Texto completo: The first plowable snowstorm for southern Maine arrived Saturday afternoon, with the National Weather Service in Gray cautioning that driving will be difficult late Saturday into Sunday morning.
An official winter storm warning was in effect from 1 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday, but NWS meteorologist Greg Cornwall correctly forecasted that snow wouldn't start falling in southern Maine until after 2 p.m. By 2:30 p.m. a light snow had begun.
Relatively heavy snow was expected with total accumulations between 4 and 7 inches in southern and western Maine. The National Weather Service cautions that driving could be "very difficult" because of low visibility and snow covered roads later tonight and into early Sunday morning. The forecast caused Concord Coach Lines to cancel some of its bus service in Maine and New Hampshire.
The Maine Turnpike reduced speeds to 45 mph Saturday afternoon. By early evening, about 2 inches were on the ground in Cape Elizabeth, 2.7 inches northwest of Hollis and just under an inch in Shapleigh.
"We are expecting snowfall to pick up through the evening and come to a head midnight and early overnight," said National Weather Service Meteorologist Maura Casey.
The approaching weather created a flurry of activity for many retailers.
Several tire stores, including Town Fair Tire in South Portland and Sullivan tire in Westbrook, were slammed with customers looking to have snow tires put on their vehicles. A VIP store worker in Westbrook said their phones were ringing off the hook and they couldn't take on any more customers Saturday. They advised drivers to schedule appointments to have snow tires put on.
At Gorham Bike and Ski, sales associate Trisha Rose said the snow was good for business. "It's been a really warm fall, so we've had a slow start. With snow in the forecast, we've seen a huge increase (in sales). We've sold a lot of cross-country skis today, a lot of ski packages. The snow makes people excited to get outside. It's good energy today."
Excitement was building at Pineland Farms in New Gloucester, too. If the storm produces 8 inches of snow, trails will open, said Matt Sabasteanski, the outdoor recreation director at Pineland.
"We do cross country skiing, snow shoeing, fat biking. We do all of it," he said Saturday. But not yet this season. "Hopefully we will be able to open some of our trails. We love to see people out and doing something in the wintertime. Nobody likes cold without a little bit of snow to recreate in."
The city of Portland was not declaring an official parking ban Saturday but did seek voluntary compliance by asking residents to park off street to allow plow crews the ability to clear streets overnight and avoid an official parking ban on Sunday evening.
The Spring Street parking garage will offer its $3 snow ban parking rate overnight (in after 5 p.m., out by 8 a.m.) to help those who do wish to park off street. Anyone who does park in snow ban lots Saturday night will need to move their cars Sunday morning so crews can get those lots cleared.
The city was asking for voluntary compliance instead of a parking ban because it's the first storm of the season and there wasn't any snow on the ground before Saturday, said Jessica Grondin, spokesperson for the city. "If enough people comply, we may not need to call an official parking ban" Sunday night.
Parking bans were announced Saturday in a number of municipalities from Sanford to Brunswick and Lewiston-Auburn.
The greatest uncertainty of the storm is along the southern coast of Maine and southern New Hampshire. Warmer temperatures moving in overnight may cause sleet or rain to mix, which means snow in those areas could be wet and heavy. Interior Maine and higher elevations should receive lighter, fluffier snow, according to the National Weather Service.
Saturday's snow is late for a typical winter season, Cornwall said. "We are behind the usual bell curve. For the season we are 8 inches below normal." A year ago there was 19 inches of snow on the ground at this time. "That's a pretty big difference."
But within a week of that storm, rain came and washed the snow away, giving much of Maine a brown Christmas.
There's a better chance for a white Christmas this year, Cornwall said. "Temperatures are supposed to be fairly cold for the remainder of the week, so a lot of the snow should be able to stick around, especially inland away from the coast."
Another system could bring flurries to the mountains and foothills Sunday night, Cornwall said. "And there's the potential for snow showers Wednesday into Thursday."
Maine has been warm so far this winter. Typically December's highs and lows are in the 20s overnight and 30s to low 40s during the day. "On Friday it got to 53 for a high, on Sunday (Dec. 12) it got to 57," Cornwall said.

Texto completo: COVID-19 cases continued to spike in Maine, as the state reported 1,080 new cases Saturday and 11 additional deaths.
The Maine death toll now numbers 1,441 since the pandemic began.
Doctors expect Maine's historic case surge to continue, and even pick up speed, with the more contagious omicron variant now in Maine. On Friday, Maine reported its first cases of omicron in five samples from Penobscot County following a genomic sequencing of positive test results reported to the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Statewide, the Maine CDC reported Saturday that 381 people are hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those patients, 115 are in critical care units, 68 are on ventilators.
One year ago, on Dec. 18, 2020, the state reported 191 people hospitalized with COVID-19, 46 in critical care and 17 on ventilators. At that time, Maine had a daily new case count of 590, about half of what the new case count has been in recent days.
Experts believe that the omicron variant may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has filled Maine hospitals and overwhelmed health care workers. But, they caution that while omicron may cause less severe symptoms in most people, it spreads more easily and will make some very ill, adding to the burden hospitals already face.
Getting a booster shot is key to protecting against the new variant, as well as social distancing and wearing masks in public, doctors say.
The arrival of omicron is unwelcome but not unexpected, Gov. Janet Mills said Friday. "We knew it was only a matter of time before we detected the presence of omicron here in Maine," she said in a press release. "The takeaway for Maine people should be this: get vaccinated now and wear a mask when you're indoors in public. Whether it's your first shot or your third shot, getting vaccinated can protect your health, keep you from getting seriously sick, and even save your life," Mills said.
Dr. Ashish Jha, an infectious disease expert with the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a series of tweets Friday that people should expect a "disruptive" January and to avoid holiday parties and other large gatherings. "We should expect a large wave of infections in January," Jha tweeted.
In addition to scheduled vaccinations at Maine pharmacies, a number of booster clinics are popping up, Maine's Dr. Shah tweeted Saturday. They include a vaccination clinic for adults and children ages 5 and up from 2-4 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 19, at the Yarmouth High School gym. Moderna, Pfizer, J & J will be available. The clinic is offered by the Yarmouth Community Coronavirus Taskforce and community pharmacies.
On Monday walk-in vaccinations will be given at a "healthy for the holidays" booster clinic at the MaineHealth office, 110 Free St., Portland, from 8:30-5. On Tuesday appointment vaccinations will be given at the same location from 8:30-5. To register, go to vaccine.mainehealth.org.
Vaccinations are also available in Sanford at the York County Vaccination Center, 1364 Main St. For more information call 207-324-1578.
On Saturday John Hopkin's COVID-19 web page reported that in the last 28 days there have been 34,397 deaths from the virus in the United States, bringing the country's death toll to more than 800,000.
That is significantly higher than the United States military members who died in both World War I and World War II. According to the Department of Defense, 521,915 service men and women died in both of those wars.

In her 'dream job,' The Telling Room's new director will help students discover their identity Kristina Powell saw herself in the role of executive director of The Telling Room before there was an opening. Now the job is hers.

Texto completo: efore she knew the job was open, Kristina M.J. Powell imagined herself as executive director of The Telling Room, the nonprofit writing and literary arts center in downtown Portland. She considered it her "dream job," and while working on her MBA from Purdue University Global this year, she created a presentation that included a plan for achieving that goal.
Two months after she studied the work of The Telling Room in her research, the position of executive director was posted. In September, Powell got the job.
"I've always admired their work so much and been drawn to the mission of organization - because of the stories that are told here, because of the voices, and also because of diversity and equity and being a woman of color," said Powell, a 2006 graduate of Bowdoin College who majored in anthropology and minored in sociology, or as she likes to say, "lots of people studies. A big piece of being a good anthropologist is creating space for people to tell their stories and listening to their stories without interjecting yourself into what they are saying, and actually listening."
Serving young writers ages 6 to 18, The Telling Room for 17 years has helped kids build confidence to tell their own stories, in many literary forms, and publishes those stories in anthologies and chapbooks for all to read. The core mission of the organization is creative empowerment of youth to help ensure success in the present and future. To break it down even more, The Telling Room helps kids find their identity.
Identity is the story of Kristina Powell's life.
"I have always been fascinated by understanding people's journeys of identity formation and how that changes, as well, and how painful and also joyful it can be," said Powell, a transracial adoptee and a single mother raising a biracial son. "Creating space for that is part of what we do here at The Telling Room, as students put pen to paper to find their voice."
Identity is complex. An American of Korean descent, Powell grew up in a diverse family in White Plains, New York. Her parents are white, she has a British grandmother, and "my aunts and cousins and spouses are either all of Asian background or they are Canadian. We are a funny international mix. ... My family and I are very close. It's been also normal to me to see that families are based on love and there are so many permutations. I was raised with that."
Powell, who lives in Falmouth with her 9-year-old son, replaces Celine Kuhn, who was director for five years. Her position at The Telling Room will allow her to pursue personal and academic interests in identity and humanity in tandem with her career-long support of educational institutions and nonprofits focused on youth and enlightenment.
She has a big personality and a hearty laugh, and much of her success has involved sharing her enthusiasm with others. Prior to joining The Telling Room, Powell directed the annual Berwick Fund at Berwick Academy. In previous jobs, she worked as development manager at the Center for Grieving Children in Portland and with alumni and parents at Bates College, and began her career with the Council on International and Educational Exchange, the country's oldest and largest nonprofit study-abroad and intercultural exchange organization, with offices in Portland.
Her interest in study-abroad programs stemmed from her experience at Bowdoin, when she spent a semester in Tibet. Bowdoin, she said, changed her life because it opened opportunities and possibilities. She has family in South Berwick and had visited southern Maine often growing up in New York. But coming to Bowdoin, Brunswick and midcoast Maine made her realize her love of Maine was ingrained in her personality, and Maine was where she wanted to grow roots and spend her life. Other than a brief stint in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she lived when she worked in South Berwick, she has spent all her time in Maine since enrolled at Bowdoin in 2002.
"A lot of other alums were thinking about where they would go after college and when they would come back to Maine," she said. "I went to career services to figure out how I could stay."
As part of her application process for her new job, Powell was asked to select a poem written by a student of The Telling Room and published in its anthology, "A New Land." She chose a poem by Jonathan Rugema called "A Different Kind of Battle." She started with 10 or so poems, and read each for friends before settling on this one to speak out loud during one of her interviews for the job. "It resonated with me," she said. "So many did, but this one stayed with me."
It's a poem about figuring out who you are and where and how you fit, with "signposts of should" that flash endlessly. Here's an excerpt:
Family
Expectation
My mind
My body
The pressure of creation
Who do I trust?
Outside voices
Inside voices
What was hard, then easy, is hard again
A different kind of hardness
A different kind of battle
Powell comes to The Telling Room at a time of renewal and looking forward for the organization. Like many arts and educational institutions, The Telling Room offered much of its programming remotely during the early days of the pandemic. It has resumed with in-person and hybrid gatherings at its Commercial Street writing center, with a goal of returning to its pre-pandemic levels of working with 3,000 students annually. In the year ahead, it plans 17 publications, including chapbooks from the afterschool programs and in-school residencies, an annual anthology, Young Emerging Authors titles and "Stepping Stones," a new youth anthology focused on writing by 6- to 11-year-olds from across Maine.
"We had multiple submissions sent via snail mail, and over 200 entries from all across Maine, from York County to Washington County, and everywhere in between," Powell said of "Stepping Stones." Publishing Workshop students will work on the anthology with the goal of a spring release.
One lesson of the pandemic, Powell said, is the disparity of access and promise of opportunity, both in remote learning in regard to technology, as well as when it comes to on-site Telling Room residencies at schools across Maine. Powell is all about opening access, and remote learning offers the chance to connect with students across Maine who cannot conveniently commute to Portland.
"What are other schools we can be in, what other communities should we be in, and what else can we do to bring students into the space in Portland? We are thinking about the possibilities. In some ways we can think about the darkness of pandemic, but technology brings so many possibilities now. We want to explore those," she said.
Rylan Hynes, communications manager at The Telling Room and a member of the search committee, said Powell's hiring resulted from a four-month search process that included input from staff members, board members, community partners, alumni and current students. "We had a great mix of voices, and we arrived at an amazing choice," Hynes said.
Board president Anya Endsley said hiring someone with Maine roots was not intentional, and the search for a new executive director was national in scope. "We had a pretty expansive executive search process, and Kristina stood out among an impressive and competitive group of candidates," she said.
Among Powell's tasks will be helping the organization write its next strategic plan, with an eye on The Telling Room's 20th anniversary in three years. While COVID-19 hit the organization hard, forcing it to reinvent itself on the fly as a remote-learning organization, it also mapped out opportunities for growth in terms of reaching new students.
"The question is, how to grow, what do we want to do with that growth and what direction do we want to take it in the future? We are very dedicated to equity and diversity work, and inclusion work, and Kristina has a strong background in that," Endsley said. "She is a dynamic leader, and I'm excited to see what she will do as executive director."
Spencer Jones, president of the Portland-based Pan Atlantic Foundation, worked with Powell at the Council on International and Educational Exchange and said her commitment to equity and creating opportunity became quickly apparent. An early project involved creating a scholarship for minority and first-generation college students to study abroad. Powell was part of a large team, supervised by Jones, working on the initiative, and took a leadership role because of her ability to sort and analyze data effectively.
"This was at a time when we were beginning to use data a lot more in the management of those programs, and she is really good at that. Kristina is really good at slinging data around and making sense of it. We ended up raising more than $3 million" in scholarships, Jones said.
Noting that The Telling Room is a writing center, Jones said he was always impressed with Powell's ability to articulate her passion for the importance of her work through her writing, which made her an effective fundraiser. She is a good communicator, which allows her to build trusting partnerships, he said.
In that vein of trust and communication and reflecting her ability to choose just the right words, Powell officiated the wedding of one of Jones's son a few years ago. "Not surprisingly, she did a good job," Jones said. "She brought the same rigor she brings to her professional life to my son's wedding."
Powell called it "the greatest joy" to work with an organization that has both a strong foundation and hopeful trajectory. "And of course," she said, "it makes me a little nervous."
She is brimming with confidence, but doesn't want to do anything to hurt the legacy of the people who have come before her in this role. With her upbringing in a supportive family and her academic background in understanding others, Powell has the tools she needs to meet those challenges and more.

Texto completo: Steve Fulton was good right away when he joined the powerful Yarmouth High boys' soccer program, starting as a freshman at outside back and then shifting to the pivotal center midfield position on a state championship team as a sophomore in 2019.
This year, as a senior, he rose to another level. Fulton was one of the best players in the state and the clear leader on another powerful team that won Yarmouth's sixth Class B title in the past seven postseasons.
"Looking back to two years ago, I was a sophomore playing with a really, really good group," Fulton said. "So a lot of my passes, I would defer to them, and if there was any trouble, I would defer to them."
With added maturity, soccer experience at the club level and more strength on a solid 6-foot-1, 185-pound frame, Fulton deferred to no one in 2021. Playing as a defensive midfielder, he still led Yarmouth in scoring (17 goals, four assists). He controlled the middle of the field, also leading Yarmouth in steals (over 80), air-ball wins (107), air-ball win ratio (107/20) and connected passes.
"Playing simple and being confident was a big significant difference," Fulton said. "The past couple years I would maybe not take a guy on and dribble past him, and that was added to my game this year. A team always needs something like that."
Yarmouth capped its 17-0-2 season with the Class B title, a 3-0 win against previously unbeaten Winslow. The Clippers were ranked second in New England and 15th nationally in United Soccer Coaches Association polls.
"Simply put, Steve Fulton is the best player on the best team in the state," said Yarmouth Coach Mike Hagerty.
And now, Fulton is the Varsity Maine 2021 boys' soccer Player of the Year. Fulton got the nod over two strong candidates, Scarborough junior and SMAA Player of the Year Zander Haskell and Trevor Wozny, a senior center midfielder for Class A champion Marshwood.
Fulton and Haskell were Maine's two All-Americans as chosen by the Maine Soccer Coaches Association.
"Steve Fulton was head and shoulders above all other players in Class B," said Cape Elizabeth Coach Ben Raymond.
In Fulton's four seasons on the varsity, including the pandemic-shortened, playoff-less 2020 season, Yarmouth compiled a 52-3-8 record, winning Class B championships in 2019 and 2021.
Fulton said winning championships is "definitely always the goal" for Yarmouth's players. He acknowledged that being part of such a strong tradition comes with expectations, but not necessarily added pressure.
"We think of it less as pressure and more an acknowledgment that we get everyone's best games and we're supposed to win and that's just a confidence boost," Fulton said.
Fulton has completed the application process to the U.S. Naval Academy and is waiting on a decision. His father, also named Steve, uncle and grandfather are Naval Academy graduates. If accepted, Fulton intends to try to make the men's soccer team as a walk-on.

Texto completo: The Maine Bird Atlas, a community-science project to determine the distribution of birds across our state, is in its fourth of five years and consists of two parts: the Maine Breeding Bird Atlas Project and the Maine Wintering Bird Atlas Project.
The fourth year of the Breeding Bird Atlas was a spectacularly successful season. We are now well situated to meet the project goals for coverage of nesting throughout the state. I'll write more on this project in the spring as we gear up for the last field season.
The fourth year of the Wintering Bird Atlas is just under way and we need your help. Here's the way this project works. The 7.5-degree topographic quadrangle maps produced by the U. S. Geological Survey provide the framework for the project. Each of these quadrangles is divided into six equal blocks, each about 3 square miles. Those blocks are the unit of focus for both atlas projects.
At a minimum, the atlas coordinators want to have a winter atlas block completed for every topographic quadrangle in the state. You can see the progress of the winter atlas in your area by visiting the map on the project's web site.
How is a block completed? The winter season is divided into two parts: an early winter period from Dec. 15 until Jan. 31, and a late winter period from Feb. 1 until March 15. To complete a block, observers have to log at least three hours of observations for both the early and late season.
You can't complete a block by observing your feeder from the comfort of your home. It is paramount that you sample all of the habitats in the block. The map referenced above indicates the progress toward completion of every block in the state. Some are complete, some have either the early or late period complete, some have little or no data.
Choose an area and go birding. You will enter your data into the Maine eBird web site.
Six hours to census 9 square miles represents only a modest effort. Completed blocks near you may well be missing fairly common birds. To see the species list of each blocks to date, click on any block in the progress map and choose Link to Species List. As an example near me, I see the Waterville NW block is complete but the species list does not include red-tailed hawk, red-breasted nuthatch, or common redpoll. I'll devote a little time this winter trying to target these birds.
Project Feeder Watch, a citizen-science project maintained by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and Birds Canada, provides a way for you to contribute important data without venturing out into the cold Maine winter. You can find their website at: feederwatch.org.
Project Feeder Watch runs from the second Saturday in November until April 30. Its web site has clear instructions on how to participate. You enter your feeder data directly onto the site and can view summaries of the data. Project Feeder Watch watchers can report behaviors of their feeder birds in addition to their abundance. Since 2016, Project Feeder Watch observers have reported over 100,000 aggressive interactions at feeders. Who are the bullies and who are the wimps?
It turns out that a fairly strict hierarchy of aggressiveness exists. Blue jays spring to mind when you think about dominant birds at feeders. For eastern birds, they do rank highly but, in increasing order of feistiness, defer to European starlings, red-bellied woodpeckers, common grackles and, at the top, American crows.
Close behind blue jays, the hierarchy has American robin, red-winged blackbird, hairy woodpecker and mourning dove. In increasing wimpiness, we find northern cardinal, downy woodpecker, white-breasted nuthatch, tufted titmouse and house finch. The meekest species at our feeders are red-breasted nuthatch, purple finch, American goldfinch and the least aggressive of all, our state bird, the black-capped chickadee.
The power of citizen science!

Texto completo: Sometimes a short walk is all you want or need, perhaps an hour or so and maybe a mile, more or less, in the great outdoors.
It's just enough time and distance to get the legs moving and the heart pumping, a little sun on your face and some fresh air in the lungs. And hopefully there's an open ledge or a craggy summit along the way for nice vista and a chance to hang out for a spell. The AMC Maine Mountain Guide has plenty of little mountain hikes to choose from that meet just these criteria.
Here are a handful of good ones to consider this winter. Enjoy!
French Mountain, Rome
The 7 Lakes Alliance maintains seven trail systems in the 6,000-acre Kennebec Highlands, the largest contiguous block of conservation land in central Maine. For a good look around the high ground of the Belgrade Lakes region, hike the 0.9-mile loop on French Mountain (716 feet), which rewards with excellent viewpoints from atop its eastern ledges. Whittier Pond, Mount Phillip, Long Pond and Great Pond are a few of the sights you'll see. Check out all that 7 Lakes Alliance has to offer for trail walks at 7lakesalliance.org.
Klondike Mountain, Lubec
For just a 150-foot highpoint, diminutive Klondike Mountain packs a big punch when it comes to views. The mountain is the centerpiece of the 46-acre Klondike Mountain Preserve, which is owned and managed by the Downeast Coastal Conservancy. The Klondike Mountain Trail, a 0.6-mile loop, leads through old cow pastures and apple orchards to the summit outcrops, where there's a lovely look out over South Bay and Fowler's Mill Pond. Find DCC's complete Trail Map & Guide at downeastcoastalconservancy.org.
Flying Mountain, Acadia National Park
Head for the west side of Mount Desert Island to visit Flying Mountain (284 feet), where a 1.4-mile loop leads to wonderful views of Somes Sound, Southwest Harbor and the islands to the south. Hike the circuit counterclockwise, taking the Valley Cove Fire Road to the namesake cove for a look at Eagle Cliff - at 500 feet, it's the island's highest - and to Acadia Mountain north along the sound. Scamper up the peak to several lookouts on the summit ridge, the best being the signed "overlook" that's reached by a short side trail. Find park info at nps.gov/acad.
Mount Battie, Camden
From the trailhead on Megunticook Street in Camden, the Mount Battie Trail climbs steeply up the rocky nose of Mount Battie for 0.6 miles to open ledges on the south side of the 790-foot peak. On top is an attractive 26-foot stone observation tower, a World War I memorial constructed a year after the old hotel on the same site was torn down in 1920. From Mount Megunticook to Camden Harbor and Penobscot Bay to Ragged Mountain, the panorama from this special spot is simply astounding. Get a trail map for Camden Hills State Park at parksandlands.com.
Ring Hill, Greenwood
Mahoosuc Land Trust maintains a sweet system of color-coded trails on Ring Hill in Greenwood at Maggie's Nature Park, 86 acres of land donated to the town by Maggie Ring, a lifelong resident and ardent conservationist. Ring Hill Loop Trail (1.1 miles) is the primary route on the mountainside, which features good views northeasterly over South Pond to Bucks Ledge, Latham Ledge, Moody Mountain and North Pond. Tack on a short side trip to nearby Peaked Mountain for a little extra effort. Check out this and other MLT trails at mahoosuc.org.
Mount Agamenticus, York
For big views with minimal effort, take a drive to the top of Mount Agamenticus in York (the Summit Access Road is open year-round, weather permitting), then meander around the summit area on the Big A Trail, a mile-long universally accessible nature path. En route you'll enjoy many fine vistas, from the Gulf of Maine to Second Hill and Third Hill to Mount Washington. There are also the ski runs, lift towers, old equipment and the ski lodge (now the Learning Lodge; it's closed until spring) from the former Big A Ski Area, plus the 1941 fire tower to check out. Visit agamenticus.org for a trail map.

Fidgety official is caught in the act

Texto completo: If you're in a room (or on a Zoom) with me for longer than 10 minutes, you'll notice that I fidget with my hair.
It's a nervous tic, or a bad habit, or a "stim." I've done it for a long time. I used to pull it out, strand by strand, until one day in sixth grade my mom noticed I had two bald spots on my head and I had to go to Supercuts and cut all of it very short for a year until I was broken of the pulling habit. (I don't pull at it anymore, thank goodness. Vanity kicks in.)
I'm not exactly sure why I do it. I've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and, like most addicts, I have a tendency towards obsessive-compulsive behavior, so I suspect it comes out of that psychological knot. I asked a psychiatrist once why I did it, and he said it was probably a way of grounding myself - a way to subconsciously remind myself that I was here, in my body, in this moment, and not out there, with my brain zinging through the universe. It's certainly a self-soothing technique; a way to calm myself, redirect my nervous energy, and focus. And it's a quiet habit, at least: I could have gone with finger-tapping, or pen-clicking, or gum-chewing for the same effect.
Something you might not have known about me is that I am technically an elected official. I'm a member of the Planning Board of the town of Buxton. In a nutshell, a planning board looks at the plans for proposed projects and construction in town and makes sure they follow the town's rules, as laid out in the zoning ordinance: Is the proposal an acceptable use under the zoning law for that particular property, are they following the fire-safety rules, etc. I don't talk about it much publicly because I take my responsibilities seriously. I don't want anyone to read my columns and think they aren't getting a fair hearing before the Planning Board.
I did figure at some point a town resident would complain about me. After all, I have a big mouth and weekly column space in Maine's largest newspaper. But it managed to take me by surprise when a town resident walked into Town Hall last week and submitted a complaint that she gets irritated when watching the meetings of the Planning Board, which are uploaded to the internet and stream on Saco River TV, the local community access station, because one of the board members is "constantly playing with their hair" and she wanted the board "to address this unprofessional behavior."
First, I was surprised that anyone even watches those meetings. It's not exactly the most exciting part of democracy. Second, I have to admire the gumption it takes to file an official memo complaining about something so ephemeral that does not affect anyone's life in any way, shape or form. I agree it can be annoying to look at, but there are always other board members on screen with me, and if you redirect your eyes a few inches to the left, the problem is solved. If the intent of this complaint was to make me feel bad about myself, it did work, for about 30 seconds. I don't like making people upset, especially when they are clearly someone with a civic investment. If the intent of the complaint was to make me feel bad about myself, it did work for a few minutes. I'm aware that my behavior is abnormal. I don't need it pointed out to me.
What got me thinking was the complaint about its being "unprofessional." If I were a chef or a surgeon, it would make sense that I shouldn't fiddle with my hair while I was working. But it's a Planning Board meeting. What does it matter?
I've noticed that there's a massive, bright-line generational difference when it comes to arbitrary ideals of professionalism. Younger generations (millennials, Gens X and Z) tend to question and push by on rules and regulations and social norms around what is and isn't "professional" that were placed there, in large part, by older generations (boomers, Silent and Greatest Generations). Tattoos, for example. There's this idea that tattoos aren't "professional" and that you should cover them at work, particularly if you are in a white-collar profession.
I once heard a guy refer to hand tattoos - one of the hardest areas to cover, unless, ironically, you're a surgeon! - as "job-killers." But - why? As long as the tattoos aren't obscene or violent, what's wrong with them being visible in the workplace? In what way do they affect my ability to perform my job?
Same with brightly colored hair. If I dye my hair blue, it's not going to suddenly take away my ability to navigate the medical records software. Younger folks tend to pay more attention to job performance, rather than job appearance. Jeans instead of khakis? Well, are they clean? Can you still stock the shelves in them? Then sure, why not wear them?
Does fiddling with my hair incapacitate my knowledge of the town of Buxton's zoning laws? Who's to say?

Doe-to-buck ratio a moving target for Maine's deer herd A big deer harvest this season is only one factor in what will have an impact on the herd's doe population in Maine.

Texto completo: This year's deer harvest is likely to set records, at least for recent years. The biggest contributing factor was the number of any-deer permits handed out by Maine, which was welcomed by many hunters. Some merely wanted a better chance for success while others have long complained about too many does or a buck-to-doe ratio that is way out of whack. Is it possible to have too many does? Can the ratio get so skewed it's detrimental to the herd or to hunting? Let's take a look.
Determining how many deer is too many may not be as simple as it seems. Biologists use the term carrying capacity - how many individuals of a particular species can be supported in a specific area without harm to the habitat or the animals. In the absence of humans, most areas can support far more deer than you might think. With a higher population, die-offs will be larger in more severe winters, but a certain proportion of the herd would die off anyway so you're left with roughly the same number of deer whether the pre-winter herd was large or small.
It is humans that prompt wildlife managers to try to maintain deer herds at some level below biological carrying capacity. First, there's hunting. Biologists have determined that holding the herd at somewhere around 70% of biological carrying capacity produces optimum sustained yield, the right balance between herd recruitment and hunter satisfaction. Then there's negative interactions like car-deer collisions, property and crop depredation and an increase in Lyme disease. Where those are prevalent, wildlife managers set their population objectives at an even lower level, sometimes referred to as social or cultural carrying capacity. That's often somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% or less of biological carrying capacity - half as many deer as the habitat can support. That's the objective in many parts of southern and central Maine yet some hunters still complain there are too many does.
To an extent, the more females the better, as they represent the reproductive potential of the herd. You also want more does than bucks because deer are polygamous and one buck can breed multiple does. It then becomes a matter of balancing the sex ratio. If there are too many does, the bucks may run themselves ragged trying to chase them down during the rut, and some does may no get bred; or so say the detractors.
The skewed sex ratios hunters observe may not be as bad as they think. There are more of them, but antlerless deer also tend to be more viewable than adult bucks. Furthermore, hunters typically consider all the antlerless deer they see to be adult does when in fact, at least half are probably fawns, and half of those are buck fawns. They complain about 10-1 or even 15-1 ratios of does to bucks, but that simply can't happen in a managed herd.
According to Kip Adams, chief conservation officer for the National Deer Association, the biological maximum is roughly a 5-1 ratio, even in the absence of a doe harvest because a certain number will perish anyway. Adams gives the hypothetical example of a population of 120 adult deer, with an unnaturally skewed ratio of 100 does and 20 bucks (5-1). Hunters kill 90 percent (18) of the bucks and none of the does, leaving 100 does and two bucks, after the season.
Next comes natural mortality. With fewer bucks in the population, fewer will die; we'll say 50 percent, leaving one buck. At least 10% of the does will die, leaving 90 does and one buck. That seems pretty skewed, but we haven't yet considered fawns and recruitment.
Average fawn recruitment is about 0.83 fawns per adult doe, with roughly a 50-50 sex ratio. In our example, that gives us 75 more deer: 38 bucks and 37 does. Assuming the same ratio for the previous year, our pre-hunt population now has 127 does and 39 bucks for a 3-1 ratio.
Add any hunting mortality on does and that ratio gets shifted even more in favor of hunters that are seeking bucks.
Time will tell whether this year's generous prescription of any-deer permits will address perceived problems. The heavy hit does took will certainly impact reproduction and recruitment. Meanwhile, hunters exacted a heavy toll on bucks as well. Deer are resilient creatures and the herd will recover in time, but hunters should expect to see fewer deer around next fall and for those who championed thinning the doe numbers it may be a case of, "Be careful what you wish for."

Texto completo: for loon lovers
"Loon Lessons"? As good a title might have been, "Everything you always wanted to know about loons but were afraid to ask." (And yes, some of those "uncommon encounters" can be shocking.) It would be pretty hard to find a question about Gavia Immer, also known as the Great Northern Diver in Britain, that "Loon Lessons" doesn't try to answer.
James D. Paruk has been studying loons ever since he volunteered to help a researcher friend catch (and release) them in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, over 30 years ago. That "college buddy" was Dave Evers, whose intensive studies into loons led him to found the Biodiversity Research Institute, now based in Portland. (I have reviewed several of Evers' books in these pages.) Paruk is now a professor of biology at St. Joseph's College as well as an adjunct senior research scientist at BRI. His professorial background accounts for both the strongest and weakest parts of the book.
At the beginning, the book delves into to the common loon's evolution from its earliest ancestors. The next chapters are devoted to the species' physiological adaptation to (and by) its natural surroundings, how it swims and dives, how it courts, how it rears its chicks. As the author points out, most people get their introduction to (and are bewitched by) the loon via its famous vocalizations: the chapter "Wails, Yodels, and Tremolos" gets to the heart - or syrinx (voice box) - of the matter. Other fascinating topics include behavior, migration, threats and conservation efforts.
"Loon Lessons" reflects the author's twin passions, research and education. Each chapter begins with an account from the field that raises the topic that will be examined in more depth in the pages ahead. Paruk has "captured and handled" over 200 loons and spent more than 5,000 hours studying their behavior (many of those hours under trying conditions given the bird's predilection for cold, damp and mosquito-ridden haunts). In these stories, he regales the reader with interesting events, avian dramas (sometimes surprisingly violent), little personal epiphanies and reminiscences.
And then there is the story of the eternal triangle. Paruk and Evers observe a male loon returning to his natal lake with a new female. (They know this because she does not have colored bands on her leg.) The pair are busy setting up their nest when the former mate arrives on the lake. (They know this because she does have colored bands on her leg.) She does everything she can to split the pair up and rekindle the bond with her old mate.
After these tales come the scientific explanations and theories. "At my core, I am a teacher and a science educator," writes Paruk, and he views his subject through the lenses of natural selection and behavioral ecology. In a pair of deft phrases, he calls natural selection "the parsimonious reaper of extravagance" and behavioral patterns "an optimizing agent in disguise."
These sections of the book are packed with fascinating - and certainly to me - new scientific information. Why do loons have white bellies, red eyes, narrow hips? And why are loons so different from cormorants?
But for the average reader, the writing can be tough going. Where his notes from the field are concise and often action-oriented, Paruk's pedagogic style tends to be awkward and confusing. The inherent chicken-and-egg element in natural selection, for example, makes clarity in discussion of it all the more important. Too often, I found the thread of his argument cumbersome and hard to follow. Contextual information sometimes amounts to overkill, with background assumptions repeated almost to the point of tautology.
I suspect these flaws may be due to Paruk's trying to adapt lecture notes to the book format. I can imagine him giving a marvelous, animated lecture to his students, dashing up to the blackboard to underline this or that point. The lessons in "Loon Lessons" certainly read like that. And as such they are terrific. In turning them into a book, however, a stronger editor's hand could have helped streamline the text and make it more comprehensible. It might also have caught occasional slip-ups, such as writing descendant instead of forebear, or razorback instead of razorbill.
However, this criticism should not deter anyone who is interested in loons. "Loon Lessons" is an elegantly produced book, and for loon lovers it is a must-have. In the end, Paruk is quite optimistic about the common loon's future. Besides adding to our knowledge about these ancient birds, "Loon Lessons" explains why. "People love their loons," he concludes, "and will go to great lengths to make sure they grace our lakes each year."

Texto completo: Our state climate strategy is called "Maine Won't Wait" for a reason. When it comes to climate change, patience is no virtue.
We need to stop burning fossil fuels as soon as possible if we are going to put off even worse catastrophes than the heat waves, severe storms and forest fires we saw in 2021. We need everyone to be working toward the same goal, and it's frustrating to see how hard that can be.
One example is the experience of Maine people who signed up to buy their electricity from a community solar farm last year but are still waiting for service.
Community solar promises to be a game changer for Maine households, who pay some of the highest electric rates in the country.
Not everyone can put solar panels on their roof, but anyone who pays an electric bill can subscribe to a remote solar farm that supplies power to the grid. Subscribers get a discount on their electric bill, typically 10 percent to 15 percent in Maine, while reducing demand for fossil fuel generated power.
The arrangement makes so much sense that it's hard to believe that it was not legal in Maine until 2019. Once Gov. Mills came into office and signed the law that permitted community solar projects, thousands of people signed up with developers, who would start putting a credit on their electric bills as soon as the panels were up and connected to the grid.
Many of those customers are still waiting.
The new generators ran into the old grid, which was built based on 20-year-old assumptions about how power would be generated and distributed. Solar farms are intermittent power producers, and if too many are connected to the same substation, they could create imbalances that make the system unstable.
Before these projects can go online, ISO New England, the region's grid operator, is requiring so-called cluster studies to determine whether the grid can handle the new power sources. At best, these studies will delay discounts for customers at a time when the price of electricity is climbing. At worst, they will find that the solar power won't come online at all because they would require expensive grid upgrades that would make the projects untenable.
The community solar delay is similar to a problem that presented itself itself earlier this year when approved grid-scale solar projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars were put on hold by Central Maine Power, because the company said it could put more power on the grid than it could handle. CMP is currently under investigation by the Maine Public Utilities Commission over its position on grid upgrades, and it is negotiating with the solar industry to settle the dispute.
What's happening with community solar opens a small window on a very big problem. To phase out fossil fuels in time, we need the state and federal governments - along with utilities, regulators, power producers and consumers - to work together. At times, it seems that they are barely talking to each other.
The transition to renewables is only half of the climate equation. The other half is using electricity for things now powered by other fuels, such as oil furnaces and gas-powered cars. That's going to require a lot more electricity than is currently produced and a level of coordination by all the players that's been missing.
We don't have time to watch promising projects stall and fail because we lacked the foresight to make sure that the necessary infrastructure exists. If the financial incentives aren't driving the utilities in the right direction, regulators and lawmakers should make them do it. Maine can't wait any longer.

Texto completo: We're fast approaching the longest night of the year, and David Sloan's "What Looms" breathes the air of that darkness. This is an ekphrastic or art-inspired poem, written in reaction to a particularly chilly room painted by Andrew Wyeth. I love how this poem hovers over the room's objects as it considers our mortal limits, as it poses unanswerable questions to the dark.
A graduate of the University of Southern Maine's Stonecoast MFA Poetry Program, Sloan has two poetry collections, "The Irresistible In-Between" and "A Rising and Other Poems" (both from Deerbrook Editions). After teaching for nearly 50 years, most recently at Maine Coast Waldorf High School in Freeport, he is now semi-retired, content to focus on the joys of grand-parenting, gardening, cycling and more regular writing.
Poets, please note that submissions to Deep Water are open through the end of the year. Deep Water is especially eager to share poems by Black writers, writers of color, Indigenous writers, and other underrepresented voices. You'll find a link to submit in the credits below.
What Looms
By David Sloan
after the painting "Maine Room," by Andrew Wyeth
The room hums with emptiness:
unadorned walls, bare floorboards,
the fireplace's dark mouth, tongueless.
Crosshatched shadows like scarred
light streak a stained mattress.
How cold must a room be for a bed
to be pushed so close to the hearth?
No sheets or pillow; someone's head
must have rested on that towel. Earth
can be a hard place to live. Barricade
a body against what looms. On the mantel,
helmet or urn? It hardly matters. One protects
in vain; the other holds a candle's snuffed
remains. Above the bed, shorebirds, sun-lit,
languid, will soon wing into the diagonal.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- If workers get sick with COVID-19 and are unable to come into work, most state and many municipal and private-sector workers get paid COVID-19 sick time so they don't have to use their regular sick time or vacation time for their time out of work.
But some hospital workers in Maine are raising alarms that they are not getting such benefits even though they're on the frontlines of the pandemic.
Laura Gosselin, a nurse at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta, said she loves a lot of things about the job she has worked for 31 years. But she feels it is a slap in the face of nurses and others who risk their own health to tend to patients when staff have to use their hard-earned regular time off if they become infected with COVID-19 and miss work.
Especially when it seems, to her, that others in nonmedical fields do get COVID-19 sick time.
"My husband and several friends work for the state of Maine and get paid from a COVID fund, thus not having to use their own personal sick time," Gosselin said, adding that her brother works for the city of Augusta, and her son-in-law works for a farm supply company, and both get COVID-19 pay if they are out sick with the virus. "I find it appalling that nurses have been at the frontlines of this pandemic and we are treated this way when we, ourselves, become sick. I hear this every single day from co-workers. It is not right. We deserve better. Our government and employer has let us down."
MaineGeneral officials said they appreciate and greatly respect the work of their nurses and other employees, especially through the pandemic, but say their earned time-off benefits are generous and that is how employees are compensated if they are out of work with COVID-19, or any other illness.
"Senior leadership and the board have sought to recognize and honor this level of performance and continues to seek ways to support staff," said Joy McKenna, spokesperson for MaineGeneral. "The pandemic requires that MaineGeneral and all health care employers to carefully balance these objectives with that of ensuring that we maintain access to the best quality health care services to our patients and families."
However, at least one major health care provider in the state, MaineHealth, which includes Maine Medical Center in Portland and seven other Maine hospitals, does provide dedicated COVID-19 sick time to employees who contract the virus, according to John Porter, a spokesman for MaineHealth.
Porter said if workers there miss work due to contracting COVID-19, they are paid for that time away from work, and it does not cost them anything from their paid time-off bank, which includes both sick and vacation time.
"We do it because that's what is best for our patients in the communities; we do it because we're in the middle of a pandemic, and we want people to know, if they get COVID, we don't want them in the workplace," he said. "If you've got active COVID, and you're out, you're getting paid time off. And it doesn't count against your paid time-off bank."
Northern Light Health, which operates Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville and Mercy in Portland, offers several benefits to employees who are sick with COVID-19, according to spokesman Andrew Soucier.
"The specific benefits that employees can access when they are ill vary by situation," Soucier said. "Employees who contract COVID-19 through community exposure have access to paid time off, and Northern Light Health provides up to 80 hours of additional time to employees who exhaust their existing paid time off while recovering. Employees also have access to company-funded short-term disability. For work-related illness, workers compensation benefits apply."
The federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act in 2020 required some private employers and state and local governments to provide workers with up to 80 hours of time off if they contracted COVID-19.
In 2021 the state, according to a Department of Administrative and Financial Services document, offered most state employees "COVIDcare" administrative leave, modeled on the federal FFCRA program, through which they could use up to 80 hours of paid COVID leave over the course of the year, if they missed work because of the virus.
But the federal and state programs provide exemptions for health care providers and emergency responders, whose employers are not required to offer any additional sick time off due to the pandemic, one of several exemptions to the act.
McKenna, the spokesperson at MaineGeneral, said if an employee gets sick with COVID-19, or any other illness, they are compensated through their earned time-off bank. Earned time-off includes both sick and vacation time, and employees accumulate days based on their time with the company and how many hours they work. A full-time employee with between five and 15 years of service would earn 31 days off in a typical year. And employees can carry those hours over into the next year, if they wish, up to 240 hours.
Gosselin said she contracted COVID-19, which she is sure she got at work, from another employee. She was out of work from the Sunday after Thanksgiving for 10 days, following Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention protocol and hospital policy guidelines. That caused her to miss four 10-hour shifts she otherwise would have worked at the Augusta hospital. To keep money coming in during that time, she used some of her earned time-off.
She said she complied with orders at the hospital to get the vaccine, but still got the virus anyway. She said she also then inadvertently gave it to several of her family members.

Texto completo: Maine has emerged as a national hot spot for COVID-19 infections as New England - long the safest part of the country - has been hammered by the delta variant of the disease.
Delta has pushed the state's health system to its limits even as a new wave of infections is expected in the coming weeks from the faster-spreading omicron variant, which was officially detected in Maine for the first time on Friday.
Maine had the country's fourth-highest number of new cases per capita over the past week - a daily average of 78 per 100,000 people - a rate more than double the national average. The state also had the second-fastest rate of change - an increase of 148 percent over 14 days - after Connecticut, according to a national tracking database of statistics from state and local health agencies maintained by The New York Times.
The daunting trends are largely driven by an explosion in cases across western and northern Maine. On Friday, Aroostook County had the third-highest per capita new caseload of all 3,240 counties and county equivalents in the United States and U.S. territories at a staggering 149 daily infections per 100,000 people. Piscataquis County was ranked 15 and Penobscot, Franklin and Androscoggin were all in the top 50.
If Aroostook County were a country it would have had the third-highest rate on the planet Friday, according to the Times' tracker.
The surge in cases comes on top of three months of unrelenting growth as the more contagious delta variant spread over Maine, pushing hospitalization levels for the disease to double the numbers seen during the worst pre-vaccination surge a year ago. Last week, the state's largest hospital, Maine Medical Center, had its worst burden of the entire pandemic, while most other hospitals coped with numbers higher than anything seen before delta - and now omicron - arrived on the scene.
Gov. Janet Mills deployed 38 members of the National Guard to 10 hospitals and long-term care facilities Monday to relieve stress on the medical system. The federal government also sent 15 medical professionals to Maine Med for the same purpose Dec. 11.
"It's alarming," Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah said of the state's diminishing hospital capacity, which he said was aptly illustrated by a political cartoon he recently saw of a hospital patient in a bed in the middle of a swimming pool, being kept afloat by a struggling nurse. "Providers are literally keeping patients afloat, but at great cost to themselves."
"It is not out of the realm of possibility that we will approach a time where ICU beds will not be available," Shah warned. "Not just for COVID patients but for any patient. We have plans to avoid that and to deal with a two-hit situation like a big pileup on the highway but, oh boy."
Dr. Laura Blaisdell, a pediatrician and vaccine policy expert, said that when the pandemic began, Maine had a game plan: Use social distancing and masks to keep hospitalizations and deaths low until a vaccine was created and widely distributed.
"We in Maine won that first half of the game," she said. "But I'm afraid we're losing the second half and it's the unvaccinated who are throwing our game."
an irony in maine's actions
It's not entirely clear why Maine and other New England states have been hit so hard in recent weeks, but it follows a seasonal pattern seen last year before vaccines and the more contagious variants arrived in the U.S. In both 2020 and 2021, the pandemic struck southern and western interior states hard in the summer, then turned its wrath on New England and the upper Midwest.
"With colder temperatures, especially in the Northeast and upper Midwest, there's a lot more indoor gatherings," said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a health policy researcher at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "In the South, in the hotter temperatures, they tend to be more indoors with air conditioning, so that is definitely a factor."
The early success of states like Maine and Vermont - which led the nation in vaccinations and in keeping the original version of the novel coronavirus in check - ironically may be contributing to the rapid spread of the new variants in both states now.
Maine has the oldest population in the country and got more people vaccinated back in the spring of 2020 than most states, meaning the efficacy of the vaccines has started to wane in people who have not received a third shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Fewer people got sick in the early waves, so there is less non-vaccine "immunity" in rural pockets of Maine than in places like South Dakota or Georgia that had massive outbreaks in the first year of the crisis.
"Maine did so well that we just don't have a lot of natural immunity said Dr. Evangeline Thibodeau, an infectious disease expert at York Hospital in York. "If we have areas that haven't had COVID before and where few people are vaccinated, that's a recipe for delta to take hold and spread rapidly."
regional, political divide
What is clear is that COVID-19 is thriving in places with low vaccination rates and leaving places with high vaccination rates relatively unscathed.
The geographic disparities in Maine are stark. In Cumberland County on Friday, 81 percent of all residents were fully vaccinated and the densely populated county had the lowest new case loads in the state. In hard-hit Franklin, Piscataquis, Aroostook and Somerset counties, the vaccination rate is just 57 percent to 63 percent, according to the Maine CDC.
In Cumberland County, 26 percent of all 5- to 11-year-olds have been fully vaccinated. In Franklin that figure is 15 percent, in Aroostook 14, and in Somerset just 8.6.
"This is really the story of the two Maines," says former Maine CDC Director Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at Maine Med's parent entity, MaineHealth, who is originally from Farmington in hard-hit Franklin County and visits the area regularly. "If you go to Whole Foods in Portland, everyone is masked and if you go to Hannaford in Farmington almost nobody is, except the employees."
The cleavages on vaccines and new cases mirror the state's historic divides between the "rim counties" that border on Canada and the rest of the coast and Kennebec and Androscoggin Valley towns.
The Maine CDC's latest ZIP-code level data on vaccination rates - dated through Dec. 13 - shows relatively high vaccination rates in every town bordering on the ocean (save Kittery and Machias). Low vaccination communities - those with a population-wide rate under 75 percent - are clustered in the interior from Eliot and the Berwicks in York County to Presque Isle and Fort Kent in the far north.
The geographic disparities in vaccination rates don't neatly correspond to rural versus urban. Portland's rate is a healthy 83 percent of all residents, but Bangor's is only 71, and Lewiston's just 66. Some rural towns have very high rates like Whiting in far eastern Maine (91 percent) or Eagle Lake in the far north (92), according to the Maine CDC. But rates are low in the places where most residents of Franklin, Somerset, Oxford, Piscataquis, Penobscot and Androscoggin counties live.
Shah said he is concerned that the decision to get vaccinated is becoming driven by political-cultural identities, putting tens of thousands of Mainers and millions of Americans at unnecessary risk.
"I think it has gone beyond a simple scientific belief and is now becoming part of someone's identity," he said. "You see very readily people on social media proud of where they have been boosted or vaccinated or proud of not being vaccinated at all. This has a huge implication from a messaging and convincing standpoint because we are essentially asking a large swath of the population to change their identity on this."
Mills said that for this reason the messengers bearing public health and vaccination facts are extremely important.
"We very strongly need people from conservative circles - religious, faith and business - to really stand up and promote vaccination," she said. "We desperately need them to do this to save our health care system and to save lives. I am very worried about the coming weeks."
care centers overburdened
The stress of the building surge is already hitting hospitals hard.
In the early months of the pandemic, public health authorities were prepared to open field hospitals at the arenas in Portland and Bangor. In a sense, Maine has again reached the point where those would have kicked in.
Shah said last week's National Guard deployment was in effect facilitating the creation of new crisis hospital capacity to relieve stress on the state's large medical centers. But instead of field hospitals, the idea is to create surge capacity within existing medical facilities.
With the Guard's help, the 10-hospital MaineHealth network is setting up new capacity at the St. Joseph's Manor rehabilitation center in Portland in order to open up space at MaineMed. Eastern Maine Medical Center is relying on a facility in Waterville.
"That's structurally the same model, but smaller and with a city-by-city approach rather than having a giant tent hospital in Bangor," Shah said. "It's effectively an alternate care site, but smaller and more replaceable."
With the holidays coming and even more contagious omicron variant presumed to be circulating in the state, experts expect the situation to get worse before it gets better. And previous assumptions that masks and social distancing could be dropped as vaccination rates exceeded 70 or 80 percent are now outdated, given the new variant's ability to spread faster and challenge vaccine defenses.
"We know what we need to do - nothing has changed in mitigation strategies," Thibodeau said. "Stay home if you're sick. Practice social distancing. Get vaccinated and get boosted."
Blaisdell agreed. "I think we know how to do masking, distancing and testing - all these things work, but I'm really looking forward to life getting back to normal," she said. "And the way we get back to living a normal life during the pandemic is through high vaccination rates."

Texto completo: The proposed referendum to create a consumer owned electric utility is a bad deal for Maine consumers.
There is nothing "wrong" about the public power model. There are well-run and not-so-well-run publicly owned utilities. And the investor-owned utility model certainly has its defects, namely that capital investments carry a rate of return that may stimulate over investment for the potential profits earned by shareholders.
The creation of our public utility regulatory model is intended to prevent the potential defects of the for-profit model by creating a comprehensive oversight system to ensure that rates are "just and reasonable." Neither system is perfect, and both depend on political good will and close regulatory scrutiny to ensure benefits for ratepayers.
However, the proposal to "take" the private property owned and operated by Versant Power and Central Maine Power has no precedent because of the scope and scale of what is contemplated. No state has approved the public takeover of private property and associated employees and infrastructure equal to a distribution system that serves almost 690,000 customers and encompasses 11,000 square miles (CMP) and 10,400 square miles (Versant). The risks to ratepayers with the estimated costs and benefits circulated by the proponents of this scheme far outweigh the promised benefits.
Here are the reasons to oppose this proposal:
n
The state will spend years and millions to litigate the constitutionality of the taking of private property and the determination of the valuation of the poles, wires, substations, billing system, call center, reliability operations, and all equipment owned by these utilities for maintenance of the system.
n
The billions in acquisition costs, once determined, will be paid by ratepayers through a revenue bond over a period of years. There is no free lunch.
n
Rates will go up once the bond is included in rates. This cost will be in addition to the normal costs that are included in your distribution service rates.
n
Rates will also go up to meet the promises for increased customer service, reliability of service, and the grid investments advocates claim are needed but not yet included in our rates to ensure more renewable resources to fight climate change. Those promised investments will increase rates since they will seek to add more debt and operational obligations to the current system.
Neither CMP nor Versant own any generation. They only operate the distribution system. The challenge to eliminate carbon emissions from our generation system is one that is going to require regional solutions since the grid is operated as a regional system.
The notion that this publicly owned utility will somehow be able to achieve more or cheaper distributed generation rooftop and community solar and offshore wind power that is years away from competitive pricing a fantasy.
The new utility will have to hire a private management company to operate the system. The cost of this contract is unknown (and would certainly include incentives and profits to the management company) and the notion that there are qualified entities "out there" who could take over this job and operate a huge statewide distribution system is questionable. For example, Long Island Public Power had to hire a public utility affiliate (PSE&G) to run their public power system after a disastrous attempt at self-governance.
The promise that ratepayers will see savings is based entirely on the assumption that the newly formed utility will eliminate the "return" included in our current rates. Anyone can calculate scenarios of potential savings in the long run but there is no promise of savings or lower rates in this bill. Everyone acknowledges that rates will increase in the short run. Ratepayers will bear this risk, not the proponents of this legislation.
The legislation establishes a politically elected Board. The potential candidates will likely include those with a special interest in ensuring investments to fit their agenda and will not necessarily have a public interest motivation.
Maine needs to focus on the tasks before us and not spend millions debating a proposal that will divert our attention from needed investments in reliability of service, ensuring affordable electricity for vulnerable households, and upgrading the grid to handle renewable energy investments.
We can achieve all these goals without taking private property and setting in motion years of litigation and delay.

Housing fix would erode local control

Texto completo: During this forthcoming shortened legislative session, which is supposed to be focused on emergency legislation and the state budget, the Legislature is likely to engage in an extended debate over a complex policy area that defies easy solutions and typical partisan disagreements, just as they did last session.
During the last session, that issue was energy policy, as the Legislature grappled with the Central Maine Power corridor. On that issue, many (though not all) Republican legislators aligned themselves with the Democratic governor, Janet Mills, in support of the corridor, while many (though not all) Democratic legislators aligned against it, despite her support. That issue hasn't entirely gone away, but this session the focus is likely to be on a different controversial area: housing policy.
There's no doubt that housing affordability is a serious problem, especially in certain parts of the state. To begin to address the issue, the Legislature created a commission last session to study the effect of local zoning laws on housing affordability. Now, to be sure, this is often a sign not that the Legislature is taking an issue especially seriously, but that they're trying to avoid doing so: Every session bills get turned into study commissions whose reports are then studiously ignored for years. This approach lets legislators pretend to have accomplished something but is usually nothing more than a complete waste of time and money.
There's reason to believe, however, that this study commission may actually result in something substantive. For one, it was truly bipartisan, with legislators from both parties fully participating. Several of those legislators were members of leadership as well, including House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, and Assistant Senate Republican Leader Matt Pouliot of Augusta.
Based on the preliminary report, though, it doesn't seem as if the commission found an easy solution to Maine's housing problem. Instead, the majority appears poised to release a proposal that would - among other ideas - curtail local authority, limiting the ability of towns to block developments.
They'd do this by stopping towns from imposing caps on housing developments and creating a statewide appeals board that could overrule towns on these issues. If that seems like a sticking point, you're probably right: The Maine Municipal Association, which had a representative on the commission, made it clear that it was against any proposals that would curtail local control. While it's understandable that housing advocates are frustrated by the not-in-my-backyarders who seemingly share their concerns yet don't want projects developed near them, curtailing Maine democracy to get their way is not a good solution. Limiting local control and creating a new statewide agency to thwart it are divisive, big-government approaches that set a terrible precedent.
The concept of a statewide appeals board is a dangerous one. Even if this iteration of such a body is limited to appealing denials of affordable housing projects, it's easy to see the Legislature expanding its authority in the future to hear appeals of other local decisions on various projects - even ones that aren't related to housing at all. In general, the power of municipalities shouldn't be usurped by the state: local government, and the citizens they represent, are the best ones to decide what's a good fit in their community. Rather than using the power of state government to run roughshod over local opinion, developers should have to make their case to the local citizenry.
Moreover, while we don't yet know exactly how such a board might be filled, these sorts of entities are more often appointed rather than elected, making them inherently less democratic than local government. Even if they were elected, it would have to be on some sort of statewide basis, and that might completely marginalize the influence of smaller communities as they tried to make their case before the board. It's hard to believe that any statewide board of appeals would be more interested in hearing from a few citizens and local elected officials than it would be from lobbyists and well-funded developers.
Rather than limiting the power of the people of Maine to decide what fits in their own towns, state government should be focused on giving communities incentives to do the right thing. They could do this by offering enhanced funding to towns that allow affordable housing, instead of taking away power from all municipalities because of bad decisions made by a few towns. That would be the better approach to encouraging responsible housing policy at the local level; hopefully, it's the one the Legislature takes.

Texto completo: For many outdoor adventurers, their most-loved gifts stand the test of time.
Every year at this time we ask expert Maine outdoors men and women for their all-time favorite outdoor gift.
Every year their stories mostly favor memories over money, travel over trendy gadgets, and time spent outdoors over anything else. And when an unparalleled piece of gear is named the best outdoor gift ever, it usually has a transformative quality.
Once again during the season of giving, here are five tales from avid Maine outdoor people about the very best outdoor gift they've received.
'THIS IS MY PASSION'
Ellsworth native Maureen Beck has won five national titles and two gold medals at the Paraclimbing World Championships. And even now, as Beck, who was born with only her right hand, transitions from a career as a competitive world-class paraclimber to more outdoor exhibition-style climbs, she proved this fall she's still got it by finishing third in the first paraclimbing World Cup held in the United States.
"It was a cool feeling. It's not like I strictly trained for it. And my competition is getting stronger and stronger," said Beck, 35, who now lives outside Denver.
Beck started climbing at age 12, and figured out how to work around her physical challenges, even though 23 years ago she didn't know about adaptive climbing. She went to college at the University of Vermont, joined the outing club, and her climbing prowess took off.
Today Beck teaches at climbing festivals and clinics to both able-bodied athletes and those with a disability. And as a professional climber with an array of sponsors, she's received some cool gear over the years.
Yet her all-time favorite outdoor gift is a no-frills, plastic helmet given by her parents, Chris and Deborah Whalley of Ellsworth.
"Before my parents really knew what climbing was, it didn't sound safe," Beck said. "That's the only piece of climbing equipment they gave me - that helmet. If that doesn't send a message. In college I said to them, I'm not quitting, this is my passion."
AVID BACKCOUNTRY SKIER
After working for 14 years for The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut and Boston, Jon Kachmar took over as executive director of the Eastern Trail Alliance just over a year ago at a time when the off-road rail-trail is poised to grow.
With the long-awaited "gap" section between Scarborough and South Portland on schedule for construction next spring, the Eastern Trail will soon span from Bug Light in South Portland all the way to Saco. And the connection needed between Saco and Biddeford is in the works, as well.
So it's a bit ironic that a guy who works during the week on one of the most important urban trails in Maine spends his weekends in avalanche country. But the backcountry skier loves the wild terrain and massive snow depth around Mount Washington. Kachmar's most meaningful outdoor gift was one he gave himself in 2012 to help him travel safely there: a $500, three-day course about avalanches taught on Mount Washington.
"It's so complicated and such a unique area that it's hard to stay on top of all of it. There's a lot to know," said Kachmar, 54. "And it's a huge benefit once you know about snow and different types of snow - you know a lot about how it can fail."
'INSPIRED BY WALKING THOSE TRAILS'
Lester Kenway is a pioneer in backcountry trail-building techniques, an icon in the Maine Appalachian Trail community, and a force behind The Maine Trail Center that the Maine Appalachian Trail Club is raising money to build in the coming years. The Maine Trail Center will be unique in the United States, offering college-style seminars on the most sustainable trail-building techniques.
A native of Connecticut, Kenway, 68, knew after he graduated from Bates College in the 1970s he wanted to build glorious, long-lasting wilderness trails. So in 1979 he took the generous monetary gift from his aunt and traveled to Nepal to study the ancient trail technology and hike around the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri Himalaya ranges 100 mile west of Everest. In one of the poorest countries in the world he was set on a path to pioneer trail-building techniques in Maine and across the United States.
"The mountain scenery was spectacular and I walked over trails that had been in place for centuries. Many of the techniques that I have used to build trails in Maine were inspired by walking those trails among some of the highest mountains in the world," said Kenway.
'IT WAS ALL SO FLIPPING WORTH IT'
For Shelby Rousseau, the good fortune she experienced 26 years ago when she and husband, Mark, were brave enough, and maybe crazy enough to move to western Maine when they had little money, and no clue about Maine's harsh winters was the greatest outdoor gift of her life.
The couple took what money they had and bought a half-built log cabin with no running water in Phillips. And they moved up from Connecticut with two children.
"We ate a lot of Cheerios that year. I never thought about having to plow the driveway before. We put our kids, ages 3 and 5, in a Flexible Flyer and hauled them up. What was I thinking?" said Rousseau, 53.
Today Rousseau is the deputy director at the Rangeley Region Heritage Trust, as well as a wilderness EMT and a member of the Saddleback ski patrol. And when she has time, she also works as a Registered Maine Guide. She loves it all.
"It was all so flipping worth it," Rousseau said. "I get to know the most beautiful places on the planet and all the opportunities that come along with living in Maine. We're in the right place."
'I HAVE THAT FLY ROD TO THIS DAY'
When Randy Spencer grew up in Manchester, Connecticut, his father, Kerwin Alton Spencer Sr., taught his three sons to fly fish on rivers around their home, as well as on Peabody Pond in the Sebago region, where the family had a camp. Before he left home after high school, Spencer's father gave him a Fenwick fly rod.
A half century later, Spencer carries it in his boat as he guides fishermen on some of the most storied fishing waters in Maine in the Grand Lake Stream region, where he and his wife, Shelley, rent private camps on West Grand Lake.
He's also earned a name as a storyteller with the award-winning books: "Where Cool Waters Flow: Four Seasons with a Master Maine Guide" and "Wide and Deep: Tales and Recollections of a Master Maine Fishing Guide." He recently published his third book, "Written on Water: Characters and Mysteries from Maine's Back of Beyond," about life in Grand Lake Stream.
Spencer, 73, has guided sportsmen from across the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Trinidad and Israel. And sometimes he offers them that Fenwick fly rod, the talisman he carries in his boat - and his best outdoor gift ever.
"My father passed in 2006, but I have that fly rod to this day. It's worse for wear, but I keep it in the canoe for luck, which I swear it brings," Spencer said.

Texto completo: The first rule of today's charcuterie boards is: There are no rules.
Now, purists will contend that anything aligning itself with the name "charcuterie" must be true to the French origins of the term, which loosely translates as "cooked flesh." To the most prosciutto-pious, only cured and smoked meats deserve to be sliced and displayed on a well-oiled wooden plank or cutting board. Begrudgingly, they'll allow a ramekin of grainy mustard, a few cornichons, and perhaps an almond or two.
But cheese? Unthinkable.
Start loading up a board with ductile clouds of young goat cheese, savory wedges of Gouda or oozy triple-cream Brie, and, to some, you've moved from charcuterie to "meat-and-cheese board," or more calamitously, antipasto. And let's not even touch on the question of allowing olives, jams, crackers or baguette slices anywhere near the dish.
Cecily Upton, co-owner of Portland's Friends & Family, a new wine bar on Congress Street, has thought through the semantics of charcuterie more than most people. Her restaurant's boards ($12-$26) reflect Upton's measured approach to the issue: "You never know how emotional people are going to be about the question of what counts, so I try not to weigh in too heavily. To me, 'charcuterie' means cured meats, but even that's not completely clear, because the word is French, yet salami itself is Italian," she said. "So we refer to them as 'meat-and-cheese' boards, but all that really matters is that people understand what they are getting."
If the now-trendy boards appearing with increasing frequency on menus across southern Maine are any indication, what customers are getting is full. No matter what you call them, charcuterie boards are all about abundance. And in a phase of the pandemic where you might have to wait months for lumber, a new car or a snowblower, there is something reassuring in being presented with an edible, over-the-top display of bounty.
But don't let that mislead you: Charcuterie boards aren't for the selfish. "The real purpose behind a board is to create a social environment where you can have a good time and snack," said Travis Kern, co-owner of Biddeford cheese shop Nibblesford. "When you get down to it, that's why I'm OK with putting cheese, pickles, and whatnot on there. It's a thing that should be about people coming together and having a good time. It's about making people feel included."
At the compact store where Kern and his business partner (and brother) Ian Kern sell a host of specialty snack foods from across Maine and New England, there is an important social component to imagining - and assembling - one of their mammoth meat-and-cheese platters ($95-$280).
"We really have to have a conversation with whoever is ordering from us. We have to ask, 'OK, what do you like to eat? Are there people who can't have cow's cheese because of lactose problems?' etcetera," Travis Kern said. "For us, it's like making a mixtape for somebody. You can't make a mixtape of only the things that you like; you have to make it with the songs that the person you're making it for would like. You always have to ask, 'I know I like this fantastic jam, awesome peppadew peppers or meat, but would this make the other person happy?' "
Indeed, it's easy to think of a well-constructed 21st century charcuterie board as a recommendation algorithm for cured meats and cheeses. Set a few artfully composed photos of your favorite platter loose on Instagram, and you might even inspire people you've never met to taste your favorite brand of bresaola.
How do I know? Well, apart from enjoying one of Charcutemarie's thoughtfully composed charcuterie trays ($55-$115 with free delivery within 15 miles of the company's headquarters in Saco), I've borrowed more than a few design ideas from founder Marie Grasser's Instagram feed. On it, she proves that she's a master of scale and shape, deploying unexpected elements like split pomegranates, buff-colored macarons, and yes, even a pyrotechnic sparkler to liven up the art of charcuterie.
You won't find any fireworks at The Portland Board, a charcuterie food truck that operates out of a retrofitted powder-blue Volkswagen bus, but owner Graham Young shares Charcutemarie's flair for originality. Each of Young's boards ($18-$25) starts with a branded, maple-wood plank, and that's where the similarity ends.
"I don't have a template to look at. Every board is unique and different from the last one, and I think that uniqueness adds to the experience," he said. "Three meats, three cheeses (or house-made vegan alternatives) and two pairings like jars of honeycomb, or blueberry-sage jam or pickled vegetables. Just whatever is fresh at the farmers market: It's always changing. I like the freedom to do whatever with a variety of flavor profiles. You'll always get some things you might not have tried before."
This season feels like the perfect time to explore charcuterie, either by visiting any of the board-specialists mentioned here (all four plan to remain open throughout the winter) or by trying your hand at composing a board of your own. My best advice is to heed Upton's guidance: "Find some fun flavors you like without breaking the bank. You can create something satisfying without buying pounds of meats and cheese. Just start small until you find what you like."
And if you still need a little help figuring out what to include, I've assembled a list of some of my favorite (mostly) locally sourced nibbles - ingredients I turn to when I'm in a charcuterie state-of-mind.

Texto completo: OTTO'S BACK HOME
Sandra Scribner Merlim ordered the watch as a Christmas present for her husband and just trusted that he would be home for the holidays.
More than four years had passed since immigration agents had swooped in on a weekday morning to detain Otto Morales-Caballeros and deport him to Guatemala. Merlim had been fighting ever since to bring him back to Maine, but it was hard to know when his paperwork finally would be in order.
Then his visa came through, and he flew in to Portland on Dec. 4.
She was so happy that she gave him her gift almost right away, unable to wait weeks to put it in his hands. He was grateful and excited, but hesitated.
"What am I going to give you for Christmas?" he asked her. "I have nothing."
"Are you nuts?" she replied. "I got what I wanted."
Much has changed in the couple's years apart. The president whose policies triggered the deportation is no longer in office. A deadly virus has spread across the globe. Merlim, 57, survived emergency heart surgery. Morales-Caballeros, 42, fought back the depression that filled the distance between them.
But today they can sit next to each other on their couch in Brunswick, and he can reach for her hand and press it to his lips for a kiss.
"We can start to live our life again," Merlim said.
delayed deportation
Early on a Wednesday in April 2017, Morales-Caballeros drove off from the couple's home in Naples to his job at a lobster processor in Saco. Within minutes, U.S. Immigration and Customs agents in big black SUVs had pulled him over. Merlim was still in her nightgown when agents knocked on her door and asked her to pick up his car.
Morales-Caballeros was in the back of an SUV when she arrived at the scene of his arrest.
"This is the end," he remembered thinking. "She's not going to be helping me when I'm over there."
Merlim wasn't allowed to talk to him directly, but her words carried through the window glass.
"You're not alone," she told him. "I'm going to fight for you."
Morales-Caballeros grew up in Petén, a mountainous region in Guatemala. His childhood was scarred by a civil war that lasted for more than three decades and claimed more than 200,000 lives. He can still remember the sounds of bullets, of his mother telling her children to get on the ground.
"People, they don't want to talk about it," he said. "They are afraid still. That war, it got stuck in people's hearts."
When he was 16, he left in search of something better. He entered this country without legal documentation. Young and afraid, he had no idea about the steps he could have taken to apply for asylum. He lived in New Jersey for a time and then made his way to Maine. He met Merlim here in 2006, and they married in 2015.
Merlim grew up in Portland and also left home at 16. She married young and had children, but then left the husband she said abused her. She needed years before she felt ready to marry Morales-Caballeros.
"It took me a couple times to get it right," she said. "I'm not letting him go."
Morales-Caballeros said immigration officials learned he was undocumented because an ex-girlfriend reported him. In 2010, a judge issued a removal order, but Morales-Caballeros was not immediately deported. In 2013, he was arrested for using a fake Social Security number and ID to work. He eventually pleaded guilty, and again he was not deported. Instead, he got legal authorization to work as long as he stayed out of trouble and checked in routinely with immigration officials.
The repeated delays to his deportation were because of shifts in federal policy. The Obama administration focused on deporting only people considered a threat to national security, border security or public safety. His government often postponed removal for people outside those categories.
President Trump saw things differently. In his first days in office, he signed an executive order that dramatically expanded immigration enforcement. Agents were directed to deport anyone with a criminal conviction or an existing removal order. Immigration arrests spiked 40 percent in his first 100 days in office, and the largest increase was among immigrants with no criminal record. The Biden administration has shifted away from that approach.
Lizz Cannon, a Florida-based attorney who specializes in bringing deportees back to the United States, agreed to represent Morales-Caballeros and worked on his case for years. It was not unique, she said.
"Otto was a person in a position that possibly hundreds of thousands of people are in," Cannon said.
Even though Morales-Caballeros was married to a U.S. citizen, the process to get him legal immigration status was complicated. The couple first had to prove that their marriage was legitimate and not just for immigration purposes. Normally, a person who has been removed from the U.S. cannot apply to come back for at least 10 years, so Morales-Caballeros also had to seek a waiver and prove that separation was causing an extreme hardship for the couple. They were approved at every step.
Cannon said the Trump administration created bureaucratic delays, and then the pandemic increased wait times even more. The couple hoped he would be home in a year, maybe two. They waited for nearly five, communicating multiple times a day, starting with a good morning phone call, ending with good night emojis.
STRUGGLING ALONE
Those many days apart were hard, and not just because of distance.
In Maine, Merlim got an overnight job at a group home and slept during the day in a recliner to avoid the empty side of the bed. Then her landlord sold their house in Naples, and she could not find another that would accept her four dogs. So she worked at night and slept in her car for nearly three months in summer 2019 until she saved enough money to buy a manufactured home in Brunswick.
Last fall, she drove herself to the hospital with chest pain and found out she needed quadruple bypass surgery. That emergency almost killed her. She spent months out of work and in recovery.
"I survived this open-heart surgery," she said. "I survived all the crap they kicked at us."
The one bright spot: Her medical needs ultimately would expedite her husband's return.
In Guatemala, Morales-Caballeros felt helpless to do anything for his wife. He spent more than a year in the city of Antigua, which is ringed by volcanoes, and he sent his wife pictures of ash in the air after an eruption. He looked for work, but he said many jobs there required connections he did not have. He spent days at a time in a rented room in the city, feeling isolated and low.
Eventually, he moved to his mother's house in Petén. He again struggled to find work in the more rural community, raising chickens and even going to Belize to pick green beans for $3 a day. His mother struggles with diabetes and dementia, and he looked after her until the family found someone to care for her in her home. The pandemic forced a lockdown for weeks, and only one household member could leave at a time for essential errands. He found solace in fishing when he was allowed to get out, but he still had to be mindful of the curfew.
With his visa in process this fall, Morales-Caballeros left for Guatemala City without telling anyone why because he could have been a target for violence if anyone knew he was bound for the United States. He slept on a friend's floor for weeks as he waited for the document to arrive. When he got vaccinated against COVID-19, he was careful to ask for the Pfizer vaccine because the county has access to vaccines that aren't approved in the United States, and he didn't want the wrong shot to block his return.
"When they sent me the passport with my visa, I was jumping up and down," he said.
Merlim booked his ticket home for that Friday. But his first and only experience on a plane had been the one that deported him. So he didn't know about such things as how early he needed to arrive at the airport in Guatemala City, and he missed his flight. A helpful ticket agent rebooked him for the next day, and he slept in the terminal to make sure there would be no further problems.
He made it to Atlanta on Saturday, but missed his connection by the time officials who detained him there verified his visa. He was so flustered as he rushed to the gate that he lost his bag, but the airline staff helped him find it once he realized his flight had left. He spent a second night in the airport, and sent his discouraged wife a selfie, holding a green-and-yellow sign that said "Baby, I'm Coming Home." He flew on Sunday to Detroit and then Portland.
finally, a 'boring' life
The airport was quiet when he landed at 4:29 p.m. Sunday. Merlim craned her neck to scan the faces of the passengers getting off the plane.
She'd flown to Guatemala twice to see her husband, in 2017 and 2018, but three years had passed since then. When she spotted him, she saw from the way he was moving that his travels had drained him. Still, he took the steps quickly to meet her at the bottom of the stairs.
They clung to each other, faces nuzzled into necks. They wiped away tears and pulled down masks to kiss. He shifted his bag to his outside shoulder so he could take her hand as they walked together. They released hands only for a moment when he pulled his blue suitcase off the baggage carousel, and she still stayed close behind him.
"He's not getting out of my sight," Merlim said with a laugh.
She kept her hand on his elbow as they wheeled the suitcase out of the airport and into the parking garage. His voice was still hoarse with tears.
"When I was losing my faith, I got so much faith from her," Morales-Caballeros said.
They went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner and he returned to the buffet four times. Then they were on their way home.
His green card, the proof of his legal permanent residency, is expected to arrive within a few weeks. He will then be able to get a Social Security number and a job. In three years, he will be allowed to apply for citizenship.
For now, Merlim jokes that they are finally living a boring life. They sit together on the couch while a talk show silently plays on the TV. He seems content to listen, eyes focused on her, while she tells their stories. Her laugh is a boom; his grin is quiet but full. He holds Skippy, one of their dogs from before his deportation, and rubs his face against the animal's soft fur.
They say they've had no trouble throwing off the anxiety that followed them for more than a decade.
"For us, that part is over with," Merlim said.
Merlim is now a shared living provider, so she has a client who stays in their home. Morales-Caballeros volunteers to come along when she drives the woman to appointments or when she has to run to the grocery store. He loves to fish all year round, but he hasn't gone yet because he knows his wife doesn't like to sit in the cold and he doesn't want to spend time without her.
They went back to the Chinese restaurant for a second time. They had a belated Thanksgiving dinner with family and friends. They are saving money for the honeymoon to Hawaii they never took, but really, they aren't in any rush.
He has a new watch on his wrist, but who's checking? Now, they have nothing but time.

Texto completo: Nurses at MaineGeneral that get sick with COVID-19 and miss work must use their earned time off to be paid, officials said.

AUGUSTA — If workers get sick with COVID-19 and are unable to come into work, most state and many municipal and private-sector workers get paid COVID-19 sick time so they don’t have to use their regular sick time or vacation time for their time out of work.
But some hospital workers in Maine are raising alarms that they are not getting such benefits even as they’re on the frontlines of the pandemic.
Laura Gosselin, a nurse at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta, said she loves a lot of things about the job she has worked for 31 years, but feels it is a slap in the face of nurses and others risking their own health to tend to patients that, if they become infected with COVID-19 and have to miss work, it costs them some of their hard-earned regular time off.
Especially when it seems, to her, that so many other workers in other nonmedical fields do get COVID-19 sick time so they don’t have to use their own regular sick or vacation time if they become infected with coronavirus and can’t work.
“My husband and several friends work for the state of Maine and get paid from a COVID fund, thus not having to use their own personal sick time,” Gosselin said, adding that her brother works for the city of Augusta, and her son-in-law works for a farm supply company, and both get COVID-19 pay if they are out sick with the virus. “I find it appalling that nurses have been at the frontlines of this pandemic and we are treated this way when we, ourselves, become sick. I hear this every single day from co-workers. It is not right. We deserve better. Our government and employer has let us down.”
MaineGeneral officials said they appreciate and greatly respect the work of their nurses and other employees, especially through the pandemic, but say their earned time off benefits are generous and that is how they are compensated if they are out of work with COVID-19, or any other illness.
“Throughout the pandemic staff have given so much, including extraordinary service to provide the best care to our fellow community members,” said Joy McKenna, spokesperson for MaineGeneral. “Senior leadership and the board have sought to recognize and honor this level of performance and continues to seek ways to support staff. The pandemic requires that MaineGeneral and all health care employers to carefully balance these objectives with that of ensuring that we maintain access to the best quality health care services to our patients and families.”
McKenna said if an employee gets sick with COVID-19, or any other illness, they use what she described as their generous earned time off bank. Earned time off includes both sick and vacation time, and employees accumulate days off based on their time with the company and how many hours they work. A full-time employee with between five and 15 years of service would earn 31 days off in a typical year. And employees can carry those hours over into the next year, if they wish, up to 240 hours.
Gosselin said she contracted COVID-19, which she is sure she got at work, from another employee. She was out of work from the Sunday after Thanksgiving for 10 days. That caused her to miss four 10-hour shifts she would have worked at the Augusta hospital as she followed Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention protocol and hospital policy by staying out of work while she recovered. To keep money coming in during that time off with COVID, she used some of her earned time off.
She said she complied with orders at the hospital to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but still got the virus anyway. She said she also then inadvertently gave it to several of her family members.
She said in the past she has only rarely gotten sick and missed work, but this year she missed a couple of days with a cold and then had to use four more days of her earned time when she was out with COVID-19 last month.
“I feel as though I was punished by having my earned time taken from me when I did what I was told and got the vaccine,” Gosselin said.
Kellie Coates, a MaineGeneral nurse for almost six years, said she did not get COVID-19, but she had close contact with a co-worker at the hospital who tested positive for COVID-19 there. Coates had to quarantine and have two negative tests before she could come back to work. That cost her only one workday, because of the way her schedule worked out, and that 10 hours of pay, which she made up for by taking it from her earned time off.
Her close contact at work came just before Thanksgiving, forcing her into quarantine “so I missed Thanksgiving with both sides of my family, because I was exposed at work,” Coates said.
She said her mother works in housekeeping for the state and gets COVID-19 sick time, as does her father, who works in maintenance at a senior living facility.
She said some of her co-workers have been out for weeks at a time due to COVID-19, including one who had to start their quarantine over because during the first quarantine the worker was exposed to someone in their household who tested positive.
In response to a letter about nurses not getting COVID-19 sick time, which Gosselin sent to hospital officials, Chuck Hays, president and CEO of MaineGeneral Health, responded to her promptly to say that nurses at MaineGeneral get worker’s compensation if they contract the virus at work. Gosselin said she couldn’t prove she got it at work, in part because she had contact with others in the community. So her claim was denied, which she said was another slap in the face.
McKenna said MaineGeneral follows workers compensation rules and offers it to any employee who receives a work-related injury or illness, but the workers compensation system requires proof the illness or injury occurred at work.
Gosselin said she has no intentions of leaving MaineGeneral and said she loves her co-workers, her immediate managers and her patients, but is frustrated that nurses have to use their earned time off if they contract COVID-19. She said many others there feel the same way, but didn’t dare comment on it publicly for fear of putting their jobs at risk.
She said she has heard other Maine hospitals have similar policies.
However, at least one major health care provider in the state, MaineHealth, which includes Maine Medical Center in Portland and seven other Maine hospitals, does provide dedicated COVID-19 sick time to employees who contract the virus, according to John Porter, a spokesman for MaineHealth.
Porter said if workers there miss work due to contracting COVID-19, they are paid for that time away from work, and it does not cost them anything from their paid time off bank, which includes both sick and vacation time.
“We do it because that’s what is best for our patients in the communities; we do it because we’re in the middle of a pandemic, and we want people to know, if they get COVID, we don’t want them in the workplace,” he said. “If you’ve got active COVID, and you’re out, you’re getting paid time off. And it doesn’t count against your paid time off bank.”
Northern Light Health, which operates Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville, offers several benefits to employees who are sick with COVID-19, according to spokesman Andrew Soucier.
“The specific benefits that employees can access when they are ill vary by situation,” Soucier said. “Employees who contract COVID-19 through community exposure have access to paid time off, and Northern Light Health provides up to 80 hours of additional time to employees who exhaust their existing paid time off while recovering. Employees also have access to company-funded short-term disability. For work-related illness, workers compensation benefits apply.”
The federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act in 2020 required some private employers and state and local governments to provide workers with up to 80 hours of time off if they contracted COVID-19.
In 2021 the state, according to a Department of Administrative and Financial Services document, offered most state employees “COVIDcare” administrative leave, modeled on the federal FFCRA program, through which they could use up to 80 hours of paid COVID leave over the course of the year, if they missed work due to the virus.
But the federal and state programs provide exemptions for health care providers and emergency responders, whose employers are not required to offer any additional sick time off due to the pandemic, one of several exemptions to the act.
Augusta City Manager Susan Robertson said the city provided city workers who contracted COVID-19 the emergency paid sick leave as required under the FFCRA and, once that expired, has continued to provide that benefit as administrative leave for full-time and permanent part-time employees. It was approved through the end of this month and she expects the city to extend it through March 2022, and it could be extended further, if needed. It provides city workers with up to 80 hours of paid sick leave. If an employee uses up that 80 hours, they can use their other accrued time such as sick or vacation time.
McKenna said MaineGeneral employees who have exhausted their earned time off in a year then move to unpaid leave, if they miss additional time. However, she said during the pandemic the organization has allowed employees who have exhausted their earned time to move into negative earned time, drawing on future earned time off, so they can continue to be paid while out of work.
She said early in the pandemic MaineGeneral’s board and senior leaders prioritized not furloughing or laying off any employees and said annual raises have continued throughout the pandemic, despite overall budget challenges, and this fall all employees received a retention bonus.
Gosselin acknowledged that bonus, but said the $489 she got from that did not cover the 40 hours of work she lost to COVID-19.

Texto completo: Noon Weiss said she didn't see any signs that her life partner, Dr. Jonathan Shenkin, was experiencing a mental health crisis, but she sensed something was terribly wrong when she got a call from his pediatric dental practice in Augusta.
"Have you heard from Jonathan?" one of Shenkin's employees said to her, Weiss recalled, on that day, Aug. 23. "He never came back from lunch, and there's an envelope with your name on it in his office."
Weiss said she knew that Shenkin had become upset that the Maine Dental Association removed him from its board the night before, during a special emergency online meeting. She said prior to the meeting, he was unaware that the purpose of the meeting was to consider his removal. The dental association had become embroiled in vaccine politics after it expressed support for the Mills administration's vaccine mandate for health care workers. The removal was for four years, with the potential to be reinstated afterward.
"Jonathan's work reputation was very important to him. His identity was very important to him," Weiss said. "They stripped him of his dignity."
Weiss - a psychiatric nurse practitioner- said she didn't realize the extent of how distraught he had become over the dispute with the board, and had not seen any previous signs of mental illness. The two had been romantic partners for 3 1/2
years, and had purchased a house together in North Yarmouth, where they lived with her two boys.
After getting the call from Shenkin's dental practice, Weiss said she had the office worker open the note and read it to her. Shenkin wrote that he was sorry, but he couldn't live with the damage to his reputation and professional life. "I thought I was doing the right thing," the note said.
She called 911, and police found Shenkin, 50, in his vehicle in the parking lot at the Augusta Civic Center near his practice.
He had killed himself.
VACCINE POLITICS
Shenkin had long advocated for public policy improvements to dentistry in Maine, including insurance reforms and pushing for an adult dental Medicaid benefit.
After lobbying for many years for adults with Medicaid to have dental services, the Maine Legislature and the Mills administration approved the dental benefit this year, expanding access for about 70,000 more people. Shenkin had also previously been a vice president of the American Dental Association, and had been quoted in many major media organizations about how public policy could improve dental care.
"He was amazing. He was a trailblazer. He saw around corners and pushed for change when he saw there was an unmet need," said his brother, Todd Shenkin, of Bergen County, New Jersey.
Shenkin had been a member of the state's dental association for many years when the issue of whether to support a vaccine mandate for health care workers came up this summer.
The MDA board voted in June to support the Mills administration's health care mandate, with a motion made by Shenkin. Weiss said he told her that he agreed with the state's efforts to have safe workplaces with vaccinated health care employees, including dental practices. A news release sent out Aug. 12 by the governor's office quoted Dr. Heather Keeling, MDA board president, as being in full support of the mandate.
"The Maine Dental Association and its members have been proactive about COVID-19 vaccinations and keeping their practices as safe as possible for patients," Keeling said in a statement. "That will continue with the governor's new requirement, which we fully support."
But Weiss said Shenkin had told her that after the MDA supported the mandate, some dental practices complained to the MDA that the mandate would cause them to lose employees who didn't want to be vaccinated.
By August, the controversy made its way to the Maine Dental Association board, which held an emergency meeting on Aug. 22. Weiss said Shenkin told her he was blindsided, and had no idea the meeting's purpose was to decide whether he should be ousted.
"I think they panicked, and he was a perfect scapegoat. I think there was fear behind this," Weiss said.
Shenkin's ouster was related to communications he had with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention about the vaccine mandate. Shenkin, in an email, told Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine CDC director, that the Maine Dental Association had approved a policy in June supportive of the vaccine mandate, and referred further questions to MDA leadership.
A dentist who was present during the Zoom meeting where Shenkin was removed - and who did not wish to be identified for fear of professional reprisal - said the proceeding was like a "witch hunt" and that Shenkin did not do anything wrong by relaying messages about the MDA's position to Dr. Shah. The individual said the meeting was run by board member Dr. Brad Rand, who made the motion to remove Shenkin. Rand did not respond to requests for comment.
An email from Shenkin to is attorney - shared with the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram by Weiss - recounted his communications with the Maine CDC.
"I emailed Dr. Shah and mentioned the MDA now had policy supporting (the vaccine mandate)," Shenkin wrote. "He thanked me and I referred him to our Executive Director. I did not say I was an officer or even a board member in my communications."
The dentist who was present at the board meeting that removed Shenkin said, "I don't think he said anything different than what I would have said to Dr. Shah." There were two calls for votes to oust Shenkin, a motion that would require a two-thirds majority. The first vote failed 7-3 with three abstentions and after more discussion, the second vote succeeded 11-2, the individual said.
Weiss said Shenkin did not hold an inflexible position about the vaccine mandate. He wanted to give dental practices sufficient time to comply so as not to suffer from workforce shortages. The Mills administration delayed enforcement of its vaccine mandate to late October to give health care providers time to comply and, if needed, find replacement workers.
"He just wanted people to be safe, the patients to be safe and the staff to be safe," Weiss said.
An email from the MDA board of directors on Aug. 23 sent to its members stated that an "unauthorized member" had communicated with Shah.
"This communication occurred without the board's knowledge, and further was a misrepresentation of the board's intent," according to the email. "The board's press statement following the governor's announcement was drafted just prior to the announcement and was based on the assumption that ALL health care workers were included. Further, we were unaware that no exemptions other than medical would be permitted."
Publicly, the MDA did not issue a news release backing away from its statement of full support of the mandate. But this fall MDA officials testified in favor of being removed from the mandate in submitted remarks to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, which was finalizing the rules of how the mandate would be implemented.
The mandate went into full effect in late October, but in early November, the state decided to exempt dentists and dental workers from the requirement. Part of the reason cited by the state was technical: Dentists are covered under rules that don't apply to other health care workers and are set by the State Board of Dental Practice.
Kathy Ridley, MDA interim executive director, declined to answer questions about the dispute between the board and Shenkin.
"Dr. Shenkin's death was a tragic loss for his family, his patients, the community he served and our association," Ridley said in a statement to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram. "He was an active and valued member whose career and leadership will leave a tremendous legacy. We continue to remind people of his lifelong achievements and the countless efforts he took to improve pediatric oral health in the state of Maine."
Weiss said she believes the board's action to remove him from the dental board triggered Shenkin. She shared the note he left her:
"Noon - I am so sorry that it has come to this. I had no expectation that my actions would destroy me professionally," Shenkin's note said. "I thought I was doing the right thing. I feel awful thinking about how this will impact you and the boys. I love you all. I know some would say this is selfish, but I can't go on living my life with what I have created. I am responsible. There is no turning back. My practice will be ruined, my reputation tarnished, everything I had worked for since I was a struggling kid."
SUICIDE AND MENTAL HEALTH
Maine's suicide rate is 12th-highest in the country, at 19.8 per 100,000 residents, compared with the national average of 14.5 per 100,000. Most of the states with the highest suicide rates are rural states like Wyoming, Montana, Alaska and New Mexico.
The reasons behind a suicide are myriad and simple explanations are insufficient, said Greg Marley, director of suicide prevention for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maine.
"People looking for reasons often grab onto easy answers," Marley said. "This is a complex mental health issue."
Marley said an event can trigger a suicide, but usually there are warning signs, such as changes in behavior, that manifest long before the suicide. He said suicide is preventable and connecting people to help is shown to work in most cases.
"For most people, suicidal ideation is short term and it passes, so prevention works," Marley said. "If you suspect suicidal ideation, step closer, talk to them. If you can, break through the isolation and get them help."
SHENKIN'S LEGACY
Shenkin grew up in the Westchester County, New York. His brother said he was inspired to be a dentist after having TMJ - a dysfunction of the jaw - as a child and needing advanced treatment.
Todd Shenkin said his brother remembered being a difficult patient for dentists, which inspired him to go into pediatric dentistry, graduating from Columbia University in New York.
"He wanted kids to feel comfortable at the dentist's office," Shenkin said. "And he wanted to have a broader impact on society."
Although he had no children of his own, Shenkin was a "doting uncle" to his two nieces, his brother said, and like a stepdad to Weiss' sons.
"After I started having kids, I used to ask Jonathan when was he going to have kids so that I could become an uncle. His stock response was 'Sorry, but I see enough kids at work.' However, underneath all that bluster, he was really a kid at heart and knew how to have fun."
A "foodie" who loved to travel, Shenkin believed he could change the world, and did so, Weiss said. Helping children at a pediatric practice, and accepting Medicaid patients, many of whom have difficulty accessing care, was not enough for him, she said.
"He couldn't sit still - he was a restless soul. He was unable to sit back and watch injustices," Weiss said. "He had his hands in everything. When he sees something he wants to change, he goes all in. He's fully dedicated."
Besides helping extend dental benefits to adults with Medicaid, Shenkin also championed the elimination of waiting periods for children whose families get new dental insurance, with that measure becoming law in 2019. Most recently, an insurance reform bill proposed by Shenkin failed this year, but is expected to be taken up in 2022.
"His legacy is still there," Todd Shenkin said. "He was brilliant. My brother was a force for good in the world. When he died, a light went out."

First snow arrives to blanket Maine

Texto completo: Between 4 and 7 inches is expected throughout much of the state. A year ago Maine had 19 inches of snow on the ground by this date.

The first plowable snow storm for central and southern Maine arrived Saturday afternoon, with the National Weather Service in Gray cautioning that driving will be difficult into Sunday morning.
An official winter storm warning was in effect from 1 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday, but NWS meteorologist Greg Cornwall correctly forecasted that snow wouldn’t start falling in southern Maine until after 2 p.m. By 2:30 p.m. a light snow had begun. In Auburn, snow began falling around 3 p.m. Saturday.
In central Maine, snow mixed with freezing drizzle was expected before 11 a.m. Sunday, with a chance of snow until noon, with a high near 32 degrees. The snowfall was expected to clear in the afternoon.
National Weather Service cautioned that driving would be “very difficult” because of low visibility and snow covered roads into early Sunday morning.
Forecasters also reported that wind gusts could reach 55 mph, which could lead to tree limbs coming down on lines and power outages.
The forecast caused Concord Coach Lines to cancel some of its bus service in Maine and New Hampshire.
The Maine Turnpike reduced speeds to 45 mph Saturday afternoon due to snow.
Lewiston on Friday announced a winter parking ban would be in effect through 7 a.m. Sunday. Auburn declared a parking ban will be in effect through 9 a.m. Sunday.
By late afternoon Friday, just about all area towns had announced similar parking bans as the storm swept toward Maine.
Saturday’s snow is late for a typical winter season, Cornwall said. “We are behind the usual bell curve. For the season we are 8 inches below normal.” A year ago there was 19 inches of snow on the ground at this time. “That’s a pretty big difference.”
But within a week of that storm rain came and washed the snow away, giving much of Maine a brown Christmas.
There’s a better chance for a white Christmas this year, Cornwall said. “Temperatures are supposed to be fairly cold for the remainder of the week, so a lot of the snow should be able to stick around especially inland away from the coast.”
Another system could bring flurries to the mountains and foothills Sunday night, Cornwall said. “And there’s the potential for snow showers Wednesday into Thursday.”
Maine has been warm so far this winter. Typically December’s highs and lows are in the 20s overnight and 30s to low 40s during the day. “On Friday it got to 53 for a high, on Sunday (Dec. 12) it got to 57,” Cornwall said.

Texto completo: Pvt. Atwood Young's great-great-grandsons plan a ceremony honoring him in the spring.

BUCKFIELD — Serving one’s country in times of war does not always end with glory. That is what one Buckfield family learned after digging into its history and discovering that an ancestor who was killed in battle during the Civil War had no confirmed burial.
Pvt. Atwood Young’s military trail ends with a mass grave on a small beach island along the South Carolina coast. His great-great-grandsons, brothers Philip McAlister Jr. and Jamison McAlister, combed through military records that provided only suggestions of Young’s fate beyond his stated date of death as Aug. 11, 1863.
Union soldiers were laid in two large trenches following the Battle of Fort Wagner where Pvt. Atwood Young was killed in 1863. One was for Black soldiers from the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment and the other for their white brethren from regiments of northeastern states from Pennsylvania to Maine.
The McAlister brothers could not be sure which of those graves their great-great-grandfather would have been in, because Young’s mother was Native American and he could have been mistaken for either race in the sweltering heat.
Many of the bodies were later exhumed and reburied at Beaufort National Cemetery in South Carolina bearing headstones that read “unknown.” But as Morris Island, where the battle was fought, was subject to erosion and shifting sands, several bodies were washed away by ocean tides before they could be reclaimed.
Pvt. Atwood Young’s final resting place was not recorded.
The McAlisters were able to piece together much of Young’s life before the Civil War, including the deception he used to enlist.
Accounts of teenage boys lying about their age in order to serve their country during times of war have been well documented, going back to colonial times. More unusual are cases where older men fudge their birth date to make them appear to be younger when they enlist.
That is what Young did, intent on joining the Union Army when the Civil War broke out. He was born in 1812.
His first stint in the military was during the Aroostook War during the 1840s. The presence of American militia soldiers in northern Maine as British and American diplomats negotiated where to draw an indisputable boundary between Maine and Canada was likely helpful. But in the end no shots were fired and the militia called to the border disbanded, returning to their hometowns unscathed.
In his mid-30s during the Aroostook War, Young would have to wait 10 more years for his opportunity to serve his country.
When the Civil War gave him his chance he was already at the cusp of his 50s.
Determined to enlist, he cited May 9, 1825, as his birth date. He joined the 9th Maine Infantry Regiment and headed south.
The 9th Maine saw action around coastal areas in the deep South. In July of 1863 it took part in the Battle of Fort Wagner in South Carolina.
The Union Army staged attacks to take the fort July 11 and again July 18, both of which saw heavy casualties and Yankee retreats.
During the aftermath, the Confederate forces left in control of the fort buried the dead Union soldiers in two mass graves, Black soldiers in one and whites in the other.
In the Civil War it could take days, even weeks, for a regiment to regroup following battle. Young did not return to his unit and one eyewitness reported he had seen him take a musket ball to the head. His date of death is where his story ended for 158 years.
As he researched Young’s history, Philip McAlister Jr. came to the conclusion that his great-great- grandfather’s remains would never be recovered. The McAlister descendants wanted him to have the military burial he deserved. Jamison, a military veteran himself, took on the bureaucracy required to get Young his headstone.
“Being a military veteran means you get a headstone,” Jamison explained from Iraq, where he works as part of a contractor security detail. “I said to my family, ‘we can get a gravestone. Let’s put it in Buckfield,’ in our family cemetery.”
Jamison reached out to the Veterans Administration and petitioned for a stone. He had proof of Young’s service that his brother had acquired, his military records, including an affidavit another soldier had made as a witness of Young’s death.
The McAlisters also needed to get the closest relatives in name to Young to sign off on the request. Jamison submitted the information in June.
Young’s marker was delivered to the McAlister home in Buckfield on Dec. 7.
Jamison is also making headway to get Young a U.S. flag through the Maine Veterans Administration.
The McAlisters plan a ceremony honoring their great-great-grandfather in the spring.
Young’s gravestone will be placed in the family’s private cemetery next to his great-granddaughter Wilma McAlister, the mother of Philip and Jamison. She died in 2000.

Texto completo: Dr. Jonathan Shenkin, 50, died by suicide on Aug. 23, a day after he lost his post with a professional association.

Noon Weiss said she didn’t see any signs that her life partner, Dr. Jonathan Shenkin, was experiencing a mental health crisis, but she sensed something was terribly wrong when she got a call from his pediatric dental practice in Augusta.
“Have you heard from Jonathan?” one of Shenkin’s employees said to her, Weiss recalled, on that day, Aug. 23. “He never came back from lunch, and there’s an envelope with your name on it in his office.”
Weiss said she knew that Shenkin had become upset that the Maine Dental Association removed him from its board the night before, during a special emergency online meeting. She said prior to the meeting, he was unaware that the purpose of the meeting was to consider his removal. The dental association had become embroiled in vaccine politics after it expressed support for the Mills administration’s vaccine mandate for health care workers. The removal was for four years, with the potential to be reinstated afterward.
“Jonathan’s work reputation was very important to him. His identity was very important to him,” Weiss said. “They stripped him of his dignity.”
Weiss — a psychiatric nurse practitioner — said she didn’t realize the extent of how distraught he had become over the dispute with the board, and had not seen any previous signs of mental illness. The two had been romantic partners for three and a half years, and had purchased a house together in North Yarmouth, where they lived with her two boys.
After getting the call from Shenkin’s dental practice, Weiss said she had the office worker open the note and read it to her. Shenkin wrote that he was sorry, but he couldn’t live with the damage to his reputation and professional life. “I thought I was doing the right thing,” the note said.
She called 911, and police found Shenkin, 50, in his vehicle in the parking lot at the Augusta Civic Center near his practice.
He had killed himself.
VACCINE POLITICS
Shenkin had long advocated for public policy improvements to dentistry in Maine, including insurance reforms and pushing for an adult dental Medicaid benefit.
After lobbying for many years for adults with Medicaid to have dental services, the Maine Legislature and the Mills administration approved the dental benefit this year, expanding access for about 70,000 more people. Shenkin had also previously been a vice president for the American Dental Association, and had been quoted in many major media organizations about how public policy could improve dental care.
“He was amazing. He was a trailblazer. He saw around corners and pushed for change when he saw there was an unmet need,” said his brother, Todd Shenkin, of Bergen County, New Jersey.
Shenkin had been a member of the state’s dental association for many years when the issue of whether to support a vaccine mandate for health care workers came up this summer.
The MDA board voted in June to support the Mills administration’s health care mandate, with a motion made by Shenkin. Weiss said he told her that he agreed with the state’s efforts to have safe workplaces with vaccinated health care employees, including dental practices. A news release sent out Aug. 12 by the governor’s office quoted Dr. Heather Keeling, MDA board president, as being in full support of the mandate.
“The Maine Dental Association and its members have been proactive about COVID-19 vaccinations and keeping their practices as safe as possible for patients,” Keeling said in a statement. “That will continue with the governor’s new requirement, which we fully support.”
But Weiss said Shenkin had told her that after the MDA supported the mandate, some dental practices complained to the MDA that the mandate would cause them to lose employees who didn’t want to be vaccinated.
By August, the controversy made its way to the Maine Dental Association board, which held an emergency meeting on Aug. 22. Weiss said Shenkin told her he was blindsided, and had no idea the meeting’s purpose was to decide whether he should be ousted.
“I think they panicked, and he was a perfect scapegoat. I think there was fear behind this,” Weiss said.
Shenkin’s ouster was related to communications he had with the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention about the vaccine mandate. Shenkin, in an email, told Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine CDC director, that the Maine Dental Association had approved a policy in June supportive of the vaccine mandate, and referred further questions to MDA leadership.
A dentist who was present during the Zoom meeting where Shenkin was removed — and who did not wish to be identified for fear of professional reprisal — said the proceeding was like a “witch hunt” and that Shenkin did not do anything wrong by relaying messages about the MDA’s position to Dr. Shah. The individual said the meeting was run by board member Dr. Brad Rand, who made the motion to remove Shenkin. Rand did not respond to requests for comment.
An email from Shenkin to his attorney — shared with the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram by Weiss — recounted his communications with the Maine CDC.
“I emailed Dr. Shah and mentioned the MDA now had policy supporting (the vaccine mandate),” Shenkin wrote. “He thanked me and I referred him to our Executive Director. I did not say I was an officer or even a board member in my communications.”
The dentist who was present at the board meeting that removed Shenkin said, “I don’t think he said anything different than what I would have said to Dr. Shah.” There were two calls for votes to oust Shenkin, a motion that would require a two-thirds majority. The first vote failed 7-3 with three abstentions and after more discussion, the second vote succeeded 11-2, the individual said.
Weiss said Shenkin did not hold an inflexible position about the vaccine mandate. He wanted to give dental practices sufficient time to comply so as not to suffer from workforce shortages. The Mills administration delayed enforcement of its vaccine mandate to late October to give health care providers time to comply and, if needed, find replacement workers.
“He just wanted people to be safe, the patients to be safe and the staff to be safe,” Weiss said.
An email from the MDA board of directors on Aug. 23 sent to its members stated that an “unauthorized member” had communicated with Dr. Shah.
“This communication occurred without the board’s knowledge, and further was a misrepresentation of the board’s intent,” according to the email. “The board’s press statement following the governor’s announcement was drafted just prior to the announcement and was based on the assumption that ALL health care workers were included. Further, we were unaware that no exemptions other than medical would be permitted.”
Publicly, the MDA did not issue a news release backing away from its statement of full support of the mandate. But this fall MDA officials testified in favor of being removed from the mandate in submitted remarks to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, which was finalizing the rules of how the mandate would be implemented.
The mandate went into full effect in late October, but in early November, the state decided to exempt dentists and dental workers from the requirement. Part of the reason cited by the state was technical: dentists are covered under rules that don’t apply to other health care workers and are set by the State Board of Dental Practice.
Kathy Ridley, MDA interim executive director, declined to answer questions about the dispute between the board and Shenkin.
“Dr. Shenkin’s death was a tragic loss for his family, his patients, the community he served and our association,” Ridley said in a statement to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram. “He was an active and valued member whose career and leadership will leave a tremendous legacy. We continue to remind people of his lifelong achievements and the countless efforts he took to improve pediatric oral health in the state of Maine.”
Weiss said she believes the board’s action to remove him from the dental board triggered Shenkin. She shared the note he left her:
“Noon — I am so sorry that it has come to this. I had no expectation that my actions would destroy me professionally,” Shenkin’s note said. “I thought I was doing the right thing. I feel awful thinking about how this will impact you and the boys. I love you all. I know some would say this is selfish, but I can’t go on living my life with what I have created. I am responsible. There is no turning back. My practice will be ruined, my reputation tarnished, everything I had worked for since I was a struggling kid.”

SUICIDE AND MENTAL HEALTH Maine’s suicide rate is 12th-highest in the country, at 19.8 per 100,000 residents, compared with the national average of 14.5 per 100,000. Most of the states with the highest suicide rates are rural states like Wyoming, Montana, Alaska and New Mexico.
The reasons behind a suicide are myriad and simple explanations are insufficient, said Greg Marley, director of suicide prevention for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maine.
“People looking for reasons often grab onto easy answers,” Marley said. “This is a complex mental health issue.”
Marley said an event can trigger a suicide, but usually there are warning signs, such as changes in behavior, that manifest long before the suicide. He said suicide is preventable and connecting people to help is shown to work in most cases.
“For most people, suicidal ideation is short term and it passes, so prevention works,” Marley said. “If you suspect suicidal ideation, step closer, talk to them. If you can, break through the isolation and get them help.”

SHENKIN’S LEGACY Shenkin grew up in the Westchester County, New York. His brother said he was inspired to be a dentist after having TMJ — a dysfunction of the jaw — as a child and needing advanced treatment.
Todd Shenkin said his brother remembered being a difficult patient for dentists, which inspired him to go into pediatric dentistry, graduating from Columbia University in New York.
“He wanted kids to feel comfortable at the dentist’s office,” Shenkin said. “And he wanted to have a broader impact on society.”
Although he had no children of his own, Shenkin was a “doting uncle” to his two nieces, his brother said, and like a stepdad to Weiss’ sons.
“After I started having kids, I used to ask Jonathan when was he going to have kids so that I could become an uncle. His stock response was ‘Sorry, but I see enough kids at work.’ However, underneath all that bluster, he was really a kid at heart and knew how to have fun. “
A “foodie” who loved to travel, Weiss said Shenkin believed he could change the world, and did so. Helping children at a pediatric practice, and accepting Medicaid patients, many of whom have difficulty accessing care, was not enough for him, she said.
“He couldn’t sit still — he was a restless soul. He was unable to sit back and watch injustices,” Weiss said. “He had his hands in everything. When he sees something he wants to change, he goes all in. He’s fully dedicated.”
Besides helping extend dental benefits to adults with Medicaid, Shenkin also championed the elimination of waiting periods for children whose families get new dental insurance, with that measure becoming law in 2019. Most recently, an insurance reform bill proposed by Shenkin failed this year, but is expected to be taken up in 2022.
“His legacy is still there,” Todd Shenkin said. “He was brilliant. My brother was a force for good in the world. When he died, a light went out.”

Texto completo: Maine's outdoor adventurers say their most-loved outdoor gifts have stood the test of time.
can’t be beat
Every year at this time we ask expert Maine outdoors men and women for their all-time favorite outdoor gift.
Every year their stories mostly favor memories over money, travel over trendy gadgets, and time spent outdoors over anything else. And when an unparalleled piece of gear is named the best outdoor gift ever, it usually has a transformative quality.
Once again during the season of giving, here are five tales from avid Maine outdoor people about the very best outdoor gift they’ve received.
‘THIS IS MY PASSION’
Ellsworth native Maureen Beck has won five national titles and two gold medals at the Paraclimbing World Championships. And even now, as Beck, who was born with only her right hand, transitions from a career as a competitive world-class paraclimber to more outdoor exhibition-style climbs, she proved this fall she’s still got it by finishing third in the first paraclimbing World Cup held in the United States.
“It was a cool feeling. It’s not like I strictly trained for it. And my competition is getting stronger and stronger,” said Beck, 35, who now lives outside Denver.
Beck started climbing at age 12, and figured out how to work around her physical challenges, even though 23 years ago she didn’t know about adaptive climbing. She went to college at the University of Vermont, joined the outing club, and her climbing prowess took off. Today Beck teaches at climbing festivals and clinics to both able-bodied athletes and those with a disability. And as a professional climber with an array of sponsors, she’s received some cool gear over the years.
Yet her all-time favorite outdoor gift is a no-frills, plastic helmet given by her parents, Chris and Deborah Whalley of Ellsworth.
“Before my parents really knew what climbing was, it didn’t sound safe,” Beck said. “That’s the only piece of climbing equipment they gave me – that helmet. If that doesn’t send a message. In college I said to them, I’m not quitting, this is my passion.”
AVID BACKCOUNTRY SKIER
After working for 14 years for The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut and Boston, Jon Kachmar took over as executive director of the Eastern Trail Alliance just over a year ago at a time when the off-road rail-trail is poised to grow. With the long-awaited “gap” section between Scarborough and South Portland on schedule for construction next spring, the Eastern Trail will soon span from Bug Light in South Portland all the way to Saco. And the connection needed between Saco and Biddeford is in the works, as well.
So it’s a bit ironic that a guy who works during the week on one of the most important urban trails in Maine spends his weekends in avalanche country. But the backcountry skier loves the wild terrain and massive snow depth around Mount Washington. Kachmar’s most meaningful outdoor gift was one he gave himself in 2012 to help him travel safely there: a $500, three-day course about avalanches taught on Mount Washington.
“It’s so complicated and such a unique area that it’s hard to stay on top of all of it. There’s a lot to know,” said Kachmar, 54. “And it’s a huge benefit once you know about snow and different types of snow – you know a lot about how it can fail.”
‘INSPIRED BY WALKING THOSE TRAILS’
Lester Kenway is a pioneer in backcountry trail-building techniques, an icon in the Maine Appalachian Trail community, and a force behind The Maine Trail Center that the Maine Appalachian Trail Club is raising money to build in the coming years. The Maine Trail Center will be unique in the United States, offering college-style seminars on the most sustainable trail-building techniques.
A native of Connecticut, Kenway, 68, knew after he graduated from Bates College in the 1970s he wanted to build glorious, long-lasting wilderness trails. So in 1979 he took the generous monetary gift from his aunt and traveled to Nepal to study the ancient trail technology and hike around the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri Himalaya ranges 100 mile west of Everest. In one of the poorest countries in the world he was set on a path to pioneer trail-building techniques in Maine and across the United States.
“The mountain scenery was spectacular and I walked over trails that had been in place for centuries. Many of the techniques that I have used to build trails in Maine were inspired by walking those trails among some of the highest mountains in the world,” said Kenway.

Joint standing committees to continue to convene remotely due to COVID surge

State lawmakers will convene for at least two in-person sessions next month, but committee work will be conducted remotely because of the ongoing pandemic, legislative leaders announced Friday.
Senate President Troy Jackson and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau said in a news release that the Legislature will convene in-person on Jan. 5 and Jan. 26. Joint standing committees, however, will continue to meet remotely in January, because of the ongoing surge in COVID-19 cases that is filling hospitals and is expected to get worse following the holiday season.
“Unfortunately, we are in the middle of an unbelievable crisis with the COVID-19 surge affecting Maine and New England,” Jackson said. “With the holidays around the corner, the Maine Legislature plans to operate under the COVID-19 health and safety protocols established last year. We simply can’t afford to put our families and communities at risk or further stress our hospitals, health care providers and front-line workers.”
Leadership said that public testimony could be provided to committees in writing at mainelegislature.org/testimony. Anyone interested in testifying live before the committee is encouraged to register at least 30 minutes before the hearing is scheduled to begin. Remote meetings will be streamed online.
The State House is open to the public, but pandemic precautions remain in place. That includes a requirement that people wear masks, unless they are alone in an office, at their own cubicle and able to socially distance, or in the third balcony at the State House.
Fecteau said lawmakers must continue to take care to protect the health and safety of the state’s nonpartisan staff, the public and lawmakers. He said remote meetings allow for greater public participation.
“Last session, we had Mainers calling in and zooming in to participate in public hearings from every corner of the state — from barns, kitchen tables, garages and shops,” Fecteau said. “It was incredible to see how everyday people could participate and get engaged in the political process without having to drive to Augusta.”
“I’m happy to report that the same level of transparency and access will continue this session, with public hearings and work sessions streaming live online,” he added. “Ultimately, I remain committed to the safety and health of the nonpartisan staff, the public and the lawmakers at the State House.”

How Maine lost control of coronavirus and became a national hot spot

Texto completo: With the virus raging across interior parts of the state, hospitals are already under stress as holidays, winter and the omicron variant lie ahead.

Maine has emerged as a national hot spot for COVID-19 infections as New England — long the safest part of the country — has been hammered by the delta variant of the disease.
Delta has pushed the state’s health system to its limits even as a new wave of infections is expected in the coming weeks from the faster-spreading omicron variant, which was officially detected in Maine for the first time on Friday.
Maine had the country’s fourth-highest number of new cases per capita over the past week — a daily average of 78 per 100,000 people — a rate more than double the national average. The state also had the second-fastest rate of change — an increase of 148% over 14 days — after Connecticut, according to a national tracking database of statistics from state and local health agencies maintained by The New York Times.
The daunting trends are largely driven by an explosion in cases across western and northern Maine. On Friday, Aroostook County had the third-highest per capita new caseload of all 3,240 counties and county equivalents in the United States and U.S. territories at a staggering 149 daily infections per 100,000 people. Piscataquis County was ranked 15 and Penobscot, Franklin and Androscoggin were all in the top 50.
If Aroostook County were a country it would have had the third-highest rate on the planet Friday, according to the Times’s tracker.
The surge in cases comes on top of three months of unrelenting growth as the more contagious delta variant spread over Maine, pushing hospitalization levels for the disease to double the numbers seen during the worst pre-vaccination surge a year ago. Last week the state’s largest hospital, Maine Medical Center in Portland, had its worst burden of the entire pandemic, while most other hospitals coped with numbers higher than anything seen before delta — and now omicron — arrived on the scene.
Gov. Janet Mills deployed 38 members of the National Guard to 10 hospitals and long-term care facilities Monday to relieve stress on the medical system. The federal government also sent 15 medical professionals to Maine Med for the same purpose Dec. 11.
“It’s alarming,” Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah said of the state’s diminishing hospital capacity, which he said was aptly illustrated by a political cartoon he recently saw of a hospital patient in a bed in the middle of a swimming pool, being kept afloat by a struggling nurse. “Providers are literally keeping patients afloat, but at great cost to themselves.”
“It is not out of the realm of possibility that we will approach a time where ICU beds will not be available,” Shah warned. “Not just for COVID patients but for any patient. We have plans to avoid that and to deal with a two-hit situation like a big pileup on the highway but, oh boy.”
Dr. Laura Blaisdell, a pediatrician and vaccine policy expert, said that when the pandemic began Maine had a game plan: Use social distancing and masks to keep hospitalizations and deaths low until a vaccine was created and widely distributed.
“We in Maine won that first half of the game,” she said. “But I’m afraid we’re losing the second half and it’s the unvaccinated who are throwing our game.”

Changing patterns It’s not entirely clear why Maine and other New England states have been hit so hard in recent weeks, but it follows a seasonal pattern seen last year before vaccines and the more contagious variants arrived in the U.S. In both 2020 and 2021 the pandemic struck southern and western interior states hard in the summer, then turned its wrath on New England and the upper Midwest.
“With colder temperatures, especially in the Northeast and upper Midwest, there’s a lot more indoor gatherings,” says Dr. Thomas Tsai, a health policy researcher at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “In the South, in the hotter temperatures they tend to be more indoors with air conditioning, so that is definitely a factor.”
The early success of states like Maine and Vermont — which led the nation in vaccinations and in keeping the original version of the novel coronavirus in check — ironically may be contributing to the rapid spread of the new variants in both states now.
Maine has the oldest population in the country and got more people vaccinated back in the spring of 2020 than most states, meaning the efficacy of the vaccines has started to wane in people who have not received a third shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Fewer people got sick in the early waves, so there is less nonvaccine “immunity” in rural pockets of Maine than in places like South Dakota or Georgia that had massive outbreaks in the first year of the crisis.
“Maine did so well that we just don’t have a lot of natural immunity in the background,” says Dr. Evangeline Thibodeau, an infectious disease expert at York Hospital in York. “If we have areas that haven’t had COVID before and where few people are vaccinated, that’s a recipe for delta to take hold and spread rapidly.”

Geographic and political divisions What is clear is that COVID-19 is thriving in places with low vaccination rates and leaving places with high vaccination rates relatively unscathed.
The geographic disparities in Maine are stark. In Cumberland County on Friday, 81% of all residents were fully vaccinated and the densely populated county had the lowest new case loads in the state. In hard-hit Franklin, Piscataquis, Aroostook and Somerset counties, the vaccination rate is just 57% to 63%, according to the Maine CDC.
In Cumberland County, 26% of all 5- to 11-year-olds have been fully vaccinated. In Franklin that figure is 15%, in Aroostook 14%, and in Somerset just 8.6%.
“This is really the story of the two Maines,” says former Maine CDC Director Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at Maine Med’s parent entity, MaineHealth, who is originally from Farmington in hard-hit Franklin County and visits the area regularly. “If you go to Whole Foods in Portland, everyone is masked and if you go to Hannaford in Farmington almost nobody is, except the employees.”
The cleavages on vaccines and new cases mirror the state’s historic divides between the “rim counties” that border on Canada and the rest of the coast and Kennebec and Androscoggin Valley towns. The Maine CDC’s latest ZIP-code level data on vaccination rates — dated through Dec. 13 — shows relatively high vaccination rates in every town bordering on the ocean (save Kittery and Machias). Low vaccination communities — those with a populationwide rate under 75% — are clustered in the interior from Eliot and the Berwicks in York County to Presque Isle and Fort Kent in the far north.
The geographic disparities in vaccination rates don’t neatly correspond to rural versus urban. Portland’s rate is a healthy 83% of all residents, but Bangor’s is only 71%, and Lewiston’s just 66%. Some rural towns have very high rates like Whiting in far eastern Maine (91%) or Eagle Lake in the far north (92%), according to the Maine CDC. But rates are low in the places where most residents of Franklin, Somerset, Oxford, Piscataquis, Penobscot and Androscoggin counties live.
Shah said he is concerned that the decision to get vaccinated is becoming driven by political-cultural identities, putting tens of thousands of Mainers and millions of Americans at unnecessary risk.
“I think it has gone beyond a simple scientific belief and is now becoming part of someone’s identity,” he said. “You see very readily people on social media proud of where they have been boosted or vaccinated or proud of not being vaccinated at all. This has a huge implication from a messaging and convincing standpoint because we are essentially asking a large swath of the population to change their identity on this.”
Mills said that for this reason the messengers bearing public health and vaccination facts are extremely important.
“We very strongly need people from conservative circles — religious, faith and business — to really stand up and promote vaccination,” she said. “We desperately need them to do this to save our health care system and to save lives. I am very worried about the coming weeks.”

Capacity tested in health care facilities The stress of the building surge is already hitting hospitals hard.
In the early months of the pandemic, public health authorities were prepared to open field hospitals at the arenas in Portland and Bangor. In a sense, Maine has again reached the point where those would have kicked in.
Shah said last week’s National Guard deployment was in effect facilitating the creation of new crisis hospital capacity to relieve stress on the state’s large medical centers. But instead of field hospitals, the idea is to create surge capacity within existing medical facilities.
With the Guard’s help, the 10-hospital MaineHealth network is setting up new capacity at St. Joseph’s Manor rehabilitation center in Portland in order to open up space at MaineMed. Eastern Maine Medical Center is relying on a facility in Waterville.
“That’s structurally the same model, but smaller and with a city-by-city approach rather than having a giant tent hospital in Bangor,” Shah said. “It’s effectively an alternate care site, but smaller and more replaceable.”
With the holidays coming and even more contagious omicron variant presumed to be circulating in the state, experts expect the situation to get worse before it gets better. And previous assumptions that masks and social distancing could be dropped as vaccination rates exceeded 70% or 80% are now outdated, given the new variant’s ability to spread faster and challenge vaccine defenses.
“We know what we need to do — nothing has changed in mitigation strategies,” Dr. Thibodeau said. “Stay home if you’re sick. Practice social distancing. Get vaccinated and get boosted.”
Dr. Blaisdell agrees. “I think we know how to do masking, distancing and testing — all these things work, but I’m really looking forward to life getting back to normal,” she said. “And the way we get back to living a normal life during the pandemic is through high vaccination rates.”

Texto completo: For that quick breath of fresh air, there are so many year-round options in every corner of Maine – from York to Lubec.
little mountain adventures
Sometimes a short walk is all you want or need, perhaps an hour or so and maybe a mile, more or less, in the great outdoors.
It’s just enough time and distance to get the legs moving and the heart pumping, a little sun on your face and some fresh air in the lungs. And hopefully there’s an open ledge or a craggy summit along the way for nice vista and a chance to hang out for a spell. The AMC Maine Mountain Guide has plenty of little mountain hikes to choose from that meet just these criteria.
Here are a handful of good ones to consider this winter. Enjoy!
French Mountain, Rome
The 7 Lakes Alliance maintains seven trail systems in the 6,000-acre Kennebec Highlands, the largest contiguous block of conservation land in central Maine. For a good look around the high ground of the Belgrade Lakes region, hike the 0.9-mile loop on French Mountain (716 feet), which rewards with excellent viewpoints from atop its eastern ledges. Whittier Pond, Mount Phillip, Long Pond and Great Pond are a few of the sights you’ll see. Check out all that 7 Lakes Alliance has to offer for trail walks at 7lakesalliance.org.
Klondike Mountain, Lubec
For just a 150-foot highpoint, diminutive Klondike Mountain packs a big punch when it comes to views. The mountain is the centerpiece of the 46-acre Klondike Mountain Preserve, which is owned and managed by the Downeast Coastal Conservancy. The Klondike Mountain Trail, a 0.6-mile loop, leads through old cow pastures and apple orchards to the summit outcrops, where there’s a lovely look out over South Bay and Fowler’s Mill Pond. Find DCC’s complete Trail Map & Guide at downeastcoastalconservancy.org.
Flying Mountain, Acadia National Park
Head for the west side of Mount Desert Island to visit Flying Mountain (284 feet), where a 1.4-mile loop leads to wonderful views of Somes Sound, Southwest Harbor and the islands to the south. Hike the circuit counterclockwise, taking the Valley Cove Fire Road to the namesake cove for a look at Eagle Cliff – at 500 feet, it’s the island’s highest – and to Acadia Mountain north along the sound. Scamper up the peak to several lookouts on the summit ridge, the best being the signed “overlook” that’s reached by a short side trail. Find park info at nps.gov/acad.
Mount Battie, Camden
From the trailhead on Megunticook Street in Camden, the Mount Battie Trail climbs steeply up the rocky nose of Mount Battie for 0.6 miles to open ledges on the south side of the 790-foot peak. On top is an attractive 26-foot stone observation tower, a World War I memorial constructed a year after the old hotel on the same site was torn down in 1920. From Mount Megunticook to Camden Harbor and Penobscot Bay to Ragged Mountain, the panorama from this special spot is simply astounding. Get a trail map for Camden Hills State Park at parksandlands.com.
Ring Hill, Greenwood
Mahoosuc Land Trust maintains a sweet system of color-coded trails on Ring Hill in Greenwood at Maggie’s Nature Park, 86 acres of land donated to the town by Maggie Ring, a lifelong resident and ardent conservationist. Ring Hill Loop Trail (1.1 miles) is the primary route on the mountainside, which features good views northeasterly over South Pond to Bucks Ledge, Latham Ledge, Moody Mountain and North Pond. Tack on a short side trip to nearby Peaked Mountain for a little extra effort. Check out this and other MLT trails at mahoosuc.org.
Mount Agamenticus, York
For big views with minimal effort, take a drive to the top of Mount Agamenticus in York (the Summit Access Road is open year-round, weather permitting), then meander around the summit area on the Big A Trail, a mile-long universally accessible nature path. En route you’ll enjoy many fine vistas, from the Gulf of Maine to Second Hill and Third Hill to Mount Washington. There are also the ski runs, lift towers, old equipment and the ski lodge (now the Learning Lodge; it’s closed until spring) from the former Big A Ski Area, plus the 1941 fire tower to check out. Visit agamenticus.org for a trail map.

Texto completo: November was the deadliest month of the pandemic for Androscoggin and Franklin counties, and Franklin County recorded more deaths per capita last month than any other county in the state, according to the Maine CDC.

If the current COVID-19 trends hold in the tri-county region, residents of Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties are likely heading toward some of the harshest months of the pandemic yet.
More people per capita died from COVID-19 in November in Franklin County than anywhere else in the state. For every 10,000 residents of Franklin County, approximately four died from COVID, according to historical data from the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention.
Across Maine, which recorded 164 deaths last month, the death rate per capita was slightly more than one per 10,000.
November was also the deadliest month of the pandemic for Androscoggin and Franklin counties, in terms of the percentage of all deaths recorded.
Last month, 22 residents of Androscoggin County died due to COVID-19 and 11 residents of Franklin County died.
This past October was previously the deadliest month of the pandemic for Franklin County.
Only one other county in Maine saw a higher case rate per capita last month than the tri-county region. Aroostook County recorded the highest number of new cases per 10,000 residents in November for the entire state.
Franklin County was not far behind, however, which recorded approximately 202 new cases per 10,000 residents over the course of the month. Oxford and Androscoggin counties ranked third and fourth, respectively.
The case rate in these four counties was nearly double what it was statewide, indicating that those areas — which are among the least vaccinated in the entire state — are regional hotspots of the surging case and deaths rates in Maine.
The majority of these cases and deaths occurred before the Thanksgiving gatherings that are most likely behind the surging rates in Maine over the past few weeks. Only halfway through December, the rate of new cases per capita in Franklin County are nearly two-thirds of what it was for all of November.
What’s more, state health officials announced Friday afternoon that five cases of the omicron variant had been detected in Penobscot County.
Studies out of the United Kingdom suggest that the omicron variant is two to three times more contagious than the delta variant. The delta variant was already considered highly contagious, twice as transmissible than the original strain of the virus, according to the U.S. CDC.
In a tweet on Friday, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah said this finding was “not unexpected, given that 40 other states have already detected it. Nor was it welcome.”
It is not yet clear if omicron causes more severe disease than delta, or if the currently available vaccines provide additional protection against it. Since the variant was first detected in the U.S. on Dec. 1, there have been outbreaks of omicron among predominantly vaccinated groups, though it appears to cause only mild symptoms in fully vaccinated individuals.
“Based on what we know about the potential for ‘immune escape,’ it’s more important than ever to get a booster,” Shah tweeted Friday. “And based on what we know about its severity (perhaps equivalent to delta), it’s more important than ever to wear a mask indoor public settings.”
The surge in cases is creating immense pressure on Maine’s health care systems.
On Thursday, 17 members of the Maine National Guard arrived at Central Maine Medical Center to assist with staffing shortages and to open a swing-bed unit to ease the patient bottleneck.
“Our workforce is exhausted and they’ve been fighting this pandemic since the very beginning and as we all know, it’s only getting worse,” Central Maine Healthcare CEO Steve Littleson said.
While a federal rapid response medical team has been sent to Maine Medical Center in Portland, CMMC is still waiting to learn if its application has been approved.
Gov. Janet Mills submitted applications for the federal teams on behalf of Maine Med and CMMC earlier this month.

DEVELOPERS BEWARE: THIS OLD RACETRACK'S SPIRITS RUN DEEP

Texto completo: To most casual observers, Beech Ridge Motor Speedway is a property in transition. Long a hub for racing enthusiasts all over southern Maine and beyond, the 55-acre site in Scarborough is being sold to developers who look beyond the oily pit area, the rubber-streaked asphalt and weather-worn grandstands and envision a sprawling new commerce center.
Not so for members of Save Beech Ridge Speedway. When they look out forlornly over their now-shuttered racetrack, they see dead people.
"There's the turn four light post on the infield," Denise Hamilton said. "There's two locations under the grandstands where specific fans sat. And there's one in the pits. There's several in the infield of the track - that's where a majority of them are."
Apparitions? Not exactly.
We're talking human ashes. Actual cremains of racers, track workers and fans so enamored with the 72-year-old speedway that they asked for and received permission to have small mounds of themselves buried there when they passed - a ticket, however symbolic, to the ear-splitting, earth-shaking action for all of eternity.
Or so they thought.
Emotions remain raw from the evening last September when track owner Andy Cusack let the air out of the end-of-season awards ceremony by announcing he was selling Beech Ridge and that almost three quarters of a century of racing there soon would come to an end.
The news came as a gut punch to generations of racing families, all of whom knew the track was struggling financially. Still, they couldn't imagine life without the place they'd long gathered on Thursday evenings and weekends to watch their local heroes circle the 1/3
-mile oval bumper-to-bumper amid the screeching of tires and the guttural roar of finely tuned engines.
Hamilton, who organized Save Beech Ridge Speedway shortly after Cusack's announcement, is one of those die-hards. She comes from a racing family and now lives adjacent to the track on Two Rod Road. Her husband, Warren Hamilton Jr., literally grew up at the track. His father, Warren "Wardie" Hamilton Sr., spent much of his life running the enterprise alongside Jim "J.B." McConnell, Wardie's father-in-law and Warren Jr.'s grandfather, who actually built the place way back in 1949 and owned it for more than two decades.
When J.B. died at age 96 in 2008, his ashes were buried out under the track scoreboard. When son-in-law Wardie died five years later, his ashes were interred right next to J.B.'s.
Then there's longtime racer and track official Cliff Wescott, whose ashes are out by the scoreboard next to Wardie and J.B. There's Leonard and Laura May, Cliff's in-laws, who worked at the track for years and had their ashes buried under the grandstand near turn one. There's longtime driver Sonny Butler, whose cremains lie under the main grandstand near turn four...
The list goes on. Hamilton, using a map of the property submitted to the town last month by a representative of the developers, has pinpointed 15 locations where ashes are known to have been buried. None of the cremains, as far as Hamilton knows, are in containers. And beyond her makeshift map, no spot is marked.
"From what we were told, it doesn't matter if there's a container or not," Hamilton said. By law, she maintains, cremains cannot be disturbed.
Track owner Cusack's family bought the place in 1981 from Calvin Reynolds, who'd bought it on a handshake from J.B. McConnell in 1973. Upon deciding last summer to pull the plug on the operation, Cusack put the property under contract with Scarborough Property LLC, an offshoot of Massachusetts-based Eastern Retail Properties.
Phone and email messages seeking more details from the company went unanswered last week, but an online listing produced by Eastern Retail Properties and obtained by the Hamiltons shows conceptual plans for what's been dubbed the Scarborough Commerce Center - a 100,000-to-700,000-square-foot facility sited smack dab on top of what is now the track, grandstands and pit area.
In an interview Friday, Cusack confirmed that he gave permission for various families to bury ashes around the racetrack over the years and remains proud that Beech Ridge meant that much to them.
"I can appreciate everybody's passion," Cusack said. "And there's really nobody more passionate about that place over the last 40 years or so that (his family) owned it than me."
That said, Cusack noted, there was never any guarantee that the track - ashes included - "will always be there forever."
Which brings us to Maine Revised Statutes Title 13, Chapter 83, Section 1371-A: "Limitations on construction and excavation near burial sites." It states that "construction or excavation may not be conducted within 25 feet of a known burial site ... whether or not the burial site...is properly recorded in the deed to the property."
The Hamiltons have hired Portland attorney Elliott Teel to see whether the planned development might run afoul of that law. Teel said he's only begun researching the issue, but "from my look at the statute they have a reasonable claim and the developer is going to need to work around them."
Maybe, maybe not. Under a subsection titled "Applications," the statute also says, "This section applies only to burial sites...containing the bodies of humans."
Underlying all of this, of course, is the grief still gripping the Hamiltons and the rest of the Beech Ridge Motor Speedway community over the loss not only of Maine's only NASCAR-sanctioned racetrack but also a way of life that drew them together for decades and now, just like that, is gone.
"Unfortunately, greed is getting the better part of this," Hamilton said, referring to track owner Cusack, with whom she's so angry that she avoids mentioning him by name. "There is a buyer or two out there who wants to come in and keep this a racetrack."
Cusack countered that he gave one such party until late October to present him with an offer, telling them "you can have a place in line if (the Scarborough Properties LLC deal) doesn't work."
"But guess what," he said. "Nobody has shown up."
It's hard to say, as the developer's plan wind its way through municipal and state regulatory processes, what will become of this tug-of-war between future and past. There's talk of some kind of memorial on the site - something Cusack said he'd readily support - acknowledging not only that people once raced here, but some still rest here.
But that won't bring the cars back. Or the fried dough. Or the blaring loudspeaker and the occasional crunch of metal on metal followed by cheers, boos and everything in between. Nor will a memorial lessen the trauma of seeing a gargantuan building atop so many places of final repose.
"If any of us knew it would not remain a racetrack, we would never have buried our loved ones' ashes there knowing they'd be dug up and hauled away," Hamilton said. "We do not want the ashes disturbed."
And if they ultimately are?
Promised Hamilton, "J.B. will come haunt them for the rest of their life."

Texto completo: Gov. Janet Mills is asking Mainers to get booster shots and mask up to protect themselves against the omicron variant now in Maine.

COVID-19 cases continued to spike in Maine, as the state reported 1,080 new cases Saturday and 11 additional deaths.
The Maine death toll now numbers 1,441 since the pandemic began.
Doctors expect Maine’s historic case surge to continue, and even pick up speed, with the more contagious omicron variant now in Maine. On Friday, Maine reported its first cases of omicron in five samples from Penobscot County following a genomic sequencing of positive test results reported to the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Statewide, the Maine CDC reported Saturday that 381 people are hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those patients, 115 are in critical care units, 68 are on ventilators.
One year ago, on Dec. 18, 2020, the state reported 191 people hospitalized with COVID-19, 46 in critical care and 17 on ventilators. At that time, Maine had a daily new case count of 590, about half of what the new case count has been in recent days.
Experts believe that the omicron variant may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has filled Maine hospitals and overwhelmed health care workers. But, they caution that while omicron may cause less severe symptoms in most people, it spreads more easily and will make some very ill, adding to the burden hospitals already face.
Getting a booster shot is key to protecting against the new variant, as well as social distancing and wearing masks in public, doctors say.
The arrival of omicron is unwelcome but not unexpected, Gov. Janet Mills said Friday. “We knew it was only a matter of time before we detected the presence of omicron here in Maine,” she said in a press release. “The takeaway for Maine people should be this: get vaccinated now and wear a mask when you’re indoors in public. Whether it’s your first shot or your third shot, getting vaccinated can protect your health, keep you from getting seriously sick, and even save your life,” Mills said.
Dr. Ashish Jha, an infectious disease expert with the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a series of tweets Friday that people should expect a “disruptive” January and to avoid holiday parties and other large gatherings. “We should expect a large wave of infections in January,” Jha tweeted.
In addition to scheduled vaccinations at Maine pharmacies, a number of booster clinics are popping up, Maine’s Dr. Shah tweeted Saturday. They include a vaccination clinic for adults and children ages 5 and up from 2-4 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 19, at the Yarmouth High School gym. Moderna, Pfizer, J & J will be available. The clinic is offered by the Yarmouth Community Coronavirus Taskforce and community pharmacies.
On Monday walk-in vaccinations will be given at a “healthy for the holidays” booster clinic at the MaineHealth office, 110 Free St., Portland, from 8:30-5. On Tuesday appointment vaccinations will be given at the same location from 8:30-5. To register, go to vaccine.mainehealth.org.
Vaccinations are also available in Sanford at the York County Vaccination Center, 1364 Main St. For more information call 207-324-1578.
On Saturday John Hopkin’s COVID-19 web page reported that in the last 28 days there have been 34,397 deaths from the virus in the United States, bringing the country’s death toll to more than 800,000.
That is significantly higher than the United States military members who died in both World War I and World War II. According to the Department of Defense, 521,915 service men and women died in both of those wars.

More awareness needed of fishermen's mental health stresses fishermen Include fishermen in policy decisions that affect them, invest in programs that support their ability to continue to work and create opportunities for them to seek mental health support.

Texto completo: Farmers and fishermen both rely on the weather to determine their schedules. One prays for rain, the other for clear skies and calm seas. Both wake up before the rooster crows and go to bed thinking about another full day of work ahead. They have similar concerns: regulations, development, finances, labor and their families.
Other parallels that can be drawn include the generational nature of the work; intrinsic family and community culture, and legacies of land, boats or buoys. Both industries are grappling with climate change: Farmers are stewards of the land; fishermen are stewards of the sea.
Both industries are historically comprised of men, and in the past decade, the median age of both has increased (around 57). While there has been increasing attention on the mental health impacts and suicide risk factors for farmers, little research is focused on the specific mental health challenges of fishermen. Because of the similarities in work factors and demographics, research on the suicide risk for farmers may inform risks for fishermen.
In the farming industry, men represent 95.9 percent of suicide deaths, with a mean age of 57 at the time of death. Caucasian males represent 97.3 percent of these deaths. Risk factors include health problems, injury and disability, loss of relationships and grief, little time for family life, economic hardships and loss of land. Similar challenges can be observed in fishing communities: long hours, unpredictable schedules based on the weather, loss of working waterfront properties and community homes, loss of fishing grounds and regulations that affect economic viability.
"The factors that contribute to suicide in the farm community are complex and compounding," says Julie Sorenson, director of the Northeast Center for Occupational Safety and Health. "Based on two decades of interactions with farmers, I would say it's a mixture of isolation, which is ever-increasing given the loss of farms, the loss of agriculture as a way of life and cultural identity and the unrelenting fears of losing the farm due to economic and regulatory pressures. Many farmers are terrified of being the one who lost the farm after generations of their forebears labored to build the business and acquire the land."
Offshore wind development, major gear changes, closures resulting in loss of fishing grounds, waterfront development and intertidal conflict all have the potential to put fishermen out of business. The health and well-being of Maine fishermen are typically an afterthought in fisheries management decisions. Unfortunately, these decisions and economic factors affect opportunities, altering the traditional landscape of Maine's coast and threatening the industry's viability.
Without the ability to fish, fishermen feel irrelevant and disconnected, much like farmers who cannot continue farming.
Of most concern is passive suicide ideation, when someone has a decreased willingness to live and, therefore, a higher likelihood of engaging in activities making life-threatening decisions (e.g., fishing in poor weather). Depression, loneliness, rejection and hopelessness are factors that lead to suicide ideation.
Fishermen live with a passive acceptance and thoughts of their death daily: Fishing is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fatality rate for fishermen from 2000 to 2017 was 114 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers, compared to four deaths per 100,000 FTE workers among all U.S. workers.
Changes in the industry, whether it's ropeless gear or industrial development in the Gulf of Maine, cannot continue to happen in a silo while disregarding the threat to the well-being of fishermen.
It is imperative that policymakers include fishermen in decisions that affect them, invest in programs that support a fisherman's ability to continue to work on the ocean and create opportunities for fishermen to seek mental health support and wellness resources that are specific to their industry. While stress in agriculture is an all-too-familiar topic, it is time for the general populace to be aware of the stress and threats to our commercial fishermen.

Texto completo: Wolfing down fried clams at a local spot under the summer sun. Driving along winding roads at the peak of fall foliage. New England is full of seasonal traditions. Including another one, fit for the holidays: the lobster trap Christmas tree, and its colorful cousin, the buoy tree.
From Rhode Island to Maine, seaside communities have taken to honoring their working waterfronts by erecting enormous trees constructed out of Styrofoam fishing buoys, lobster traps loaned for the occasion — or, more often, both.
To the uninitiated, it can be an odd sight: trees towering over the harbor, fashioned together with zip ties and wire. Others are nestled on docks, decorated with buoys hand-painted by children and artists, which will be auctioned off for fund-raising efforts.
In Gloucester, the lobster trap tree has been a part of the Christmas landscape for 20 years.
It was downtown shopkeeper Janice Lufkin Shea who formulated the idea for the tree in 2001. She wanted to liven up Main Street for the holidays and thought a tree that celebrated part of what makes Gloucester unique was a perfect way to do it. With help from friends and volunteers, the vision became reality, and it was later taken over by the founder of Cape Ann Art Haven, who endeavored to make it “a little bigger for the community," said Traci Corbett, the executive director of the nonprofit art organization.
The tree has grown to include nearly 300 traps and close to 700 buoys featuring vibrant collections of rainbows, snowflakes, and Minions designed by local schoolchildren.
Shawn Henry, who has helped build the tree since 2013, said that for a city populated by generations of fishermen — and Henry counts all three of his brothers-in-law among them — the arrival of the tree marks the moment “the season is here, and it's Christmastime in Gloucester."
While Gloucester popularized the tree, the tradition may date back many years earlier. Lobstermen, many of whom keep their traps on their property throughout the year, have long constructed miniature trees out of them on their lawns as the holidays got underway, said David Gogel, the executive director of Rockland Main Street, the nonprofit that organizes the lobster trap build in the self-proclaimed “Lobster Capital of the World."
In Rockland, Maine, the first large trap tree was created in 2003 as a means of championing the city and its role in the industry, Gogel said. This year it's made up of 152 red and green traps, about 480 feet of garland, and over 150 buoys donated by lobstering families.
Over the years, Gloucester and Rockland have sparred over which one started the tradition and who has erected the superior trees, even attracting national attention for the only-in-New-England fight. “I think the rivalry exists with Gloucester, and this idea of who inspired who," Gogel said. “If you talk to old-timers who have been building this tree since day one, they would tell you that Rockland was the first."
More recently, at least a dozen other trees have popped up along the New England coastline. This year you can find the bright displays in places like Padanaram, Mass. (a section of South Dartmouth), Stonington, Conn., and Kittery Point, Maine.
Lisa Konicki, the president of the Ocean Community Chamber of Commerce in Westerly, R.I., said she first saw the tree in Gloucester in January 2019 and was “so impressed," adding that the organization has credited the city as a source of influence for its own this year in Stonington, Conn., which features “mostly the works of professional artists."
Often this time of year, Rockland fields calls from communities across the region about construction methods and patterns used, a secret sauce the city is “happy to provide," Gogel said. He noted even the supplier for its traps has seen an increase in requests specifically for trees.
And while Gloucester and Rockland may lay claim to being the first — all in good fun, they insist — both would agree: The celebration of lobster trap and buoy trees to ring in the holidays has cemented itself as a distinctly New England tradition.
“One of the things that the pandemic has shown us is that every community has its own kind of textured flavor and that informs their traditions," Gogel said. “So every community, their trap tree is gonna look different, it's gonna feel different, it's gonna represent something different. It's more about how it comes together, what it symbolizes for the community, and how they make it uniquely their own."

Texto completo: Railroad veteran will oversee major expansion after big funding boost
Amtrak has named veteran company leader Stephen Gardner as its next chief executive.
Gardner, who has served as the passenger railroad's president for the past year, will take over the top job at Amtrak on Jan. 17. He will replace William J. Flynn, who has served as Amtrak's top executive since April 2020.
Flynn, who led the company through the coronavirus pandemic slump and recovery efforts, will remain at the company as a senior adviser to Gardner through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. The change is the latest at the railroad company as it tries to recover from a pandemic ridership dip while planning for the infusion of billions of dollars from the federal infrastructure package.
"With the Biden Administration and Congress just having made a transformational investment in intercity passenger rail, this is the right time to transition the leadership of the company for the long term to help guide Amtrak's promising future," Amtrak board Chair Tony Coscia said in announcing the transition last week. "Stephen has the business skills, industry knowledge and vision to improve and modernize service for the next generation of Amtrak's customers."
Gardner, 45, has been at Amtrak since 2009 and has served in various leadership roles, including chief operating and commercial officer. He was named president a year ago, in charge of day-to-day operations, and leads the company's effort to grow service and ridership. He will hold both the president and chief executive roles starting in January.
"I am really fortunate and very humbled to have this opportunity to work on this incredible mission that Amtrak has," Gardner said in an interview Wednesday. "We've got a lot to build."
At a House hearing this month, Gardner praised Congress's passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law, saying the allocation of $66 billion of new funding for rail will help kick-start more intercity passenger train service and improve the safety, efficiency and reliability of the nation's rail networks.
Amtrak this year put out a map and a vision for what an expanded rail network could look like by 2035. It includes 39 new routes and increased frequencies on 25 existing routes. The company estimates the expansion could mean 20 million more passengers annually using Amtrak, which had a record 32.5 million passenger trips before the pandemic hit.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a statement praised Flynn's leadership during the pandemic and welcomed Gardner as Amtrak continues its "robust recovery from the pandemic and lays the groundwork to expand and improve service" with infrastructure funding.
In March last year, when Flynn was announced as chief executive, railroad officials said they expected him to stay at Amtrak longer than his two predecessors, carrying on progress that included record-setting growth, financial milestones and service improvements. He had retired from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings on Jan. 1, 2020, after a 13-year tenure in which he served as president. Flynn will leave less than two years after taking the role, having led Amtrak through its biggest crisis.
The public health crisis derailed prospects for positive earnings last year as ridership dropped and revenue plunged 97 percent. Ridership has rebounded to about 70 percent of pre-pandemic levels. Coscia credited Flynn for prioritizing safety and advancing improvements, infrastructure projects and the company's diversity goals.
"This was one of Amtrak's most challenging periods in its 50-year history," he said in a statement. "Bill has built a strong foundation for continued safe and reliable operations, innovation and growth."
Officials at the company said Flynn's timing for stepping down was partly driven by a desire within Amtrak to install long-term leadership as it exits the pandemic emergency and enters a phase with a financial boost from the infrastructure bill.
The infrastructure funding is expected to spur the largest expansion in Amtrak's history while kick-starting repair and replacement projects across the passenger rail network. It will help address Amtrak's repair backlog, improve stations, replace old trains and create a path to modernize the Washington-to-Boston corridor, the nation's busiest area of rail traffic. It would be the biggest boost of federal aid to Amtrak since Congress created it in 1971.
Gardner, who will be one of the youngest chief executives at Amtrak, said he plans to focus on customer service, bringing passenger rail service to new cities, replacing aging rolling stock and advancing projects to address major choke points. Among those are the $4 billion replacement of the 148-year-old Baltimore & Potomac Tunnel in Maryland and an $11.6 billion plan to build new tunnels under the Hudson River, a structure more than a century old that sees about 200,000 daily passenger trips in the New York area.
"We really have a new era of investment with this bipartisan infrastructure law and that allows us to modernize our core assets and grow the network to meet the 21st-century needs of the United States," Gardner said. "It's a huge job ahead."
Before joining Amtrak, Gardner worked as a congressional staffer. Earlier in his career he held various operating and managerial positions with Guilford Rail System's Maine Central Railroad in Maine and Massachusetts and the Buckingham Branch Railroad in Virginia. A native of Arlington, Va., Gardner was an intern at Amtrak from 1993 to 1994 at Union Station.

Texto completo: COVID-19 cases continued to spike in Maine, as the state reported 1,080 new cases Saturday and 11 additional deaths.
The Maine death toll now numbers 1,441 since the pandemic began.
Doctors expect Maine’s historic case surge to continue, and even pick up speed, with the more contagious omicron variant now in Maine. On Friday, Maine reported its first cases of omicron in five samples from Penobscot County following a genomic sequencing of positive test results reported to the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Statewide, the Maine CDC reported Saturday that 381 people are hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those patients, 115 are in critical care units, 68 are on ventilators.
One year ago, on Dec. 18, 2020, the state reported 191 people hospitalized with COVID-19, 46 in critical care and 17 on ventilators. At that time, Maine had a daily new case count of 590, about half of what the new case count has been in recent days.
Experts believe that the omicron variant may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has filled Maine hospitals and overwhelmed health care workers. But, they caution that while omicron may cause less severe symptoms in most people, it spreads more easily and will make some very ill, adding to the burden hospitals already face.
Getting a booster shot is key to protecting against the new variant, as well as social distancing and wearing masks in public, doctors say.
The arrival of omicron is unwelcome but not unexpected, Gov. Janet Mills said Friday. “We knew it was only a matter of time before we detected the presence of omicron here in Maine,” she said in a press release. “The takeaway for Maine people should be this: get vaccinated now and wear a mask when you’re indoors in public. Whether it’s your first shot or your third shot, getting vaccinated can protect your health, keep you from getting seriously sick, and even save your life,” Mills said.
Dr. Ashish Jha, an infectious disease expert with the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a series of tweets Friday that people should expect a “disruptive” January and to avoid holiday parties and other large gatherings. “We should expect a large wave of infections in January,” Jha tweeted.
In addition to scheduled vaccinations at Maine pharmacies, a number of booster clinics are popping up, Maine’s Dr. Shah tweeted Saturday. They include a vaccination clinic for adults and children ages 5 and up from 2-4 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 19, at the Yarmouth High School gym. Moderna, Pfizer, J & J will be available. The clinic is offered by the Yarmouth Community Coronavirus Taskforce and community pharmacies.
On Monday walk-in vaccinations will be given at a “healthy for the holidays” booster clinic at the MaineHealth office, 110 Free St., Portland, from 8:30-5. On Tuesday appointment vaccinations will be given at the same location from 8:30-5. To register, go to vaccine.mainehealth.org.
Vaccinations are also available in Sanford at the York County Vaccination Center, 1364 Main St. For more information call 207-324-1578.
On Saturday John Hopkin’s COVID-19 web page reported that in the last 28 days there have been 34,397 deaths from the virus in the United States, bringing the country’s death toll to more than 800,000.
That is significantly higher than the United States military members who died in both World War I and World War II. According to the Department of Defense, 521,915 service men and women died in both of those wars.

Texto completo: <img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-26068236" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/08/Cal-Thomas-285x300.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="300" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/Cal-Thomas.jpg" />
Some politicians and government officials can’t let a crisis go to waste. In the matter of the tornadoes that devastated parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri, restraint was called for, but went unanswered.
Asked about the cause of such devastation, President Biden said, “We all know everything is more intense when the climate is warming.” He later walked back the comment to a “wait and see” position.
Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell also blamed climate change, saying such disasters will be the “new normal” from now on.
Neither the president nor Criswell are meteorologists, but Chris Martz is. On climatedepot.com, he writes that there has been “no overall trend in U.S. tornado activity since 1954.” He cites the National Weather Service’s (NWS) EF scale, which is used to measure the power of storms. That scale shows tornado intensity is down 50% in nearly seven decades. This tornado was a rare event.
Another meteorologist, Paul Dorian, is quoted on climatedepot.com: “Tropical cyclone activity across the Northern Hemisphere has been below-normal in 2021 in much the same way as it was last year. Specifically, while the Atlantic Basin featured above-normal tropical activity in this year and last, the Pacific Ocean experienced below-normal conditions in both years leading the way to below-normal levels across the hemisphere as a whole. In terms of tornadoes, it has been another below-normal season in the US with no EF-5’s recorded.”
Politics, not unbiased science, appears to be behind much of the faith in “climate change.” As with COVID-19, “experts” have regularly contradicted themselves and others when offering their conclusions and advice.
A 1974 story in the Lincoln (Nebraska) Journal Star blamed severe weather on “global cooling”: “Droughts, floods, blizzards, tornadoes, typhoons, and hurricanes have plagued much of the nation and the world in recent years. Most people considered these weather conditions to be abnormal and temporary, but instead, climatologists now believe the first half of the 20th century was blessed with unusually mild weather and that the global climate has begun returning to a harsher — but more normal — state. For the long run, there is mounting evidence of a worldwide cooling trend.”
Climate analyst Paul Homewood notes: “Provisional data from the NWS indicates that the tornadoes which hit Mayfield, Kentucky and Edwardsville, Illinois were both EF-3s. Although most tornadoes occur in spring and early summer, strong tornadoes are not unheard of in winter. Indeed, on average since 1950 there have been five tornadoes every winter of EF3 and greater strength. And the official data shows that these winter storms are not becoming more frequent.”
The response to those earlier “sky is falling” assertions included demands to alter our way of life if the planet was to be saved. More recently we have had ludicrous predictions by nationally-known figures (most of them associated with growing government and more state control over our lives) that the planet will cease to exist if we don’t follow the advice of politicians and “experts” about climate change.
These apocalyptic predictions about life on Earth range from weeks, to months, to a few years. I wouldn’t discount higher gas prices being used to force us to give up our cars and take public transportation.
Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg offers electric cars as alternatives to vehicles fueled by gasoline. He says once families embrace electric cars they will “never have to worry about gas prices again.” Has he noticed that electric bills usually go up, not down?
The major media don’t report how wrong “experts” have been in the past when they once predicted the opposite of what new “experts” now predict. Could there be a political agenda behind this? Do you have to ask?
The focus should be on helping people in need in the states hit by the storm. Leave the politics and questionable science for debate on another day.

The Maine Celtics have earned the No. 2 seed for the G League’s Showcase Cup tournament that starts Sunday in Las Vegas.
Maine will play the seventh-seeded Motor City Cruise at 11:30 p.m. Sunday in the first round of the eight-team tournament. The championship game is Wednesday at 5 p.m.
HOCKEY
ECHL: Anthony Nellis broke a 1-1 tie midway through the second period and Olivier Archambault scored twice for the Trois-Rivières Lions in a 5-2 win over the Maine Mariners at Trois-Rivières, Quebec.
Maine’s Andrew Romano opened the scoring with a power-play goal early in the second period, but Archambault tied it less than three minutes later. Goals by Nellis and Alexis D’aoust made it 3-1 after two periods. Archambault and Peter Abbandonato each added a goal early in the third.
Conner Bleackley scored a power-play goal for the Mariners with nine seconds left.
HIGH SCHOOLS
BOYS’ HOCKEY: Aidan Hartwell scored with 4:42 remaining to lift Windham/Westbrook/Bonny Eagle/Sacopee Valley (2-0) to a 2-1 win over Marshwood/Traip/Sanford/Noble (1-2) in Dover, New Hampshire.
Bobby Fothergill and Lucas LaForest assisted on Hartwell’s goal. Fothergill also scored in the first period, and Porter Krause made 29 saves for the Trail Blazers.
The Nighthawks tied the game early in the third on a goal by Braden Butler, assisted by Colby Davis. Summer Wood finished with 25 saves.
GIRLS’ BASKETBALL: Kelsie Carlton had 15 points and eight steals to lead Brunswick (2-0) to an 80-33 win over Morse (2-1) in Brunswick.
Logan Brown added 12 points and six assists, Morgan Foster had 11 points and four steals, and Kyra Fortier scored 10 points.
Haley Kirkpatrick scored 11 points and Laney Brewer had 10 for Morse.
• Bella McLaughlin scored 17 points to lead Hampden Academy (3-0) to a 55-30 win over Portland (0-3) at the Expo.
McLaughlin got 10 points in the first half, helping the Broncos build a 34-12 lead.
Eliza Stein led Portland with seven points.
SOCCER
ENGLAND: The Premier League’s pandemic-affected schedule took a further hit on Saturday when a COVID-19 outbreak in Aston Villa’s squad sparked the postponement of its match against Burnley, reducing the number of fixtures this weekend to four.
There was only one game on Saturday – Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Leeds. That was played despite Arsenal Manager Mikel Arteta saying there had been more coronavirus cases among the club’s players and staff.
SPAIN: Seventeen-year-old Gavi Paez scored one goal and set up the 85th-minute winner by Nico Gonzalez as Barcelona earned a 3-2 win over Elche 3-2 in the Spanish league.
Barcelona’s first win in four games across all competitions moved it to seventh place, still a distant 15 points from leader Real Madrid.
GERMANY: Marco Richter scored twice for Hertha Berlin in a 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund, which fell to nine points behind Bayern Munich going into the Bundesliga’s winter break.
FRANCE: Down to eight men after two players received two yellow cards and another got a red card, second-division side Nancy reached the last 32 of the French Cup by beating Ligue 1 team Troyes 4-2 in a penalty shootout after they finished regulation in a 1-1 tie.
SKIING
WORLD CUP: Bryce Bennett added to a long list of American success in Val Gardena, Italy, by winning the first classic downhill of the season.
The 6-foot-7 Californian joined Steven Nyman (three downhill victories) and Bode Miller (one super-G victory) as American winners at the resort in the Dolomites.
For his first career victory, Bennett finished 0.14 seconds ahead of Otmar Striedinger of Austria and 0.32 ahead of Niels Hintermann of Switzerland amid perfect conditions.
• Olympic champion Sofia Goggia and American rival Breezy Johnson finished 1-2 in a women’s downhill for the third time this season, at Val d’Isere, France.
Goggia stretched her unbeaten run in the discipline to a year, having won all seven downhills she has competed in since Dec. 18, 2020. The Italian missed the final two races of last season because of a knee injury.
Goggia beat Johnson by .27 seconds, with Austria’s Mirjam Puchner .91 behind in third.
The result sent Goggia past Mikaela Shiffrin to the top of the overall standings, leading the American three-time champion by 10 points.
Shiffrin sat out the race but is scheduled to compete in a super-G on the same hill Sunday.

LEWISTON — Edward Little junior Andrew Casares broke another Red Eddies swimming record Saturday as the Edward Little/Leavitt co-op beat Mt. Ararat in a meet at the YWCA.
Casares set a new program record in the 200-yard individual medley, finishing in a time of 2:07.16 to break Shawn Bazinet’s 1989 record by more than a minute. Bazinet was on hand at the meet to watch Casares and the team compete, and to collect his Edward Little record board piece for the 100-yard butterfly, a record which Casares broke earlier this season.
Edward Little/Leavitt also set a new program record in the 200-yard freestyle relay, which Casares was a part of. Isaac Raymond, Gavin Holbrook and Chase Leonardo swam the other legs to help the relay team finish in 1:40.50, breaking a record set in 1998.
The Edward Little/Leavitt girls also beat Mt. Ararat in the team competition, with Mya Vincent, Jalee Boucher and Kora Martel each winning individual events.

SPRUCE MOUNTAIN 47, WINTHROP 44, OT: Olivia Mastine scored a game-high 22 points and the Phoenix (2-0) overcame a slow start to rally and take down the Ramblers (1-1) in Jay.

BOYS BASKETBALL
CARRABEC 53, OAK HILL 49: Luke Carey poured in a game-high 28 points to lift the Cobras (3-1) past the Raiders (2-2) in Wales.
Daniel Handley added 13 points for Carrabec, which was behind by six after one quarter before rallying and taking an eight-point lead into the fourth quarter.
Caden Thompson led a balanced Oak Hill attack with 12 points, while D’Andre Daniels added 10.
MEN’S BASKETBALL
UMAINE 86, UNE 50: Ja’Shonte Wright-McLeish scored a career-high 15 points, Vukasin Masic added 11 points and 10 assists, and the University of Maine cruised to an 86-50 men’s basketball win in Orono on Saturday against the University of New England.
The victory snapped a four-game losing streak for the Black Bears (3-6), whose three wins have come against in-state opponents – UMaine-Farmington, UMaine-Fort Kent and UNE.
UNE (1-9) was led by Alex Kravchuk with 17 points and Drake Gavin with 12.

Texto completo: Finding high school ski competition schedules isn’t easy, but the season is up and running.
By going to the Maine Principals’ Association website I was able to find the dates and locations of the state championships, but unlike team sports there is no list of regular meets. For those, you will have to check with your local school, or you could call your local ski area to see if they are hosting any racing.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2733424" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Dave-Irons-sig-2006.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="193" data-full-size="" />
The Class A Alpine state championships are scheduled for Black Mountain in Rumford on Feb. 17 and 18. Those same days, the Class B Alpine championships will be at Saddleback.
The Class A, B and C Nordic state championships are at Black Mountain on Feb. 23 and 24.
Without listings for competitions, it’s not easy to support high school skiing. Team sports taking place in stadiums and gymnasiums are easy. Just go to the gym and cheer on your team.
Skiing isn’t as easy. Not only do events take place outside, but often getting to the finish requires some hiking.
There are a few places where Alpine race finishes are near the base lodge and some where you can actually watch a good part of the race from inside. This is true for races run on Bull Moose under the chair at Lost Valley. Also, Mt Abram has racing on Boris which can be seen from the bottom.
Cross country races usually finish near the lodge, so it doesn’t take a lot of hiking to see the finish, but it does require warm dress.
HIGH PRICE
Of course, skiing requires equipment typically furnished by the competitor, and as every parent who ever outfitted a skier for competition knows, this can be expensive. All the pads on a football player or a hockey player are furnished by the school and can run hundreds of dollars per player.
I have to admit that I am not as up on equipment costs for Nordic as I am for Alpine. I know that a top of the line race boot for GS and slalom can run up to $800, and to be truly competitive a skier needs skis for both events, which with bindings can exceed $1,000 each.
Fortunately, Leon Akers helped out with Nordic pricing by sending this year’s catalog. Unfortunately, the 2021-2022 winter catalog will be Akers’ last.
After 62 years, this shop in Andover, Maine, which has supplied a full line of cross country equipment for skiers, teams and schools all over the country, will no longer supply a printed catalog. The costs of printing and mailing have risen to the point where it makes more sense to post everything online. Akers’ store is still open and carries a full line of Nordic equipment, and they will be mailing occasional flyers to those on their mailing list. Everything can be found at www.akers-ski.com.
Obviously, we can’t replicate an entire catalog in this space, but from perusing the catalog it’s apparent that outfitting a Nordic skier is less expensive than Alpine.
Traditional XC skiers will notice the difference in boots. Instead of outfitting for the classic, straight-ahead style of XC competition, skating has added another dimension. The softer boots used for the classic, straight-ahead stride are still fine for classic competition, but skating requires a boot with lateral stiffness.
There are a number of packages that include a Combi boot. These have a removable cuff that provides the necessary stiffness for skating but can be removed for classic striding. This added technique has made XC boots more complex, but they are sill far simpler than an Alpine race boot.
The point of all this is that high school skiers train as hard as any athletes and buy their own equipment, and for the most part, they compete with no one watching except a few coaches and teammates.
For a few years, when Mt. Abram reserved Friday nights for high school racing and turned on the lights, we could count on a bunch of parents to be on hand. They would gather around the finish area and cheer as their children and teammates finished.
It was an ideal setup. The entire course was visible from the base area, and it was only a short walk to get inside and warm up. With most high school racing taking place during the day midweek, it’s difficult for parents to be spectators at times when most are working.
To see if there might be a source of information on high school racing, I talked with former Edward Little coach Dick Osgood and learned that there is a website. I will be looking into www.mainehighschoolskiing.com to learn more about the regular schedule of meets, but all I can offer at this point is the name of the site.
Osgood related how the school used to furnish Nordic skis for the kids, but given the changes in the sport it would be very expensive today. Just as the Alpine racer has to have both GS and slalom skis, the cross country racer would need skis for both classic and skate competition.
Mostly my research has told me that I need to do a lot more. High school skiing in Maine is busy with a bunch of schools and a lot of kids. They would like nothing better than to see crowds of spectators at every race. Go to the website and find out where and when your school will be racing.
It could make your ski season a lot more interesting. You might even see me at a race or two.
See you on the slopes.

Texto completo: The first plowable snow storm for southern Maine is expected to arrive Saturday afternoon, with the National Weather Service in Gray cautioning that driving will be difficult late Saturday into Sunday morning.
An official winter storm warning is in effect from 1 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday, but NWS meteorologist Greg Cornwall correctly forecasted that snow wouldn’t start falling in southern Maine until after 2 p.m. By 2:30 p.m. a light snow had begun.
Relatively heavy snow was expected with total accumulations between 4 and 7 inches in southern and western Maine. The National Weather Service cautions that driving could be “very difficult” because of low visibility and snow covered roads later tonight and into early Sunday morning. The forecast caused Concord Coach Lines to cancel some of its bus service in Maine and New Hampshire.
The Maine Turnpike reduced speeds to 45 miles per hour Saturday afternoon due to snow. By early evening, about 2 inches was on the ground in Cape Elizabeth, 2.7 inches northwest of Hollis and just under an inch in Shapleigh.
“We are expecting snowfall to pick up through the evening and come to a head midnight and early overnight,” said National Weather Service Meteorologist Maura Casey.
The approaching weather created a flurry of activity for many retailers.
Several tire stores, including Town Fair Tire in South Portland and Sullivan tire in Westbrook, were slammed with customers looking to have snow tires put on their vehicles. A VIP store worker in Westbrook said their phones were ringing off the hook and they couldn’t take on any more customers Saturday. They advised drivers to schedule appointments to have snow tires put on.
At Gorham Bike and Ski, sales associate Trisha Rose said the snow was good for business. “It’s been a really warm fall, so we’ve had a slow start. With snow in the forecast, we’ve seen a huge increase (in sales). We’ve sold a lot of cross-country skis today, a lot of ski packages. The snow makes people excited to get outside. It’s good energy today.”
Excitement was building at Pineland Farms in New Gloucester, too. If the storm produces 8 inches of snow, trails will open, said Matt Sabasteanski, the outdoor recreation director at Pineland.
“We do cross country skiing, snow shoeing, fat biking. We do all of it,” he said Saturday. But not yet this season. “Hopefully we will be able to open some of our trails. We love to see people out and doing something in the wintertime. Nobody likes cold without a little bit of snow to recreate in.”
The City of Portland is not declaring an official parking ban Saturday, Dec. 18, but is seeking voluntary compliance by asking residents to park off street to allow plow crews the ability to clear streets overnight and avoid an official parking ban on Sunday evening.
The Spring Street parking garage will offer its $3 snow ban parking rate overnight (in after 5 p.m., out by 8 a.m.) to help those who do wish to park off street. Anyone who does park in snow ban lots Saturday night will need to move their cars Sunday morning so crews can get those lots cleared.
The city is asking for voluntary compliance instead of a parking ban because it’s the first storm of the season and there wasn’t any snow on the ground before Saturday, said Jessica Grondin, spokesperson for the city. “If enough people comply, we may not need to call an official parking ban” Sunday night.
No official parking ban tonight, Dec 18, but we are asking for voluntary compliance with parking off street and in snow ban lots in order to allow crews the ability to clear streets and avoid an official parking ban on Sunday night.

Parking bans were announced Saturday in a number of municipalities from Sanford to Brunswick and Lewiston-Auburn.
The most uncertainty of the storm is along the southern coast of Maine and southern New Hampshire. Warmer temperatures moving in overnight may cause sleet or rain to mix which means snow in those areas could be wet and heavy. Interior Maine and higher elevations should receive lighter, fluffier snow, according to the National Weather Service.
Saturday’s snow is late for a typical winter season, Cornwall said. “We are behind the usual bell curve. For the season we are 8 inches below normal.” A year ago there was 19 inches of snow on the ground at this time. “That’s a pretty big difference.”
But within a week of that storm rain came and washed the snow away, giving much of Maine a brown Christmas.
There’s a better chance for a white Christmas this year, Cornwall said. “Temperatures are supposed to be fairly cold for the remainder of the week, so a lot of the snow should be able to stick around especially inland away from the coast.”
Another system could bring flurries to the mountains and foothills Sunday night, Cornwall said. “And there’s the potential for snow showers Wednesday into Thursday.”
Maine has been warm so far this winter. Typically December’s highs and lows are in the 20s overnight and 30s to low 40s during the day. “On Friday it got to 53 for a high, on Sunday (Dec. 12) it got to 57,” Cornwall said.

The pandemic getting worse in central and western Maine

If the current COVID-19 trends hold in the tri-county region, residents of Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties are likely heading toward some of the harshest months of the pandemic yet.
More people per capita died from COVID-19 in November in Franklin County than anywhere else in the state. For every 10,000 residents of Franklin County, approximately four died from COVID, according to historical data from the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention.
Across Maine, which recorded 164 deaths last month, the death rate per capita was slightly more than one per 10,000.
November was also the deadliest month of the pandemic for Androscoggin and Franklin counties, in terms of the percentage of all deaths recorded.
Last month, 22 residents of Androscoggin County died due to COVID-19 and 11 residents of Franklin County died.
This past October was previously the deadliest month of the pandemic for Franklin County.
Only one other county in Maine saw a higher case rate per capita last month than the tri-county region. Aroostook County recorded the highest number of new cases per 10,000 residents in November for the entire state.
Franklin County was not far behind, however, which recorded approximately 202 new cases per 10,000 residents over the course of the month. Oxford and Androscoggin counties ranked third and fourth, respectively.
The case rate in these four counties was nearly double what it was statewide, indicating that those areas — which are among the least vaccinated in the entire state — are regional hotspots of the surging case and deaths rates in Maine.
The majority of these cases and deaths occurred before the Thanksgiving gatherings that are most likely behind the surging rates in Maine over the past few weeks. Only halfway through December, the rate of new cases per capita in Franklin County are nearly two-thirds of what it was for all of November.
What’s more, state health officials announced Friday afternoon that five cases of the omicron variant had been detected in Penobscot County.
Studies out of the United Kingdom suggest that the omicron variant is two to three times more contagious than the delta variant. The delta variant was already considered highly contagious, twice as transmissible than the original strain of the virus, according to the U.S. CDC.
In a tweet on Friday, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah said this finding was “not unexpected, given that 40 other states have already detected it. Nor was it welcome.”
It is not yet clear if omicron causes more severe disease than delta, or if the currently available vaccines provide additional protection against it. Since the variant was first detected in the U.S. on Dec. 1, there have been outbreaks of omicron among predominantly vaccinated groups, though it appears to cause only mild symptoms in fully vaccinated individuals.
“Based on what we know about the potential for ‘immune escape,’ it’s more important than ever to get a booster,” Shah tweeted Friday. “And based on what we know about its severity (perhaps equivalent to delta), it’s more important than ever to wear a mask indoor public settings.”
The surge in cases is creating immense pressure on Maine’s health care systems.
On Thursday, 17 members of the Maine National Guard arrived at Central Maine Medical Center to assist with staffing shortages and to open a swing-bed unit to ease the patient bottleneck.
“Our workforce is exhausted and they’ve been fighting this pandemic since the very beginning and as we all know, it’s only getting worse,” Central Maine Healthcare CEO Steve Littleson said.
While a federal rapid response medical team has been sent to Maine Medical Center in Portland, CMMC is still waiting to learn if its application has been approved.
Gov. Janet Mills submitted applications for the federal teams on behalf of Maine Med and CMMC earlier this month.

Oh Poutine, oh sumptuous snack. My sin, my soul. It’s pleasure like this that will have you looking over your shoulder in guilt. Did you just moan, in public? If anyone asks, point to the poutine — they’ll understand.
There’s a primal urge behind the flavors at play here: hot and greasy, sweet and salty intertwined, steaming impatiently, waiting to be ravaged, and when you’re finally left with a clean plate, it’s like an unmade bed smelling faintly of bygone passion.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-28056287" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/Joaquin-headshot-e1639856253808-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/Joaquin-headshot.jpg" />
Poutine is a mess, literally: that’s what it means in Quebecois slang. But what exactly is it? I had never tried poutine before I dined at Governor’s in Lewiston, and I was a bit hesitant; perhaps confused would be more appropriate. It wasn’t at all how I imagined it, and for better or worse, not how the average Quebecois would imagine it either.
Traditionally served with french fries, cheese curds and gravy, Governor’s eschews the norm, swapping regular fries for sweet potato waffle fries and gravy for syrup. Bits of chicken fingers lay strewn among the fries under a web of melted cheese. The maple syrup is referred to as “sauce” by Governor’s: it lacks the viscous consistency of syrup, but not to the detriment of the dish. You’re there for the heavy stuff anyway: the meat and potatoes, the tightropes of cheese between fries that snap as you pull them apart.
The sweetness is cool, but it’s essentially the cherry on top, the pièce de résistance which Governor’s has been in the business of since 1959. Governor’s Restaurant and Bakery was originally Creemee’s, an ice cream stand owned and operated by Leith and Donna Wadleigh. The current name came from Leith’s custom of calling every customer “Governor” a la Regular Show. Since then, they’ve branched out into six locations.
All the elements of the poutine work off of each other well. The fries are crispy (provided you don’t let them sit in the sauce for too long, but if that’s your thing, more power to you) and the chicken is lean. It’s very much a snack, something you can pick at and nibble on, but as fast food it fails, which perhaps may be the antithesis of the meal’s purpose.
But why would anyone want to rush through this? Since its inception in the 1950s, poutine has had a strong following in rural Quebec, popular in greasy spoon diners across the province. It’s ideal conversation food: if you’re not talking about it, you’re inhaling it absentmindedly as you discuss something way less interesting.
Poutine has since become a Canadian staple with worldwide appeal: it was served at the White House during the first state dinner hosted by President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2016. Canada doesn’t get credit for much, particularly in terms of food, eclipsed by the cuisine of its colonial progenitor and its francophone siblings, but there’s no denying the ingenious complexity of such a simple combination of flavors.
During a visit to Canada in 2017, Belgian PM Charles Michel met Trudeau for a lunch of hot dogs and poutine, ribbing him afterwards on Twitter over the superiority of Belgian french fries. Belgium is one of the many countries that claim to have created french fries.
We as Americans have the advantage of being in the the bottle neck; the center of the hourglass that is the North American continent, the colors of both our neighboring nations running and setting into the fabric of our collective tastes. Canadian influence in Maine stretches back to when Maine achieved statehood in 1820. Lewiston is home to the largest French speaking population in the country.
A truly wonderful thing about food is that it can act as a mirror, reflecting the tastes and sensibilities of an area. Governor’s poutine is Mainer poutine, through and through. The maple syrup used in the sauce is shipped from a farm in Bridgewater. The dish’s creator, Jason Clay, is Governor’s director of operations. In 2017, Clay was experimenting with what makes the dish work so well and thought of adding regional flavors, ultimately creating a “different and playful spin on the original.” They added the poutine to the menu as a limited time promotion and has since gained fervent popularity; a big reason being the portions. “Most people get it as an entree,” Clay said.
Diners like these, cultural and culinary pillars of Americana, are members of a fraternity of timeless institutions that have set the standards of American cuisine. Perhaps the beauty of diner food is that it can’t truly be pinned down: they’re niche variations of traditional meals, safe and familiar.
Comfort food is often the simplest, a mantra alive and well on the Governor’s menu.

Texto completo: Brody Haynes has played well against the Boston Jr. Bruins this season.
Saturday was no different.
The Twin City Thunder goalie made 33 saves in a 3-2 victory in a USPHL National Collegiate Development Conference game at Norway Savings Bank Arena.
“We beat them in a shootout earlier in the year (with Haynes in net), and he had a really strong performance in the first game of the year in a 2-0 game that we lost,” Twin City Thunder coach Dan Hodge said.
Ethan Lim put the Thunder (13-11-1, 27 points) up 80 seconds into the game for his first goal of the year.
Twin City took the 1-0 lead into the intermission, but 66 seconds into the second period Grady Friedman tied the game at 1-1 for the Jr. Bruins (13-10-4, 30 points).
Friedman, the son of former Twin City Thunder coach Doug Friedman, just joined the Jr. Bruins this week from the Springfield Jr. Blues of the NAHL.
Steven Armstrong put the Thunder back on top at the two-minute mark of the middle frame with an unassisted marker.
“They scored, and we came right back. Armstrong, a great game by him,” Hodge said. “He took the (defenseman) wide and went to the net and literally just got a backhander on the net, and it squeaked through the goalie.”
Dom Chasse scored his seventh goal of the season in the middle of the second period to extend the Thunder lead to 3-1.
Henry Wilson scored in the third period for Boston.
Colin Winn stopped 25 shots in the loss.
The Thunder are on a holiday break and don’t return to action until Jan. 8 against the Boston Advantage on the road.
“We are two games above .500, and I believe we are in (third) place in the (North) Division now,” Hodge said. “We have a lot of work to do, but I think being in a playoff spot right now is a good way to end the (first half). We are 4-2 in the past six games. Things are coming together. We are learning when we play in the system, we do well. We learn when we don’t play in the system.”

If the New England Patriots win their last four games of the regular season, none of the rest of the games matter. If they run the table, they’d be 13-4 and the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC.
UP NEXT
WHO: Buffalo Bills at New England Patriots
WHEN: 1 p.m. Dec. 26
TELEVISION: CBS
But since it is hard to win four straight games, Patriots fans are rooting for a little cushion – results that help earn the AFC East title, whatever the highest seed possible, and until they’ve clinched a playoff berth, a spot in the field.
The Los Angeles Chargers nearly gave New England some help Thursday, before too many mistakes allowed the Chiefs to rally to an overtime win and a 10-4 record.
The Patriots (9-4) needed to beat Indy on Saturday night to keep pace.
Four division winners (seeds 1-4) and three wild-card teams (seeds 5-7) make the playoffs in each conference, with only the top seed getting a first-round bye.
Here are this weekend’s key games (teams listed by their current playoff rank), and who the Patriots will be rooting for:
Sunday
No. 12 (NFC) Carolina (5-8) at No. 7 Buffalo (7-6), 1 p.m.: Cam Newton was a popular teammate as a Patriot and his former teammates have been rooting for him anyway. They’ll really be doing so Sunday. A Bills loss would not only fortify New England’s hold on the AFC East, but would knock Buffalo to the wrong side of the playoff bubble.
No. 14 N.Y. Jets (3-10) at No. 13 Miami (6-7), 1 p.m.: This game is only on this list because the Dolphins already have a win over the Patriots and play them again. New England would be happy to get Miami out of the playoff picture.
No. 2 Tennessee (9-4) at No. 11 Pittsburgh (6-6-1), 1 p.m.: The Patriots are rooting against the Titans almost as vehemently as they are the Bills.
No. 9 Cincinnati (7-6) at No. 10 Denver (7-6), 4:05 p.m.: A Bengals win and a Ravens loss would leave Cincinnati in first place in the AFC North. A Denver win could vault the Broncos into solid wild-card position.
No. 2 (NFC) Green Bay (10-3) at No. 4 Baltimore (8-5), 4:25 p.m.: Obviously, root for the NFC team over the AFC contender in all scenarios. The Ravens are wobbly. The Patriots would be happy to see the Packers push them further down.
Monday
No. 12 Las Vegas (6-7) at No. 8 Cleveland (7-6), 4:30 p.m.: This game has been moved to Monday. The Browns could be leading the AFC North by the end of the weekend if they win and the Ravens and Bengals lose, but COVID has left Cleveland a mess. The Raiders desperately need this to have any chance to stay in the playoff race. The Patriots are probably rooting for the Raiders, as the Browns, when healthier, are more dangerous.

Bob Neal: The Countryman: Can the Supreme Court save us? Or itself?

John Roberts, chief justice of the United States, has one of the toughest jobs in a tough town, Washington.
He may believe he can save the court from itself. I’m not so sure.
You might argue that he is trying to close the barn door after the horse has fled. The Gallup Poll shows public support for the Supreme Court hit a historic low, 40%, this fall, well below the 50-55% support the court has held over the past decade or so.
In the wake of that poll, two justices, one right and one left, insisted that the court is not political. The newest justice, Amy Coney Barrett, said “This Court is not comprised of (sic) a bunch of partisan hacks.”
She spoke at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville, named for U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. Talk about partisan hacks.
Justice Stephen Breyer, who has been on the court for 27 years, wrote that “It is a judge’s sworn duty to be impartial, and all of us take that oath seriously.”
Why would two justices rush to reassure us that they are right down the middle? When by all appearances they are not. There may be fire behind all that smoke.
I came to the study of the court in the jurisprudence class at the University of Missouri — Kansas City. I came away firmly persuaded that the court’s duty is to be the final arbiter of our democracy, our stalwart protector from forces trying to undermine our democracy.
My faith has been shaken, severely, in the 52 years since. The conservative part of me questioned Roe vs. Wade, the 7-2 decision in 1973 that states cannot restrict access to abortion. The conclusion didn’t bother me so much as the reasoning that the Constitution implies a right to privacy. I value privacy highly but I can’t find it in the Constitution.
I recall that (now late) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she regretted the Roe decision because the issue is a matter of gender equality, not privacy. Besides, the decision turned everything around so fast that it gave lots of motivation to opponents of abortion access. Their drive will likely succeed when the court overturns Roe vs. Wade next summer. Prediction: Chief Roberts will vote with the three liberals to uphold the essence of Roe.
The liberal side of me questioned the court’s neutrality when it handed down its decision in Bush vs. Gore, taking the presidency from the man who had won the national popular vote. The court halted the recount of Florida’s ballots in the 2000 election. That meant the original count stood, and Bush had won Florida by less than a hair.
The court was not required, as retired Justice Sandra Day O’Connor noted later, to review the case. O’Connor sided with the majority and thereby may have dimmed the star that conservatives and liberals alike saw shining in her.
“Maybe the court should have said, ‘We’re not going to take it, goodbye,'” O’Connor told the Chicago Tribune in 2013. “It turned out the election authorities in Florida hadn’t done a real good job there and kind of messed it up. And probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day.” Ah, the wisdom of hindsight.
Then, last week, the court further eroded whatever respect I still held for it when it refused to rule on the constitutionality of SB 8, the Texas law banning abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. Worse, it legalizes vigilante justice by authorizing anyone to sue anyone who in any way contributed to an abortion, such as driving a patient to a clinic.
Even nine justices who don’t have to live in the real world should have been able to see where that sort of vigilante justice might lead. Were they not in Washington on Jan. 6?
The Roberts court had already shown its out-of-touchedness in 2013 when it overturned parts of the Voting Rights Act, saying Congress should update the law. Anyone who can count knows Congress is not going to update anything, whether Republicans control the Senate by two votes or Democrats control it by one. So, calling on Congress to modernize voting rights just tells millions of Americans, notably Blacks in the south and Hispanics in the southwest, that they don’t have the same voting rights as the rest of us.
Then this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a law allowing Californians to sue anyone who provides arms restricted by California law. “If that’s the precedent, then we’ll let Californians sue those who put ghost guns and assault weapons on our streets. If Texas can ban abortion and endanger lives, California can ban deadly weapons of war and save lives.” he said. The SB 8 decision may have opened Pandora’s box.
Roberts still sits nearer the middle than any of the other five Republican-named justices. He voted in 2012 to uphold the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), siding with the four liberals, and he voted last week to overturn SB 8. He wrote: “Texas has employed an array of stratagems designed to shield its unconstitutional law from judicial review.”
But his vote is no longer pivotal. Five justices, not four, are more conservative than he is.
Bob Neal wonders how Sen. Susan Collins might look with egg on her face, should Justice Kavanaugh — who, she said, assured her Roe was “settled law” — vote to end Roe. Neal can be reached at turkeyfarm@myfairpoint.net.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — The Maine Nordiques limped into Saturday’s game against the New Jersey Titans.
The Titans completed the weekend sweep with a 5-2 win at The Colisee in a North American Hockey League East Division game.
“We started the game a little light, we had some injuries ongoing and some recent ones last night,” Nordiques head coach Matt Pinchevsky said. “I think guys had it in their minds that whatever we sustained, it wouldn’t last, but we want to work on that mentality, ‘whatever it takes.’ If there’s going to be some hardship in the game, we want to embrace it and overtake it.”
Forward Aidan Connolly has been out with a shoulder injury since Oct. 22. Forward Patrick Schmiedlin, who played Friday night, wasn’t in the lineup Saturday.
Brendan Dumas had two goals to lead the Titans.
Coleman Nee stood in the slot and redirected the puck from a Marcus Sang pass into the goal to give the Titans a 1-0 lead 3:07 into the game.
“Obviously, you always want to get off to a good start,” Titans coach Craig Doremus said. “The momentum and positive shifts built a lot of confidence on the bench and a lot of positive energy. It’s something we have talked about and we were able to find the back of the net early.”
The Titans went up 2-0 just 36 seconds later when Ryan Coughlin scored his seventh goal of the season. Defenseman Tyler Sanborn had the assist.
“Given the numbers and bodies, I told them I wasn’t going to call a timeout,” Pinchevsky said. “We had to sort our way through it, and we had a couple of breakdowns in (the defensive) zone. It wasn’t so much on entry.”
New Jersey forward Jack Karlsson flipped the puck over a Nordiques defenseman’s head in the neutral zone and Nick Ring chased the puck down in the Titans’ offensive zone to score on a partial breakaway. The goal came with 6:11 remaining in the first period.
Brendan Dumas’ shot trickled past Maine goalie Avery Sturtz for a 4-0 lead with under two minutes remaining in the first period.
Sturtz was pulled after the first period, stopping 14 shots. Gus Holt made 28 saves on 29 shots in relief.
Zach Whitehead put the Nordiques’ on the board with a shorthanded breakaway goal with three minutes remaining in the second period.
“He’s automatic on breakaways,” Pinchevsky said of Whitehead.
Dumas jammed home the puck for his second goal at the 5:31 mark of the third period. Tommy Bannister had the assist.
Doremus was pleased with how the players played before the holiday break.
“We struggled a bit going into our Thanksgiving break,” Doremus said. “We talked as a group; we didn’t want to let our foot off the gas. We wanted to stay hungry and focused here.”
Maine Nordiques forward Tristan Fasig scored a late power-play goal.
Andrew Takacs made 28 saves in the win.
The Maine Nordiques are back in action Dec. 31-Jan. 1 at The Colisee against the Danbury Jr. Hat Tricks. Faceoff is at 7 p.m. both nights.

Texto completo: For some people, sleep is just something you do to recharge and keep life on an even keel. For others, sleep is divine, one of the creature evolutions that bring sheer pleasure. I belong to the latter category. For me, a good, well-crafted mattress and a night of extended REM sleep is a special gift.

But I have never had one good night’s sleep during more than 25 years of elk hunting in the Colorado Rockies.
This fall was no different. Bedded down among the aspens in my one-man pup tent and snuggled in my expensive L.L. Bean zero degree down mummy bag atop my high-end Therm-a Rest NeoAir Xlite Ultralight Backpacking Air Mattress, sleep would just not come.
Toss and turn. Sigh … Toss and turn. Sigh. Oh, maybe a few winks were caught during the long, cold night, but nothing that would really recharge a tired, old hunter.
So, what’s going on here? Why would I, a person who revels in sleep and is very good at it at home, go six nights sleepless in the Rockies?
In an effort to solve this sleep issue over the years, I confess to having pursued the popular solution: I threw money at it. Lots of money. In my plastic storage tubs in the garage, there are enough different brands of backpacker air mattresses to open up my own sporting goods store. Ditto, one-man mountain tents, the purchases of which followed the march of backpacking technology as manufacturers over the years make one-man tents that are lighter and lighter. (There actually is a one-man tent that is lighter than a six-pack of Bud Light.)
Advice-givers suggest that it is either my age or the altitude, or maybe both. This past trip, which is probably my last time sleeping on the ground, I gave this stubborn problem some careful thought and self-examination. Getting down into the weeds, a conclusion surfaced — an inescapable inductively-reasoned explanation for my years of Colorado sleeplessness.
A ha! The ground just isn’t a comfortable place to sleep.
A number of years ago, one of our newbie elk-hunting partners arose from his pup tent on opening day after a restless night. “Where’s the coffee pot?” he queried, with a furrowed brow.
“Ain’t no community coffee pot. Every man for himself, lad,” we insisted. “Don’t you remember? We told you that last month at the hunt briefing.”
He scuffed the ground.
By lunch time, the newbie was gone, lock, stock and barrel. He picked up his gear and walked 10 miles down the mountain to his Denver rental car, leaving behind a $400 bull elk permit and some hunt buddies with fallen jaws.
Wouldn’t you think that one of these high-tech, space-age, outdoor gear-makers could come up with an air mattress that really works? Somebody get the word to Mike Lindell, the My Pillow guy.

Articles about the vaccination and mask-wearing controversies keep on coming. Opinions are all over the map. But only Ebenezer Scrooge would deny that Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director, Nirav Shah, and his overworked staff do everything they can to monitor and prevent the spread of COVID-19. So this holiday season, spend 57 cents and the cost of a Christmas card to send those public servants a holiday "thank-you."
Don't use email: I am sure their inboxes are overflowing. Here's the   address: Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Director; Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention; 286 Water Street; State House Station 11; Augusta, Maine 04333-0011.

Letter: Susan Collins has a short sighted view of voting rights

Sen. Susan Collins apparently believes voting laws should be left up to the states. Maine has generous voting laws -- it is easy for most people to cast a ballot in our state. That's great -- but what if that's not the case in other states? Or if other states are gerrymandered so a person's vote won't really count? In a federal election for Congress and president, how can the citizens of Maine expect their vote to count if other states are rigging those systems by making it harder for people to vote?
According to the Guardian, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance recently added the U.S. to an annual list of "backsliding" democracies for the first time in its annual report. The report says: "A historic turning point came in 2020-21 when former President Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election results in the United States." The country's voting rights are being attacked.
Restrictive voting laws, dark money spending, eliminating bipartisan election boards and gerrymandered districts are threatening our democracy. The Freedom to Vote Act would set national standards to protect access to the vote, end partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, begin to overhaul the campaign finance system, and create new safeguards against subverting the electoral process.
For Collins to essentially say that voting rights should be a state issue is convenient and short sighted. I believe other states' election laws will affect whether Maine citizens' votes count in federal elections.

Texto completo: Re: "It's been a deadly year for Maine pedestrians" (Dec. 15, Page A1):
After reading the news article regarding pedestrians being killed, I've decided to say something about that. As a pedestrian, I rarely walk in the street and when I do, I face oncoming traffic, wear light-colored clothes or better reflectors.
As a driver, I have been scared out of my wits on several occasions by pedestrians wearing all black or nearly black clothing, who aren't noticed until I'm practically on top of them. And if they are walking in "my" lane, alongside traffic, that exacerbates the problem.
Making the streets safer for pedestrians is one thing, but education should be the key.
Also, put the phone away!

We're lucky to have Mills amid COVID-19 crisis
Re: "Letter to the editor: Gov. Mills' COVID strategy isn't working" (Dec. 16):
I can readily empathize with letter writer John Gold of Saco, who, because of the surge of COVID cases is, as he puts it, out of luck if he is in need of health care any time in the immediate, and possibly distant, future.
Far more seriously inconvenienced are those whose ongoing health issues have been negatively affected by the disruption of services such as the cancellation or indefinite postponement of surgeries and therapeutic treatment.
While Mr. Gold's indictment of the unvaccinated is well founded, his criticism of Gov. Mills is out of line. We should be thankful that our governor is a skilled, dedicated and competent public servant. What if the Blaine House were occupied during the pandemic by an ignorant, science-denying type such as Paul LePage (remember the "little beards" comment)? It is not hard to imagine the elevated death toll if an incompetent chief executive were actively interfering with effective public health policy. Just consider the carnage done nationally from Jan. 20, 2020, to Jan. 20, 2021.
As Mr. Gold may well ask, where did "flatten the curve" go? The curve has been replaced by a steep spike. Why? Although modern medicine produced reliable and safe vaccines with incredible speed, "you can't cure stupid," as comedian Ron White puts it.
How pathetic it would be for the species of Homo sapiens if herd immunity is reached only when the herd is thinned of those afflicted with self-inflicted mental sclerosis and self-imposed moral indifference.

COVID-19 care's cost can't be shrugged off
In his Dec. 9 letter, Dr. Joshua Cutler makes a compelling scientific argument for vaccination against the evolving coronavirus. And, of course, Gov. Mills, Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew and Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Nirav Shah have been using a number of moral and civic responsibility arguments to convince Mainers to get vaccinated.
Despite pleas and arguments such as these, though, some 30 percent of the Maine population are still not vaccinated. Might an economic argument get through to them? According to the Maine CDC, 383 Maine people are hospitalized currently with COVID-19. If we assume some 80 percent of them are unvaccinated, that translates to about 306 unvaccinated patients in hospital on a given day.
It's hard to know the daily cost of hospital care for an average COVID-19 patient because there's no such thing as an average patient. But even if we assume a conservative average daily cost per patient of $1,000 over the course of a year, the cost of care for those unvaccinated patients would be at least $111,690,000 (306 patients x $1,000 per patient per day x 365 days). Vaccinated people are hospitalized as well, of course, but if all those 306 unvaccinated had been vaccinated, the chance of any of them ending up in the hospital would be vanishingly small.
Unvaccinated Mainers need to realize their behavior will force Mainers (and themselves) to eventually pay for those avoidable hospitalization costs through tax and premium surcharges of over $110 million annually.
It's easy to pooh-pooh science, morality and civic responsibility. But money?

Texto completo: Excessive speed appeared to be a factor in the wreck Friday that injured two Madison residents, police said.

MADISON — A motorist was airlifted to a Bangor hospital and his passenger was injured in a single-car crash Friday in Madison, a sheriff’s official said.
Somerset County sheriff’s deputies were dispatched shortly after 8 a.m. to Weston Avenue, Chief Deputy Michael Mitchell said in a news release.
Vincent Thompson, 33, of Madison, was driving a 2017 Toyota Camry when the car went off the road and struck a utility pole. The car sustained significant damage.
Thompson was seriously injured and taken by ambulance to a waiting LifeFlight of Maine helicopter, which then transported him to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, Mitchell said.
Mitchell did not know Thompson’s condition.
The passenger, Sylvia Coutinho, 27, of Madison, was taken to Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan for injuries that did not appear to be life-threatening, Mitchell said. Both Thompson and Coutinho were wearing seat belts.
Excessive speed appeared to be a factor in the crash, Mitchell said. The investigation is ongoing.

Texto completo: Northern Light Inland Hospital said the two members of the Maine National Guard arrived Friday and would work in the monoclonal antibody clinic for COVID-19 patients in non-clinical roles.

WATERVILLE — Two members of the Maine National Guard arrived at Northern Light Inland Hospital on Friday morning to help in nonclinical roles under a deployment order from Gov. Janet Mills to assist hospitals as the surging COVID-19 pandemic stretches hospital staffs to the brink across the state.
The hospital said in a news release Friday evening that Terri Vieira, president of Northern Light Inland Hospital, welcomed Army Pvt. 1st Class Heather Kervin and Air Force Staff Sgt. Devin Lincoln. Kervin and Lincoln will be helping in the monoclonal antibody clinic for COVID-19 patients in nonclinical roles while working under the supervision of nursing staff, the hospital said.
Under Mills’ deployment order, Guard members may be redeployed to another site at any time if there is a higher need at another health care facility.
Kervin said that all deployed members took an online temporary nurse aid course in addition to an all-day infection prevention training held at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, according to Inland’s release. Guard members were taught how to properly use personal protective equipment, were fitted for N95 masks, and completed additional training.
Kervin and Lincoln have been instructed on how to restock supplies, escort patients to and from the monoclonal antibody clinic, disinfect, take patient vitals, and observe patients during and after their treatment.
“We are so grateful for their help,” said Courtney Cook, a registered nurse who is director of birthing and assists with the monoclonal antibody clinic. “It takes a half hour for a treatment during which a nurse administers the monoclonal antibody infusion, and then the COVID-19 patient needs to be observed for an hour after the treatment is finished.”
Inland said that having additional people trained to do observation means more patients can be treated each day.

About 45 firefighters respond to mill fire
Crews from multiple agencies battled a four-alarm fire at Irving Forest Products mill Friday evening.
Dixfield Fire Chief Scott Dennett was at the scene and said that the fire was in the rear of a production building and was contained shortly after 6 p.m., about two hours after it was reported.
"We are currently doing an overhaul in the building, looking for hot spots," he said.
About 45 firefighters from departments in Dixfield, East Dixfield, Mexico, Rumford, Peru, Andover, Wilton and Jay responded to the scene.
"All Irving employees were evacuated," Dennett said.
The first calls came in about 4 p.m. with flames reported at the sawmill at 24 Hall Hill Road. Less than an hour later, a fourth alarm was sounded and more crews were requested at the scene.
Central Maine Power was called to cut electricity to the area.

Former Gov. LePage rings Salvation Army bell
Friday afternoon, a fellow stood with his daughter in Walmart's parking lot, pointing at the man ringing a bell to raise money for The Salvation Army.
"That's Gov. Baldacci right there," the man said convincingly - and plenty loud enough for the bell ringer to chuckle in response.
For Paul LePage, a two-term former governor, it was just another day on the campaign trail, where not quite everybody knows his name.
LePage said he's been ringing the bell for The Salvation Army during the Christmas season since 1979, one way to repay the charity that helped him out as a poor child growing up in Lewiston.
LePage, a 73-year-old Edgecomb resident, is also gearing up for a long slog on the campaign trail next year as the Republican hopeful tries to unseat Gov. Janet Mills, the Democrat who succeeded him in 2018.
Most people hustling in and out of the big box store didn't so much as glance at him. Those who did notice him often gave no indication they knew who he was, as they stuffed coins and bills into a red kettle.
But when they did realize that LePage stood there, they often hailed him or promised to vote for him. Only a couple had harsh words.

Farm Service Agency director appointed
A U.S. Department of Agriculture worker with 29 years of experience in agriculture in Maine has been tapped to guide federal from policy and oversee agricultural operations in the state.
The Biden administration announced Friday that Sherry Hamel has been appointed executive director of the USDA's Maine Farm Service Agency.
"Sherry's proven track record of success at the USDA, her understanding of our heritage industries, and long history of advocating for Maine farmers makes her a perfect choice for the role," independent Sen. Angus King and Democratic Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden said in a statement.
Each state executive director works with a committee to administer FSA programs. They also assist farmers seeking loans and other financial assistance, and provide support for operating costs, emergencies, and other financial needs.
AUGUSTA
Threat prompts schools to 'lock-in'
The Augusta Public Schools closed for a "lock-in" for half an hour Friday afternoon because of a social media threat unrelated to the nationwide TikTok threats.
Superintendent James Anastasio said Friday afternoon that a student brought the threat to school administrator's attention. Anastasio could not provide additional details of what the threat said since it is an ongoing investigation.
The lock-in, meaning no one could go in or out of the building, ended at 1:15 p.m., and operations went back to normal. Parents received an automated call altering them to the lock-in.
The threat did not specify which Augusta school, so out of an abundance of caution, every school took the precaution, Anastasio said. It was made around 12:30 p.m. on social media and police are currently looking into the matter to track down the threat.
The schools already had extra police officers on-site because of the TikTok threats across the state.

Texto completo: Parking bans, wind advisories and power crews on the ready. Sound familiar?
Cities and towns across the state were bracing Friday night for what could be the season's first significant storm.
Snow is expected to begin falling in most areas of the state by Saturday afternoon. Cities and towns in southern Maine were told to expect 4-6 inches by the time the storm winds down Sunday morning.
Western parts of the state might see up to 8 inches, forecasters said, while others may get more of a "wintry mix."
To add to the fun, forecasters also reported that wind gusts could reach 55 mph, which could lead to tree limbs coming down on lines and power outages.
Police and city officials were preparing for what might be the first plowable amount of snow of the season and some cities and towns were announcing parking bans from Saturday night into Sunday.

Person associated with Basic Law Enforcement Training Program positive for COVID-19


The Maine Criminal Justice Academy in Vassalboro canceled its formal graduation ceremony Friday for the 40th Basic Law Enforcement Training Program after a person associated with the academy tested positive for COVID-19, officials said.
The positive test came Thursday night, prompting officials to cancel the in-person ceremony “out of an abundance of caution and to protect the safety of all those who planned to attend the event,” according to Shannon Moss, spokeswoman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Citing privacy concerns, Moss declined to provide additional information about the person who tested positive. She said the academy alerted all of the building staff, as well as cadets and anyone who may have had a close contact with the person, and that appropriate protocols from the agency and Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention were being followed.
There were 57 cadets graduating from the program, Moss said. A virtual ceremony is not planned instead because “the appropriate mechanisms are not in place to hold a virtual ceremony, although that is something we’re looking at for the future,” she said.
Rick Desjardins, director of the academy, said the cancellation “doesn’t in any way diminish the achievements this class has made over these 18 weeks of rigorous training and we are all very proud of their commitment to the law enforcement profession.”
The training program was described by Moss as “an intensive training made up of practical and academic training that prepares cadets for a career in law enforcement.” The program includes training on motor vehicle stops, defensive tactics, firearms training, and emergency vehicle operation and control. Cadets must also meet a rigorous physical training regimen, as they spend five days per week on campus while returning home on weekends.

Texto completo: Gov. Janet Mills is among dozens of Maine women participating in the campaign to erase the shame some may feel in being in an abusive relationship.

AUGUSTA — Posters went up Friday in the Augusta area showing the faces of Maine women victimized by domestic violence as part of a campaign to peel away the shame in speaking publicly about abuse.
The posters were placed in business windows on Water Street in Augusta and also at shops in Hallowell and Gardiner.
They show the faces of teachers, artists, college students, a doctor, nurses and a governor, too.
“Domestic abuse affects everyone,” according to a statement by Gov. Janet Mills. “Years ago, a man I loved threatened my life. Escape from violence is possible.”
A campaign called “Finding Our Voices” said in a news release that the initiative “features 40 Maine women standing proud and speaking loud, with their faces, names and experiences of abuse on huge posters and also bookmarks to erase shame and stigma for the victim and bring education and awareness to the general community.”
Patrisha McLean, who founded Finding Our Voices, is a photojournalist once involved in an abusive marriage.
“My ex was arrested for domestic violence,” said McLean, who is from Camden, and was married to “American Pie” singer-songwriter Don McLean. She divorced him in 2016, and he was charged with crimes related to domestic violence, ultimately pleading guilty and paying a $3,600 fine to dismiss the case as part of a plea agreement.
She described how the shame from the experience made her reluctant to leave her home and face people in the community. “I thought it was embarrassing,” she said.
But McLean was met with support from other women, which prompted her to start taking portraits of other survivors and opening exhibits in Camden and Augusta.
“It’s all about breaking the silence,” she said.
McLean launched the nonprofit Finding Our Voices last year. She described domestic violence as an epidemic within the COVID-19 pandemic. She said the problem has only gotten worse as people isolated in their homes.
“I think not many people realize how many women, how many people go through this,” McLean said. “The stereotype is harmful because that’s where you get shame.”
Mills earlier posed for a portrait taken by McLean at the Blaine House. McLean said she has received emails from people who had heard about Mills’ involvement and that has helped Finding Our Voices broaden its reach.
“Her coming out, not as governor but as a survivor, is huge,” McLean said.
In addition to the posters, Finding Our Voices produces bookmarks that are distributed at food pantries, bookstores, libraries, retail shops and other places. Police officers responding to domestic violence calls also hand them out.
The campaign has produced 25,000 bookmarks and intends to create 10,000 to 20,000 additional ones next year.
“We’re really upping our outreach in 2022,” McLean said. “And bringing Gov. Mills along is amazing.”

Maine reports first cases of omicron variant

Texto completo: The arrival of the fast-spreading coronavirus variant came on the same day state health officials reported 1,150 cases of COVID-19 and 25 additional deaths.

Maine reported its first cases of the more contagious omicron variant on Friday in five samples from Penobscot County following a genomic sequencing of positive test results recently reported to the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention.
The arrival of the fast-spreading coronavirus variant came on the same day state health officials reported 1,150 new cases of COVID-19, 25 deaths and a record 383 people hospitalized.
Omicron may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has fueled the fall surge, but officials say it may add to the burden hospitals are facing because it spreads more easily.
Omicron has quickly ramped up infections in countries like South Africa, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway. And COVID-19 is soaring in New York City, suspected to be fueled by exponential growth in the omicron variant. The variant has been detected in 41 states, including Maine, according to the Maine CDC. The U.S. CDC currently estimates 3% of all cases nationwide are the omicron variant, but those numbers are expected to grow quickly because the variant is so contagious.
The arrival of omicron in Maine is unwelcome but not unexpected, Gov. Janet Mills said. “We knew it was only a matter of time before we detected the presence of omicron here in Maine,” Mills said in a news release. “While we are still learning about this new variant, the takeaway for Maine people should be this: get vaccinated now and wear a mask when you’re indoors in public.
“Whether it’s your first shot or your third shot, getting vaccinated can protect your health, keep you from getting seriously sick and even save your life.”
Dr. Ashish Jha, an infectious disease expert with the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a series of tweets Friday to expect another surge in cases, a “disruptive” January, and to avoid holiday parties and other large gatherings.
“We should expect a large wave of infections, likely gathering steam in late December, peaking sometime in mid-January,” Jha said in a tweet. “And likely falling quickly to low numbers by end of February.”
Jha also tweeted that getting the booster shot is key.
“We’ll see lots of infections. Boosted folks will largely do fine. Others will get infected at high rates,” Jha said. “Unvaccinated and high-risk folks with breakthroughs will be at risk for hospitalizations.”
Preliminary studies are showing that vaccines become less effective against omicron over time and that re-infection is more possible for people who had previously been infected and remain unvaccinated. People who had previously fallen ill from COVID-19 but remain unvaccinated have a five-fold greater chance of being reinfected with omicron compared to previous variants, according to a study released in the U.K. on Friday.
Studies also indicate that booster shots provide similar protection against omicron compared to a fully vaccinated — but nonboosted — person against delta and previous variants.
“Boosters were important before. They are more important now,” Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said during a media briefing on Thursday. Maine is now administering about 10,000 shots per day — levels not seen since the spring — with about seven out of every 10 shots being boosters. Maine has given about 400,000 booster shots, representing about 30% of the state’s 1.3 million residents.
Shah said in a tweet on Friday that the science is still in the early stages on omicron.
“Judging by some publications, omicron is Schrodinger’s variant: it is simultaneously bad and not bad. Of course, it’s too early to know with certainty,” Shah said.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 135,320 cases of COVID-19, and 1,430 deaths. Maine had 383 people hospitalized for COVID-19 on Friday, a record, with 113 in intensive care and 69 on ventilators.
Of Friday’s 25 reported deaths, 19 were from a periodic review of death certificates, with those deaths occurring between Nov. 11 and Dec. 1.
There continues to be a wide disparity among counties, with high-vaccination counties such as Cumberland recording fewer cases per capita when compared to low-vaccination counties. Aroostook County had the highest seven-day total of 689 cases per 100,000 population.
Cumberland County, the most-vaccinated county in Maine, had the second-lowest virus prevalence at 349 cases over a seven-day period per 100,000 population.
Knox County has the second-highest vaccination rate in Maine — at 76% fully vaccinated, compared to 81% for Cumberland County — and the lowest per capita infection rate over the past week, with 259 cases in seven days per 100,000 population.
The disparity also is present among those who have received booster shots, although the gap is not as wide. Lincoln County led the counties with 37% of its population boosted, compared to a low of 22% in Somerset County. The statewide average was 30%.
Pop-up walk-in clinics continue to be announced in a race to get people their booster shots before the omicron wave intensifies.
The former Pier 1 at the Maine Mall is hosting a walk-in vaccination clinic operated by Northern Light Health. The hours are noon to 5 p.m. on Saturday, as well as 1-7 p.m. on Dec. 21-23. Northern Light also is hosting an appointment clinic at Northern Light Health Center, 885 Union St. in Bangor. To make an appointment, go to covid.northernlighthealth.org or call 207-204-8551.
The Westbrook Fire and Rescue Department is holding a one-day, walk-up clinic from noon to 8 p.m. on Tuesday at the Westbrook Community Center at 426 Bridge St.
Also, MaineHealth is hosting a vaccination clinic at 110 Free St. in Portland from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, the clinic is walk-in, while on Tuesday it is by appointment. To schedule an appointment, go to vaccine.mainehealth.org.

No credible threats found in schools

AUBURN — Schools ran smoothly Friday despite the outpouring of alarm from parents, students and staff following a wave of TikTok videos which warned of school violence.
Local and national law enforcement agencies investigated the threats on TikTok, which generally did not name any specific schools, and did not find evidence of a valid concern for school safety. Still, many school districts in Maine and across the country bolstered their security presence on school campuses as a precaution.
School staff say there were fewer students than normal in attendance Friday, however, besides the tense start, the school day was uneventful.
The exception was the Lewiston school district, which canceled classes districtwide Thursday night after administrators were made aware of a Snapchat video which showed a student in possession of a gun threatening another student from Lewiston Middle School. Police visited a student at his home, where a firearm matching the description of the one in the video was found, Superintendent Jake Langlais wrote in an email Friday.
The school was not able to definitively identify the suspected student as the one who sent the message because Snapchat videos disappear. All students connected to the incident have been suspended, and Langlais asks that any students with information come forward.
He additionally shared that school administrators worked with law enforcement to investigate three additional social media posts and images since Thursday night, but did not find any to be a credible threat.
The Auburn school district and police worked from Thursday night into early Friday morning to track down a threatening social media message unrelated to TikTok. The threat, which was directed at Edward Little High School in Auburn, was not found to be credible, and schools were open Friday.
Edward Little Principal Scott Annear said the high school was missing about a third of its students, however classes continued as scheduled. The Auburn chief of police, the school resource officer, the superintendent, and extra police officers were all present on Edward Little’s campus Friday morning, and the school addressed concerns of school violence during the morning announcements.
Annear said it was an exhausting 24 hours, from receiving word of the TikTok threats Thursday morning to dealing with the Snapchat message superimposed with a gun Thursday night into Friday morning. Many parents called him and the front office looking for assurance and more information on the discredited threats.
Oak Hill Middle School Principal Ben Wilson said school was “sedate” on Friday and estimates that 85% of students were in attendance. Only a couple of students left during the school day.
Wilson said this is the first time he has seen this level of concern in Maine schools since he became an educator 20 years ago, and a school administrator 10 years ago. Never before has he experienced several nearby districts, as well as his own school, receive multiple threats in a short time.
The superintendent of Regional School Unit 4 — which serves Litchfield, Sabattus and Wales — closed all schools Dec. 10 due to concerns of school violence directed toward Oak Hill Middle School in Sabattus. Wilson said he has been receiving calls from concerned parents all week, but said there were a few more Thursday night and Friday morning in response to the discredited threats shared over TikTok.
He is concerned by the lost education time, but said that safety is his, and other school administrators’, No. 1 priority when potential threats surface.
Principal Cari Medd of Poland Regional High School shared Wilson’s concerns. She also confirmed that the school day was uneventful.
It is “so discouraging, students have so many things on their (mind), teachers too,” she said, adding that the entire school community is feeling exhausted. Medd said she was discouraged by what she has seen posted to social media this fall, from videos encouraging students to slap teachers and vandalize school property, to the threats shared this week.
“It would be nice to get to Christmas break with a couple of very quiet days,” she said.

Texto completo: Northern Light Health announced this week that Terri Vieira will step down as president of Northern Light Inland Hospital and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital.
Subheader

The president of the Northern Light Health hospitals in Waterville and Pittsfield has announced her retirement and will step aside in April, the health system said this week.
Terri Vieira leads both Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital in Pittsfield. She also oversees Lakewood Continuing Care in Waterville.
Vieira said Friday that she’s proud of the work she’s done to help the employees and students she’s worked with in the region to reach their potential.
“If they have dreams and visions, I like to help them get those,” Vieira said of hospital staff. “Because when they get those, we benefit, too.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it unprecedented challenges, but she noted that some good can come from such struggle. She said she is “retiring in spite of COVID.”
“With COVID, you go back to the basics. If you take care of the people that are caring for patients, you take care of patients; you keep them in the forefront, you make good decisions that way,” Vieira said.
A challenging part of Vieira’s career was learning leadership skills early on and developing a balancing act between “taking care of today but always keeping tomorrow in mind.”
Vieira took over operations of the Pittsfield hospital in 2013 and then took on additional duties in Waterville last year.
She will step down from those roles April 1.
Northern Light Health President and Chief Executive Officer Tim Dentry said in a news release that Vieira is a voice of reason and has clear communication skills.
“Many of our Northern Light presidents see her as a leadership role model,” Dentry said.
Vieira, who’s also a senior vice president for the Northern Light Health system, was previously president of Northern Light CA Dean Hospital in Greenville, where she learned a lot about rural health care.
“In rural medicine, we are people caring for people,” Vieira said. “They may be our neighbors, they may be our friends, they may be our family, and they are really counting on us — not just for good care, but good caring.”
Vieira started as a radiology technician in 1973 and taught anatomy and radiology at MassBay Community College in Boston.
She grew up in Maryland before coming to Maine to earn her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from St. Joseph’s College in Standish. She worked her way up through hospital administrative positions in Maine, Maryland and Massachusetts.
“I’m all about making a difference and helping others, and that’s how you do it,” Vieira said.
In 1988 she became the director of diagnostic services at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, and she joined Sebasticook Valley as vice president of operations in 2000, before becoming chief operating officer in 2010.
Vieira said she was asked to join Sebasticook Valley to help develop a women’s care center, which still exists as a separate wing at the hospital for women’s imaging services like mammography and bone density scans.
“That’s a passion of mine, always has been,” she said.
A successor to Vieira’s posts will be named after an internal search is conducted, officials said.

Texto completo: In its eagerness to address climate change, the Maine Legislature has given a multimillion-dollar windfall to solar farm developers that threatens to raise electric rates up to 20 percent. It is not too late to amend this legislation before all these solar farms are built. This looming rate increase comes on top of the recently announced 30 percent rate increase in the average household Central Maine Power bill.
The Maine Public Utilities Commission had been entering into contracts to purchase renewable electricity at the competitive rate of 3 to 4 cents per kilowatt-hour before the Legislature opened the floodgates two years ago to invite developers to build solar farms in Maine with a subsidy of many times the wholesale rate without any competitive bid process. The legislation permitted these solar farms to produce up to 5 megawatts - the size of a small power plant - and failed to limit the number of these farms, essentially issuing a blank check on the state's exposure.
The legislation usurped the authority of the PUC to exercise any discretion in limiting this giveaway and failed to require these solar farms to be built at strategic locations. Maine's transmission and distribution system was built for large power plants to deliver power to customers. The system was not built to add small solar generators at any location along the distribution system.
The solar developers are paid retail rather than wholesale rates for the power they produce, which shifts all the costs for transmission, distribution, billing and storm restoration for this power to other customers. And because retail rates are increasing 30 percent, these developers will get that windfall paid on top of their already lucrative subsidy - all at the expense of other customers.
Maine has embarked on an ambitious agenda to reduce greenhouse gases by 45 percent by 2030 and by 80 percent by 2050. The plan calls for 80 percent of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050, which may explain the Legislature's interest in bringing on as much solar power as possible.
The state's aggressive goals to reduce greenhouse gases assume that Mainers will switch to electric heat pumps and electric vehicles because heating and driving account for most of the state's carbon emissions. But these electric rate increases make switching to electric for heat and transportation less feasible. The Legislature's overly generous subsidy to solar developers not only imposes an undue burden on the electric ratepayer but also will likely undermine the state's goal of addressing climate change.
Utility regulation requires a balance among the three Rs - rates, reliability and renewables. Reliability, affordability and addressing climate change compete directly with each other. The more you have of one, the less you may have of the others. Solar generation produces power only during daylight hours, which makes it less reliable than sources that can produce electricity over a 24-hour period. All new power sources increase costs because Maine is a net exporter of electricity. They must be added judiciously with the ratepayer in mind.
Many large electric users have entered into contracts with these solar projects, which will provide them a portion of the windfall to hedge against the inevitable electric rate increases. This may provide these solar developers with political support, but it will not make this program good energy policy.
The Legislature should give the PUC the discretion to reject projects that are not in the public interest because of their expense or location. The state can move aggressively in the direction of renewable electricity by allowing the commission to enter into long-term contracts for renewable energy projects of any size under a competitive bid process.
We can address climate change and provide Maine with reliable power supplies while holding down electric rates, but not by providing huge subsidies to out-of-state developers.

Texto completo: The arrival of the fast-spreading coronavirus variant came on the same day state health officials reported 1,150 cases of COVID-19 and 25 additional deaths.

Maine reported its first cases of the more contagious omicron variant on Friday in five samples from Penobscot County following a genomic sequencing of positive test results recently reported to the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention.
The arrival of the fast-spreading coronavirus variant came on the same day state health officials reported 1,150 new cases of COVID-19, 25 deaths and a record 383 people hospitalized.
Omicron may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has fueled the fall surge, but officials say it may add to the burden hospitals are facing because it spreads more easily.
Omicron has quickly ramped up infections in countries like South Africa, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway. And COVID-19 is soaring in New York City, suspected to be fueled by exponential growth in the omicron variant. The variant has been detected in 41 states, including Maine, according to the Maine CDC. The U.S. CDC currently estimates 3% of all cases nationwide are the omicron variant, but those numbers are expected to grow quickly because the variant is so contagious.
The arrival of omicron in Maine is unwelcome but not unexpected, Gov. Janet Mills said. “We knew it was only a matter of time before we detected the presence of omicron here in Maine,” Mills said in a news release. “While we are still learning about this new variant, the takeaway for Maine people should be this: get vaccinated now and wear a mask when you’re indoors in public.
“Whether it’s your first shot or your third shot, getting vaccinated can protect your health, keep you from getting seriously sick and even save your life.”
Dr. Ashish Jha, an infectious disease expert with the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a series of tweets Friday to expect another surge in cases, a “disruptive” January, and to avoid holiday parties and other large gatherings.
“We should expect a large wave of infections, likely gathering steam in late December, peaking sometime in mid-January,” Jha said in a tweet. “And likely falling quickly to low numbers by end of February.”
Jha also tweeted that getting the booster shot is key.
“We’ll see lots of infections. Boosted folks will largely do fine. Others will get infected at high rates,” Jha said. “Unvaccinated and high-risk folks with breakthroughs will be at risk for hospitalizations.”
Preliminary studies are showing that vaccines become less effective against omicron over time and that re-infection is more possible for people who had previously been infected and remain unvaccinated. People who had previously fallen ill from COVID-19 but remain unvaccinated have a five-fold greater chance of being reinfected with omicron compared to previous variants, according to a study released in the U.K. on Friday.
Studies also indicate that booster shots provide similar protection against omicron compared to a fully vaccinated — but nonboosted — person against delta and previous variants.
“Boosters were important before. They are more important now,” Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said during a media briefing on Thursday. Maine is now administering about 10,000 shots per day — levels not seen since the spring — with about seven out of every 10 shots being boosters. Maine has given about 400,000 booster shots, representing about 30% of the state’s 1.3 million residents.
Shah said in a tweet on Friday that the science is still in the early stages on omicron.
“Judging by some publications, omicron is Schrodinger’s variant: it is simultaneously bad and not bad. Of course, it’s too early to know with certainty,” Shah said.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 135,320 cases of COVID-19, and 1,430 deaths. Maine had 383 people hospitalized for COVID-19 on Friday, a record, with 113 in intensive care and 69 on ventilators.
Of Friday’s 25 reported deaths, 19 were from a periodic review of death certificates, with those deaths occurring between Nov. 11 and Dec. 1.
There continues to be a wide disparity among counties, with high-vaccination counties such as Cumberland recording fewer cases per capita when compared to low-vaccination counties. Aroostook County had the highest seven-day total of 689 cases per 100,000 population.
Cumberland County, the most-vaccinated county in Maine, had the second-lowest virus prevalence at 349 cases over a seven-day period per 100,000 population.
Knox County has the second-highest vaccination rate in Maine — at 76% fully vaccinated, compared to 81% for Cumberland County — and the lowest per capita infection rate over the past week, with 259 cases in seven days per 100,000 population.
The disparity also is present among those who have received booster shots, although the gap is not as wide. Lincoln County led the counties with 37% of its population boosted, compared to a low of 22% in Somerset County. The statewide average was 30%.
Pop-up walk-in clinics continue to be announced in a race to get people their booster shots before the omicron wave intensifies.
The former Pier 1 at the Maine Mall is hosting a walk-in vaccination clinic operated by Northern Light Health. The hours are noon to 5 p.m. on Saturday, as well as 1-7 p.m. on Dec. 21-23. Northern Light also is hosting an appointment clinic at Northern Light Health Center, 885 Union St. in Bangor. To make an appointment, go to covid.northernlighthealth.org or call 207-204-8551.
The Westbrook Fire and Rescue Department is holding a one-day, walk-up clinic from noon to 8 p.m. on Tuesday at the Westbrook Community Center at 426 Bridge St.
Also, MaineHealth is hosting a vaccination clinic at 110 Free St. in Portland from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, the clinic is walk-in, while on Tuesday it is by appointment. To schedule an appointment, go to vaccine.mainehealth.org.

Texto completo: Gov. Janet Mills is among dozens of Maine women participating in the campaign to erase the shame some may feel in being in an abusive relationship.

AUGUSTA — Posters went up Friday in the Augusta area showing the faces of Maine women victimized by domestic violence as part of a campaign to peel away the shame in speaking publicly about abuse.
The posters were placed in business windows on Water Street in Augusta and also at shops in Hallowell and Gardiner.
They show the faces of teachers, artists, college students, a doctor, nurses and a governor, too.
“Domestic abuse affects everyone,” according to a statement by Gov. Janet Mills. “Years ago, a man I loved threatened my life. Escape from violence is possible.”
A campaign called “Finding Our Voices” said in a news release that the initiative “features 40 Maine women standing proud and speaking loud, with their faces, names and experiences of abuse on huge posters and also bookmarks to erase shame and stigma for the victim and bring education and awareness to the general community.”
Patrisha McLean, who founded Finding Our Voices, is a photojournalist once involved in an abusive marriage.
“My ex was arrested for domestic violence,” said McLean, who is from Camden, and was married to “American Pie” singer-songwriter Don McLean. She divorced him in 2016, and he was charged with crimes related to domestic violence, ultimately pleading guilty and paying a $3,600 fine to dismiss the case as part of a plea agreement.
She described how the shame from the experience made her reluctant to leave her home and face people in the community. “I thought it was embarrassing,” she said.
But McLean was met with support from other women, which prompted her to start taking portraits of other survivors and opening exhibits in Camden and Augusta.
“It’s all about breaking the silence,” she said.
McLean launched the nonprofit Finding Our Voices last year. She described domestic violence as an epidemic within the COVID-19 pandemic. She said the problem has only gotten worse as people isolated in their homes.
“I think not many people realize how many women, how many people go through this,” McLean said. “The stereotype is harmful because that’s where you get shame.”
Mills earlier posed for a portrait taken by McLean at the Blaine House. McLean said she has received emails from people who had heard about Mills’ involvement and that has helped Finding Our Voices broaden its reach.
“Her coming out, not as governor but as a survivor, is huge,” McLean said.
In addition to the posters, Finding Our Voices produces bookmarks that are distributed at food pantries, bookstores, libraries, retail shops and other places. Police officers responding to domestic violence calls also hand them out.
The campaign has produced 25,000 bookmarks and intends to create 10,000 to 20,000 additional ones next year.
“We’re really upping our outreach in 2022,” McLean said. “And bringing Gov. Mills along is amazing.”

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Posters went up Friday in the Augusta area showing the faces of Maine women victimized by domestic violence as part of a campaign to peel away the shame in speaking publicly about abuse.
The posters were placed in business windows on Water Street in Augusta and also at shops in Hallowell and Gardiner.
They show the faces of teachers, artists, college students, a doctor, nurses and a governor, too.
"Domestic abuse affects everyone," Gov. Janet Mills said in a statement. "Years ago, a man I loved threatened my life. Escape from violence is possible."
A campaign called "Finding Our Voices" said in a news release that the initiative "features 40 Maine women standing proud and speaking loud, with their faces, names and experiences of abuse on huge posters and also bookmarks to erase shame and stigma for the victim and bring education and awareness to the general community."
Patrisha McLean, who founded Finding Our Voices, is a photojournalist once involved in an abusive marriage.
"My ex was arrested for domestic violence," said McLean, who is from Camden and was married to "American Pie" singer-songwriter Don McLean.
Don McLean was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence against Patrisha McLean at the couple's home in Camden in 2016. He faced six charges, including domestic violence assault. He pleaded guilty to four charges and paid a $3,660 fine in 2017. The domestic assault charge was dismissed a year later. McLean, who also came to financial terms with his ex-wife, agreeing to a divorce settlement worth $10 million, said he pleaded guilty to settle the case.
She described how the shame from the experience made her reluctant to leave her home and face people in the community. "I thought it was embarrassing," she said.
But Patrisha McLean was met with support from other women, which prompted her to start taking portraits of other survivors and opening exhibits in Camden and Augusta.
"It's all about breaking the silence," she said.
McLean launched the nonprofit Finding Our Voices last year. She described domestic violence as an epidemic within the pandemic. She said the problem has only gotten worse as people isolated in their homes.
"I think not many people realize how many women, how many people go through this," McLean said. "The stereotype is harmful because that's where you get shame."
Mills earlier posed for a portrait taken by McLean at the Blaine House. McLean said she has received emails from people who had heard about Mills' involvement and that has helped Finding Our Voices broaden its reach.
"Her coming out, not as governor but as a survivor, is huge," McLean said.
In addition to the posters, Finding Our Voices produces bookmarks that are distributed at food pantries, bookstores, libraries, retail shops and other places. Police officers responding to domestic violence calls also hand them out.
The campaign has produced 25,000 bookmarks and intends to create 10,000 to 20,000 additional ones next year.
"We're really upping our outreach in 2022," McLean said. "And bringing Gov. Mills along is amazing."

Texto completo: Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that he could often quickly compose the first few lines to verses but would then be unable to finish them. They'd stay on his desk for days, much like an unwanted guest in the house. He'd finally tack a few lines on the end and launch them, metaphorically speaking, stern first into the great outdoors, just to be rid of them.
The same is often true of newspaper columns. Some end very comfortably before they fill up their allotted space, and would lose their poignancy were they to be artificially fleshed out.
When I could slip these short informative or humorous bits in between the music in a radio or television program, they were just the thing, but there is no place for them in Maine's foremost daily newspaper.
You might see mountains of old plastic yogurt containers and glass olive jars in the homes of elderly people - because they might come in handy someday. I am in a similar position with countless pages of useless quips and comments. Everything worth saying in three lines has already been printed on greeting cards, so there is no market for aphorisms.
Anyone worth his salt could weave several of these scraps together without having it look contrived. If you can't, you end up with a column that looks more like a list of events in your yearly Christmas letter.
n
Do you remember what it was like to be little and look forward to Christmas?
Some of the presents were already under the tree.
You'd pick up the packages and feel them and squeeze them and shake them. And if there was a puppy inside, too bad for him.
Did you realize it is possible to relive those innocent days of unmitigated excitement?
Did you know that even at 85 it is possible to rekindle a gleam of anticipation in your rheumy old eyes?
I would not have believed this could happen had I not found myself sitting on the edge of my chair, watching the clock. And realizing that in only 26 minutes it would be noontime and that I could then remind my wife, Marsha, to make me a crabmeat sandwich.
n
Sooner or later every woman married to a man who can't remember if he ate his pills has to admit that the old geezer has only a few more miles left on him.
How do you suppose the old man knows when his wife realizes that he is not immortal?
She breaks out a few of his expensive shirts that she's been making him save for special occasions and suggests that he start wearing them around the house.
n
If you have chosen your Facebook friends by something other than scanty clothing or caustic memes, your reward can be substantial. Take, for example, what Nick wrote on my page about cats. He says that many people get their knickers in a twist when their cat climbs up a tree and feigns distress. Some call the fire department. Good-natured firefighters sometimes humor them, but one in Camden was heard to say, "Lady. Be patient. The cat will come down. Did you ever see a cat skeleton in a tree?" Another friend replied with, "Dogs are obviously smarter than cats. You seldom see a dog at the top of a tree pretending to be stuck."
n
If you were a seagull in the town of St. George, Maine, you'd probably think back wistfully to the good old days when we had a landfill dump. Back then, sports wanting to make a good impression on a first date would take her to the dump to shoot rats. Nowadays, the town of St. George has a state-of-the-art recycling center where even a cockroach would starve to death.
Even though everything is recycled, to many of us it is still the dump. There are two different wood piles, one for trees and one for lumber. You can back up your truck and load it with firewood or boards. When I haul a good pine board home from the dump, I am saving the town money in disposal fees. When you see me leaving the dump with more than I brought down, you realize that St. George epitomizes the social experience they call recycling. The only losers are rats and seagulls.
Has anyone ever been married at your dump?
Wouldn't you think that two people who reached for the same pine board and felt the magic when their hands touched would want to consider it?

Maine Celtics bounce back to beat Long Island after streak snapped
Chris Clemons had 26 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists as the Maine Celtics bounced back one night after having their seven-game winning streak snapped with a 111-99 win over the Long Island Nets on Friday night at the Portland Expo.
Long Island beat Maine 97-95 in overtime on Thursday night, the Celtics first loss since Nov. 12.
Jaysean Paige led Maine with 29 points and six rebounds, while Juwan Morgan added 20 points and seven rebounds. Theo Pinson had 12 points and Asante Gist added 11.
Bryce Brown had 26 points and Josh Gray had 21 for Long Island.
HOCKEY
ECHL:
The Maine Mariners scored twice in the second period to take the lead for the second time in the game but had to settle for a 3-3 tie with the Lions in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec.
Patrick Shea scored 1:31 into the game to give Maine a 1-0 lead. Trois-RIvieres took the lead with two goals by Shawn St-Amant less than three minutes apart. The Mariners took the lead back in the second period with goals by Conner Bleackley and Mathew Santos, but the Lions tied it again when Jonathan Joannette scored with 2:41 left in the second.
Trois-Rivieres beat Maine 4-2 on Wednesday night.
TENNIS
NADAL RETURNS:
A rusty Rafael Nadal played his first match in more than four months on Friday, losing in straight sets to Andy Murray at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The 20-time Grand Slam champion's chronic foot injury forced him to sit out the final months of this season. Nadal has not competed since early August, when he lost to Lloyd Harris in Washington. He missed Wimbledon, the Tokyo Olympics and the U.S. Open.
SOCCER
U.S. MEN:
Forward Jordan Morris is likely to play his first U.S. national team match in more than two years when the Americans face Bosnia and Herzegovina in an exhibition on Saturday.
Morris, a 27-year-old Seattle Sounders forward, tore his left ACL on Feb. 20 while on loan from Seattle to Swansea, three years after tearing his right ACL. He returned to the field for the Sounders on Nov. 1 and appeared in three club games.
Defender Aaron Long probably won't play. Long tore his right Achilles tendon while playing for the New York Red Bulls on May 15 and has not appeared in a game since.
ENGLAND:
Premier League managers will meet on Monday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation, which has already wiped out half of this weekend games and sidelined star players.
Outbreaks at clubs underscore the worsening health emergency in Britain as the omicron variant spreads. Opinions were wide-ranging regarding what steps to take from here. Some managers advocate a break in play, citing fairness. Others say the games should continue.
COLLEGES
FOOTBALL:
Freshman Nick Vattiato threw for 270 yards and two touchdowns, including a 59-yard scoring pass to Jarrin Pierce with 6:24 left, and Middle Tennessee (7-6) held on for a 31-24 win over Toledo (7-6) in the Bahamas Bowl.
n
Grayson McCall threw four touchdown passes and Coastal Carolina held off Northern Illinois 47-41 in the Cure Bowl in Orlando, Florida, with the game ending with the Huskies at the Chanticleers 4.
BASKETBALL:
The NCAA will pay officials for the women's tournament the same amount it pays the officials for the men's.

Texto completo: With a roster full of returners and three solid lines, Eagles roll past Camden Hills.
The Messalonskee hockey team had reason to be optimistic when it entered the season with a roster loaded with key returners and a few impact transfers.
A game in, and it’s so far, so good for the Eagles.
Five different players scored in a season-opening 6-3 victory over Class B North contender Camden Hills on Wednesday in Rockport.
“The guys are working really hard at practice, we have a lot of competition going on day-in, day-out at practice,” said Messalonskee second-year coach Dennis Martin. “We’ve got guys working really hard, we’re getting better every day. With the experience that we have from last year, guys played, though it wasn’t much of a season. Basically, 18 of our 20 guys are back (from last year).”
Garrett Card led the Eagles with two goals, while Brady Doucette, Bryce Crowell, Owen Kirk and Andrew Beckwith also scored.
Martin said Messalonskee has three strong lines entering the season, a luxury for most high school hockey teams in Maine, particularly in Class B North.
“We had goals from all three of our lines (Wednesday night),” said Martin, whose team has been aided with the transfers of Brandon Bearce and Cody Pawson. “We have three solid lines that we’ll be able to play, and not really have to match up with other teams. (Each line) doesn’t drop off that far from each other.”
While the Eagles feature a veteran-heavy squad, Martin said there’s still work to be done as the season moves along.
“With COVID last year, we didn’t really have a lot of practices and a lot of consistency doing stuff,” Martin said. “Right now, (Thursday’s) practice was No. 12 already. I think we had 17 (practices) all of last year. They’re getting used to the systems that we’re doing. As a group, it is a lot easier, they’re adapting to things a lot quicker. We don’t have to start with square one with everything. It makes a big difference. We can add to it, instead of just starting backwards and working your way through.”

The Black Tigers — a girls hockey co-op comprised of players from Winslow, Gardiner, Cony, Lawrence, Messalonskee and Brewer — are trying to regain the momentum they enjoyed at the start of the season.
The group opened the season with three consecutive victories, but have since dropped three straight, including losses to Class A teams Lewiston and Cheverus. The latest setback came Thursday in a 5-3 decision to Yarmouth/Freeport.
“I like the 3-0 start that we were off to in those first three games,” head coach Bill Boardman said.
“Then we had Lewiston and Cheverus back-to-back, and those are two of the tough teams in the state. I don’t think we competed as well as we should have. We were up 2-0 against Lewiston, so we were kind of excited about that, but certainly Lewiston is a very strong program, strong team. They came back on us and I think we were just a little flat once we got behind and did not compete for the full game. We did not compete in the third period, and we need to overcome those kind of things. I think that carried on to the Cheverus game, where we came out a little flat against a solid team that has two solid lines that can skate and move the puck.”
There’s been plenty of bright spots for the Black Tigers, notably the play of junior goaltender Emma Michaud. Boardman has also been impressed with the play of his defensemen, including Kylie Boardman, Jordin Williams, Evelyn Rousseau and Hannah Daigneault.
“Our (defense) and our goaltending has been strong, I’m very happy with that,” Bill Boardman said.
“In the first three games, we were able to get the puck up the ice and get it to the offensive zone to score some goals. I think our strength so far, which I expected, was our defensive play. Certainly looking to continue that.”

While most central Maine boys hockey teams have played at least one game, Cony/Monmouth/Erskine/Mt. Blue/Richmond begins its season Saturday against Capital Region — comprised of players from Maranacook, Winthrop, Spruce Mountain, Hall-Dale and Lawrence — at 8 p.m. at the Ice Vault.
Cony finished 5-4 last season, with head coach Shawn Johnson returning for his fifth season at the helm.
Capital Region will be looking for its first win after losing a 9-0 decision to Hampden Academy on Dec. 11.

Texto completo: Maine reported its first cases of the more contagious omicron variant on Friday in five samples from Penobscot County following a genomic sequencing of positive test results recently reported to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The detection of the fast-spreading coronavirus variant came on the same day state health officials reported 1,150 new cases of COVID-19, 25 deaths and a record 383 people hospitalized.
Omicron may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has fueled the fall surge, but officials say it may add to the burden hospitals are facing because it spreads more easily.
Omicron has quickly ramped up infections in countries like South Africa, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway. And COVID-19 is soaring in New York City, suspected to be fueled by exponential growth in the omicron variant. The variant has been detected in 41 states, including Maine, according to the Maine CDC. The U.S. CDC currently estimates 3 percent of all cases nationwide are the omicron variant, but those numbers are expected to grow quickly because the variant is so contagious.
The arrival of omicron in Maine is unwelcome but not unexpected, Gov. Janet Mills said. "We knew it was only a matter of time before we detected the presence of omicron here in Maine," Mills said in a news release. "While we are still learning about this new variant, the takeaway for Maine people should be this: get vaccinated now and wear a mask when you're indoors in public.
"Whether it's your first shot or your third shot, getting vaccinated can protect your health, keep you from getting seriously sick and even save your life."
Dr. Ashish Jha, an infectious disease expert with the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a series of tweets on Friday to expect another surge in cases, a "disruptive" January, and to avoid holiday parties and other large gatherings.
"We should expect a large wave of infections, likely gathering steam in late December, peaking sometime in mid-January," Jha said in a tweet. "And likely falling quickly to low numbers by end of February."
Jha also tweeted that getting the booster shot is key.
"We'll see lots of infections. Boosted folks will largely do fine. Others will get infected at high rates," Jha said. "Unvaccinated and high-risk folks with breakthroughs will be at risk for hospitalizations."
Preliminary studies are showing that vaccines become less effective against omicron over time and that re-infection is more possible for people who had previously been infected and remain unvaccinated. People who had previously fallen ill from COVID-19 but remain unvaccinated have a five-fold greater chance of being reinfected with omicron compared to previous variants, according to a study released in the U.K. on Friday.
Studies also indicate that booster shots provide similar protection against omicron compared to a fully vaccinated - but non-boosted - person against delta and previous variants.
"Boosters were important before. They are more important now," Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said during a media briefing on Thursday. Maine is now administering about 10,000 shots per day - levels not seen since the spring - with about seven out of every 10 shots being boosters. Maine has given about 400,000 booster shots, representing about 30 percent of the state's 1.3 million residents.
The U.K. study shows a range of 55 percent to 80 percent protection against infection for those vaccinated and boosted.
Shah said in a tweet on Friday that the science is still in the early stages on omicron.
"Judging by some publications, omicron is Schrodinger's variant: it is simultaneously bad and not bad. Of course, it's too early to know with certainty," Shah said.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 135,320 cases of COVID-19, and 1,430 deaths. Of Maine's record 383 people hospitalized for COVID-19 on Friday, 113 were in intensive care and 69 were on ventilators.
Of Friday's 25 reported deaths, 19 were from a periodic review of death certificates, with those deaths occurring between Nov. 11 and Dec. 1.
There continues to be a wide disparity among counties, with high-vaccination counties such as Cumberland recording fewer cases per capita when compared to low-vaccination counties. Aroostook County had the highest seven-day total of 689 cases per 100,000 population. Cumberland County, the most-vaccinated county in Maine, had the second-lowest virus prevalence at 349 cases over a seven-day period per 100,000 population.
Knox County has the second-highest vaccination rate in Maine - at 76 percent fully vaccinated, compared to 81 percent for Cumberland County - and the lowest per capita infection rate over the past week, with 259 cases in seven days per 100,000 population.
The disparity also is present among those who have received booster shots, although the gap is not as wide. Lincoln County led the counties with 37 percent of its population boosted, compared to a low of 22 percent in Somerset County. The statewide average was 30 percent.
Pop-up walk-in clinics continue to be announced in a race to get people their booster shots before the omicron wave intensifies.
The former Pier 1 at the Maine Mall is hosting a walk-in vaccination clinic operated by Northern Light Health. The hours are noon to 5 p.m. Saturday, as well as 1-7 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday.
Northern Light also is hosting an appointment clinic at Northern Light Health Center, 885 Union St. in Bangor. To make an appointment, go to covid.northernlighthealth.org or call 204-8551.
The Westbrook Fire and Rescue Department is holding a one-day, walk-up clinic from noon to 8 p.m. Tuesday at the Westbrook Community Center at 426 Bridge St.
Also, MaineHealth is hosting a vaccination clinic at 110 Free St. in Portland from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, the clinic is walk-in, while on Tuesday it's by appointment. To schedule an appointment, go to vaccine.mainehealth.org.

Texto completo: The Maine Criminal Justice Academy in Vassalboro canceled its formal graduation ceremony Friday for the 40th Basic Law Enforcement Training Program after a person associated with the academy tested positive for COVID-19, officials said.
The positive test came Thursday night, prompting officials to cancel the in-person ceremony "out of an abundance of caution and to protect the safety of all those who planned to attend the event," said Shannon Moss, spokeswoman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Citing privacy concerns, Moss declined to provide additional information about the person who tested positive. She said the academy alerted all of the building staff, as well as cadets and anyone who may have had a close contact with the person, and that appropriate protocols from the agency and Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention were being followed.
There were 57 cadets graduating from the program, Moss said. A virtual ceremony is not planned instead because "the appropriate mechanisms are not in place to hold a virtual ceremony, although that is something we're looking at for the future," she said.
Rick Desjardins, director of the academy, said the cancellation "doesn't in any way diminish the achievements this class has made over these 18 weeks of rigorous training and we are all very proud of their commitment to the law enforcement profession."
The training program was described by Moss as "an intensive training made up of practical and academic training that prepares cadets for a career in law enforcement." The program includes training on motor vehicle stops, defensive tactics, firearms training, and emergency vehicle operation and control. Cadets must also meet a rigorous physical training regimen, as they spend five days per week on campus while returning home on weekends.

Texto completo: State lawmakers will convene for at least two in-person sessions next month, but committee work will be conducted remotely because of the ongoing pandemic, legislative leaders announced Friday.
Senate President Troy Jackson and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau said in a news release that the Legislature will convene in-person on Jan. 5 and Jan. 26. Joint standing committees, however, will continue to meet remotely in January, because of the ongoing surge in COVID-19 cases that is filling hospitals and expected to get worse following the holiday season.
"Unfortunately, we are in the middle of an unbelievable crisis with the COVID-19 surge affecting Maine and New England," Jackson said. "With the holidays around the corner, the Maine Legislature plans to operate under the COVID-19 health and safety protocols established last year. We simply can't afford to put our families and communities at risk or further stress our hospitals, health care providers and front-line workers."
Leadership said that public testimony could be provided to committees in writing at mainelegislature.org/testimony. Anyone interested in testifying live before the committee is encouraged to register at least 30 minutes before the hearing is scheduled to begin. Remote meetings will be streamed online.
The State House is open to the public, but pandemic precautions remain in place. That includes a requirement that people wear masks, unless they are alone in an office, at their own cubical and able to socially distance, or in the third balcony at the State House.
Fecteau said lawmakers must continue to take care to protect the health and safety of the state's nonpartisan staff, the public and lawmakers. He said remote meetings allow for greater public participation.
"Last session, we had Mainers calling in and zooming in to participate in public hearings from every corner of the state - from barns, kitchen tables, garages and shops," Fecteau said. "It was incredible to see how everyday people could participate and get engaged in the political process without having to drive to Augusta."
"I'm happy to report that the same level of transparency and access will continue this session, with public hearings and work sessions streaming live online," he added. "Ultimately, I remain committed to the safety and health of the nonpartisan staff, the public and the lawmakers at the State House."

Texto completo: Northern Light Inland Hospital said the two members of the Maine National Guard arrived Friday and would work in the monoclonal antibody clinic for COVID-19 patients in non-clinical roles.

WATERVILLE — Two members of the Maine National Guard arrived at Northern Light Inland Hospital on Friday morning to help in nonclinical roles under a deployment order from Gov. Janet Mills to assist hospitals as the surging COVID-19 pandemic stretches hospital staffs to the brink across the state.
The hospital said in a news release Friday evening that Terri Vieira, president of Northern Light Inland Hospital, welcomed Army Pvt. 1st Class Heather Kervin and Air Force Staff Sgt. Devin Lincoln. Kervin and Lincoln will be helping in the monoclonal antibody clinic for COVID-19 patients in nonclinical roles while working under the supervision of nursing staff, the hospital said.
Under Mills’ deployment order, Guard members may be redeployed to another site at any time if there is a higher need at another health care facility.
Kervin said that all deployed members took an online temporary nurse aid course in addition to an all-day infection prevention training held at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, according to Inland’s release. Guard members were taught how to properly use personal protective equipment, were fitted for N95 masks, and completed additional training.
Kervin and Lincoln have been instructed on how to restock supplies, escort patients to and from the monoclonal antibody clinic, disinfect, take patient vitals, and observe patients during and after their treatment.
“We are so grateful for their help,” said Courtney Cook, a registered nurse who is director of birthing and assists with the monoclonal antibody clinic. “It takes a half hour for a treatment during which a nurse administers the monoclonal antibody infusion, and then the COVID-19 patient needs to be observed for an hour after the treatment is finished.”
Inland said that having additional people trained to do observation means more patients can be treated each day.

Texto completo: Excessive speed appeared to be a factor in the wreck Friday that injured two Madison residents, police said.

MADISON — A motorist was airlifted to a Bangor hospital and his passenger was injured in a single-car crash Friday in Madison, a sheriff’s official said.
Somerset County sheriff’s deputies were dispatched shortly after 8 a.m. to Weston Avenue, Chief Deputy Michael Mitchell said in a news release.
Vincent Thompson, 33, of Madison, was driving a 2017 Toyota Camry when the car went off the road and struck a utility pole. The car sustained significant damage.
Thompson was seriously injured and taken by ambulance to a waiting LifeFlight of Maine helicopter, which then transported him to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, Mitchell said.
Mitchell did not know Thompson’s condition.
The passenger, Sylvia Coutinho, 27, of Madison, was taken to Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan for injuries that did not appear to be life-threatening, Mitchell said. Both Thompson and Coutinho were wearing seat belts.
Excessive speed appeared to be a factor in the crash, Mitchell said. The investigation is ongoing.

Texto completo: Northern Light Health announced this week that Terri Vieira will step down as president of Northern Light Inland Hospital and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital.
Subheader

The president of the Northern Light Health hospitals in Waterville and Pittsfield has announced her retirement and will step aside in April, the health system said this week.
Terri Vieira leads both Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital in Pittsfield. She also oversees Lakewood Continuing Care in Waterville.
Vieira said Friday that she’s proud of the work she’s done to help the employees and students she’s worked with in the region to reach their potential.
“If they have dreams and visions, I like to help them get those,” Vieira said of hospital staff. “Because when they get those, we benefit, too.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it unprecedented challenges, but she noted that some good can come from such struggle. She said she is “retiring in spite of COVID.”
“With COVID, you go back to the basics. If you take care of the people that are caring for patients, you take care of patients; you keep them in the forefront, you make good decisions that way,” Vieira said.
A challenging part of Vieira’s career was learning leadership skills early on and developing a balancing act between “taking care of today but always keeping tomorrow in mind.”
Vieira took over operations of the Pittsfield hospital in 2013 and then took on additional duties in Waterville last year.
She will step down from those roles April 1.
Northern Light Health President and Chief Executive Officer Tim Dentry said in a news release that Vieira is a voice of reason and has clear communication skills.
“Many of our Northern Light presidents see her as a leadership role model,” Dentry said.
Vieira, who’s also a senior vice president for the Northern Light Health system, was previously president of Northern Light CA Dean Hospital in Greenville, where she learned a lot about rural health care.
“In rural medicine, we are people caring for people,” Vieira said. “They may be our neighbors, they may be our friends, they may be our family, and they are really counting on us — not just for good care, but good caring.”
Vieira started as a radiology technician in 1973 and taught anatomy and radiology at MassBay Community College in Boston.
She grew up in Maryland before coming to Maine to earn her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from St. Joseph’s College in Standish. She worked her way up through hospital administrative positions in Maine, Maryland and Massachusetts.
“I’m all about making a difference and helping others, and that’s how you do it,” Vieira said.
In 1988 she became the director of diagnostic services at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, and she joined Sebasticook Valley as vice president of operations in 2000, before becoming chief operating officer in 2010.
Vieira said she was asked to join Sebasticook Valley to help develop a women’s care center, which still exists as a separate wing at the hospital for women’s imaging services like mammography and bone density scans.
“That’s a passion of mine, always has been,” she said.
A successor to Vieira’s posts will be named after an internal search is conducted, officials said.

Texto completo: US rule on fishing gear would help lobstermen adapt to changing ocean Whale-safe gear is crucial to the future of Maine's lobstermen, as many in the industry are realizing (“The lobster trap: Protests and prayers,” Page A1, Dec. 13). But we need to find ways to help fishermen ease the transition.
That's one reason our organization is urging the federal government to adopt a rule on so-called ropeless, or pop-up, fishing gear for marine sanctuaries and other waters where whales are at risk. A legal requirement would further technological developments and investments that bring down the cost.
As climate change alters our oceans, North Atlantic right whales and other endangered animals are being pushed into fisheries where old-fashioned gear takes a devastating toll. In 2018 alone, more than 100 large whales were reported entangled in fishing gear in the United States — probably only a fraction of the actual number, since most entanglements go unobserved.
Ropeless gear is the only way to prevent entanglements while allowing fishing to continue. It's been tested and used in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and the National Marine Fisheries Service calls it “game changing.”
But change is happening too slowly, so we need a federal push to convert to ropeless gear. That will protect both right whales and lobstermen's ability to make a living in a changing ocean.

Protecting whales is worthy goal, but well-being of working people should be our priority Re “The lobster trap” (Page A1, Dec. 12): What has become of our country when the well-being of whales takes precedence over the well-being of working people? How many so-called environmentalists have ever spent more than an hour or two on the ocean, have ever held a job that requires manual labor or is paid by the hour?
Protecting whales is a worthy goal, but why must the burden be put on those who harvest lobsters for a living? Replacing a line and float that costs only a few dollars with a possibly unreliable high-tech gadget that costs hundreds or thousands of dollars would be a substantial burden to the small operator.
If the nation believes that entanglement of whales in lobstering gear is a problem that needs solving, then all of us, through our taxes, should bear the cost. The alternative is to alienate working people from their own government and enable demagogues like Donald Trump.

Global warming is the overarching threat Global warming giveth lobstering wealth, and global warming will taketh it. Regardless of what right whale regulations turn out to be, the future of Maine's lobster industry (and ski industry, for that matter) is in jeopardy because of global warming. Far from protecting their livelihood for future generations, opposing wind farms will only hasten their industry's decline.
The good folks in Maine are not the only ones working against their own livelihood, but for the sake of Johnny McCarthy's 9-year-old son and his generation, we all need to make changes to reduce carbon emissions as fast as possible.

Lobstermen's choices are few The phrase “move, adapt, or die” is a very brief summary of the theory of evolution, when applied to a niche ecology. I believe it applies to both the lobsters in the Gulf of Maine and to the lobstering industry of Vinalhaven, Maine.
The lobsters came en masse to the Gulf within the last couple of decades, and it appears that they will be gone in a few decades, moving north, because of warming ocean temperatures.
I believe the Vinalhaven fishery will end, as catches become smaller over time. To move is not a solution, the lobstermen say. That leaves adapt or perish as a way of life as their only choices.
To adapt by suing the government will not succeed. The government cannot order the lobsters to remain where they are.
I feel compassion for the lobstermen, faced with monumental changes. But my compassion does not change their choices, which are limited to three.

In warming world, we are all essentially the lobster in a boiling pot Re “Protests and prayers”: Thank you to The Boston Globe and the Portland Press Herald, in partnership, for this excellent series on the effects of climate change on the lobster industry. The industry's struggles are a microcosm of what our planet is facing now and in the coming years.
Since we seem to be the proverbial lobster in the boiling pot, can we see what is happening and then act quickly and decisively enough to avert the worst effects of a warming planet? It will be a challenge, particularly when many of our politicians and our populace refuse to acknowledge what we can see and feel every day.
Prayers won't be enough, except perhaps to give us the strength to act to protect our only home, planet Earth.

Series brings the impact of climate change home Your series about the impact of climate change on the lobstering community of Vinalhaven, Maine, was one of the best articles I have read in the Globe over my 30 years as a subscriber. The writing and accompanying photographs put a human spin on the impact of climate change on this small community, providing many different viewpoints in a wonderfully told tale of the struggles people face in a quickly warming world.
It would be great to see more articles like this one that are so well-researched and well-presented and that make the reader connect with climate change through storytelling. I hope to see a follow-up to this article in a year to learn more about decisions this community makes in order to survive.

The creaking sounds of nature changing, and the lives within it I want to note two vastly different articles about the same state, both excellent.
Durin Chappe's musings on a Maine seaside hike with his mother (“Looking for cranberries — and finding meaning — at the water's edge,” Ideas, Dec. 12) is a quiet, and yet forceful, reminder of the soul-enriching experience of immersing oneself in the natural world. While I live in a much more developed place, I, too, am reminded of the pre-Colonial-era Native Americans who used to roam this area, especially when I spy ducks on the water in winter.
Meanwhile, Jenna Russell and Penelope Overton's series about Vinalhaven brings us into a world facing changes both climatic and cultural. We are brought up close to those whose lives — not unlike those of coal miners — affect the rest of us tangentially, whether through our daily assumption of the availability of energy or our casual consumption of a lobster roll. We need to be reminded of these lives.

U-E girls start quickly, fall short vs. unbeaten Elmira

Texto completo: Elmira's quick start to the season wasn't matched by the Express' play to open each half Wednesday night at home against Southern Tier Athletic Conference foe Union-Endicott.
The Express fell behind 10-0 before charging back for a 30-23 halftime lead. The second half opened with six straight points from U-E until Elmira regained control in a 63-45 victory to improve to 4-0.
Junior guard Jalea Abrams scored 10 consecutive points on two 2-pointers and two 3-pointers to get Elmira going. She finished with 19 points.
Senior forward Megan Fedor took charge in the second half, scoring 16 of her game-high 25 points to help close out the victory. She added 10 rebounds, four assists, three blocked shots and two steals.
Khamiah Inman contributed eight of her 12 points for Elmira in the fourth quarter and Amarionah Dixon added 11 rebounds and two blocked shots.
Neroj Barwari and Adriana Fontana scored nine points each for the Tigers (3-2).
A potent pair
Abrams and Fedor each scored a career-high 26 points Saturday in a 70-54 road win over Maine-Endwell. Trying to find a way to slow even one of those two has proved difficult.
"I'm lucky, I have kids who are going to play hard the whole game," U-E coach Mike Howell said. "We're going to put pressure on teams, but those two girls, Fedor and Abrams, are tough."
Said first-year Elmira head coach A'Don Allen: "I'm excited they're on our team and not the other team."
Howell said the Tigers were a bit lucky in limiting Fedor's scoring in the first half, but the second half was a different story. He said it's largely a matter of picking your poison with those two.
"That's a hard combo to stop. Fedor down low and Abrams on top," Howell said. "She extends the 3-point line by four feet, so you've got to guard her way out there. You come out there and they throw it into Fedor, so it's a tough task. But I thought the girls did a good job, it's just that Elmira's a good team."
Turnovers, tempo turned the tide
Pace of play was quick, with each team creating turnovers on the defensive end. Elmira ended up forcing more, leading to several layups that spearheaded a 23-7 scoring edge in the final quarter. Elmira's lead was 40-38 after three.
While scoring was led by Abrams and Fedor, the Express' up-tempo style is a team-focused approach on both ends of the court.
"It doesn't always show in the book, you've got Amarionah Dixon coming off the bench giving us 11 rebounds, you've got Payton Ross, who's been playing absolutely out of her mind the past couple weeks. Amiah Driscoll," Allen said.
He added players are starting to find their roles.
"Megan and Jea are kind of doing the heavy lifting offensively, but their teammates are really picking them up in other places and we're getting a different girl each night kind of being that third scorer," Allen said. "That's a nice luxury to have considering we're still missing Ellie (Clearwater), we're still missing Shay Wallace, we're still missing a couple other girls. To be 4-0 at this point with the learning curve of everything that's happening is good as a coach."
U-E showing potential
Union-Endicott overcame a 12-point deficit at the start of the fourth quarter Saturday to beat Horseheads, 52-50. Howell has been impressed by his players' resiliency early in the season, something Allen said is also a strength for the Express.
Elmira won four consecutive Section 4 Class AA titles before last season, when no champions were crowned in Section 4. Allen was an assistant to Jake Dailey during that run and Elmira has continued its fast-paced style and winning ways with Allen as head coach.
"We told the girls that we are going to get everybody's best every single night and I think maybe they didn't believe that at the start today," Allen said. "Union-Endicott's a good team. They're going to make some noise in Class A. We knew that coming in, we knew they were tough. I don't want to say we weren't prepared, but maybe we took things a little bit for granted. We had a big win against (Maine-Endwell), maybe a little layover, but I liked the way the team reacted afterward."
Up next
Elmira plays at Bishop Kearney at 4:15 p.m. Saturday in a meeting of traditional powers from Section 4 and Section 5.
U-E plays at Binghamton at 1:45 p.m. Saturday.

Holiday gift ideas for outdoors enthusiasts

Texto completo: With a second COVID-19 Christmas fast approaching, selecting just the right gift for the outdoor-oriented man or woman on your list will be just the first hurdle, actually finding and buying it might even be more daunting. Production levels are down, supply ships are backed up waiting to unload and sporting goods store shelves are almost barren of many hunting, fishing, camping and watersports gear. Nonetheless, I've some suggestions that will make for happy holidays if you locate and purchase them.
First and foremost, if there's a target shooter or hunter in line for a present, ammunition under the tree will be a big hit. For months there has been a terrible sparsity of most rifle, shotgun and handgun cartridges and also an absence of components for hand loading your own shells, especially primers and gunpowder. Be prepared for sticker shock -- prices have skyrocketed due to demand and low supply; shells have tripled in price so a box of 20 rifle cartridges can be well over $75.
It's unlikely there will be any significant change in availability or cost before next season, so buy when you can. One thing about Maine is that most country stores and corner markets cater to sportsmen and have a few boxes of a variety of rifle and shotgun ammo. Call and visit local spots and check larger companies online. Perhaps you will be fortunate and find the caliber or gauge needed and the shooter on your gift list will be very surprised and appreciative.
If there happens to be a waterfowl or turkey hunter on your Christmas list, check out SX Decoys on your computer, in an outdoor catalog or at a nearby sporting goods store. After 50 years of duck and goose hunting I'm a bit of a connoisseur of realistic decoys and this brand is top rate. Their painted models are very good, but for unbelievable realism the full-bodied, fully flocked Canada goose, mallards and wild turkey are unsurpassed. If live birds land among the decoys set up on motion stakes, it's difficult to tell the difference.
Goose decoys are available in three species and numerous poses, and both mallard and goose decoys have floaters for gunning over water or field models that mount on special motion stakes. These are all one-piece decoys with a special hand-carry strap in the tail to allow several to be carried at once, as well as a set of stands for frozen ground and a set of in-ground stakes. A durable carry and storage bag to protect flocking is included with each decoy. SX decoys will make a believer out of sportsmen and wild birds in a hurry.
For the bass or muskie fisherman, there are some STORM plugs and poppers that make great reasonably priced stocking stuffers. There are many local, catalog and online outlets with a wide array of sizes and colors for several species of fresh and saltwater gamefish. The STORM Wiggle Wart and Hot 'N Tot are sure bets for bass, and STORM ThinFish lures drive the perch and pickerel into a feeding frenzy.
For regional lakes and rivers holding toothy muskie, try the STORM Flatstick crankbaits in large sizes, 6 to 8 inches. This lure can be cast or trolled, has a bright UV finish offering flash in even murky water, three sets of treble hooks and a tough tooth-proof exterior. They are solid or jointed bodies and in several colors. The green tiger and chrome perch are proven favorites.
Other items in the moderate price range that everyone enjoys include various reading materials; a yearly magazine subscription or a book about a favorite pastime helps pass a few long winter nights. Gun Digest or Shooters Bible are annual big book publications that any hunter, shooter or reloader will enjoy. Camping, carving, canoeing, or skiing, skating and snowshoeing -- whatever you're into, there's a book or magazine to learn how, improve your technique or just expand your horizon no matter what the hobby.
How about a duck or goose call? A half dozen dry flies, a couple of tandem streamers or lures or maybe some tapered leaders for an angler? With the new year at hand, a new hunting or fishing license will be needed and makes a great gift. A sturdy wooden canoe paddle, a trout net, a rechargeable headlamp, a multitool and belt case, or a Maine made Snow and Nealley belt ax will all be appreciated Christmas Day and many, many days in the future.
My patient, beleaguered wife laments each birthday, anniversary and Christmas that I already own one of every outdoor product. Thanks to new and improved gear, however, she manages to find gifts. Here's hoping someone in your family is as patient and persistent.
Happy holidays, one and all.

Texto completo: Response to letter about Bangor's vision
In response to the letter to the BDN from John Mooney, who wants to know if people are proud to pay taxes in a Bangor that lacks vision as opposed to the forward thinking of Hampden and Herman: The sad fact is that Bangor is a city that sold its soul when it embarked on the downward process of urban renewal in the 1960s.
That is a simple, but not at all simplistic, explanation. It is also accurate. I would also suggest that it might be revealing to compare the political party affiliations of Bangor citizens to those of Hampden and Hermon.

King and Golden should help protect Medicare Advantage
Medical care and procedures may often be stressful, particularly when unexpected. For many Mainers, who often live on limited or fixed incomes, this is particularly true. Many fear the thought of forgoing needed services at a time when needed most due to cost.
For more than 120,000 Maine seniors, we are fortunate to be enrolled in Medicare Advantage programs. Medicare Advantage is the only program connecting seniors with the needed benefits while keeping prices manageable. In fact, Medicare Advantage premiums are set to decrease 10 percent for 2022. This means seniors will pay, on average, $19 per month.
Even with the low cost, Medicare Advantage members are not forced to give up any of the benefits we need. Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have access to all of the benefits of original Medicare with the addition of in-home care support, grocery planning and delivery, wellness programs, integrated vision, dental and hearing benefits and more.
With all of the benefits of the Medicare Advantage plans, I encourage Sen. Angus King and Rep. Jared Golden as well as the entire Maine congressional delegation to continue their efforts to advocate for the senior community by protecting Medicare Advantage. Funding cuts would inevitably lead to rate increases and/or possible loss of currently available services. Rate increases also may make Medicare Advantage plans unaffordable to the millions nationwide who depend on them.

We need to change the tragic trend of pedestrian and cyclist deaths
﻿This year, the number of pedestrians killed by drivers in Maine is nearly twice what it was last year and includes two women killed this past week while walking along Maine roads. It's way past time for a serious conversation about designing roadways that accommodate everyone's use of roads.
Deaths on American roads have increased by 10% over the past decade, while deaths in European Union countries have decreased. That's because regulators in Europe insist that manufacturers design cars that are less lethal to a human body and roads in Europe are more likely to be designed to lessen the likelihood of accidents.  
Human error becomes the fallback explanation for accidents, yet that ignores significant other factors such as weather, inadequate or obscured signage and road design.  
Until our roads are designed to accommodate all users, it's imperative that drivers of cars obey speed limits and adjust to changing weather conditions by slowing down. Adopt the mindset that there are walkers and cyclists everywhere you drive and watch for them! Imagine how you'd feel if you were responsible for that empty chair at a family's holiday celebration.
And walkers and cyclists, do everything you can to protect yourself. Wear brightly colored clothing, use crosswalks, put lights on your bike, walk facing traffic and bike with traffic, use hand signals to indicate you're turning your bike etc.  
Diligence on everyone's part can change this tragic trajectory of more deaths to pedestrians and cyclists with each passing year.

Texto completo: Elmira's quick start to the season wasn't matched by the Express' play to open each half Wednesday night at home against Southern Tier Athletic Conference foe Union-Endicott.
The Express fell behind 10-0 before charging back for a 30-23 halftime lead. The second half opened with six straight points from U-E until Elmira regained control in a 63-45 victory to improve to 4-0.
Junior guard Jalea Abrams scored 10 consecutive points on two 2-pointers and two 3-pointers to get Elmira going. She finished with 19 points.
Senior forward Megan Fedor took charge in the second half, scoring 16 of her game-high 25 points to help close out the victory. She added 10 rebounds, four assists, three blocked shots and two steals.
Khamiah Inman contributed eight of her 12 points for Elmira in the fourth quarter and Amarionah Dixon added 11 rebounds and two blocked shots.
Neroj Barwari and Adriana Fontana scored nine points each for the Tigers (3-2).
A potent pair
Abrams and Fedor each scored a career-high 26 points Saturday in a 70-54 road win over Maine-Endwell. Trying to find a way to slow even one of those two has proved difficult.
"I'm lucky, I have kids who are going to play hard the whole game," U-E coach Mike Howell said. "We're going to put pressure on teams, but those two girls, Fedor and Abrams, are tough."
Said first-year Elmira head coach A'Don Allen: "I'm excited they're on our team and not the other team."
Howell said the Tigers were a bit lucky in limiting Fedor's scoring in the first half, but the second half was a different story. He said it's largely a matter of picking your poison with those two.
"That's a hard combo to stop. Fedor down low and Abrams on top," Howell said. "She extends the 3-point line by four feet, so you've got to guard her way out there. You come out there and they throw it into Fedor, so it's a tough task. But I thought the girls did a good job, it's just that Elmira's a good team."
Turnovers, tempo turned the tide
Pace of play was quick, with each team creating turnovers on the defensive end. Elmira ended up forcing more, leading to several layups that spearheaded a 23-7 scoring edge in the final quarter. Elmira's lead was 40-38 after three.
While scoring was led by Abrams and Fedor, the Express' up-tempo style is a team-focused approach on both ends of the court.
"It doesn't always show in the book, you've got Amarionah Dixon coming off the bench giving us 11 rebounds, you've got Payton Ross, who's been playing absolutely out of her mind the past couple weeks. Amiah Driscoll," Allen said.
He added players are starting to find their roles.
"Megan and Jea are kind of doing the heavy lifting offensively, but their teammates are really picking them up in other places and we're getting a different girl each night kind of being that third scorer," Allen said. "That's a nice luxury to have considering we're still missing Ellie (Clearwater), we're still missing Shay Wallace, we're still missing a couple other girls. To be 4-0 at this point with the learning curve of everything that's happening is good as a coach."
U-E showing potential
Union-Endicott overcame a 12-point deficit at the start of the fourth quarter Saturday to beat Horseheads, 52-50. Howell has been impressed by his players' resiliency early in the season, something Allen said is also a strength for the Express.
Elmira won four consecutive Section 4 Class AA titles before last season, when no champions were crowned in Section 4. Allen was an assistant to Jake Dailey during that run and Elmira has continued its fast-paced style and winning ways with Allen as head coach.
"We told the girls that we are going to get everybody's best every single night and I think maybe they didn't believe that at the start today," Allen said. "Union-Endicott's a good team. They're going to make some noise in Class A. We knew that coming in, we knew they were tough. I don't want to say we weren't prepared, but maybe we took things a little bit for granted. We had a big win against (Maine-Endwell), maybe a little layover, but I liked the way the team reacted afterward."
Up next
Elmira plays at Bishop Kearney at 4:15 p.m. Saturday in a meeting of traditional powers from Section 4 and Section 5. U-E plays at Binghamton at 1:45 p.m. Saturday.

Texto completo: Green wreaths with red bows lay against the white tombstones.
As they place the greenery at each of the 14,500 veterans graves at the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies in Cecil, Washington County this weekend, volunteers will say the deceased's name. They will take a moment to pause and thank him or her for their service to this country.
The event is called Wreaths Across America.
"The wreaths are not decorations," said Edward Hajduk, the director of the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs at a memorial service Friday. "They are wreaths of remembrance. This can be a hard time of the year for families who are missing a loved one.
"We come out here to remember those we lost, to honor those currently serving and to bring our children here to teach the next generation to value their freedom -- the freedom we all have because of these veterans."
[gps-image name="4566359_web1_PTR-WreathCemetery-1.jpg"]
In front of Hajduk, wreaths were displayed representing each branch of the service -- Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Space Force, Merchant Marine - as well as POW/MIA.
A brief ceremony was held to recognize each veteran in the cemetery, which encompasses 292 acres. It opened in 2008. The ceremony was on Facebook Live because of covid-19 concerns.
The tombstones are in a straight line.
"They are all in formation," said Hajduk, who served in the U.S. Navy. "Anyway you look, the graves are straight."
[gps-image name="4566359_web1_PTR-WreathCemetery100-121821.jpg"]
Volunteers began laying wreaths on Friday afternoon.
Event continues Saturday, Sunday
It will continue from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday and Sunday. On Friday, 1,000 boxes, each containing nine wreaths, was unloaded by some of the 3,000 to 4,000 volunteers who will be at the cemetery throughout the weekend.
Three of those volunteers are Bonnie Wishner, of Strabane; Dave Richards of Chartiers; and Mike Yanchak of North Strabane. They are members of the Red White and Blue Team from Washington County, which includes the Blue Knights, the local Masonic lodge and local fire department. The group hosts a motorcycle ride in the summer that raises money for the wreaths.
Wishner, the team leader, said her wish every year is for every veteran to have a wreath. Richards said it is so important to volunteer and to help others, especially veterans who have given so much.
Yanchak recalled placing wreaths in all weather -- from ice and snow, to wind and rain, and temperatures in the teens.
"I remember one year we couldn't get the boxes of wreaths open because they were frozen," he said.
Saturday is National Wreaths Across America Day. The mission is: Remember those we lost. Honor those currently serving. And teach the next generation about freedom.
Wreaths Across America was begun by Maine businessman Morrill Worcester in 1992. He owns Worcester Wreath Co. of Harrington, Maine. He donated extra wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
Each wreath costs $15. Everyone of them was sponsored for this year's Wreaths Across America event -- the 16th for the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies, said Brynnly Schwartz, Wreaths Across America coordinator. "This is not political, and it's not religious."
"This is the cost of freedom," Hajduk said as he looked out over the graves. "They are from all backgrounds and walks of life. They made the ultimate sacrifice. We will not forget. We will never forget what these men and women gave to our country."
National Cemetery of the Alleghenies is one of 2,700 cemeteries participating in all 50 states. There are more than 2 million volunteers nationwide.
On Jan. 22, volunteers will remove the wreaths.
"We are forever grateful for the thousands of supporters who dedicate their time and effort to fulfilling our mission on a local level," said Karen Worcester, executive director, Wreaths Across America in a statement. "These individuals and their communities know the value of remembering the fallen, honoring those who currently serve and teaching the next generation about the sacrifices made for our freedom every day. And without their continued support, Wreaths Across America would not exist."
"This is more than a wreath," Wishner said. "It's important to say their name. And thank them. Spend time at their grave. Remember them."

MADISON – Douglas “Doug” Denico passed on Oct. 22, 2021, at home after a courageous struggle with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, with his family by his side. He was born in Waterville on Feb. 7, 1944 to Agnes Lewis and Carlton Denico.He earned a Masters in Forestry from the University of Maine at Orono and worked in the Industry he loved until he retired from Plum Creek.Not one to sit idle, after a short time away he was appointed to the position of State Forester in 2011 for Governor LePage and after a few short years also assumed the responsibility for Maine’s Public Lands. These last few years, working in this capacity, for the people of Maine, were the most rewarding of his career. These were the things that Doug did, which were only a small part of who Doug was.During his childhood he lived in many different locations throughout Central Maine, but his childhood home would always be his Grandmother Denico’s farm in Vassalboro. This is where he had adventures with his dog, raised ducks, rode horses, flooded neighbors fields during misguided attempts to build dams, worked hard and built the character of the man he would become.After he married he spent the remainder of his years at his home in Madison. He raised his family and worked on his wood lots. Many weekends were dedicated to working in the woods because he just enjoyed it.In 1973 he built a camp on Haymock Lake; years of trips down the lake in his small canoe to get to camp with his family. No matter what time of day or night, no matter the weather, the trip down the lake could be made to get to camp to make more family memories at Haymock. In later years he was able to make life a bit easier and built a road to his camp, inviting many valued friends, who became family as well.Doug loved a good joke. He loved to tease his children and grandchildren, making up wild stories and creating elaborate schemes to pull off the next whopper. He loved the Maine woods, hunting, fishing and just spending time in it. He had an eidetic memory and could tell you the exact spot he shot a deer in 1969 or a bird 30 years ago. He took pride in being a good friend. He may not have said it often, but he loved his family, teaching them the things that he knew and loved. He loved daschuands Peanut, Charlie and PJ almost more than his own children. If you ask his children, they may say he loved them more.He was a unique man, a man probably born out of his time. A man who hopefully left the world a bit of a better place than when he came into it.He is survived by his children, Kathy Corraro and her husband Rick, Tonia Denico and Tamara Denico, son of his heart Robert Bagley and his wife Janet and daughter of his heart Jeannine Annis; grandchildren, Brandy, Luke, Rowan, Lief, Hannah; great-grandchildren, Joshua, Piper, and Bryce Petrucci, Shane, Nathan and Caden Mehlhouse, Sean Denico, Emma, and Carter Goodridge; beloved dogs, Charlie and PJ; and many deeply valued friends. He was predeceased by his parents; wife Rea; brother Fredrick; mother-in-law Ruth, father-in-law Earl.The family wishes to express deep gratitude to Dr. Jacqueline Garcia at Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. R. Gupta of Alfond Cancer Care for their tireless effort to give their father more time with his family.A Celebration of Life will be held on Jan. 16 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Turner Poulin Union Hall at 676 US Rt. 201 Skowhegan ME.

Texto completo: UPDATED 2:05 P.M. FRIDAY: Lewiston announced a winter parking ban will be in effect from 5 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. For parking alternatives and winter tips, visit lewistonmaine.gov/winter.
UPDATED 12:19 P.M. FRIDAY: Auburn declared a parking ban will be in effect from 6 p.m. Saturday to 9 a.m. Sunday.
UPDATED NOON FRIDAY: After temperatures reached as high as 50 overnight in Maine, winter returns Friday with gusty winds and falling temperatures. A wind advisory has been issued for interior areas with sustained winds from 10 mph to 25 mph and localized gusts up to 55 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-28040669" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/NWSfriwindmap121721.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="768" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/NWSfriwindmap121721.jpg" />
Areas to the south of the mountains could have wind gusts from 25 mph to 35 mph.

After a day of strong wind gusts Friday, much of northern New England is set to see its first significant snowfall of the season this weekend.
Half a foot of snow is possible in most of southern and central Maine, and eastern and northern parts of the state could get a little bit less.
The snow is expected to start falling Saturday afternoon in most of New Hampshire, the National Weather Service said. Much of the state also could see up to 8 inches of snow, but some spots south and east of Manchester were expected to get more of a wintry mix of precipitation.

Texto completo: SOUTH PARIS — A Connecticut man accused of fatally stabbing a fellow carnival worker in Fryeburg in September was charged with murder Friday.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-26928255" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/10/CarlosNegron-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/CarlosNegron.jpg" />
An Oxford County grand jury indicted Carlos A. Negron, 46, of knowing or intentional murder of Anderson Gomes, 31, a charge punishable by 25 years to life in prison.
Negron also is charged with manslaughter, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in prison.
Both men had worked at a carnival at the Fryeburg Fairgrounds that had been in operation during the Fryeburg Fair a week earlier.
According to investigators, witnesses said Gomes had been upset about not getting a ride back to Connecticut from the fairgrounds with other fair workers on Oct. 13.
Witnesses told Maine State Police that Gomes had been drinking and had become belligerent.
One witness said she heard Gomes had punched a man in the face. That witness said she then saw Gomes on top of the man. After someone pulled Gomes off the man, he continued to behave in a belligerent and confrontational manner when Negron came from behind a trailer and appeared to punch Gomes, the witness said.
A witness heard Negron tell Gomes: “Don’t f— with my family,” according to a police affidavit.
That same witness then heard Gomes’ girlfriend yell that he had been stabbed. Gomes “continued to walk around in a belligerent, argumentative manner,” then sat down on the steps of a camper, the witness told investigators.
A witness told police she’d heard Gomes had been unhappy that his girlfriend had been flirting with Negron.
When interviewed, Negron said he’d been drinking that night with Gomes, who left and returned later with “an attitude.”
The two started throwing punches that missed each other.
Negron told investigators “he does not remember stabbing Andy and that it was a blur.”
He said he kept his knife inside a black pouch clipped to his pants. He told investigators he left the scene of the fight and threw the knife into a field.
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner determined the cause of Gomes’ death was due to multiple sharp force wounds and ruled his death a homicide.
Negron is being held without bail pending trial.

Koral Morin and Lewiston take care of rival Edward Little

Texto completo: AUBURN — Koral Morin seemingly couldn’t miss in the second quarter.
The Lewiston sophomore scored 11 consecutive points and spurred the Blue Devils to a huge second period en route to a 51-29 girls basketball victory over rival Edward Little on Friday.
“I put in the time outside of practice, in practice, to improve and I work hard,” Morin said. “I was just trying to shoot with confidence and not let the noise get to me.”
Lewiston (1-1) took control of the game early and jumped out to a 10-2 lead. Natalie Beaudoin and Morin each hit a 3-pointer and Aiwen Maiwen scored a couple baskets at the hoop.
The Red Eddies (0-3), though, quickly pulled back into the game, as five players scored during a tw0-minute stretch to cut the deficit to 12-11.
Lewiston’s lead was 15-11 heading into the second quarter.
Then Morin took over, hitting three 3-pointers in a row to help Lewiston outscore Edward Little 16-2 in the period.
Morin, who scored a game-high 19 points, said that Blue Devils coach Craig Jipson encourages her to shoot when she is open.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-28049864" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/27984824_SJ.SPTLewELGirlsHoopsP.12182112.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="500" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/27984824_SJ.SPTLewELGirlsHoopsP.12182112.jpg" />
“He said if you’re open to shoot with confidence, and if you’re not, look for your teammates,” Morin said. “I owe it to my teammates, they got me some really good looks, and to God, he gives me confidence.”
Maiwen and Masya Way got in foul trouble at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter, and had to spend a lot of the second sitting on the bench. Morin’s 11 points and five from Beaudoin more than made up for their absences.
“(Morin) shot the lights out and really carried us in the second quarter,” Jipson said. “I am really pleased because Aiwen and Masya were in foul trouble, and we could sit them in part because of Koral. Natalie had to play post defense instead of guard, and I was really, really happy with our defense.”
The Blue Devils didn’t quite maintain the momentum in the third quarter. But the Eddies struggled to make up ground. Both teams created turnovers and neither team shot particularly well in the period.
“I just think that in the third we had the opportunity to get back in the game but we didn’t make the most of our opportunities,” Edward Little coach Chris Cifelli said. “I think we forced shots and I think it was a combination of frustration and some clock watching, and so some shots were rushed. It’s not to say we were having a comeback, but our opportunity to comeback was in the third and we didn’t take advantage of it.”
Lewiston outscored Edward Little 9-0 in the third, but only had two points through the first 6:40 of the quarter. Beaudoin saved the third-quarter shutout with a chase-down block of Edward Little’s Madi Turcotte with 1:46 remaining.
“Defensively, in the third we did great,” Jipson said. “We needed to do a little better getting to shooters, but we just aren’t very deep. Overall, defensively, they had a very good night.”
Edward Little scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, paced by four of Jenny Chaput’s team-high seven points. Rachel Penny also scored seven points for the Red Eddies.
Cifelli said that the Eddies showed some positive flashes, but they need to stretch them into positive moments.
“I think we have a lot to work on,” Cifelli said. “We have a lot of soul searching to do, I think we have some definite things to make a decision on, the things we are going to try to maximize, the things we do well, and then try to get better at the things we don’t do so well. I think we have flashes of brilliance at times where there’s a lot of potential, but we have to sustain the longer periods of better play that we were having.”
Jipson said he was happy with how the Blue Devils bounced back from their loss to Oxford Hills earlier this week.
“I loved how we bounced back, showed a lot of character tonight,” Jipson said. “To play your rival is always hard, and they didn’t go to school today because of a situation at school so I think that was weighing on their minds tonight. They showed a lot of maturity.”

Texto completo: NORWAY — The Select Board on Thursday evening accepted nearly $8,000 from donations, the sale of scrap metal and criminal forfeitures.
The Acts of Kindness Foundation, a nonprofit arm of Daddy O’s restaurant in Oxford, donated $2,500 to assist needy residents who are not eligible for General Assistance funds.
“It is extremely important to us that no one be turned away should they fall between the cracks of the government’s requirements,” according to a letter accompanying the donation. “We want no one to be judged, just simply helped, with the assumption that they are asking because they truly have a need.”
Restaurant co-owners Aaron and Amanda Ouellette of Mechanic Falls have also presented $2,500 each to Paris and Oxford.
The board accepted $1,000 from New Balance shoe manufacturing company to provide portable heaters at the town ice rink. The company has a factory in Norway.
The Office of the Maine Attorney General gave the town $2,678 from a criminal forfeiture. Police Chief Robert Federico recommended the money be placed in the drug prevention account.
Lastly, the town earned $1,768.78 from the sale of scrap metal from the old highway garage. Highway Foreman Art Chappell had asked that it be put in the safety account.
The four donations totaled $7,946.78.
Town Manager Dennis Lajoie announced that Code Enforcement Officer Scott Tabb has submitted his resignation. His last day is Dec. 29.
Four residents in the area of Yagger Road expressed frustration with neighbors who moved in a couple of months ago on property owned by family members and are reportedly living in a trailer.
The four said there was an explosion on the site after midnight Dec. 10 and complained of activity before sunrise, which one described as the grinding of metal with generators running at all hours of the night. A walking path in the area no longer feels safe, they added.
Officials are working to address the issue through policing and code enforcement. Federico said his officers have been on the property at least a dozen times but found no criminal violations.
Any potential code issues are being addressed by Tabb.
Officials said they understood the frustration, but nothing could be done immediately.
“We need something concrete to move on,” Federico said, adding the investigation is ongoing.
The board approved an application for a BYOB event the the American Legion hall at 212 Main St. A Valentine Masquerade Ball and Dinner is planned at at 5 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 5.
Also approved were requests from Central Maine Power for poles at Pleasant Street and Abbott Road and a sec0nd pole at Solon Street and Paris Street.
Lajoie provided a list of members on the committee and subcommittees for the upcoming visioning and comprehensive plan, which the board approved.

DIXFIELD — Crews from multiple agencies battled a four-alarm fire at Irving Forest Products mill Friday evening.
Dixfield Fire Chief Scott Dennett said at the scene that the fire was in the rear of a production building and was contained shortly after 6 p.m., about two hours after it was reported.
“The fire is contained at this point,” he said. “We are currently doing an overhaul in the building, looking for hot spots.”
About 45 firefighters from departments in Dixfield, East Dixfield, Mexico, Rumford, Peru, Andover, Wilton and Jay responded to the scene.
“All Irving employees were evacuated,” Dennett said.
The first calls came in about 4 p.m. with flames reported at the sawmill at 24 Hall Hill Road. Less than an hour later, a fourth alarm was sounded and more crews were requested at the scene.
Central Maine Power was called to cut electricity to the area, although it was not immediately clear if that had been done by 5 p.m.
“They have personnel on site working to get the mill back online,” Dennett said. “I can’t say what they need to do or when they will be back in operation, you would have to call New Brunswick about that.”
JD Irving is based in Canada.
Its Dixfield mill produces 75 million board feet of pine lumber each year.
Acquired in 1998, the sawmill is North America’s largest producer of Eastern White Pine boards for interior and exterior finish applications. The sawmill serves as a market for loggers throughout the area.
J.D. Irving in Dixfield generated 20% of its own power, which has lowered emissions at the mill, as of 2020. That year, the mill celebrated a $26.5 million investment in a state-of-the-art planer mill. It’s one of the first of its type in the world and allowed Irving to use scanning technology to capture more value in the logs.

Texto completo: BASKETBALL
Chris Clemons had 26 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists as the Maine Celtics bounced back one night after having their seven-game winning streak snapped with a 111-99 win over the Long Island Nets on Friday night at the Portland Expo.
Long Island beat Maine 97-95 in overtime on Thursday night, the Celtics first loss since Nov. 12.
Jaysean Paige led Maine with 29 points and six rebounds, while Juwan Morgan added 20 points and seven rebounds. Theo Pinson had 12 points and Asante Gist added 11.
Bryce Brown had 26 points and Josh Gray had 21 for Long Island.
HOCKEY
ECHL: The Maine Mariners scored twice in the second period to take the lead for the second time in the game but had to settle for a 3-3 tie with the Lions in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec.
Patrick Shea scored 1:31 into the game to give Maine a 1-0 lead. Trois-RIvieres took the lead with two goals by Shawn St-Amant less than three minutes apart. The Mariners took the lead back in the second period with goals by Conner Bleackley and Mathew Santos, but the Lions tied it again when Jonathan Joannette scored with 2:41 left in the second.
Trois-Rivieres also beat Maine 4-2 on Wednesday night.
TENNIS
A rusty Rafael Nadal played his first match in more than four months on Friday, losing in straight sets to Andy Murray at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The 20-time Grand Slam champion’s chronic foot injury forced him to sit out the final months of this season. Nadal has not competed since early August, when he lost to Lloyd Harris in Washington. He missed Wimbledon, the Tokyo Olympics and the U.S. Open.
LUGE
OLYMPICS: The International Luge Federation has changed some of the qualifying rules for the upcoming Beijing Olympics, largely because many teams and sliders have been forced to use borrowed equipment for the last several weeks.
Instead of using the results from seven World Cup races through Jan. 10 to determine how to allocate starting spots to various nations, the federation decided that it would now eliminate the three worst finishes for each slider and re-calculate accordingly.
It could be a major boost for some athletes who struggled in recent weeks while not having their regular equipment. Nearly three dozen boxes of equipment – including some sleds, which typically are finely honed to each slider’s individual liking – did not make it out of China following three weeks of training there this fall, forcing some athletes to compete in the next three World Cup events without their regular gear.
The rule changes also could benefit athletes who have missed races and couldn’t accrue points. U.S. Olympic veteran Emily Sweeney, a former Falmouth resident, had to miss two World Cup races in Russia; she is an active soldier in the U.S. Army but couldn’t go to the races at the 2014 Sochi Olympics venue because of current military rules prohibiting travel to Russia.
SOCCER
U.S. MEN: Forward Jordan Morris is likely to play his first U.S. national team match in more than two years when the Americans face Bosnia and Herzegovina in an exhibition on Saturday.
Morris, a 27-year-old Seattle Sounders forward, tore his left ACL on Feb. 20 while on loan from Seattle to Swansea, three years after tearing his right ACL. He returned to the field for the Sounders on Nov. 1 and appeared in three club games.
Defender Aaron Long probably won’t play. Long tore his right Achilles tendon while playing for the New York Red Bulls on May 15 and has not appeared in a game since.
GERMANY: Robert Lewandowski took another old record from Bayern Munich great Gerd Muller on Friday.
The Poland star scored his 43rd Bundesliga goal of the year to cap a 4-0 win for Bayern over Wolfsburg and eclipse the previous best mark for goals in a calendar year set by Muller in 1972.
ENGLAND: Premier League managers will meet on Monday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation, which has already wiped out half of this weekend games and sidelined star players.
Outbreaks at clubs underscore the worsening health emergency in Britain as the omicron variant spreads. Opinions were wide-ranging regarding what steps to take from here. Some managers advocate a break in play, citing fairness. Others say the games should continue.
FRANCE: Crowd violence forced a French Cup game between Lyon and Paris FC to be abandoned at halftime, with score tied a 1-1.
The start of the second half at Stade Charlety in Paris had been delayed for about 50 minutes when stadium authorities announced over the speakers that the game was abandoned.
At halftime, supporters threw flares, the field was invaded, and fights broke out in the stands.
SKIING
WORLD CUP: Former overall champion Aleksander Aamodt Kilde kept up Norway’s success on the Saslong course by winning a men’s super-G in Selva di Val Gardena, Italy.
Austrian skiers Matthias Mayer and Vincent Kriechmayr finished second and third, respectively.
• Swiss skier Lara Gut-Behrami tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss the next four World Cup races in France, her team said.
Gut-Behrami, a two-time world championship gold medalist, won a super-G last Saturday at St. Moritz, Switzerland, and is fourth in the overall standings behind Mikaela Shiffrin.

Andrew Takacs’ 39 saves leads New Jersey Titans past Maine Nordiques

Texto completo: The Maine Nordiques are getting shots on goal, but that wasn’t enough Friday night.
New Jersey Titans goalie Andrew Takacs made 39 saves in a 4-2 victory over the Nordiques in a North American Hockey League East Division game at The Colisee.
“I feel like we produced enough shots to bury, but we got to keep working on to make sure it goes over the line to produce (a goal),” Maine Nordiques coach Matt Pinchevsky said. “I think we played a full 60 minutes tonight, which is really good for our hockey club. We are trending in the right direction here.”
Chris Carroll opened the scoring with under six minutes remaining in the first period to give the Titans (21-9-1, 43 points) a 1-0 lead.
Ryan Coughlin scored on the power play to give New Jersey a 2-0 lead a minute later. The assists went to Brendan Dumas and Anthony Calafiore.
Defenseman Evan Orloff scored his first goal of the season to put the Nordiques (9-13-3, 18 points) on the board with 3:14 remaining in the first period. Theo Thrun and Patrick Schmiedlin had the assists.
Zion Green tied the game at 2-2 nearly four minutes into the second period. Defensemen Matt Connor and Jacob Pellerin had the assists.
Pinchevsky said the Nordiques controlled the pace of play all night.
“I loved our pace, I loved how we were attacking all over the ice,” Pinchevsky said. “We played like we owned the (ice sheet); we did, we were at home. That’s the most-penalized team in the league, for them to have only two penalties, maybe that’s true, maybe it’s not, but that’s how the referees saw it. I know they are dealing with, constantly dealing with, pressure during the game. Statistically, it didn’t add up, but statistics don’t always have to add up. Team with the most penalties in the league and they are on the road, I thought we could have seen a couple more power plays.”
The Thunder were 0-for-2 on the power play while the Titans scored on both of their power plays.
Carroll scored his second goal of the game, this time coming on the power play five minutes into the second period, to give the Titans the lead back.
Pinchevsky said there was a missed call on the goal.
“The referees saw what they saw,” Pinchevsky said. “I am not going to make this about the officials, but part of their team — the goal judges — it must have been pretty definitive in the referees’ eyes because a goal judge informed us it was most certainly a high stick, but it’s not what the officials saw.”
Tommy Bannister scored midway through the third period to extend the Titans’ lead to 4-2.
Avery Sturtz made 46 saves for the Nordiques in the loss.
Maine hosts New Jersey on Saturday at 7 p.m. at The Colisee.
NOTES
Caden Pattison played in his 100th regular-season game for the Nordiques.
Former Twin City Thunder forward Levente Keresztes isn’t in the lineup for the New Jersey Titans this weekend as he’s representing his home country Hungary at the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Division IA Under-20 Championships this week.

Texto completo: Reading the article about Maine having another deadly year for pedestrians (“Maine on track for another deadly year for pedestrians,” Dec. 15), I was dismayed that although the author mentioned that drivers must be more vigilant, there was nothing about pedestrians doing so.
I believe that it really needs to be stressed that people need to be aware when crossing a street, or walking on the side of a road. I see too many people step out, especially at a crosswalk, with no care about whether a car will stop or not.
Do pedestrians have the right of way? Of course they do, but people need to take some responsibility.
If a car hits a person the driver could be at fault and very sad … but the pedestrian would be dead.

All are encouraged to attend this family-friendly event.
A family from All Saints Parish will donate $2 to Mid Coast Hunger Prevention Program for each person who comes to sing.

The lyrics for the carols will be provided to those who attend. Participants are asked to bring their own flashlights.
The Mid Coast Hunger Prevention Program assists community members in need through a soup kitchen, food bank, food pantry, and several other programs.
For more information, call the parish at 207-725-2624.

Auburn schools open after threat to Edward Little deemed not credible

Texto completo: AUBURN — A threatening social media message written by a former Edward Little High School student set off an overnight investigation by the Auburn police. After interviewing the individual early Friday morning, police determined the threat was not credible.
Auburn schools will be open Friday. The decision was made in consultation with law enforcement, Superintendent Cornelia Brown said.
According to a statement by Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen, the former student, who now lives in Sabattus, sent a friend a Snapchat message which pictured himself superimposed with guns. The message, which referenced violence, quickly went viral among students and staff, Moen said.
Snapchat is a cellphone application which allows users to send images of themselves with a brief caption.
Brown said the guns may have been Nerf guns, a type of toy.
Last night, Brown sent a short message to the school community addressing a wave of TikTok threats which have school across the country bolstering their police presence Friday. Law enforcement agencies have said they do not believe the threats, most of which did not name specific schools, were credible. The Snapchat message was sent shortly after.
Auburn Police officers interviewed the former student Friday morning at 2 a.m. and determined that he was not a threat to the Auburn school community, according to Moen’s statement. The District Attorney’s Office will consider criminal charges, he said.
The TikTok threat “has been deemed not credible, and it is regrettable that a social media platform is not more responsible for what it allows to be posted,” Brown said. “It seems to me that there ought to be some sort of ethical lenses these social media platforms, or standards, they need to be held to. Putting aside the obvious and very real concern to people, it’s a significant disruption in the kids’ lives.”
Brown said her daughter, who attends Cony High School in Augusta, will attend school Friday, and she believe it is safe for school to be in session.
Lewiston schools will be closed Friday due to an unrelated threat. While a social media threat from a student following an altercation at Lewiston Middle School was addressed by Lewiston police, school officials and city police decided to close all schools in the district as a precaution.

Texto completo: Parking bans, wind advisories and power crews on the ready. Sound familiar?
Cities and towns across the state were bracing Friday night for what may be the season’s first significant storm.
Snow in most areas is expected to begin falling Saturday afternoon. Lewiston-Auburn and surrounding towns were told to expect between 4 and 6 inches by the time the storm winds down Sunday morning.
Southern parts of the state might see up to 8 inches, weather forecasters said, while others may get more of a ‘wintry mix.”
To add to the fun, forecasters also reported that wind gusts could reach 55 mph, which could lead to tree limbs coming down on lines and power outages.
Police and city officials were preparing for what might be the first plowable amount of snow of the season.
Lewiston announced a winter parking ban will be in effect from 5 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. Auburn declared a parking ban will be in effect from 6 p.m. Saturday to 9 a.m. Sunday.
By late afternoon Friday, just about all area towns had announced similar parking bans as the storm swept toward Maine.

Texto completo: <img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-28042859" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/28037285_SJ.CITlePage2P.121821-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/28037285_SJ.CITlePage2P.121821.jpg" />
AUBURN – Friday afternoon, a fellow stood with his daughter in Walmart’s parking lot, pointing at the man ringing a bell to raise money for The Salvation Army.
“That’s Gov. Baldacci right there,” the man said convincingly — and plenty loud enough for the bell ringer to chuckle in response.
For Paul LePage, a two-term former governor, it was just another day on the campaign trail, where not quite everybody knows his name.
LePage said he’s been ringing the bell for The Salvation Army during the Christmas season since 1979, one way to repay the charity that helped him out as a poor child growing up in Lewiston.
LePage, a 73-year-old Edgecomb resident, is also gearing up for a long slog on the campaign trail next year as the Republican hopeful tries to unseat Gov. Janet Mills, the Democrat who succeeded him in 2018.
Meanwhile, it doesn’t hurt a candidate to get in the holiday spirit at a busy store a week before Christmas.
Most people hustling in and out of the big box store didn’t so much as glance at him. Those who did notice him often gave no indication they knew who he was, as they stuffed coins and bills into a red kettle.
But when they did realize that LePage stood there, they often hailed him or promised to vote for him. Only a couple had harsh words, including one who blamed him for President Donald Trump’s effort a year ago to subvert the results of the 2020 election. LePage told the guy he didn’t know exactly what Trump did.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-28042856" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/28037285_SJ.CITlePage1P.121821-1024x678.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/28037285_SJ.CITlePage1P.121821.jpg" />
He said later, though, that it is not true that he was always in lockstep with Trump. At one point, he said, Trump refused to speak to him for eight months because they disagreed on an issue.
LePage said he always thought Trump should have stayed off Twitter and toned down his rhetoric. Plus, he said, he would like to have heard Trump say “we” a lot more often and “I” much less frequently.
LePage and his wife, Ann, said their Christmases are always focused on family. It is a time to be together, they said, and to enjoy the holiday.
As a child, LePage said, his family relied on the church and charities, including The Salvation Army, to bring a little Christmas cheer to their poverty-stricken home on Lincoln Street.
To give an idea how poor they were, he said, one year he got a flashlight for Christmas to help him when he went down into the dark cellar to get wood. He didn’t get the batteries to operate it until the following Christmas.
This year, the couple will be at their house in Florida for Christmas, where the ex-governor is going for a routine medical procedure related to the bariatric surgery he had five years ago that helped him lose 85 pounds. LePage said he could get into the hospital right away in Florida, but it might have been eight months before he could do the same in Maine.
LePage said he plans to campaign full-tilt next year and to keep his focus on the issues. He said he wants to talk “pure policy,” not personalities, and to do what he can to lower the temperature of an overheated political landscape.
He is not oblivious to his own role in turning up the heat in years past, but insists that he has always been focused on making government work better and cheaper. That is what he is running on this time around.
So far, he said, it is going well. Though he knows it will not be an easy campaign, he said he feels confident he can win it.
“You can’t please everybody,” LePage said. “All you’ve got to do is please enough.”

Season outlook: Edward Little’s numbers are down on both the boys and girls teams this season, so scoring at championship meets will be tough, according to co-head coach Angie Jalbert. On the girls team, sophomore Makenna Drouin is poised to build off her successful freshman outdoor track and field season and be a top sprinter in the state. Breya Whitman also has potential to be a top KVAC jumper. Nathan Hyndman will be a jumper to watch on the boys team.
GRAY-NEW GLOUCESTER PATRIOTS
Coaches: Mike Griffin (eighth year), Todd Mercer (18th year)
Conference: WMC; Class: B
Returning athletes: Seniors — Cam Hargreaves, Max MacCallum, Seb Leighton, Ryland Moore, Morgan Curtis (jumps); Juniors — Joe Burgess, Lorenza Piper (shot put), Lexi Hutchings (shot put), Emma Hutchings (shot put).
Promising newcomers: Sophomores — Ella Brown (sprints), Maisie Lerette (shot put), Kylie Thibodeau (sprints), Trevor Amos, Braeden Chute, Preston Gerry, Thomas Ladd, Curtis Lang, Wyatt MacLean, Tony Reiling, Phil Soule; Freshmen — Cole Frey, Gavin Gerry, Connor Hughes, Samuel Klosenski, Cameron Meek, Cole Ouellette, Cole Thibodeau.
Season outlook: Gray-New Gloucester will rely on its throwers to lead the rest of the team this winter, according to coaches Mike Griffin and Todd Mercer. Lorenza Piper finished in second place in the shot put and the discus at the 2021 Class B outdoor state meet, while Lexi Hutchings, Max MacCallum and Seb Leighton all are state meet qualifiers in the shot put.
LEAVITT HORNETS
Coach: Jamie Juntura (10th year)
Conference: KVAC; Class: B
Returning athletes: Seniors — Jack Boutaugh, Reeve Twitchell, Josh Chretian, Jacob Wilcox, Blaine Shaw, Manuel Driscoll, Jon Schomaker; Junior — Emma Couturier.

Season outlook: While the girls team is small, coach Jamie Juntura said it is mighty. “There is a lot of new talent on the team and the girls have already shown they are ready to work hard to accomplish their season goals,” Juntura added. Serae Fish finished in second place in the high jump in the team’s first meet of the season. On the boys side, the senior-laden team is looking to have a successful season. The Hornets have football linemen Jack Boutaugh, Reeve Twitchell and Josh Chretian throwing shot put, and Chretian finished second in the shot in the team’s first meet. “The underclassmen are having a great start to their indoor career and should make a splash in competitions throughout the season,” Juntura said.
LEWISTON BLUE DEVILS
Coach: Steve Virgilio (third year)
Conference: KVAC; Class: A
2019 results: Boys: first in KVAC, seventh in Class A; Girls: third in KVAC, 10th in Class A.
Returning athletes: Seniors — Abdirizak Abukar (sprints), Josh Brito (sprints), Prince Likibi (sprints, jumps), Jabreel Muhammad-Aceto (hurdles, jumps), Ari Santana (sprints, jumps), Amelia Wedderburn (sprints, jumps); Juniors — Feysal Abdirahaman (middle distance), Adam Bilodeau (hurdles, jumps), Farid Muhammad-Aceto (sprints, shot put), Deston Rogers (sprints), Julien Turmenne (middle distance).
Key losses: Alem Vassell (sprints), Bryce DuFour (middle distance), Sydney Roy (shot put).
Promising newcomers: Seniors — Raimundo Lubota (sprints, shot put), Wayne Shaw (shot put), Aydrianna Bowman (jumps, shot put), Lexi Freeman (hurdles, pole vault, sprints); Junior — Danny Zhang (middle distance); Sophomores — Zawadi Debola (middle distance), Naisha Francisco (sprints, jumps); Freshmen — Somana Hassan (middle distance), Jenni Flynn (sprints, jumps), Ryker Paradis (shot put), Marissa Beaulieu (middle distance).
Season outlook: Lewiston head coach Steve Virgilio said that the Blue Devils’ boys and girls teams should be “Competitive at the KVAC and championship levels.” On the girls side, Lewiston has many newcomers that Virgilio said could “emerge in the top-10 at the state level,” including Amelia Wedderburn, who is a top jumper and sprinter in the KVAC. On the boys team, Virgilio thinks depth will help the Blue Devils compete at the state level. Jabreel Muhammad-Aceto is a top hurdler and jumper in Class A, while Farid Muhammad-Aceto is a top thrower and sprinter.
POLAND KNIGHTS
Coach: Laurie Gaudreau (second year)
Conference: WMC; Class: B
Returning athletes: Seniors — Domenic Antonelli, Tory Davis, Riley Day, Lucas Frechette, Ellen Marquis-Boutin, Arianna Miller, Evelyn Miller, Tyler Robbins, Trinity Sands, Emma Turkington, Jake Twigg, Christian Vachon; Juniors — Nick Garry, Nolan Garry, Lagan O’Driscoll; Sophomores — Abby Hamilton-Borkowski, Dodge Lafrinea, Cadyn Langlois, Jonathan McNally, Alerick Sands.
Promising newcomers: Freshmen — Brianna Corriveau, Autumn Demelia, Jason Garneau, Connor Neal, Nolan O’Driscoll.
Season outlook: Second-year head coach Laurie Gaudreau is focusing on the positives this winter. “The focus for (our) season is not what they can’t do, but what they can,” Gaudreau said. “This is a team that focuses on their strengths and will build upon them. Without the availability to practice at an indoor facility twice a week, many events like long jump, triple jump, etc., will not be at the same advantage as the running and throwing events.” Ellen Marquis-Boutin should be a point scorer at the championship meets in the girls sprints and jumps, while Jake Twigg should score points in the boys distance events.
ST. DOM’S/LISBON/OAK HILL/WINTHROP
Coach: Tyler Shennett (first year)
Conference: WMC; Class: B
Returning athletes: Seniors — Hunter Burkhardt, Darien Davis, Sydney Dick; Juniors — Matt Homan, Abbie Mitchell, Chloe Whited, Aidan Laviolette.
Key losses: Liam Levasseur, Owen Mitchell, Sarah Brown, James Cognata.
Promising newcomers: Seniors — Autumn Gerry, Joshua Gosselin; Junior — Kiana Goldberg; Sophomores — Emmet Mooney, Cadence White; Freshman — Jack Gilpatric, Aiden Walling.
Season outlook: The co-op between St. Dom’s, Lisbon, Oak Hill and Winthrop is replacing a lot of athletes from the indoor track season two years ago. With first-year head coach Tyler Shennett at the helm, with the help of assistant Dan Campbell, the team hopes to continue its success in the distance events. “Two years ago, the last indoor season, we had the boys state title-winning 4×800 team, and with new acquisitions and exciting prospects the distance team is hoping to retain the title,” Shennett said. “Hunter Burkhardt and Joshua Gosselin will be two of our top distance runners and we have high hopes for them this season.”

Texto completo: The University of Maine System will require COVID-19 vaccinations for staff and students when the federal government gives final approval to the vaccines and they are no longer in emergency use authorization.
The system has said for months it would consider a vaccine requirement pending final approval and made the announcement Friday as it also unveiled other COVID-19 protocols for the fall semester, which starts Aug. 30.
"We want to make it clear as we prepare to start the academic year that in fact when a vaccine has regular approval we will in fact be requiring it," Chancellor Dannel Malloy said. "It also ties to the fact students will be showing up relatively soon. The bulk of them will be with us in late August and we want to be very clear. If regular approval is granted at some point, then vaccination will be required. Don't wait and have to scramble."
The UMaine System already has announced plans for a more traditional fall semester with the bulk of classes and activities being held in person, as they were before the pandemic. But Friday's announcement outlined that some coronavirus safety protocols and rules will remain in place for unvaccinated staff and students.
Unvaccinated staff and students who plan to attend classes and work in-person will be required to participate in COVID-19 testing upon arriving on campuses and will have to quarantine while they await test results.
The university system is following state guidance and will drop masking requirements for vaccinated people indoors on July 26, though unvaccinated people still will be asked to wear face coverings in university buildings going forward.
Students and staff are being asked to verify their vaccination status through an online portal. So far over, 5,000 of the system's 35,000 staff and students have verified they are vaccinated, the system said Friday. Those who register as vaccinated before Aug. 20 will be exempt from the testing and quarantine arrival protocols.
During the semester, unvaccinated staff and students who are in-person can expect to participate in asymptomatic COVID-19 testing as often as once per week. "It will in all likelihood be once or twice per week, depending on the circumstances and what happens with the delta variant," Malloy said. "CDC may very well recommend more frequent testing as that variant becomes more common in Maine and elsewhere."
The system is already conducting weekly asymptomatic testing of in-person students and staff who are unvaccinated during the summer in a carry-over from the testing regime last spring. In the last 14 days there have been 476 tests conducted and no positive results.
Hundreds of colleges and universities around the country, including several in Maine, have announced plans to require students, staff or both to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the fall. On Friday the University of Vermont was among the latest schools to announce a vaccine requirement for students.
Students at the University of Connecticut and in the University of Massachusetts System also will be required to get vaccinated. Rhode Island, in a rare step this week, announced that state will be the first in the nation where all institutions of higher learning both public and private will require COVID-19 vaccinations for students this fall.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Hampshire have passed a bill that would prohibit public colleges and universities from mandating vaccines and sent the bill to the governor for his signature last week. The University System of New Hampshire is still strongly encouraging students, faculty and staff to get vaccinated, Lisa Thorne, the system's director of communications, said in an email Friday.
In Maine, Malloy said the system envisions requiring the vaccine for both students and staff when full approval is granted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though the system has noted that whatever policy is approved will "recognize and respect" that some individuals are not able to be vaccinated.
All three vaccines available in the United States are currently in emergency use authorization. On Friday CNN reported that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been granted priority review for its application for a full license. An FDA official told CNN a decision on full approval could come within two months.
In the meantime, the University of Maine System is continuing to encourage all students and employees who are able to get vaccinated. On-campus vaccination clinics are being planned for the start of the fall semester, including a weekly series of clinics at the University of Maine during August and September.
The system also is launching a $1,000 Shot Clock Scholarship and will be awarding $1,000 scholarships on a weekly basis between now and Aug. 20 to students who verify their status as fully vaccinated online.

Texto completo: The system also announced plans for unvaccinated students and staff to participate in required COVID testing and quarantine upon arriving on campuses this fall.

The University of Maine System will require COVID-19 vaccinations for staff and students when the federal government gives final approval to the vaccines and they are no longer in emergency use authorization.
The system has said for months it would consider a vaccine requirement pending final approval and made the announcement Friday as it also unveiled other COVID-19 protocols for the fall semester, which starts Aug. 30.
“We want to make it clear as we prepare to start the academic year that in fact when a vaccine has regular approval we will in fact be requiring it,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy said. “It also ties to the fact students will be showing up relatively soon. The bulk of them will be with us in late August and we want to be very clear. If regular approval is granted at some point, then vaccination will be required. Don’t wait and have to scramble.”
The UMaine System already has announced plans for a more traditional fall semester with the bulk of classes and activities being held in person, as they were before the pandemic. But Friday’s announcement outlined that some coronavirus safety protocols and rules will remain in place for unvaccinated staff and students.
Unvaccinated staff and students who plan to attend classes and work in-person will be required to participate in COVID-19 testing upon arriving on campuses and will have to quarantine while they await test results.
The university system is following state guidance and will drop masking requirements for vaccinated people indoors July 26, though unvaccinated people still will be asked to wear face coverings in university buildings going forward.
Students and staff are being asked to verify their vaccination status through an online portal. So far over, 5,000 of the system’s 35,000 staff and students have verified they are vaccinated, the system said Friday. Those who register as vaccinated before Aug. 20 will be exempt from the testing and quarantine arrival protocols.
During the semester, unvaccinated staff and students who are in-person can expect to participate in asymptomatic COVID-19 testing as often as once per week. “It will in all likelihood be once or twice per week, depending on the circumstances and what happens with the delta variant,” Malloy said. “CDC may very well recommend more frequent testing as that variant becomes more common in Maine and elsewhere.”

Texto completo: Two former police officers in Maine have pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges stemming from an incident in which they beat porcupines to death with their batons while on duty, Sagadahoc County District Attorney Natasha Irving told CNN.
Addison Cox and Michael Rolerson both pleaded guilty on Thursday to one count of night hunting and one count of misdemeanor animal cruelty, Irving said.
Cox received a 90-day sentence, with all but 10 days suspended for the animal cruelty charge, and seven days for the night hunting charge, which will be served concurrently. Cox will also have to pay a fine, complete community service and receive treatment for PTSD, Irving said.
Rolerson was sentenced to 270 days in jail, with all but 20 days suspended, and seven days for the night hunting charge, which will also be served concurrently. He will also pay a fine, perform community service and undergo treatment for PTSD, according to Irving.
CNN has reached out to Cox and Rolerson's attorneys but has not yet received a response.
CNN has previously reported that both officers were fired from the Rockland Police Department following a criminal and internal investigation into allegations against them.
The incidents took place in early June 2020 but were not reported until late August by another Rockland police officer, The Courier Gazette reported.
Police Chief Chris Young confirmed the termination of two officers in a statement on Facebook but would not divulge their identities or any details, citing state law relating to employee discipline. Young declined to comment to CNN.
A third officer was placed on administrative leave for allegedly filming a video of Rolerson killing a porcupine, The Courier Gazette reported in October.
The animal cruelty charges against Cox and Rolerson were dropped to misdemeanors because the men appear to be suffering from PTSD, according to Irving. Both Cox and Rolerson are combat veterans.
"Our belief from the investigation is they seem to be having PTSD symptoms," she said. "We want these guys to get the treatment they need."
Rolerson estimated that he killed eight porcupines while Cox said he killed three in the report compiled by the Bureau of Warden Services, according to The Courier Gazette.
Both men "took responsibility" for their actions, Irving added. After their release, the goal is to get them the treatment they need so "they don't act cruelly to any animals ever in their lifetime."
CNN's Allen Kim contributed to this report.

Pushing Beyond Sex Assault, Gillibrand Faces Resistance to Military Bill

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — After years of resistance from Pentagon leaders, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., appeared to be nearing victory on a major change to how the military handles sexual assault cases. But her emphasis on the inclusion of all serious crimes in the measure as a matter of racial justice now threatens to weaken her support.
Gillibrand’s push to remove commanders from decisions in the prosecution of sexual assault cases had gained bipartisan backing despite opposition from military leaders. Last month, President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III endorsed a similar change recommended by an independent military panel.
But Austin and some of Gillibrand’s strongest allies in Congress on this issue are balking at the more extensive changes to the military justice system. Some lawmakers say they had only recently focused on the particulars of the measure after months of discussions.
“Her bill is far broader than I had realized,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, an early proponent of Gillibrand’s measure. “I believe she’s made a compelling case on sexual assault and related allegations to be taken out of the chain of command.”
But Collins said she did not think there was justification for moving other alleged crimes out of the military justice system.
Gillibrand’s bill would remove the decision to prosecute major crimes like sexual assault and other felonies such as murder from military commanders to military prosecutors. The Pentagon panel suggested a more limited change: that a special victims unit within the military should be set up for sex assault cases and a few other crimes.
But Gillibrand argues that would create an unequal system and has said her proposal would also help combat racial injustice.
A bill that would cover most felonies is “necessary,” she said Tuesday on the Senate floor, “because the current military justice system is simply not delivering justice, especially not to service members of color.”
This tactic has helped bring other voices to her cause.
“Racial and gender biases in the military have resulted in the underprosecution of sex assault cases and the overprosecution of Black and brown officers,” Rep. Anthony Brown , D-Md., a veteran and former Army judge advocate general, said in an interview this week.
While prosecutorial disparities in the military have existed throughout time, he said, “I think in aftermath of George Floyd’s tragic murder, it really propelled many of us to say, ‘Hey, this is a real opportunity here to fix these inequities and disparities.’”
Studies over the years have noted racial disparities in military justice, including in how discipline is administered.
The tension building over Gillibrand’s measure and the narrower changes recommended by the military commission presents potentially tricky terrain for Austin, who has said that more forcefully addressing sexual assault, racism and extremism in the ranks are among his top priorities.
Many military leaders who reject changes in the sexual assault cases might also oppose losing other prosecutorial powers. But the focus on other crimes also could alienate some of Gillibrand’s supporters — many of whom were brought along after years of courting.
“My inclination now is to do sexual assault,” Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said after previously saying he would sign on with Gillibrand. “That’s been the target of our work for eight years.”
Gillibrand still appears to enjoy support among the roughly 70 senators from both parties who got on board this spring. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has been on her side for years, while some Democrats, like Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, only recently joined her efforts.
“There’s a lot of reasons to professionalize the way you treat felonies,” said Kaine, who once practiced law. “Kirsten has a bright line that maybe was a little different than the way she was drawing the line earlier. But it’s a line that makes sense to us lawyers.”
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., agreed. “As a lawyer and former prosecutor, I think there is some value in having continuity, saying any felony crime is going to be handled the same way no matter what it is. I like that as a former prosecutor, and I like it as a defense lawyer. To me it’s a plus.”
Both men said they support the bill as written but welcome further debate on the proposed changes, which would require an act of Congress.
Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, now supports the change in sexual assault prosecutions after years of resistance. But he is a leading voice against expanding this process to other crimes.
The data on racial disparities is mixed and at times inconclusive, owing in large part to the military’s failure to keep consistent data on race and the justice system, several reports have noted.
A recent report by the Government Accountability Office found that Black and Hispanic service members were more likely than whites to be tried in a court-martial proceedings across the military but that race “was not a statistically significant factor for a conviction.”
A report last year by the Air Force inspector general found that Black service members are 1.64 times more likely to be suspects in Office of Special Investigations criminal cases but said that “the identification of racial disparity does not automatically mean racial bias or racism is present.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: A Colorado police officer was in court Tuesday morning at a bail hearing for an assault charge he faces for allegedly tasing and injuring a 75-year-old man while responding to a call at the man's apartment.
According to a news release from the police department last week, Idaho Springs Police Officer Nicholas Hanning and another officer responded to a disturbance call May 30, when a male suspect allegedly answered the door "holding a club-like object with what appeared to be teeth along the edges," and then got into a physical altercation with officers.
"After multiple commands were given by both officers, Officer Hanning deployed his Taser. The male was injured as a result, and ultimately taken to St. Anthony's hospital for medical care," prosecutors said.
Attorney Sarah Schielke said in a statement on Facebook that her client, Michael Clark, 75, was involved in the altercation with officers and was unarmed.
The tasing caused Clark heart complications followed by a stroke, carotid surgery on his neck and a burst appendix, according to Schielke's statement. He is still in a hospital and in poor health, she said.
Prosecutors, as well as Hanning's defense attorney and the victim's attorney, looked to Tuesday's hearing to provide clarity on releasing footage from police body-worn cameras in compliance with Colorado's new police accountability law.
The law, signed by Gov. Jared Polis on July 6, addresses a broad scope of police accountability measures ranging from body and dash camera requirements to training and appropriation of state police funding. The law also provides a timeline in which body camera footage must be released.
In her Facebook post, Schielke said Clark's family wants to see Hanning's body camera footage to find out exactly what happened to him.
The post included a statement from his children. "Our dad hasn't been able to sleep in his own bed since May 30," the children, identified as Cynthia and Jeremy said. "The taser wrecked his heart. He's lost everything. All independence. All happiness ... This is just so, so wrong. We won't wait another minute because our dad may not have another minute. Our family deserves the truth now."
Footage to be released by July 29, judge rules
Schielke said Idaho Springs Police Chief Nathan Buseck and Clear Creek County District Attorney Heidi McCollum had refused to release the videos.
McCollum told CNN Monday she was looking for clarification from the court on the new law before releasing the body camera footage to Clark's family or the public.
"The parties (at Tuesday's hearing) discussed the new law's call for efficient release of law enforcement-type video footage, while weighing the privacy rights of victims, witnesses and defendants 'caught' on the footage during the incident, medical transport of the victim, emergency responders, etc." a news release from the district attorney's office said.
Clear Creek County Judge Cynthia Jones ruled the body camera footage with required blurring must be released to the public no later than July 29, according to the release.
Jones also dismissed the defense's motion requesting to seal Hanning's arrest warrant for third degree assault against an at-risk person, a felony.
The affidavit for the warrant describes portions of the body camera footage recorded as Hanning and another officer responded to an apartment complex because of a reported assault. A neighbor of Clark's told a dispatcher that he had knocked her in her face, the document says.
The affidavit says the video shows the officers going to Clark's apartment and there is a verbal confrontation where Hanning tells Clark to put "it" down. Within seconds Clark puts a sword on a shelf, the document says.
The two officers give Clark differing commands as he complains about the noise his neighbors were making, the affidavit says.
Then Hanning uses his Taser.
"At 22:51:07 hours, without commands or warning Ofc. HANNING fires his Taser, which strikes Clark in the abdomen and pelvic area," the document says.
Clark falls backward, hits a dining room chair and lands on the floor, according to the affidavit.
Clark's attorney pleased with ruling
Schielke said she thought Jones did a great job interpreting and applying the state's new law during Tuesday's hearing.
"The important thing about this law is the release of body cam is supposed to prompt and inventible," Schielke said. "Those two things were honored today."
Hanning, who has worked for the department since October 2017, will next appear in court on August 24, according to the DA's release.
CNN reached out to an attorney for the officer but has not heard back.
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident. Police said the city is evaluating Hanning's employment status.
The other officer, Ellie Summers, "received internal disciplinary action per departmental policy regarding a policy violation and remains employed with ISPD," a police release from last week says. Summers has been with the department since June 2019.
Idaho Springs is in the Rocky Mountains about 30 miles west of Denver. In 2010, the city had a population of 1,717 people.

Texto completo: Top Democrats are quietly moving to lock down support for President Joe Biden's imperiled nominee to head a key agency overseeing firearms -- while also struggling to find consensus on a slimmed-down bill to expand background checks for gun sales -- the latest example of how the politics of gun control remains a divisive subject in the narrowly divided Congress.
Biden nominated David Chipman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in April, seeking the first Senate-confirmed director of the agency since 2015 and just the second in its history. But Chipman -- a career official at ATF for 25 years and more recently a top adviser with Giffords, a group that advocates for stricter gun laws -- has come under fire from the National Rifle Association, turning off some moderate Republicans and causing some squeamishness among centrist Democrats.
Chipman has privately been holding one-on-one meetings with wayward senators to assure them he respects the Second Amendment, planning a meeting with GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Wednesday, meeting with independent Sen. Angus King of Maine on Monday and even meeting with pro-gun groups in West Virginia and GOP Gov. Jim Justice at Sen. Joe Manchin's request.
Some are still not sold.
"The issue is whether he's the right guy for the job," King, who caucuses with Democrats, told CNN on Tuesday. "My question is whether he can be an effective director. I haven't decided yet."
Republican opposition is stiffening, with King's Maine colleague, GOP Sen. Susan Collins, announcing her plans to vote against the nomination, underscoring the likelihood that Democrats need to keep all 50 of their members united to see the nomination confirmed.
The first key procedural vote -- to discharge the nomination to the floor after it deadlocked in the Senate Judiciary Committee last week -- could happen as soon as this week, Democrats say.
"We're still working on it," Manchin said when asked Tuesday if he'd back Chipman, adding that they had a "very candid conversation."
The issue comes amid a rise in mass shootings in the United States and as Democrats have been trying for months to draft legislation aimed at overcoming GOP resistance to measures aimed at curbing the use of guns. The House approved two bills to expand background checks on firearm sales, including one to do so on private and commercial transactions, but that lacks the support of moderate Democrats like Manchin and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised that the two House-passed bills will get a Senate procedural vote -- but he has pushed his colleagues to find consensus on a new deal that could get all 50 Democrats on board, even as they may still lack 60 votes to overcome a GOP filibuster.
Democrats eye narrow background checks deal
Behind the scenes, two Connecticut Democrats -- Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal -- have each worked on separate legislative efforts to deal with gun violence.
Murphy has been trying to find GOP support for a slimmed-down background checks bill that would be even narrower than the bill Republicans blocked in 2013 -- after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- to require checks for sales at gun shows and across the internet but exempt private transfers.
That bill, drafted by Manchin and GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, stands little chance of passing the 50-50 Senate. So Murphy has been trying to see if there's consensus with Republicans on a bill to expand checks at gun shows -- leaving aside internet sales -- in order to pass some gun bill this Congress.
Murphy has been in talks with Manchin, Toomey and GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to see if they can cut a bipartisan deal. But the Democrat says it's still an open question whether there are 60 votes "for anything meaningful" on closing the so-called gun show loophole and dealing with "a couple other issues."
"The feeling is it might be a little bit easier for Republicans to support because it's a real defined universe," Murphy said of focusing mainly on gun shows. "So we're not there yet."
Blumenthal is trying to see if there's a deal with Graham on a bill to bolster so-called red-flag laws that would empower states to remove guns from individuals deemed mentally unfit. But both Blumenthal and Murphy acknowledged that it seemed doubtful that a vote on gun legislation could occur before the August recess -- given that action will be dominated by infrastructure over the next few weeks.
"I'm not sure it's on the front burner right now," Blumenthal said.
Fight over Chipman
But the fight over Chipman's nomination could come to a head within days.
Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona said they are still reviewing the nomination. Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, told CNN he has not spent time yet deciding whether he would vote for Chipman.
"I haven't made a determination yet," Tester said.
Democratic leaders said they are whipping the nomination to see if they can get 50 votes.
"I would say there's a hesitation, but it's understandable," said Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, referring to his members. "This man will only be the second director of the Alcohol and Tobacco, Firearms agency in its history. It's notorious for being vacant at the top, and I think that was a specific strategy for the gun lobby. They don't want this agency to do its work."
Durbin added that Chipman is a "gun owner and his achievements I think are clear. He respects the Second Amendment, he just wants to stop the crimes of guns."
Chipman has reiterated that message in his private meetings. And on Tuesday, he won the support of Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, who is facing reelection in New Hampshire and announced she would back his nomination.
Winning over Republicans remains an open question. Toomey declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he planned to put a statement out on the nomination.
Complicating the vote for Democrats is that Chipman has faced a series of tough blows from hunting and sportsman groups like Ducks Unlimited who have argued that his views on an assault weapons ban are too extreme for the job.
"This is the first time I have seen such a broad array of sporting groups, conservation groups like Ducks Unlimited come out in opposition to a nominee. That shows how divisive he is," Collins said.
But Democrats believe ultimately he will get the job.
"He still needs to answer some questions and concerns, but I am confident he is going to have 50 votes on the floor. This is a mainstream nominee, someone who knows the ATF backwards and forward. It would be a gift to the gun lobby if somebody with that kind of qualification wasn't supported by the Democratic caucus," Murphy said.
CNN's Ali Zaslav and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Largely freed from domestic travel restrictions, Americans have flocked to national parks in record numbers this spring and summer. Several parks — including Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park — have already set monthly visitation records. Many sites are gearing up for their busiest years in history.
And so, in place of serenity, many visitors have instead found packed parking lots, congested trailheads, overrun campsites and interminable lines.
Hikers at Zion National Park, in Utah, have faced wait times of four hours to access certain trails. Visitors to Arches National Park, in the same state, are being turned away at the gate — “The park is currently full,” the Parks Service’s Twitter feed routinely announces — and asked to return at a later time.
To capture the crowds over the Fourth of July weekend, we sent photographers to four parks: Acadia National Park in Maine; Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona; Joshua Tree National Park in California; and Yellowstone National Park, largely in Wyoming.
Here’s what they saw.
Acadia National Park, Maine
Visitors in 2020: 2.7 Million
With its panoramic vistas, Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain, is popular among visitors as a prime spot to watch the sunrise. On this July morning, the 4:53 a.m. timing did not deter the crowds.
To reduce overcrowding and protect the natural resources on the summit, the park instituted a reservation system between May 26 and Oct. 19 for all vehicles heading up to the mountain. The limitations have helped keep congestion somewhat in check, and have reduced illegal parking beyond the site’s 150 parking spots.
Jordan Pond, which overlooks the twin mountain peaks known as the Bubbles (North Bubble and South Bubble), serves as a launching point for hikers and bikers. Many visitors, however, just come for a brief glance — and, of course, for the renowned popovers served at Jordan Pond House.

(STACEY CRAMP/)
Visitation numbers at Acadia have increased around 60% in the past decade. To limit traffic, the park actively encourages visitors to use alternative methods of transportation, including bicycles and the free Island Explorer bus.
The stretch of the 27-mile Park Loop Road between Sand Beach and Otter Cliff is one of the most heavily trafficked areas in Acadia National Park. Visitors park in small lots or along the roadway and walk to attractions like Thunder Hole.
There, under the right tidal conditions, waves crashing through a crevice and into a small cave can produce a thunderous sound and a dramatic spray of water — much to the delight, on July 5, of those on the heavily trafficked walkway.
Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona
Visitors in 2020: 2.9 million
Cars lined up in the early morning hours at the South Rim entrance of the Grand Canyon, one of the park’s three gated entrances. By late morning, the wait to enter the park was about 30 minutes — and growing.
Grand Canyon National Park, which encompasses some of America’s most iconic scenery, is perennially among the list of the country’s most-visited national parks. In 2020 it drew 2.9 million visitors, down from 5.97 million in 2019.
Mather Point offers many visitors their first view of the canyon — despite the crowded platform.

Shuttle buses offer visitors an efficient way of getting around the park. Masks are required for all shuttle passengers, both before boarding and once inside, and the rule was strictly enforced.
Masks are also required for unvaccinated visitors inside shared spaces, as well as outside in places where 6 feet of distance cannot be maintained from those outside one’s household.
Joshua Tree National Park, California
Visitors in 2020: 2.4 million
Keys View is a popular destination at sunset. On July 3, visitors spilled beyond the walkway to take in the breathtaking views of the San Andreas Fault, Mount San Jacinto, Mount San Gorgonio and the Salton Sea.
Hikers on the Hidden Valley trail made their way along a 1-mile loop that winds among massive boulders, through what is rumored to have been a cattle rustler’s hideout.

(BETH COLLER/)
After setting attendance records each year between 2014-19, visitation numbers at Joshua Tree dropped significantly last year, in part because of temporary closures in March, April and May. Still, the park drew 2.4 million visitors in 2020 and was No. 10 on the list of the country’s most-visited national parks.
Skull Rock is a granite rock formation with two depressions that resemble hollowed-out eye sockets. Its easy access — the site is just off the park’s main road — helps make it a heavily trafficked landmark.
The crowds here were not overwhelming, though visitors had to wait to take photographs.
Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho
Visitors in 2020: 3.8 million
Yellowstone set visitation records in May, hosting 483,159 visitors, an 11% increase compared with May of 2019. (The park was closed for much of May last year.)

Like in ‘Postapocalyptic Movies’: Heat Wave Killed Marine Wildlife en Masse

Dead mussels and clams coated rocks in the Pacific Northwest, their shells gaping open as if they had been boiled. Sea stars were baked to death. Sockeye salmon swam sluggishly in an overheated Washington river, prompting wildlife officials to truck them to cooler areas.
The combination of extraordinary heat and drought that hit the Western United States and Canada over the past two weeks has killed hundreds of millions of marine animals and continues to threaten untold species in freshwater, according to a preliminary estimate and interviews with scientists.
“It just feels like one of those postapocalyptic movies,” said Christopher Harley, a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia who studies the effects of climate change on coastal marine ecosystems.
To calculate the death toll, Harley first looked at how many blue mussels live on a particular shoreline, how much of the area is good habitat for mussels and what fraction of the mussels he observed died. He estimated losses for the mussels alone in the hundreds of millions. Factoring in the other creatures that live in the mussel beds and on the shore — barnacles, hermit crabs and other crustaceans, various worms, tiny sea cucumbers — puts the deaths at easily over 1 billion, he said.
Harley continues to study the damage and plans to publish a series of papers.
Such extreme weather conditions will become more frequent and intense, scientists say, as climate change, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, wreaks havoc on animals and humans alike. Hundreds of people died last week when the heat wave parked over the Pacific Northwest. A study by an international team of climate researchers found it would have been virtually impossible for such extremes to occur without global warming.
Just before the heat wave, when Harley took in the eye-popping weather forecasts, he thought about how low the tide would be at midday, baking the exposed mussels, sea stars and barnacles. When he walked to the beach last week on one of the hottest days, the smell of decay struck him immediately. The scientist in him was excited, he admitted, to see the real-life effect of something he had been studying for so long.
But his mood quickly changed.
“The more I walked and the more I saw, the more sobering it all became,” Harley said. “It just went on and on and on.”
The dead sea stars, usually the most eye-catching creatures in tidal pools, hit him particularly hard. But the obvious mass victims were blue mussels, an ecologically important species that feeds sea stars and sea ducks and creates habitat for other animals.
Scientists have only begun to consider the domino effects. One concern is whether the sea ducks, which feast on mussels in the winter before migrating to their summer breeding grounds in the Arctic, will have enough food to survive the journey.
“It’s at least something that we’re starting to think about,” he said.
Species that live in intertidal zones are resilient, he noted, and the mussels on the shady north side of boulders seem to have survived. But if these extreme heat waves become too frequent, species will not have time to recover.
While the heat wave over the Pacific Northwest has eased, punishing temperatures have persisted across much of the American West. Now another heat wave appears to be building, only worsening the ongoing drought.
That means biologists are watching river temperatures with alarm. Salmon make an extraordinary migration, often hundreds of miles, from the inland rivers and lakes where they are born, out to sea, and then back again to spawn the next generation. A network of long-standing dams in Western states already makes the journey perilous. Now, with climate change worsening heat waves and droughts, scientists say the conditions look grim without intense intervention, which comes with its own risks.
“We are already at critical temperatures three weeks before the most serious heating occurs,” said Don Chapman, a retired fisheries biologist who specialized in salmon and steelhead trout, talking about conditions along the Snake River in Washington, where four dams are the subject of long-standing controversy. “I think we’re headed for disaster.”
The plight of the salmon illustrates a broader danger facing all kinds of species as climate change worsens. Many animals were already struggling to survive because of human activity degrading their habitats. Throw in extreme heat and drought, and their odds of survival diminish.
As an emergency measure, workers with the Idaho Fish and Game agency have begun capturing a variety of endangered sockeye salmon at the Lower Granite dam, putting them into a truck and driving them to hatcheries as a stopgap measure to decide what to do next. (Idaho game officials first tried trucking the adult fish during a heat wave in 2015. It has been done for juvenile salmon on a variety of runs for a variety of reasons.)
In California’s central valley, Jonathan Ambrose, a biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he wished he could do something similar. The chinook salmon he monitors historically spawned in the mountains. But since the Shasta Dam was built more than three-quarters of a century ago, they have adapted by breeding just in front of the mammoth structure, which they cannot cross. The critical problem this year is that the water there is expected to grow too warm for the eggs and juveniles. Previous efforts to secure state or federal funding to transport them past the dam have failed.
“We’re looking at maybe 90% mortality, maybe even higher this year,” Ambrose said.
Elsewhere in California, for the first time since the state built the Iron Gate Fish Hatchery on the Klamath River in 1962 to make up for lost spawning habitat, state biologists will not release the young salmon they have nurtured back into the wild, because they would likely die. Instead, they are spreading 1 million young salmon among other area hatcheries that could host them until conditions improve.
“I want to find the positives, and there are some, but it’s pretty overwhelming right now,” said Harley, the University of British Columbia marine biologist. “Because if we become too depressed or too overwhelmed, we won’t keep trying. And we need to keep trying.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Largely freed from domestic travel restrictions, Americans have flocked to national parks in record numbers this spring and summer. Several parks — including Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park — have already set monthly visitation records. Many sites are gearing up for their busiest years in history.

There, under the right tidal conditions, waves crashing through a crevice and into a small cave can produce a thunderous sound and a dramatic spray of water — much to the delight, on July 5, of those on the heavily trafficked walkway.
Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona
Visitors in 2020: 2.9 million
Cars lined up in the early morning hours at the South Rim entrance of the Grand Canyon, one of the park’s three gated entrances. By late morning, the wait to enter the park was about 30 minutes — and growing.
Grand Canyon National Park, which encompasses some of America’s most iconic scenery, is perennially among the list of the country’s most-visited national parks. In 2020 it drew 2.9 million visitors, down from 5.97 million in 2019.
Mather Point offers many visitors their first view of the canyon — despite the crowded platform.
Shuttle buses offer visitors an efficient way of getting around the park. Masks are required for all shuttle passengers, both before boarding and once inside, and the rule was strictly enforced.
Masks are also required for unvaccinated visitors inside shared spaces, as well as outside in places where 6 feet of distance cannot be maintained from those outside one’s household.
Joshua Tree National Park, California
Visitors in 2020: 2.4 million
Keys View is a popular destination at sunset. On July 3, visitors spilled beyond the walkway to take in the breathtaking views of the San Andreas Fault, Mount San Jacinto, Mount San Gorgonio and the Salton Sea.
Hikers on the Hidden Valley trail made their way along a 1-mile loop that winds among massive boulders, through what is rumored to have been a cattle rustler’s hideout.
After setting attendance records each year between 2014-19, visitation numbers at Joshua Tree dropped significantly last year, in part because of temporary closures in March, April and May. Still, the park drew 2.4 million visitors in 2020 and was No. 10 on the list of the country’s most-visited national parks.
Skull Rock is a granite rock formation with two depressions that resemble hollowed-out eye sockets. Its easy access — the site is just off the park’s main road — helps make it a heavily trafficked landmark.
The crowds here were not overwhelming, though visitors had to wait to take photographs.
Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho
Visitors in 2020: 3.8 million
Yellowstone set visitation records in May, hosting 483,159 visitors, an 11% increase compared with May of 2019. (The park was closed for much of May last year.)
At Midway Geyser Basin, the last of the evening’s visitors walked on a crowded boardwalk next to the Grand Prismatic Spring.
June, July and August are typically the busiest months at Yellowstone.
The area around Old Faithful, one of the park’s biggest draws, was most congested immediately after the geyser’s eruption, as people departed the viewing platform. At those times, the crowds were reminiscent of those at Disneyland.
Within the park, the lines at places like the cafeteria and the visitor center were not very long, since the park staff was effectively shepherding the crowds. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Stifling heat is searing the US West as the weekend approaches, with historic drought conditions worsening and fire danger escalating across much of the Northwest.
Daytime high temperatures across the West will threaten records once again, soaring into the 90s and triple digits through the end of the week. The brunt of the heat will hit Idaho, Utah and the desert Southwest before high pressure shifts back toward the West.
"Excessive heat warnings, watches, and heat advisories remain in effect across central California, the Southwest, and parts of the central/northern Great Basin," said the Weather Prediction Center. The alerts cover nearly 25 million people.
Prolonged, unprecedented heat like the West is experiencing is made worse and more frequent by the climate crisis, experts have told CNN.
The interior Northwest has endured unrelenting heat since the end of June after a deadly heat wave in the Pacific Northwest stalled out over the region.
Boise, Idaho on Tuesday tied the record longest streak with nine over-100-degree days, matching streaks set in 2003, 2006 and 2015. Wednesday's high in Boise only hit 99 degrees, ending the streak, but the forecast is expected to be over 100 again this weekend.
Wildfire weather worsens
Extreme heat and little rainfall are creating a recipe for wildfire disaster across the western US.
The drought in the West continues to worsen, the latest drought monitor released Thursday morning shows. Over 90% of the West is in drought, with several locations' drought level worsening.
Across the US, the drought has nearly doubled in size from this time last year. Around 25% of the country was in drought conditions in July 2020; as of this week, nearly half is in drought.
Heat waves and their prolonged nature coupled with the historic drought are drying out the vegetation in the area, allowing for ripe fuel for fires.
Red flag warnings and fire weather watches Thursday span the Great Basin from California to the Rockies, where gusty winds and hot conditions could easily propel any ignited fires into dangerous size and strength.
"All the ingredients are there: dry conditions, dry lightning potential, and breezy winds, so new fire starts will be possible," said the National Weather Service in Pendleton, Oregon.
Winds picking up through the day Thursday could exceed 25 mph, prompting critical fire weather conditions to extend from northern Nevada through southeastern Idaho.
CHECK YOUR LOCAL FORECAST
Large fires have already ignited this week across the Pacific Northwest as hot and dry conditions persist. A wildfire prompted evacuations of around 200 homes Tuesday in Spokane, Washington.
In California, wildfires are an increasingly disruptive part of life, and 2021 is already proving to be an active fire season.
There have been more than 750 more fires and 42,000 more acres burned in 2021 than this time last year, with 4,599 fires ignited in California so far this year, according to CalFire.
Californians should prepare for wildfires as the danger is expected to grow this weekend with the next heat wave, authorities warned.
Critical fire conditions are expected to extend into the weekend.
Temperatures rise in the Southwest
Some records are in jeopardy over the next two days across California and Nevada before the heat will crescendo into the weekend, with additional records likely to fall.
"For the most part regional temperatures remain 5-10 degrees above average through the remainder of the week. This trend will continue into the weekend with some daytime and even higher overnight temps either touching or exceeding record territory," said the weather service in Reno, Nevada.
By the weekend, the large ridge of high pressure over the region will expand, covering the southwestern US, leading to sweltering temperatures in central California, Nevada and Arizona.
"This will bring a trend up in temperatures into the weekend with atrocious afternoon temperatures topping out between 100 and 108 for valleys near and below 5000 feet for the weekend (versus mid 90's to low 100's prior to Saturday)," the weather service in Reno said.
In Las Vegas, the weather service forecasts a 43% chance of breaking the all-time high temperature record of 117 degrees on Saturday and a 61% chance of tying the record, which has only been done four times, most recently in 2005.
Death Valley could see temperatures climb to 130 degrees on Sunday, just 4 degrees shy of the official hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth, measured on July 10, 1913, at this same location.
"This next heat wave is looking pretty brutal and could bring with it record setting maximum temperatures and possible records for high minimum temperatures this weekend into early next week. Sadly, our next spell of triple digit heat looks like it could be our longest one yet this Summer," said the National Weather Service in Hanford, California.
The extreme heat won't be short-lived, as the high pressure is expected to park over California and Nevada throughout the beginning of next week.
"It's best to think of this ridge as a very tall mountain of dry, stable air," the weather service in Hanford said. "Tall mountains are difficult to move and the ensembles (weather models) suggest that no weather system will be strong enough to move this mountain of hot, dry air before the middle of next week."

The critical race theory panic has White people afraid that they might be complicit in racism

Texto completo: Keziah Ridgeway says she's the only teacher she knows in Philadelphia who teaches critical race theory in public high school -- and she teaches it in her anthropology class, as one framework among many to understand human cultures. But she also teaches African American history, and that's what she thinks the frenzy over critical race theory (CRT) is really about.
"Critical race theory is a lens, right? It's not being taught in schools," Ridgeway says. It's a theory for understanding the interaction of race and the law, and is mostly taught in graduate school, not elementary school. But conservatives are using the phrase to mean any instruction about the role of race in America, past or present.
The explicit message is that such instruction puts White people in danger of being blamed for their ancestors' crimes. Its undercurrent is that it could bring attention to the ways that White people today continue to benefit from racism.
"Can (CRT) influence the way that some teachers teach? Yeah," Ridgeway says. "But that's a good thing, right? Because race and racism are literally the building blocks of this country. So how can you not talk about it?"
In the wake of protests over the murder of George Floyd, Republican politicians have been hyping "critical race theory" as a threat to the impressionable minds of America's children. In more than a dozen states, legislators have proposed bills to ban CRT. In May, Oklahoma teachers were banned from teaching that "an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive." On September 1, a Texas law goes into effect that bans teaching that "slavery and racism are anything other than deviations from, betrayals of, or failures to live up to, the authentic founding principles of the United States."
Ridgeway teaches at an inner-city school where a majority of students are people of color. She says the strongest reaction she gets from kids who take her class is that they feel like they've been lied to by a feel-good version of American history.
"I love primary sources, which is what I use a lot in my classroom. Because if a parent comes and says, 'Why are you teaching my kid that Christopher Columbus was a murderer?' I'll just be like, I technically didn't teach them anything. They read his diary."
Ominous warnings about the danger of CRT have been circulating from 4chan to Fox News for a year. In the last few months, it has started turning people out. Across the country, school board meetings have gotten heated as parents have protested CRT. Last week, CNN toured the mid-Atlantic to survey the CRT discourse, interviewing Ridgeway in Philadelphia, watching a suburban school board meeting, talking to an anti-CRT activist in Pennsylvania, and watching a local Republican panel at a diner near Baltimore.
'A conflation of issues'
This CNN crew dropped by a school board meeting in Phoenixville, in the suburbs of Philadelphia, to see if someone might show up to talk about CRT. Two did.
"We do not want our children to be taught that they are oppressed or they are oppressors by virtue of their color," a White woman said as she addressed the school board, her kids at her side. "These are my babies. Not yours. If you are embarrassed or ashamed of your skin color, that's your issue. Not mine or my children." Half a dozen people clapped.
She went on to address the subject of history. "Saying America is wholly racist, and White supremacy are the biggest threats to America, is like saying Big Foot is the biggest threat. It's a lie. 600,000 people died in the Civil War to end racism and slavery. Don't rewrite factual history or indoctrinate. Just present the facts, not storytelling." (She later declined to comment, saying, "I don't like your show.")
A White man in a suit said, "We did not want our children to be taught that America is systemically racist." (Once the meeting moved on to less nationally relevant matters, CNN waited outside to ask him about his comments. He stood in the window and took a picture of the crew, but when the meeting ended, he left through another exit.)
These comments did not go without pushback. "What I'm hearing in these comments is really disturbing on a lot of levels," school board member Christopher Caltagirone said. "I heard a comment that we ended racism with the Civil War." He sounded astonished. "I'm sick and tired of seeing people try to run roughshod over the education system."
After the meeting, some teachers and school board members lingered. A couple of teachers said they'd heard the CRT backlash was big in a nearby suburb, Downingtown. Phoenixville had gotten a few comments over the last several weeks, Caltagirone told CNN, but "I wouldn't say it's a majority, and I wouldn't say we've been inundated." He said he'd never seen CRT in the curriculum. "I have no clue what triggered it locally. But I think it's part of the larger movement that we're seeing nationally."
"I think it's a knee-jerk reaction to what's gone on in society over the last year," Caltagirone said. "It's a conflation of issues" -- history, critical race theory, equity, diversity and inclusion -- "it's all being put together. And I don't think that's fair."
The idea that CRT is being used to teach young White children to hate themselves for being White has circulated in conservative media. In April, Idaho lawmakers debated a bill later signed by the governor that stated critical race theory would "exacerbate and inflame divisions" and banned public schools from teaching that individual people "are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin."
During this debate, Idaho state Rep. Heather Scott relayed the claims of a substitute teacher, who said students had been instructed to read the book To Kill a Mockingbird. Scott recounted, "She said the message was clear: White people are bad, Black people are innocent victims. And the students were encouraged to believe there was an endless era of Black victimization." (To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960, has long been considered a literary classic, and its protagonists are a White lawyer and his precocious daughter.)
Ridgeway seemed somewhat amused but mostly exasperated by these claims. Is she teaching children to hate America? "No, I'm teaching children to question America. And that's what makes a good patriot." Is she teaching White kids to hate themselves for being White? "No." Is she teaching Black kids that there's nothing they can do to improve their situation? "Absolutely not." Because racism exists and they can never fight it, so they should give up? "Absolutely not. I'm creating little free thinkers and resistors and future politicians and lawyers and teachers and change-makers."
Ridgeway said she thought Pennsylvania's governor would veto any anti-CRT bill the state legislature might pass. (When asked for comment, a spokeswoman for Gov. Tom Wolf said, "These proposals are harmful political props meant solely to stir up outrage," but did not say whether Wolf would veto.) But even if one such bill became law in her state, she would not change the way she teaches. "I could lose my job. Is that gonna stop me from teaching the truth? Absolutely not."
But, Ridgeway said, "I'm concerned about teachers who live in states where they have a Republican governor who is hell-bent on putting these things into law. They could be fined. They could lose their job. They could be suspended. And I think that is so problematic. Can you imagine in Germany, them banning teaching about the Holocaust?"
Parents fight 'indoctrination' at school
With just two days left in the 2020 school year, Elana Fishbein says she received an email from her kids' school near Philadelphia saying they would be given lessons about the role of race in American society. She said she reviewed the materials and determined they were racist.
While there are some bigots, Fishbein allowed, "American society is not racist." She continued, "Taking a wide brush and painting this country as systemic racist, as, you know, structurally racist -- it's insane."
She was particularly upset by the book, A Kids Book About Racism, by Jelani Memory, published in 2019. In the book, Memory says he has a Black dad and a White mom, which makes him mixed -- "or African American, biracial, Black, or a person of color." This offended Fishbein. "There's no mention of the fact that his mother was White," she said. "The White option doesn't exist there. He can be Black, but he cannot be White."
The legacy of America's "one-drop rule" has meant a biracial person with a Black ancestor is usually considered Black. Fishbein did not find this persuasive. She said, "But the fact that somebody defines you, doesn't make you what they define you. The fact that somebody calls me a racist, doesn't make me a racist."
Fishbein says she then wrote a letter to the school board and posted it on the school's Facebook page, where she was "literally lynched." CNN suggested perhaps she was just figuratively lynched. "Of course, of course," she said, "very harshly, obviously, calling me racist and bigot and demanding that my post would be removed." She said the post was deleted, and removed from other local school-related Facebook pages, too. "That's when I started really being concerned."
Fishbein put her kids in private school. But her interest in the public school curriculum continued.
In August, Fishbein created an advocacy group called No Left Turn in Education. Despite the name, she said, "Our goal is to get any kind of indoctrination, any kind of politicization, from our schools. It's not about right and left. It's about right and wrong." An appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show had generated a wave of interest, she said, though she would not say how many people had joined or how much money she'd raised.
Though her kids are out of public school now, Fishbein said she didn't want her money, as a taxpayer, "to go to indoctrinate kids that then are going to hate my kids because of the color of their skin, and attack them because of the color of their skin, and blame them that whatever achievement they have, it's because of the color of the skin."
Asked if she was afraid her children would be attacked by Black children, Fishbein said, "No, I didn't say by Black children." When asked who exactly she feared would attack her children, Fishbein said, "What happened in the summer, it twisted the minds of all kids, all kids. My kids can be attacked by antifa kids or BLM kids that are not Black. They're White like my kids. But they're believing -- they were indoctrinated. And they internalize this philosophy."
Asked if her children had been beaten up by "antifa kids," Fishbein said, "It's going to happen if we are not going to stop it. But we are going to stop it."
When did race stop mattering?
Near Baltimore, the Howard County Young Republicans rented out half a diner for a panel discussing two topics: schools being shut down amid Covid-19, and critical race theory. It was standing room only, with more than 100 people. The speakers were people of color, and the audience was mostly White. It erupted in applause as the speakers denounced CRT.
Maria Vismale, who is Black, said Black people "absolutely" have more opportunities than White people now, citing college scholarships for people of color and corporate diversity initiatives. She said of the corporate world, "If I can compete, if I am able to do the job, then they're going to choose me over a White woman, and definitely a White male, because they're looking for these people to diversify."
A recurring theme among conservatives CNN spoke to was their perception that the concept of systemic racism implies individual Black people don't have a shot at becoming rich and successful. "Telling people they can't compete based off skin color does nothing but keep them down," Vismale said. "Rather than tell them they can accomplish anything, like my parents did. Like I'm sure Barack Obama's parents did, like I'm sure so many of the entrepreneurs (did)."
The real problem, Vismale said, was the education system. Vismale's long conversation with CNN at times went in circles about whether an education system that was disadvantageous for poor Black kids counted as systemic racism.
"In Baltimore City, students can't read and write," she said. "And to say the issue is because of their skin color is absolutely ridiculous. It's not because of their skin color. It's because they don't have the resources." But why didn't they have the resources? "It's because they have been born into poverty." But why do they have to go to poor-performing schools? Vismale said it was because school administrators were overpaid, and teachers were underpaid.
The inner-city schools weren't working, so even if a Black kid is valedictorian, she said, "Realistically, can you compete with your counterparts who clearly have had better circumstances and schools, better input from parents, better local government, politicians, administrators that are not, basically, ... being corrupt? ... Yes, he can do anything. Yes, it will be more difficult for him to do it. But it's not because, 'OK, this man is a Black man.' It's because of the circumstance in which the school system was constructed."
Schools are funded with property taxes, which means schools in poor neighborhoods have less funding, and on top of that, redlining had restricted where Black people could live -- did that not all add up to systemic racism? Vismale said no.
The diner event drew all kinds, from college kids to senior citizens. There was a contingent of College Republicans from Towson University. One of them, Craig Lewis, admitted he was "not that knowledgeable" about critical race theory. "But it sounds as if -- obviously, this is more of an educated assumption -- that it is, obviously, teaching people, kids about race and racial issues in America's past is very important. I was taught about slavery, Jim Crow, the whole of the history of the United States. But to paint the country as an inherently racist country from its founding, I think is dangerous. And false."
When Lewis was reminded that the Constitution's Three-fifths Compromise says slaves shall be counted as 60% of a person, he said, "Of course, and that was applied at an earlier time. That's not the case now, obviously." Asked to square the inclusion of explicitly unequal treatment in the founding documents of America with his claim that America was founded on the principle of equality, Lewis said, "Well yeah. ... It wasn't perfectly written in the Constitution. But the founding of the United States is so that all people under God are created equal."
After watching Lewis's interview, his buddy, Sam Jones, the president of Towson College Republicans, wanted a go. "Critical race theory is the idea that's taught to our nation's youth that the way that you're born contributes to the amount of success that you can achieve in this country," Jones said. "Basically, it states that White people are born with everything. And if you're not White, you're born with nothing. And you have a strategic disadvantage in making money and gaining success here."
Jones said he had not read any critical race theory books. He could not name any critical race theory scholars. He could not name any critical race theory concepts. Even so, "I think I've summarized critical race theory as a whole pretty well."
"My point is, it doesn't matter what race you are, it matters how hard you work," Jones said. "I think it has much more to do with the choices you make and the place you live, the people that you surround yourself with, than the color of your skin when you're born."
Did race ever matter in American history? Jones said yes. Race mattered a lot during slavery. Jim Crow, too. When did race stop mattering? "I mean, I'm not gonna be able to tell you an exact date of when it stopped mattering," Jones said.
But could he give a date range? "I mean, it doesn't not matter. It definitely matters because there's an implicit bias in all of us. But my point is that the success, the economic, the personal success that you're going to make in this life has nothing to do with the color of your skin." Could he give a decade when that became true? "Probably the 90s."
But what specifically? "Living your life." So in the 90s, Black people were living their lives? "Cut that one off," Jones said and walked off-camera and out of the interview.
"Our kids are smart, they know what's happening," Ridgeway said. "We do them a disservice by continuing to pretend like critical race theory is the issue. When it's really you just don't want kids to learn the truth. Because not only do they become critical thinkers, but they also become voters."
The people who have something to fear, she said, were the politicians. "As this generation gets older, a lot of the people who are making these laws will be voted out of office."

Texto completo: Unrelenting heat is expected to continue in the West after a late-June heat wave left hundreds dead in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. Records could topple again this weekend as temperatures climb well above normal.
The number of Oregonians who died from heat-related illnesses during the historic late-June heat rose to 107, the state medical examiner said Tuesday in an updated statement. While the deaths were reported across the state, nearly two-thirds occurred in Multnomah County, home to the city of Portland.
Many of those who died were found alone, without air conditioning or a fan, Multnomah County officials said.
The number of fatalities is higher than previous years. Twelve deaths from hyperthermia, which is when the body overheats, were reported statewide between 2017 and 2019, officials previously said.
In Washington state, a total of 57 heat-related deaths were reported from June 26 through July 1, Washington State Department of Health Public Information Officer Teresa McCallion told CNN.
At least 13 of those deaths were in Seattle.
McCallion said not all heat-related deaths have been reported as it takes time for local agencies to report out deaths to the state.
"Deaths are reported to the state by health care providers, medical examiners/coroners, local health departments, and others. For this reason, the statewide count of deaths often lags behind the counts of local health departments," McCallion said.
In terms of hospital visits, "Yesterday, there were 31 visits for heat-related illnesses not admitted as outpatient," McCallion said Tuesday. "This is still higher than 'normal,' but is on the downtrend from last week, which saw a high of 729 visits. In terms of totals, there have been 2,060 hospital visits between June 25-July 1."
And in British Columbia, 486 sudden deaths -- almost triple the usual number -- occurred during the heat, the coroner's office said, which set a new record for Canada's all-time highest temperature.
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Sunday the "horrific" heat wave is "a harbinger of things to come" as climate change intensifies extreme weather and drought conditions. She said the state is undertaking a review of its response to the deadly heat wave and called for federal aid to assist with wildfire prevention efforts.
Prolonged, unprecedented heat is made worse and more frequent by climate change, experts told CNN.
Midweek warm up
One week later, a ridge of high pressure is strengthening again Tuesday and Wednesday over the West with temperatures poised to reach the triple digits later this week.
"Excessive and oppressive heat across the Northwest will continue through at least the first half of the week where daytime highs will climb well into the 90s and low 100s," according to the Weather Prediction Center. "Daily record highs will, once again, be challenged by Tuesday and Wednesday for parts of the Great Basin and northern California."
Eastern Oregon, Nevada and Idaho might touch daily high records once again as daytime temperatures reach into the high 90s and triple digits.
"This will bring near record temperatures and could possibly be the warmest day of the year thus far," the National Weather Service in Boise (NWS) said.
It has already been a warm week for Boise. The record for longest streak of warm lows above 70 degrees has been set with nine days in a row, breaking the previous record of five days in 2015 according to NWS Boise.
The warm low temperature streak is coupled with a streak of seven days with high temperatures over 100 degrees. Boise is forecast to reach 100 degrees for the next three days, which would break the record of a nine-day streak of over 100-degree temperatures.
Excessive heat warnings are in place for much of eastern Oregon and western Idaho on Tuesday, in effect through the evening.
Northern Nevada, Northern California and Southern Oregon have heat advisories in place, where temperatures will be in the low triple digits.
The NWS in Pocatello, Idaho says that more heat watches and warnings will be likely for southern Idaho going into Tuesday. Red flag warnings are also in place for Friday, as temperatures begin to heat up once again along with a chance for scattered thunderstorms elevating the wildfire risk.
The heat will peak on Tuesday and Wednesday for most of the region before a front brings brief relief on Thursday. Temperatures will still be above average, but closer to the normal values.
After Thursday, the heat rises into the weekend for some parts of the West.
Weekend heat wave worrisome
Another ridge of high pressure centered over Nevada begins to build into the end of the week by Saturday and daily high temperatures soar into triple digits once again.
"The Coast Ranges across the Great Basin to the northern Rockies should all see highs 10-15F above normal each day with locally higher readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are under threat across primarily the Great Basin each day with a slight western shift to California this weekend as the ridge axis drifts west," said the WPC.
Eastern Washington, Oregon and Idaho could see daily highs threatened once again this weekend. Highs in Northern California will ramp up as well, with temperatures in the 100s and some exceeding 110s.
"It's noteworthy that the latest run of the National Blend of Models already gives Redding a 60 percent and 73 percent chance of exceeding 110 degrees next weekend Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Redding has already observed 10 consecutive days at or above 100 degrees, and looks like we'll easily add at least 8 more days on top of the current streak," said the NWS in Sacramento, California.
This summer has already proven to be scalding for the West. Drought conditions have deteriorated, and fire weather is making large fires burning in places like California significantly worse. Smoke over the Great Basin from large fires in California will be bothersome throughout the week.
Multiple large fires, including the Salt and Lava fires that have torn through over 30,000 acres according to InciWeb, are burning in Northern California and their smoke is impacting areas of Southern Washington and Western Idaho.
Monsoon moisture this weekend has proven helpful for Arizona and New Mexico but has left the regions that most need it in the Northwest parched.
The heat wave over the weekend is expected to last throughout the next week. The prolonged hot conditions with little nighttime relief set up another dangerous week for the West.
CNN's Jon Passantino, Raja Razek, and Brisa Colon contributed to this story.

Texto completo: The Camden Public Library plans to host New York Times Bestselling Author and Pulitzer Prize Finalist Colin Woodard to the Camden Amphitheatre at 6 p.m. Tuesday for a talk about his latest book “Union.”
The book tells the story of how the myth of U.S. national identity was created and fought over in the nineteenth century — a conflict that continues to affect the U.S. today.
Woodard will discuss the book and offer signed copies for sale. The audience is encouraged to bring a lawn chair for comfortable seating.
In “Union,” Woodard describes the struggle to create a national myth for the United States, one that could hold its rival regional cultures together and forge an American nationhood. On one hand, a small group of individuals — historians, political leaders and novelists — fashioned and promoted the idea of America as a nation that had a God-given mission to lead humanity toward freedom, equality and self-government.
But this emerging narrative was swiftly contested by another set of intellectuals and firebrands who argued that the United States was instead the homeland of the allegedly superior “Anglo-Saxon” race, upon whom divine and Darwinian favor shined.
Woodard tells the story of the genesis and epic confrontations between these visions of the nation’s path and purpose through the lives of the key figures who created them — a cast of characters whose personal quirks and virtues, gifts and demons shaped the destiny of millions.
Derek Chollet, executive vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, describes the book as a “very insightful guide to understanding much of what we are reading in the news today,” according to a news release from the Camden library.
Woodard, a Maine native, is the author of six books that have been translated into a dozen foreign languages and inspired an NBC television drama. He is state and national affairs writer at the Portland Press Herald and Maine Sunday Telegram, where he won a 2012 George Polk Award and was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 2016.
He is a contributing editor at POLITICO, and his work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, Smithsonian and dozens of other major publications. He is a graduate of Tufts University and the University of Chicago. He is past Pew Fellow in International Journalism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and a recipient of the Jane Bagley Lehman Award for Excellence in Public Advocacy.

Supreme Court to Hear Case on Government Aid to Religious Schools

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether Maine may exclude religious schools that offer sectarian education from a state tuition program.
The case, Carson v. Makin, No. 20-1088, is broadly similar to one from Montana decided by the court last year. In that case, the court ruled that states must allow religious schools to participate in programs that provide scholarships to students attending private schools.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority in the case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, No. 18-1195, said a provision of Montana’s Constitution banning aid to schools run by churches ran afoul of the federal Constitution’s protection of the free exercise of religion by discriminating against religious people and schools.
“A state need not subsidize private education,” he wrote. “But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.”
But the Montana decision turned on the schools’ religious status rather than their curriculums. There may be a difference, Roberts said, between an institution’s religious identity and its conduct.
“We acknowledge the point,” he wrote, “but need not examine it here.”
In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case from Maine, two families that send or want to send their children to religious schools, represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group, asked the justices to resolve the open question and do away with the distinction.
“Such a state of affairs — in which a state cannot deny a benefit to a student because she wishes to attend a school that is religious, but can deny it because the school does religious things — is unstable and untenable,” the families’ brief said.
Maine requires rural communities without public secondary schools to arrange for their young residents’ educations in one of two ways. They can sign contracts with schools elsewhere, or they can pay tuition at public or private schools chosen by parents so long as they are, in the words of state law, “a nonsectarian school in accordance with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.”
In opposing Supreme Court review, officials in Maine argued that the schools students attend under the program should mirror the teaching offered at public schools.
“The purpose of the program is to engage private schools willing to deliver a specific service: an education that is substantively akin to that which a student would receive if their community operated a public school,” the state’s lawyers wrote. “A religious organization that is willing to provide the service sought is treated no differently than any other organization.”
The Supreme Court has long held that states may choose to provide aid to religious schools along with other private schools. The question in the cases from Montana and Maine was the opposite one: May states refuse to provide such aid if it is made available to other private schools?

Texto completo: Details of the investigation leading to the charges against Lori Vallow in the death of her former husband show he feared for their children's safety​, police say, citing a mental health petition Charles Vallow filed.
Arizona police released a probable cause statement Thursday with information on what led them to charge Lori in the death of her former husband, Charles Vallow. She is already facing charges in the deaths of two of her children, Tylee Ryan, 17, and Joshua "JJ" Vallow, 7.
The probable cause statement released by Chandler Police recounts how on July 11, 2019, Lori's brother, Alexander Cox, called 911 to report he had shot and killed his former brother-in-law, and the investigation that led police to question Cox's timeline of what happened and the events that led to that day.
Lori Vallow was charged by a Maricopa County grand jury with one felony count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of her former husband, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office said in a news release Tuesday.
CNN has reached out to Lori's attorney for comment.
Messages point to premeditation, police say
Charles Vallow had communicated with another of Lori's brothers to plan an intervention for her out of fear for their children's safety​, and had mentioned​ ​what police described as her "radical beliefs," according to the statement. Those beliefs included that she was an "exalted Goddess" and that she and the man she would later marry, Chad Daybell, were "directed to lead 144,000 people in preparing for the end of the world​," ​according to the police statement -- though it's unclear whether Charles was aware of those specific beliefs. ​
Charles Vallow and Lori Vallow had been separated and, according to the probable cause statement, he had filed a mental health petition asking for an evaluation. In the petition, he said Lori had told him that he was possessed by a "dark spirit" named Ned Schneider and referred to him as Ned, police said.
Lori Vallow found out about the intervention, according to the statement, and texted her brother, Cox, the day before her former husband's murder, "Thank you for standing by me. It's all coming to a head this week."
Investigators said in the statement that they found more correspondence that pointed to Charles' death being premeditated.
One of those messages was from Daybell to Lori that said, "I got the inspiration to go back to my original death percentages that helped us track Charles, Ned, etc. Tammy is very close. Her percentage has fallen steadily since Hiplos (a reference to Charles as a dark spirit) left. It is encouraging!"
Daybell has not been charged in Charles' death, but he is facing a murder charge in the death of his wife Tammy Daybell. Daybell has pleaded not guilty. Lori is facing a charge of conspiracy in her death.
Police: Charles Vallow lay dead or dying for 43 minutes
Charles Vallow arrived to pick up ​their seven-year-old son, and found that Cox was also there, according to the statement.
​Cox later told investigators he shot and killed Charles in self-defense after a physical altercation, police say.
Police estimate that Charles Vallow would have laid dead or dying for 43 minutes between the gunshot and when Cox called 911, but phone records indicated that he called Lori ​in the interim.
During this time, police say Lori Vallow took her former husband's rental vehicle and cell phone. GPS data from the phone indicated she went to Burger King to get food for their son JJ and Walgreens to get flip-flops for herself and Tylee​, according to the statement.
When Cox did call 911, the probable cause statement said he insinuated the shooting had just happened and was provided with CPR instructions.
Cox acted as if he was performing CPR, but "It was not until emergency personnel began life saving measures that they saw blood coming from Charles' body. This would indicate that Alex ( Alexander Cox) performed no emergency aid," the probable cause statement said.
Cox died in December 2019, prosecutors said.
Lori Vallow and Daybell face murder charges in the death of her children
Tylee and JJ went missing in September 2019. Two months later, Lori Vallow and Daybell were married.
In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the children's remains on Daybell's property in Fremont County, Idaho.
Lori and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May in connection with the deaths of the children.
After a court-ordered psychological evaluation, Lori Vallow was declared "not competent to proceed" with trial by an Idaho judge last month.
This decision affected Lori's trial in Fremont County, where she is charged with two counts of conspiring to destroy, alter or conceal evidence of her two children's buried bodies.
It isn't clear if the psychological evaluation will affect her trial on the murder charges involving her children.

Texto completo: Republican governors across the country are deploying state law enforcement officials to the US-Mexico border, giving each governor the opportunity to emphasize their fealty to former President Donald Trump while simultaneously lambasting President Joe Biden's administration.
The deployments, which have come from states ranging from South Dakota to Idaho to Florida, were in response to requests from two other Republican executives -- Arizona's Doug Ducey and Texas' Greg Abbott -- who asked the nation's governors to send law enforcement to the U.S.-Mexico border in a letter sent earlier this month.
Their actions come amid a concerted effort by Republicans to pin a surge in illegal immigration on the Biden administration -- namely Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been asked to lead the White House's effort to curb migration from Central America. Trump, as part of this political effort, will visit South Texas and the border with Abbott on Wednesday, continuing his persistent attacks against his successor.
The Republican governors -- many of whom have long been closely aligned with Trump -- also are signaling their allegiance to the former President, who made illegal immigration and the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border a cornerstone of his four years in the White House.
South Dakota's Kristi Noem is one of the latest state executives to deploy state law enforcement to the border, announcing on Tuesday that she had sent the South Dakota National Guard to Texas to "help the secure the border between the United States and Mexico."
Noem took a whack at the Biden administration as part of the rollout.
"The Biden Administration has failed," she said, adding that the "border is a national security crisis that requires the kind of sustained response only the National Guard can provide."
Noem funded the operation, according to her spokesman Ian Fury, through a private donation made by Willis and Reba Johnson's Foundation. The Johnsons are longtime Republican donors who founded Copart, an online used car dealer.
Fury said the donation was made directly to the state and that Noem "welcomes any such donations to help alleviate the cost to South Dakota taxpayers."
The South Dakota governor joined a number of other Republican executives to send law enforcement officials to the border, including a potential fellow 2024 presidential contender.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last week that he would deploy state and local law enforcement officers to Texas and Arizona "in response to the border crisis." DeSantis, who is seen as a possible 2024 contender, took a shot at Biden while doing it: "Where the federal government has failed, the states are stepping up into doing our best to fill the void."
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson also on Tuesday authorized a 90-day deployment for up to 40 national guard troops in order to "reduce the adverse impact of illegal immigration on Arkansas." Last week, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds authorized national guard troops head to the border earlier this month because, she said, the state "has no choice but to act." And earlier this month, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts announced his state was "stepping up" and deploying state patrol troopers to the border, while Idaho Gov. Brad Little announced that the state would help but was "evaluating our resources" to determine what it could provide.
How effective these state law enforcement officials will be is an open question.
The enforcement of immigration law falls on federal authorities. While the federal government has partnered with states and localities in some cases, local law enforcement is generally limited in how it can assist with immigration enforcement.
"This is much more theatre than it is anything else," former US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske told CNN. "I think immigration is the sole purview of the federal government. It isn't like drug laws that are shared with the states. No state can impose its own immigration laws or rules."
In Texas, the Department of Public Safety has been down at the border over the years to patrol the roads, make traffic stops and observe and report any activity, said Kerlikowske, who served under former President Barack Obama. National Guard troops have similarly provided support to Customs and Border Protection, often in a logistical capacity.
"On the ground, it had always been logistical coordination," he said, adding that "there was good coordination and CBP worked well with deployments." CBP employs more than 19,000 Border Patrol agents.
The distinction, concluded Kerlikowske, will be how well the deployed officers know the border -- with National Guard troops more likely to have some familiarity -- and how, if at all, they work in concert with Border Patrol agents.
"Sending 50 law enforcement officers from Florida with no understanding of the border is really just again political theatre," Kerlikowske said.
A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told CNN that the government agency "continues to leverage our longstanding relationships with state and local law enforcement, including deconflicting operations in the border region and responding to callouts from other law enforcement agencies," but that it "defers to the State of Texas to speak to any steps they are taking to increase their enforcement posture."

Texto completo: An Idaho woman who is accused of killing her two children has been charged in the death of her former husband.
Lori Vallow was charged by an Arizona grand jury with one felony count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office said in a news release Tuesday.
The charge is related to the death of Vallow's former husband, Charles Vallow, on July 11, 2019. On that day, Vallow's brother, Alexander Cox, called 911 to report he had shot and killed his brother-in-law, according the statement from the attorney's office. Charles Vallow died at the scene, prosecutors said.
According to the grand jury indictment, Vallow agreed with her brother that "at least one of them or another would engage in conduct constituting the offense of First Degree Murder."
Cox, Vallow's brother, died in December 2019, prosecutors said. The Maricopa County medical examiner said Cox died of natural causes, CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK reported
CNN has reached out to Vallow's attorney for comment.
Vallow faces charges in children's deaths
Vallow is also facing charges in Idaho related to the deaths of two of her children, Tylee Ryan, 17, and Joshua "JJ" Vallow, 7.
The children went missing in September 2019. Vallow and Chad Daybell married that November. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the children's remains on Chad Daybell's property in Fremont County, Idaho.
Vallow and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May in connection with the deaths of the children.
Daybell pleaded not guilty to the charges earlier this month.
After a court ordered psychological evaluation, Lori Vallow was declared "not competent to proceed" with trial by an Idaho judge last month.
This decision affected Vallow's trial in Fremont County, where she is charged with two counts of conspiring to destroy, alter or conceal evidence of her two children's buried bodies.
It isn't clear if the psychological evaluation will affect her trial on the murder charges involving her children.

Jill Biden will visit Maine on July 4th weekend
First lady Jill Biden is expected to visit Maine over the July 4th weekend, according to the cable news network CNN.
Her visit will be part of her husband's administration's "America's Back Together," a theme marking the progress that has been made in the effort to vaccinate Americans against the COVID-19 virus.
Not a lot of details about when or where Biden will make an appearance, but CNN indicated that the president's wife will likely visit New Hampshire and Maine on Saturday, a day in advance of the July 4th holiday.
President Joe Biden will visit Traverse City, Michigan on Saturday as he promotes the idea that the country is starting to return to pre-pandemic normals, according to CNN. The White House has said that the country will likely fall short of the President's goal of having 70 percent of Americans vaccinated by July 4. As of Monday, 66 percent of Mainers had received at least one dose of the vaccine.
CNN reports that the Bidens are planning to host a massive July 4th celebration at the White House for essential workers and military families on the South Lawn. The National Mall will also be open for fireworks.
WESTBROOK
Police seek public's help locating missing man
Westbrook police are asking for the public's help in locating a man who was last seen by family more than a week ago.
Terry Tucker Jr., 32, was seen at a local store last Thursday, but his family hasn't seen or been in contact with him since June 20.
Tucker is white, with brown hair and blue eyes. He's approximately 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs 155 pounds. He was last seen wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, gray shorts and blue Nike sneakers, police said.
Anyone with information about Tucker's whereabouts is asked to contact Westbrook police at 207-854-0644.
SCARBOROUGH
Police: Portland man fired gun at house
A Portland man was arrested Monday on suspicion of firing several gunshots at a house in Scarborough in the early morning hours.
Shane Fors, 23, is charged with domestic violence criminal threatening and reckless conduct with a firearm - both Class C felonies - and with criminal mischief, a midemeanor.
Scarborough police responded shortly after 2:30 a.m. to a house on Stoneridge Drive, off Route 77, after residents reported that several gunshots had been deliberately fired. No one was injured.
Officers responded and spent several hours at the scene Monday gathering evidence and later arrested Fors. He was taken to Cumberland County Jail.
BANGOR
Driver tops 100 mph in chase through 2 counties
A man who led police on a chase topping 100 mph across two counties is facing numerous charges, police say.
It started Sunday when the motorist declined to stop for a trooper in Stetson and sped away in an SUV. At one point, the motorist stopped, entered a home and then departed with a stolen vehicle, police said.
The man tried to steal another car, in Bangor, after the vehicle was disabled by spike mats, police said.
The man had two outstanding warrants and faces new charges including eluding an officer, passing a roadblock, driving to endanger, burglary and theft, police said. It was not clear Monday if he had an attorney.
LEWISTON
Fireworks complaints rolling in as July 4 nears
City officials are reminding residents that fireworks are only permitted in a limited fashion over the Independence Day holiday. Across the river in Auburn, consumer fireworks are not permitted at all.
But, even with the restrictions, the annual fireworks complaints are rolling in.
According to Lewiston Police Lt. Dave St. Pierre, there have been eight fireworks complaints since the beginning of June. One led to a civil summons being issued on June 20.
"Despite fireworks being legal, there are many rules applicable, such as discharge dates and there are zones that they cannot be discharged," he said.
In Lewiston, those dates are Dec. 31, Jan. 1 and July 4, when fireworks are allowed from 10 a.m. through 10 p.m. However, the city's ordinance stipulates that fireworks only be used in a specific discharge zone, which eliminates most of Lewiston's main residential areas.
The discharge zone lines up with the city's firearm discharge zones.
Boston
City mourns 2 victims of possible hate crime
BOSTON -- One was a respected state trooper, the other a beloved Air Force vet.
Family and friends on Monday mourned David Green and Ramona Cooper, the two bystanders killed Saturday afternoon by a white gunman in a Boston suburb in an attack officials are treating as a hate crime.
Authorities, meanwhile, said they're investigating when and how the gunman became radicalized.
Prosecutors say Nathan Allen drew swastikas and wrote messages about whites being superior in the weeks leading up to the shootings. He was killed by police moments after shooting the victims, who were African American.
Green and Cooper were each shot multiple times by Allen after he crashed a stolen box truck into a residential building in Winthrop, an overwhelmingly white, coastal community located on a peninsula jutting into Boston Harbor.

Seattle and Portland endure another day of relentless heat gripping the Northwest

Texto completo: The mercury kept climbing Monday in heat-baked Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, again setting record highs.
Canada and US cities in the Northwest are all reporting their hottest temperatures on record in a wave that has more heat in store. More than 20 million people are under a heat warning or advisory, from the Canadian border to the Mexican border.
Seattle had topped its all-time record high Sunday when thermometers climbed to 104 degrees -- so hot that even the normally freezing temperatures above 10,000 feet on Mt. Rainier reached 73 degrees.
That record fell on Monday, when the city endured 106 degrees, with the possibility of a higher number by the end of the day.
Portland was at 115 on Monday afternoon, three ahead of Sunday's mark.
It was the third day in a row when the heat was above 107 degrees.
In Multnomah County, home to Portland, the sheriff's office said it has responded to multiple heat-related calls and ambulances were stretched thin due to demand.
"We ask folks to postpone outdoor activities, find appropriate shelter, stay out of the heat until temperatures subside," the office tweeted.
Temperatures are expected to remain scorching in the area until Tuesday. That is when highs are supposed to dip to 93 degrees -- still far above the usual 75 at this time of year.
Lytton, British Columbia, holds the record for the hottest temperature ever recorded in Canada after topping out at 117.5 degrees on Monday. That eclipsed 116 degrees Sunday, when it was hotter in Lytton than in Abu Dhabi.
Record keeping in these areas dates back to the late 1800s, meaning temperatures like these haven't been seen in these regions for more than 100 years, said CNN meteorologist Michael Guy.
The heat wave is a clear example of the climate crisis affecting global weather. Climate change will also make record-breaking heat waves more frequent in the future -- and researchers and policy experts say the Pacific Northwest is not prepared.
By the middle of this century, the number of days that hit 90 degrees in the Pacific Northwest is expected to increase from a current average of around six to 16 a year, according to a study from the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Olympic trials and streetcar services shut down
At Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, the US Olympic track and field trials were suspended Sunday due to extreme heat.
Sunday was the last day of the 10-day of trials and the events were scheduled to resume at 11:30 p.m. ET.
Eugene set a new all-time high of 110 degrees Sunday, breaking the prior record of 108 degrees set on August 9, 1981.
In Portland, all Metropolitan Area Express Light Rail and Streetcar service has been suspended until Tuesday morning due to extreme heat, according to the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet).
"Please be sure to stay hydrated and do not travel, unless for emergencies," TriMet said in a statement Sunday night.
Bus service is still operational and TriMet said it will not turn away any customers who are unable to pay their transit fare during the extreme heat.
In Seattle, some restaurants had to close Sunday and Monday because of the heat, CNN affiliate KING reported.
"On a day like today, all bets are off," Matt Galvin, co-owner of Pagliacci Pizza in the Columbia City neighborhood, told the station.
Residents used blow-up pools, visited lakes and even stayed in hotels to get some relief, CNN affiliate KIRO reported.
Portland Parks & Recreation announced the closure of outdoor pools Monday because it is too hot for employees to be outside, CNN affiliate KATU reported.
Volunteers helped local health leaders like Dr. Jennifer Vines, health officer for Multnomah County. Hundreds of people have used cooling centers set up since temperatures began soaring.
"People don't realize how deadly heat can be," Vines told KATU. "Northwesterners are used to cool evenings and overnights. It gives our bodies a break; it's a chance to open the windows and cool down apartments and homes. We're not going to get that these next few days."
A heat dome acts as an oven over the region
Scorching conditions in the region come from a large ridge of high pressure that has formed a heat dome, which is essentially acting as an oven to bake the region for an extended period of time.
Hot air rises, but the high pressure acts as an atmospheric lid -- forcing the hot air back to the surface where it is heated even further.
"Imagine a swimming pool when the heater is turned on -- temperatures rise quickly in the areas surrounding the heater jets, while the rest of the pool takes longer to warm up," the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said.
The circulations within the heat dome allow temperatures to increase quickly and within a fairly confined region.
Rural eastern Oregon and Washington will feel the heat wave through the Fourth of July weekend, and eastern Idaho will also swelter.
"Right now, we're looking at 105-110 in Snake Basin of Idaho and the Treasure Valley. We could be breaking all-time records in Boise on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week." said NWS Boise meteorologist Korri Anderson.
NWS Boise is urging people not to become another statistic, as heat-related deaths are the number one cause of weather fatalities.
"According to the CDC, over 600 people die each year from heat. It can happen to you," NWS Boise warns.
CNN's Rachel Ramirez, Joe Sutton, Angela Fritz, Jamiel Lynch, Taylor Ward, Jay Croft, Hannah Gard and Haley Brink contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Those who've been able to work from home over the past year have had to get creative about their workstations, setting up makeshift offices on balconies, couches or even kitchen counters. Some temporarily relocated to new cities and towns early in the pandemic.
But a new convergence of factors in the United States - easier access to vaccinations, loosening domestic restrictions, falling coronavirus cases and good weather - has led to a golden opportunity for those tempted to take their work on the road after a year of staying put.
Whether you hope to try out a new city for a permanent move or just want to take advantage of the last few months outside the office, here are six cities or towns to consider for remote work this summer.
If you like the beach ... Honolulu: Sarah Sheu, 29, a product lead for the travel app Hopper, has been working from her parents' home in Honolulu since mid-May. At first, she thought the time difference between Hawaii and the East Coast, where many of her colleagues are based, would make it difficult to communicate with them. But it has worked out, she said, and her early start - she logs on around 5:30 a.m. - leaves her afternoons free to explore Honolulu.
On your off time, Sheu recommends bicycling to and around Diamond Head, a state park with a large crater at its center that has well-marked bike lanes and stellar coastal views. You might also go surfing at Waikiki Beach or stand-up paddleboarding at Ala Moana.
If you want to be in wine country ... Petaluma, California: When Joanna Faltys, 31, moved to Petaluma from Boston in 2015, it felt like the perfect compromise between her desire to be in Sonoma County, where she'd grown up, and her husband Brian's need to be close to the San Francisco Bay for his work in the boating industry.
"It was only once we moved here that we realized what a perfect fit it was for our lifestyle as well," said Faltys. "Petaluma really offers everything we love: beautiful scenery, proximity to outdoor activities, great restaurants and coffee shops, and good entertainment options."
The city also lends itself to remote work, she said, with two centrally located coworking spaces and several coffee shops with Wi-Fi, while offering access to San Francisco, some of the region's most popular vineyards and its beautiful coast.
If you want a manageable city ... Topeka, Kansas: For a city with a spirit of social justice and an array of cultural offerings, try Topeka. The city opened Evergy Plaza in 2020, a central hub with free Wi-Fi where people can work or enjoy a monthly concert series, complete with food trucks and pop-up beer gardens.
As home of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka has a strong undercurrent of social justice, said Bob Ross, a spokesman for Choose Topeka. One of his recommendations for long-term stays is Liberty House, an Airbnb rental which puts profits toward supporting LGBTQ youth in the Midwest.
During their off time, people can explore the North Topeka Arts District, known as NOTO, which was restored in 2008 to include murals, galleries and restaurants housed in historic buildings.
If you're a foodie ... Tucson, Arizona: Named a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy in 2015 for its heritage foods and dishes that draw from its Mexican and Indigenous history and location in the Sonoran Desert, Tucson is ideal for culinary enthusiasts.
Visitors can explore the city's Best 23 Miles of Mexican Food, a trail of restaurants and food trucks featuring Mexican cuisine, or local favorites like Barrio Bread, known for its bread made of Sonoran wheat.
If you want a twofer ... Bath and Brunswick, Maine: Bath and Brunswick, neighboring towns along the coast of Maine, are distinct, but their proximity to each other - about 8 miles - by car or a river trail makes it easy to explore both during an extended stay.
Brunswick, the home of Bowdoin College, has a thriving downtown and, before 2020, had a steady stream of international visitors drawn to the college and the town's rich arts scene. Bath is on the Kennebec River, has lots of green space and is a more community-driven town, according to Nate Wildes, executive director of Live + Work in Maine.
"The culture and the feel together is really well balanced," he said, though the towns are "very distinct and different."
If you like nature ... Ithaca, New York: For nature lovers, travel blogger Gerry Isabelle, who asked to be identified by her first and middle name to protect her privacy, recommends this city in the lush region in upstate New York. "There's a little bit of everything," she said.
The Finger Lakes, named for its 11 long, narrow lakes, is home to a number of colleges and universities, state parks and wine trails. And Ithaca's central location at the foot of Cayuga Lake offers easy access to urban amenities as well as many of the region's towns and attractions.
"You won't just be working from home," Isabelle said. "You'd literally be working with views of the lake from your window."
Watkins Glen State Park and the Finger Lakes National Forest are within 30 minutes of Ithaca, and Buttermilk Falls State Park's stunning water falls and trails are only a 10-minute drive away.

The Mountain West has emerged as one of the most vaccine-hesitant regions of the United States. Along with the South, it is lagging far behind the national vaccination pace.
In both Idaho and Wyoming, fewer than 40% of people have received at least one dose so far, ranking those states among the bottom five in the nation, according to a New York Times database. Montana, Utah and Nevada are doing a bit better, but remain well below the national average of 54% . None of the five states is on track to meet President Joe Biden’s goal of at least partly vaccinating 70% of adults by July 4, and the White House acknowledged this past week that the president doesn’t expect the nation as a whole to meet that target.
Health officials in the region say that their efforts have been hampered by sparse populations in their wide-open areas and by the deep-rooted brand of political conservatism that is common among rural residents. But there is more to the story than that.
As in other parts of the country, the unvaccinated in the Mountain West can be divided largely into two camps, experts say.
“There are those who are kind of the wait-and-see folks, and then we have the absolutely, definitely not,” said Greg Holzman, who was Montana’s state medical officer until April. Rampant misinformation makes it difficult to change minds, he said, and so does the logistical difficulty of providing convenient access in small, widely scattered communities.
There are crosscurrents beneath the statewide trends. For example, Native Americans in Montana, after some initial hesitancy, have embraced the vaccines while white residents in rural areas have been less accepting.
Garfield County, in eastern Montana, illustrates some of what health officials are up against. The county was the scene of a lengthy standoff in 1996 between the FBI and an anti-government militia called the Montana Freemen. These days, “the life philosophy is pretty much the same, and that’s no government intervention, no way, no how,” said Dr. Randall Rauh, medical director of the Garfield County Health Center, a critical access facility and nursing home.
Just 21% of eligible county residents have been fully vaccinated, the lowest rate in Montana, according to state figures.
Rauh said that after the center vaccinated all of its nursing home residents, he was accused by an employee of experimenting on old people, and the facility received little support from local officials. The county health department will only administer vaccine doses when 10 or more people show up to get them, Rauh said, so “it’s very difficult for people unless they can make the trip to a surrounding county to get vaccinated.”
In Utah, home to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the church’s leadership has voiced strong support for vaccination. Even so, a recent survey found that about half of Mormon respondents were hesitant or unwilling to get vaccinated.
Misinformation appears to be a factor among Mormon women, in a state with one of the nation’s highest birthrates, said Dr. Emily Spivak, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City. “I’ve had a lot of questions about fertility,” and whether the vaccines affect menstruation, she said. There is no current evidence that the vaccines impact fertility.
Idaho tends to have lower immunization rates in general, according to Maggie Mann, district director for Southeastern Idaho Public Health. Many people have told her that their schedules are too busy to fit in the appointment.
The eight counties Mann oversees are dotted with communities that have not been severely hit by the pandemic, she said, and “it’s hard for people when they haven’t been personally affected to be highly motivated to get that vaccine.”
Only one county in Nevada has fully vaccinated more than half of its residents 12 and older, according to the Times database. Experts say many people in the state’s rural areas simply do not see the need.
Matthew Walker, CEO of William Bee Ririe Critical Access Hospital and Rural Health Clinics in Ely, Nevada, said that health care workers try to win over skeptics by appealing to their sense of self-reliance.
“We try to really push that if you get sick, regardless whether it’s the flu or COVID, and you have to be laid up in bed for a few days, or worse, what’s going to happen?” he said. “You can’t take care of yourself, you’re an hour or two away from a medical facility, you’ve got kids or family — who’s going to take care of your ranch? And oftentimes, that will get people.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: An extraordinary heat wave is taking shape this weekend, potentially unlike any other the Northwest US has experienced.
As temperatures surge into the triple digits, Seattle could feel more like Las Vegas, while Portland could experience Phoenix-level warmth in an area where having air conditioning isn't always the norm. Dozens of heat records -- including some all-time records set decades ago -- are forecast to fall in Oregon, Washington and Idaho, all in the first week of summer.
"Usually, the hottest time of the year [in Washington] lags a month after the solstice," Rocco Pelatti, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Spokane, told CNN Weather. "July is usually the hottest month; sometimes, it bleeds into August. To have June start out like it has is very concerning."
The heat will rise toward uncharted territory in Seattle and Portland. By late weekend, high temperatures could be 25 to 30 degrees above what's normal for this time of year.
Seattle's average high in late June is 72 degrees, while Portland typically enjoys 75-degree afternoons this time of year. Forecast models suggest high temperatures could be near or above 100 degrees for the two cities from Saturday through Monday.
See how hot it will get >>>
Seattle has maintained weather observations since 1894. During that time, the city has eclipsed the 100-degree mark on only three occasions. It's forecast to hit 100 three days this weekend alone.
The mercury in Seattle rarely climbs above 90 degrees. As a result, the hottest June temperature ever observed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport -- 96 degrees in 2017 -- will also be in jeopardy this weekend.
Much like the Southwest heat wave last week, a massive ridge of high pressure -- colloquially referred to as a heat dome -- will be responsible for the torrid heat. But unlike the Southwest, millions of people in the Northwest do not have air conditioning in their homes.
"In this area, not many people have A/C, so we don't have the relief that we can get in other places that get this hot," said Mary Butwin, a meteorologist for NWS Seattle.
Least air-conditioned city in the US
The heat could be lethal in Seattle and Portland, which rank first and third respectively for major US cities with the fewest air-conditioned households. A US Census Bureau study in 2015 found that only 33% of Seattle-area homes were air conditioned.
The lack of A/C in Seattle -- a city known for its tepid summers -- has not historically been a problem. Between 1971 and 2000, the city averaged only three 90-degree days each summer. However, from 2015-2018, the average number of 90-degree days increased to 10 each summer.
Not surprisingly, the US Census Bureau updated its findings in 2019, revealing that A/C adoption in Seattle had risen to 44%, an 11% increase in A/C units installed since just 2015.
"What makes this heat wave unique from others we've had in the area is the lack of a marine influence in the overnight hours," said Samantha Borth, a meteorologist at NWS Seattle.
With its proximity to Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean, overnight temperatures can fall into the 50s, even on the hottest summer days.
Since records began at Sea-Tac airport in 1945, there was only one night that failed to drop below 70 degrees: the morning of an infamous 103-degree afternoon in July 2009. Come Sunday and Monday, the record books could include two additional 70-degree mornings, making for an unbearable weekend for the households without A/C.
All-time records in jeopardy
An even more oppressive heat wave is looming in Portland.
The hottest June temperature ever felt in the city was 102 degrees on June 26, 2006. The all-time maximum temperature the city has endured was a notch higher at 107 degrees (August 1981 and July 1964).
From Saturday to Monday, forecasts are pointing to high temperatures in the range of 100 to 110 degrees in Portland, likely breaking the all-time June mark and threatening the overall maximum temperature on the first full weekend of summer.
"With all three days, we would be breaking the June highest temperature record, and if we do reach the 107, we would be tying the all-time warmest day ever recorded in Portland," said Lisa Kriederman, a meteorologist at NWS Portland.
As the massive dome of high pressure strengthens, the air will compress and heat up, like the warmth felt on a bike pump while pumping a tire. That, combined with dry winds from the deserts of eastern Washington and Oregon, will potentially send the mercury to near all-time records in both states.
In Spokane, temperatures are likely to top 100 degrees well into next week.
"We haven't seen anything like this in a while," Pelatti says. "For the Spokane area, we are forecasting 108 for Monday and Tuesday. Even after Tuesday, it still looks like it will stay hot, with temperatures in the 100s."
The last time Spokane had a consecutive number of days over 100 was in 1928.
"Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, we have temperatures exceeding 100 degrees," Pelatti says. "Guidance suggests that the temperatures still stay above 100 after Tuesday for a number of days, so it could possibly exceed six."
Similar to Washington and Oregon, Idaho will see blistering record heat well into next week.
"Right now, we're looking at 105 to 110 in snake basin of Idaho and the Treasure Valley," said Korri Anderson, a meteorologist with NWS Boise. "We could be breaking all-time records in Boise on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week."
The all-time record at Boise is 111 and Ontario is 113, Anderson adds. "So we could be flirting with those next week."
An excessive heat warning has been issued for more than 11 million people in parts of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. In the Columbia Basin, the region's typical hot spot, the high temperature forecast is between 110-112 degrees this weekend.
These temperatures would be within striking distance of state records for Oregon (117 in July 1939) and Washington (118 in August 1961).
Extreme heat to become the norm in the Northwest
Parts of the Northwest could see the average number of 105-degree days increase from 0 to 2 in as little as 15 years, according to a recent study.
Without any intervention, that number would increase to an average of five days by late century, while 90-degree days would increase from roughly six days to 37 days each year in that same period.
"We always have a chance of extreme heat, particularly in the summer," Katharine Hayhoe, the chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy, previously told CNN. "But as the world warms, we see that summer heatwaves are coming earlier, lasting longer, and are becoming hotter and more intense."

The Shakers Are Movers, Too

CHATHAM, N.Y. — In an earlier life, the moribund red brick Victorian building at the foot of Main Street in this thriving Columbia County village had been a sanitarium, a hotel and tavern, a furniture store and an auto dealership. These were the warmup acts for its latest incarnation: a permanent new home for the Shaker Museum, widely considered the country’s most significant collection of Shaker furniture, objects and archival material. The museum, set to open in 2023 and to include a new addition, is being designed by architect Annabelle Selldorf, whose current projects include the expansion of The Frick Collection, in New York City, and an addition for the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego La Jolla.
“Modern architects tend to like the clarity and simplicity of Shaker furniture and architecture,” Selldorf said. “But of course, it’s so much more profound than that. It’s about equality, sustainability and community, to mention a few of the values. The pairing of the two really appealed to me.”
The collection, which is online, has been physically housed in somewhat dilapidated farm buildings and has not been on public view for a decade. The new $18 million complex will house a conservation and storage facility, permanent and rotating exhibitions, a public reading room and a community space. Selldorf, who is something of a court architect to the art world, has designed a series of glass links to connect the old and new structures. These will open up to a Shaker-inspired landscape by the firm Nelson Byrd Woltz and made up of medicinal and native plants and a small garden of concentric circles loosely based on Shaker dances. Selldorf’s renderings, along with a few stellar pieces, are currently on view in “The Future is a Gift,” a pop-up exhibition in Chatham, which is close to the Shaker heartlands of New Lebanon, New York, and Hancock, Massachusetts.
The new museum is the latest example of what William Moore, director of the American and New England Studies program at Boston University, has dubbed “Shaker fever.” Perhaps no one was more stricken than John Stanton Williams (1902-1982), a wealthy New York stockbroker-turned-gentleman farmer whose passion for antique farm implements eventually led him to Shaker barns and then communities, where he amassed the encyclopedic collection of more than 18,000 objects that form the backbone of the new facility.
In contrast to competitors, who bought with an eye for resale, Williams was a bit of a nerd whose primary interest in the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, as the Shakers were officially known, was their entrepreneurial and technological prowess. He befriended Eldresses and Sisters, amassing key pieces from a religious sect best known at the time for communal practices that included celibacy, shared economic resources, male and female leadership, an abhorrence of excess and the ecstatic liturgical dancing that gave birth to the popular name “Shakers.”
The qualities that most fascinated Williams were the Shakers’ embrace of new technology and their economic self-sufficiency and business savvy. Among the items the Shakers produced for commercial consumption were seeds in pioneering packets, medicinal compounds, chairs, brooms, collegiate letter sweaters, wooden buckets and ladies cloaks (in racy red, in contrast to the black worn by Shaker sisters). In addition to now-archetypal furniture in original paint, including Shaker blue, Williams bought washing machines, fire engines, hand looms for weaving, mortising machines for crafting beams, bonnets and the contents of a blacksmith’s shop, to name a few.
The Shakers also repurposed familiar objects — one of the collection's more intriguing artifacts is an 1830s rocking chair outfitted with wooden wheels to accommodate people with disabilities, and there is an early example of blue orthopedic shoes. Rather than focus on Shakers as the subjects of New Deal photography or as the precursors of modernism, Williams probed their Protestant work ethic and Yankee ingenuity, approaching his task like “an anthropologist documenting the decline of a culture,” Moore said. He also gathered an influential community of supporters, including Norman Rockwell, Eric Sloane and Zelina Brunschwig, textile designer and chairman of the famous fabric house.
The museum’s exhibitions are still in the nascent stages. Maggie Taft, a guest curator, said the permanent exhibition will address the fundamental aspects of Shakerism, which reached its zenith in the 1840s with 18 villages from Maine to Kentucky, but also the unexpected subtexts. The sect — an international Protestant monastic community — was founded in 1774 by Mother Ann Lee, the charismatic illiterate daughter of an English blacksmith (a swatch of one of her aprons is among the museum’s most prized possessions).
Although the sect was known for gender equality, Taft noted that women and men were “divided in ways that resembled worldly labor divisions” — with men toiling outside on agriculture and other tasks while the women worked indoors. The exhibition will also explore the different generations of Shakerism, especially the third generation after Mother Ann Lee’s death, in 1784, when young women’s “encounters” with her were manifested in drawings and texts thought to be “gifts” from the spirits.
The spare, modernistic furnishings for which the Shakers are best known are typically exhibited for their aesthetics. These pieces were not intended for individual use, however, but rather shared among groups or men and women. Time has shed light on a pine wheelbarrow — featured in the 1986 “Shaker Design” show at the Whitney Museum — that was said to be used for clearing land: Research has shown it hauled boxes of medicine. The idea will be to go beyond the visual to focus on the human aspects of the furniture.
“The Shakers were radical in the kinds of decisions they were making about gender equality, racial equality, vegetarianism, accessibility, shared property and pacificism — choices far more progressive than their contemporaries and things we are still wrestling with today,” Taft said.
The 30,000 visitors a year who are projected to visit the museum will be a boon to Columbia County, where about 15% of the housing stock consists of second homes typically owned by weekending New Yorkers. It seems likely to spark a Shaker tourism circuit that would include Hancock Shaker Village in nearby Pittsfield, Massachusetts, a living history museum that has an archetypal Round Barn, baby animals and goat yoga.
The Shaker Museum itself owns 91 acres with 10 Shaker buildings in nearby New Lebanon — once Mount Lebanon, the spiritual and administrative mother ship of the Shaker communities throughout New England, Kentucky, Ohio and Florida. One centerpiece is the shell of the Great Stone Barn, a National Historic Landmark that was damaged by fire in the 1970s. Its ingenious three-story design — “a machine of a building,” in the words of Jerry Grant, the museum's director of collections and research — was built into a hill and allowed hay to be pitchforked to the cows below, with manure deposited by a railway system into a vault from which it could be carted away into the pastures. It was an early example of sustainability. “They were on it,” said Lacy Schutz, the museum’s executive director.
Once the province of the North Family, as the community was known, the museum’s property in New Lebanon includes a still-elegant granary that, like many of the museum’s objects, conveys the sense of the human hand, with pencil marks for orders scribbled on the beams. The museum has restored hiking trails amid weatherworn stone walls and is offering tours of the collection this summer.
Grant said that the Shakers themselves would not have understood the obsession with aesthetics that persists among collectors and imitators of Shaker furniture today; they were merely trying to create a physical environment that harmonized and didn’t interfere with how they chose to live their lives.
To the Shakers, material culture was not spiritual, Brother Arnold Hadd of the Sabbathday Lake Shakers in Maine once explained to an interviewer. It was just material. The Shakers “were the shrewdest Yankees going,” he noted. “We are the ultimate capitalistic communists.”

Texto completo: President Biden announced his first slate of political ambassadors Tuesday, selecting longtime Washington hands for key foreign postings.
Biden will nominate Thomas R. Nides, a former State Department official, to serve as the ambassador to Israel; Julie Smith, a former Biden national security adviser, as the ambassador to North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and Ken Salazar, the former secretary of the interior and senator from Colorado, as the ambassador to Mexico.
The Washington Post previously reported the three were expected in those spots.
Biden will also nominate C. B. “Sully" Sullenberger, III, who safely landed a plane on the Hudson River in 2009, as the representative to the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and Dr. Cynthia Ann Telles, a UCLA professor of psychiatry, to serve as ambassador to Costa Rica.
Washington Post
July Fourth celebration planned at White House
The White House will host a 1,000-person gathering on the South Lawn on the Fourth of July, a celebratory display meant to signal that President Biden delivered on a promise that Americans could expect to return to some semblance of normal life by the holiday.
Essential workers and military families will be invited to participate in the South Lawn event, and administration officials have encouraged local leaders to hold their own celebrations: “America is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year. A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations," an e-mail circulated to local leaders by the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs said.
The National Parks Service announced that visitors are encouraged to attend a holiday fireworks display on the National Mall and that all nearby monuments will be open. (Last year, attendees were advised to stay socially distanced and to avoid traveling into the capital.)
Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington also issued a statement that “D.C. is open and ready to welcome back visitors" for the holiday.
“We thank President Biden and his team for acting with urgency to get the vaccine to the American people so that we could save lives, get our country open, and celebrate together once again," Bowser said.
The large celebration goes well beyond the scope of what Biden had promised three months ago. In a televised address in March to mark the anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic, Biden said the country could expect to celebrate with friends and family on the Fourth of July, as long as they took the chance to get vaccinated and did not prematurely abandon mask wearing, social distancing and other measures to contain the virus.
“July 4th with your loved ones is the goal," he said. “This is not the time to let up."
The modest expectations Biden laid out in his speech have given way to the largest planned event of his presidency, one designed to emphasize the speed with which the Biden administration has gotten shots in arms. Still, with a recent slowdown in vaccination rates, particularly in Southern states, Biden may not reach his goal of 70 percent of Americans vaccinated by July 4. If the pace of adult vaccination continues on the seven-day average, the nation will come in just shy of Biden's target, with roughly 67 percent of adults partly vaccinated by July 4, according to a New York Times analysis.

Rohrabacher says he was with crowd outside Capitol
Former congressman Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, said Monday that he was among the crowds outside the US Capitol on Jan. 6, but claimed that he was there to protest the election and did not join others in storming the building.
Rohrabacher acknowledged his presence outside the Capitol in an interview with a Maine newspaper. Over the weekend, social media users began circulating photos that appeared to show the former congressman and an associate standing among the pro-Trump crowd.
“I marched to protest, and I thought the election was fraudulent and it should be investigated, and I wanted to express that and be supportive of that demand," Rohrabacher, 73, said in the interview with the Portland Press Herald. “But I was not there to make a scene and do things that were unacceptable for anyone to do."
Rohrabacher could not immediately be reached for comment.
There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and dozens of court challenges seeking to overturn President Biden's victory failed.
Nearly 140 police officers were assaulted during the insurrection, authorities said, facing some rioters armed with ax handles, bats, metal batons, wooden poles, hockey sticks, and other weapons.
The House last month passed legislation that would form an independent commission to investigate the attack. But the measure failed to advance in the Senate, with nearly all Republicans in the chamber banding together in opposition.
During his time as a member of Congress, Rohrabacher earned a reputation as among the most vocal defenders of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. In June 2016, then-House majority leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, asserted in a private conversation with other Republican leaders: “There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump."
Rohrabacher served in Congress for 30 years. After losing reelection in 2018, he moved to Maine and has been active in the cannabis industry. He and his wife, Rhonda, have also taken steps toward becoming active in local politics in their new hometown of York.
According to the Portland Press Herald, videos of the Jan. 6 riot show the former congressman was nearly 500 feet inside the restricted zone surrounding the Capitol, but there are no signs that he tried to enter the building.
In the interview with the newspaper, Rohrabacher also promoted a false narrative about the storming of the Capitol, claiming without evidence that “leftist provocateurs" led the charge.
“By going into the building, they gave the left the ability to direct the discussion of what was going on in a way that was harmful to the things we believe in," Rohrabacher said.
Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, has made similar false claims about the identities of those who stormed the Capitol. Federal officials have said there is no substantial evidence of left-wing provocation or that anti-fascist activists posed as Trump supporters during the riot.

Texto completo: President Biden announced his first slate of political ambassadors Tuesday, selecting longtime Washington hands for key foreign postings.
Biden will nominate Thomas R. Nides, a former State Department official, to serve as the ambassador to Israel; Julie Smith, a former Biden national security adviser, as the ambassador to North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and Ken Salazar, the former secretary of the interior and senator from Colorado, as the ambassador to Mexico.
The Washington Post previously reported the three were expected in those spots.
Biden will also nominate C. B. “Sully” Sullenberger, III, who safely landed a plane on the Hudson River in 2009, as the representative to the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and Dr. Cynthia Ann Telles, a UCLA professor of psychiatry, to serve as ambassador to Costa Rica.

July Fourth celebration planned at White House The White House will host a 1,000-person gathering on the South Lawn on the Fourth of July, a celebratory display meant to signal that President Biden delivered on a promise that Americans could expect to return to some semblance of normal life by the holiday.
Essential workers and military families will be invited to participate in the South Lawn event, and administration officials have encouraged local leaders to hold their own celebrations: “America is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year. A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations,” an e-mail circulated to local leaders by the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs said.
The National Parks Service announced that visitors are encouraged to attend a holiday fireworks display on the National Mall and that all nearby monuments will be open. (Last year, attendees were advised to stay socially distanced and to avoid traveling into the capital.)
Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington also issued a statement that “D.C. is open and ready to welcome back visitors” for the holiday.
“We thank President Biden and his team for acting with urgency to get the vaccine to the American people so that we could save lives, get our country open, and celebrate together once again,” Bowser said.
The large celebration goes well beyond the scope of what Biden had promised three months ago.

Sens. Menendez, Collins to New York Times: There Will Be Another Pandemic - Are We Prepared for It?

Texto completo: Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, issued the following joint commentary with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to the New York Times:
* * *
U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) penned the following op-ed published in today's New York Times calling on Congress to support the creation of an independent, 9/11-style commission to assess the U.S. pandemic response and ensure the country is better prepared to confront future public health and economic crises. The senators have introduced the National Coronavirus Commission Act, the only bipartisan, bicameral legislation of its kind.
* * *
The devastating events of Sept. 11, 2001, shook the United States to its core and sparked immediate and consequential actions to protect American lives. Congress formed the independent 9/11 Commission to investigate the security missteps that contributed to the attack and to issue prescriptions for what we as a country could do better to prevent future acts of foreign terrorism on American soil. The commission released a series of recommendations, many of which were adopted quickly, to tighten security and improve interdepartmental information sharing and coordination.
The death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic is more than 200 times that of the 9/11 attacks -- but Congress has yet to establish a similar blue ribbon commission to investigate the vulnerabilities of our public health system and issue guidance for how we as a nation can better protect the American people from future pandemics.
We are just now beginning to emerge from a pandemic that has already claimed more than 600,000 mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, spouses, friends, neighbors and co-workers in the United States alone. Tragically, it will claim even more lives before it's over. The economic costs of the pandemic have yet to be fully realized, even though we have finally begun to reopen, owing to the swift pace of vaccinations and the flow of billions of dollars in stimulus money into the economy. But it isn't too soon to call for an independent, 9/11-style commission.
Abroad, Covid-19 continues to kill thousands of people a day and infect hundreds of thousands more. Here at home, we are racing to stop the spread of new coronavirus variants. Health care workers are grappling with post-traumatic stress disorder and the strain on our families, our children and our economy has been enormous.
We should do everything in our power to prevent our country and our communities, small businesses and families from enduring a similar ordeal again, because it's not a matter of if but when another pandemic or public health emergency will strike. That is why we introduced the National Coronavirus Commission Act. Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, and Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives, making the act the only bipartisan, bicameral legislation of its kind.
The 9/11 Commission, led by former representative Lee Hamilton and former governor Tom Kean, conducted a thorough investigation of the events leading up to the terror attacks. It attracted leading experts, acted independently from politics and is considered to be the gold standard for bipartisan commissions to this day. Our legislation will bring this same comprehensive approach to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The bill creates an independent, nonpartisan commission to assess the U.S. pandemic response. It will illuminate our successes and uncover our failures, and it will provide Congress with actionable recommendations to improve our readiness and prevent future public health crises and the massive loss of life we have suffered from Covid-19.
The commission will have a broad mandate to investigate our pandemic response from all angles, including international disease surveillance; federal, state and local government coordination; private sector engagement; and vaccine development and distribution. It will also examine why some of our communities, especially communities of color, experienced disproportionately higher rates of sickness, death and economic harm.
Covid-19 is not the first pandemic to hit our shores, and it won't be the last. Scientists predict that pandemic diseases will become more common in the 21st century, and we must be far better prepared for the next one. That is why a comprehensive analysis of our Covid-19 response is critical to ensuring our readiness and safeguarding our nation's long-term health, security and economic interests.
We were both deeply engaged in implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, which is why we are equally committed to protecting this nation and its people from future pandemics. We believe that, in the aftermath of this public health and economic catastrophe, we must once again come together in a bipartisan way to do serious and necessary work to save American lives.
We urge all our colleagues in Congress to join us in supporting the National Coronavirus Commission Act. This is not about pointing fingers but learning from our shared experiences and committing to do better by our fellow Americans.
We must meet the urgency of this moment, examine the U.S. response to Covid-19 and learn from our mistakes. After burying more than 600,000 of our loved ones, it is the very least we can do.

Susan Collins says she supports investigation into Trump DOJ's subpoenas on Congress

Resumen: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions subpoenaed Apple in 2017 and 2018 for the data belonging to California Rep. Adam Schiff, then-ranking member of the committee, as well as panel staff and family members amid a hunt for the sources of leaks about Trump associates and their ties to Russia.

Texto completo: Maine Sen. Susan Collins on Sunday said she supports an "in-depth investigation" into former President Donald Trump's Justice Department after reports surfaced that it subpoenaed information on House Democrats.
On Thursday, the New York Times reported that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions subpoenaed Apple in 2017 and 2018 for the data belonging to California Rep. Adam Schiff, then-ranking member of the committee, as well as panel staff and family members amid a hunt for the sources of leaks about Trump associates and their ties to Russia. The Maine Republican said "two serious allegations" warrant an inquiry from President Joe Biden's administration.
"There are two serious allegations here," she told CBS News's John Dickerson. "One has to do with whether or not there was a leak of classified information by members of Congress. But the second, which is also important, is, has the Justice Department abused its power by going after members of Congress or the press for partisan, political purposes?"
"And that's why I support the deputy attorney general's request that the inspector general of the Department of Justice do an in-depth investigation of both of these issues. That is really important," she added.
PELOSI SAYS TRUMP-ERA SUBPOENAS GO 'BEYOND RICHARD NIXON' AS SHE VOWS TO INVESTIGATE
On Friday, the DOJ's top watchdog, Michael Horowitz, announced an investigation has commenced into the activity of both Sessions and former Attorney General William Barr. The New York Times reported that records of "at least a dozen people tied to the" House Intelligence Committee were seized by DOJ authorities. Previous reports have also suggested that top brass in the Trump administration also sought seizures from journalists with the Washington Post, CNN, and the New York Times.
The revelations drew immediate scorn from congressional leadership, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard Durbin, who referred to the allegations as an "appalling politicization of the Department of Justice." The pair also said at least one GOP member would have to be on board with the investigation into Sessions and Barr in order to subpoena the pair.
Collins, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and an outspoken critic of Trump, may fill that void.
Also on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the accusations against the Trump administration go "beyond" the conduct of former President Richard Nixon. She expressed support for both former attorneys general to speak before Congress on the matter.
“What the Republicans did — what the administration did ... goes even beyond Richard Nixon," Pelosi told CNN's Dana Bash. "Richard Nixon had an enemies list. This is about undermining the rule of law, and for these attorneys general ... or Sessions, at least, to say they, too, didn’t know anything about it is beyond belief.”
“So we will have to have them come under oath to testify about that," she added.

When asked if she'll subpoena Sessions and Barr if they refuse to testify, the Democratic leader said, “Well, let’s hope that they will want to honor the rule of law.”
Sessions, Barr, and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have denied knowledge of the subpoenas.

EDITORIAL: Susan Collins and Angus King can play a productive role in protecting voting rights

Texto completo: Jun. 11 - The BDN Editorial Board operates independently from the newsroom, and does not set policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.com.
The debate over voting rights could very well go nowhere in Congress, bogged down in part by party messaging, sweeping generalizations and inflexibility. Both of Maine's senators are well positioned to help cut through that noise and get something done.
The actions and words from several state legislatures around the country underscore the need for Congress to shore up federal protections to safeguard the fundamental right to vote for all legal voters. As an extension of former President Donald Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election, Republican state lawmakers across the country have pursued and passed new laws in the name of election security. But some of their own comments, like indicating that some votes are worth more than others, speak more to voter suppression rather than security.
The imperative for congressional action is clear. The political path forward is much murkier.
Democrats, minus a notable holdout in Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are pushing the sweeping For the People Act as a solution. Some argue that American democracy hinges on the more than 800-page bill's passage. This is hyperbole, even with the obvious need for action.
We want to see action on voting rights. We also recognize that the For the People Act is more than a voting rights bill. It contains a host of other provisions like campaign finance and ethics reforms that, while sounding good in many cases, make it easy for Republicans to dismiss the entire package as a liberal wish list and power grab. So our message to Democrats is this, even if it should go without saying: In the push for stronger voting rights protections, focus on actual voting rights.
Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, was asked on CNN last weekend about the For the People Act, a bill he has co-sponsored and is working on as a member of the Senate Rules Committee. King said that he doesn't support the bill as written and thinks there are things that can be negotiated and modified.
"But the guts of it, Jake, is voting rights. It has a lot of other pieces. For example it has public financing of elections. It has a lot of other pieces in it. But the important part for me is protecting voting rights," King told CNN's Jake Tapper in a remote interview from Millinocket. "And that's becoming more urgent by the day, based upon what's going on around in the states."
There is also an urgent need for Congressional Democrats to adapt to political realities. Manchin outlined his opposition to the For the People Act last weekend, along with his continued commitment to preserving the Senate filibuster. That effectively dooms the bill as written in the Senate, even if other Democrats wanted to try to get rid of the 60-vote threshold. The House of Representatives passed the bill in March, with both Rep. Chellie Pingree and Rep. Jared Golden supporting it.
But Manchin also continues to float the idea of reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in a bipartisan way. He and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska urged congressional leadership to take this path in a May letter.
"Inaction is not an option. Congress must come together - just as we have done time and again - to reaffirm our longstanding bipartisan commitment to free, accessible, and secure elections for all," Manchin and Murkowski wrote. "We urge you to join us in calling for the bipartisan reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act through regular order. We can do this. We must do this."
Now, such a bipartisan path requires actual bipartisan engagement. So far, Murkowski is the only Senate Republican who has supported a bipartisan VRA reauthorization. That brings us to our message for Republicans: they should join Murkowski in this push.
When the Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts invited Congress to readdress that part of the legislation. It's past time to take him up on that invitation. This isn't the only thing lawmakers can do to protect voting rights across America, but it is the least they can do.
We asked both Maine Senators' offices if they would support the idea of a bipartisan Voting Rights Act reauthorization.
"Senator Collins is open to bipartisan discussions to ensure our elections are free and fair," Collins spokesperson Annie Clark said in a statement. "There are reforms she supports - such as efforts to disclose dark money and foreign influence contacts with political campaigns. She believes we should work on issues like those where we can find areas of agreement. Senator Collins does not support using taxpayer dollars to finance political campaigns, as [the For the People Act] proposes."
"Senator King believes that voting rights are the bedrock foundation of the American experiment in self-government - and he would hope that all of his colleagues, from both parties, would agree," King spokesperson Matthew Felling said in a statement. "He is prepared to work with any and all members of the Senate to advance legislation that strengthens our representative democracy for Americans across the nation."
Like any other state, Maine only has two voices in the U.S. Senate. But given their positions as more moderate, consensus-driven members within their caucuses, they each can play an important role in advancing the voting rights debate. One Republican plus one independent does not equal 60, but both Collins and King should work to steer the Senate toward a bipartisan voting rights approach that protects the rights of all eligible voters and can clear a filibus

The debate over voting rights could very well go nowhere in Congress, bogged down in part by party messaging, sweeping generalizations and inflexibility. Both of Maine's senators are well positioned to help cut through that noise and get something done.
The actions and words from several state legislatures around the country underscore the need for Congress to shore up federal protections to safeguard the fundamental right to vote for all legal voters. As an extension of former President Donald Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election, Republican state lawmakers across the country have pursued and passed new laws in the name of election security. But some of their own comments, like indicating that some votes are worth more than others, speak more to voter suppression rather than security.
The imperative for congressional action is clear. The political path forward is much murkier.
Democrats, minus a notable holdout in Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are pushing the sweeping For the People Act as a solution. Some argue that American democracy hinges on the more than 800-page bill's passage. This is hyperbole, even with the obvious need for action.
We want to see action on voting rights. We also recognize that the For the People Act is more than a voting rights bill. It contains a host of other provisions like campaign finance and ethics reforms that, while sounding good in many cases, make it easy for Republicans to dismiss the entire package as a liberal wish list and power grab. So our message to Democrats is this, even if it should go without saying: In the push for stronger voting rights protections, focus on actual voting rights.
Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, was asked on CNN last weekend about the For the People Act, a bill he has co-sponsored and is working on as a member of the Senate Rules Committee. King said that he doesn't support the bill as written and thinks there are things that can be negotiated and modified.
"But the guts of it, Jake, is voting rights. It has a lot of other pieces. For example it has public financing of elections. It has a lot of other pieces in it. But the important part for me is protecting voting rights," King told CNN's Jake Tapper in a remote interview from Millinocket. "And that's becoming more urgent by the day, based upon what's going on around in the states."
There is also an urgent need for Congressional Democrats to adapt to political realities. Manchin outlined his opposition to the For the People Act last weekend, along with his continued commitment to preserving the Senate filibuster. That effectively dooms the bill as written in the Senate, even if other Democrats wanted to try to get rid of the 60-vote threshold. The House of Representatives passed the bill in March, with both Rep. Chellie Pingree and Rep. Jared Golden supporting it.
But Manchin also continues to float the idea of reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in a bipartisan way. He and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska urged congressional leadership to take this path in a May letter.
"Inaction is not an option. Congress must come together – just as we have done time and again – to reaffirm our longstanding bipartisan commitment to free, accessible, and secure elections for all," Manchin and Murkowski wrote. "We urge you to join us in calling for the bipartisan reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act through regular order. We can do this. We must do this."
Now, such a bipartisan path requires actual bipartisan engagement. So far, Murkowski is the only Senate Republican who has supported a bipartisan VRA reauthorization. That brings us to our message for Republicans: they should join Murkowski in this push.

WISCASSET, Maine — On the first weekend of June, the scene at Red’s Eats seemed much like summers past. The line of tourists waiting to order at this picturesque seafood shack ran down the block. The sun beat down and employees passed out umbrellas and water, the sort of nicety you provide when your restaurant makes “best of” lists and causes traffic jams in attracting people from across the country.
Red’s menu offered its usual fare of sea scallops, whole belly deep-fried clams and its most famous dish, a fresh lobster roll, “piled high.”
The only change was the price: This year, the lobster roll is $30.
“Are you kidding me?” said Bindu Gajria, who was vacationing from Philadelphia and hadn’t checked the menu before getting in line. “I was going to order one, but now I’m having second thoughts.”
And $30 was a relative bargain. Two weeks earlier, as reported in the Bangor Daily News, Red’s was selling the sandwich for $34 — a mere $136 to feed a family of four.
Up and down the coast of the northeastern United States, the price of lobster — and thus, lobster rolls — is at historic highs, say restaurateurs who serve them.
“The most it’s ever been,” said Steve Kingston, owner of the Clam Shack in Kennebunkport, Maine, who this summer is charging $24.95 for his lobster roll.
Last year, the lobster roll was $18.95, but the price of lobster meat “was so high that we had no choice but to go significantly higher,” he said.
At the Lobster Landing in Clinton, Connecticut, an eatery that’s earned praise in Yankee magazine for its roll, the cost is up 75 cents from last year, to $19.75.
“For us, a family of four is 80 bucks and then sales tax, which is nothing to do with me,” said Enea Bacci, an owner. “Everywhere around us it’s $21, $22, $24. For me, I didn’t want to go $22 and shock the people.”
As with used cars and houses, the price spike in lobster meat is, in part, a matter of supply and demand exacerbated by the pandemic. Home cooks, stuck inside during the lockdown, turned to all manner of seafood to expand their palates and learn new kitchen skills over the past year.
“The processing sector is demanding a lot of meat,” said Dick Douty, an owner of Douty Bros., a lobster wholesaler and processor in Portland, Maine. “There’s more players, and there’s not more lobsters.”
Is lobster roll inflation, dare we say, transitory? It’s true the catch tends to be lower in May and June and increases through July and August, as the lobsters migrate to shore with the rising water temperatures.
But the lobster industry is also “inefficient by design,” said Annie Tselikis, the executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers’ Association.
There are roughly 4,500 licensed lobstermen in the state of Maine, and every fishing vessel is an independent operator. “The fishery and the supply chain are completely disconnected,” Tselikis said. “I cannot tell those boats to go fishing,” if a captain decides to take the day off.
And when it comes to processing, she added, “We don’t have a lot of automation in this industry because we’re dealing with an animal that has two large claws, eight legs, a tail and an exoskeleton. In order for that lobster to get out of the ocean and to a consumer is an incredible process. This isn’t a hot dog. It isn’t a hamburger.”
All of which has resulted in an epic mismatch between supply and demand so far this year. So epic, in fact, that Red’s opened in April with no lobster on its menu. That’s like Peter Luger opening with no steak.
But the lobstermen and women from whom Red’s buys were not having good harvests, even offshore. So it was either go without until live lobster was available or serve frozen meat — an option that Debbie Gagnon, an owner of Red’s, likened to “a stake in the heart.”
Wearing a red Red’s T-shirt and ball cap, Gagnon spoke to a reporter through the order window, where she was simultaneously scribbling on a pad and making announcements over a loudspeaker (“Welcome to Red’s. Get ready for the best lunch in Maine! … Last weekend we had Academy Award-winning actress Susan Sarandon waiting in line …”).
“Frozen lobster is like wet cardboard,” she said. “And it’s not who we are. I would never, ever serve frozen lobster.”
Just down the hill from Red’s, another lobster shack, Sprague’s Lobster, was selling its roll for $25.95, and you didn’t have to stand in line. Further up the coast, at McCloon’s Lobster Shack on Sprucehead Island, the roll was $19.95. Then there was Bacci down in Connecticut with his 20-cents-off roll.
Was there a gouging of tourists by some eateries? Or are varying prices an indication of individual restaurants’ approach to the roll?
The owners of McCloon’s, which include Douty, also own a wharf, where they furnish the lobstermen with bait and fuel and buy lobsters directly, making supply less of an issue. They stuff their $20 lobster roll with four ounces of meat.
Red’s serves a buttery, heaping roll that contains so much meat — about eight ounces — the bun is invisible. Decreasing the portion size would be another stake in the heart.
Gagnon hopes to lower the price as the supply increases. But many restaurants set the lobster roll price at the beginning of the season and maintain it. Kingston, who tends to operate this way, said determining the price for his 5 1/2-ounce roll was “painful” this year.
“I worry about this stuff,” he said. “We’re on people’s bucket lists. They will tell me, ‘We got off the exit to come here. We understand you serve the Bushes.’ But there comes a point.”
How much is too much for a summer food tradition?
“I didn’t think we were there at $24.95, but I’ve been worried,” Kingston said. “I’m pretty sure we’re not selling as many as 2019.”
Places like the Clam Shack, which has won the Lobster Roll Rumble several times, and Red’s, may have pricing power, at least during the tourist season — especially after last year’s lost summer, as Americans are traveling and embracing life outside their homes again.
Steve Pulliam and his wife, Allison, who were among those waiting in the scorching sun at Red’s, had traveled from Fayetteville, Arkansas, to be there. Visiting Maine was “on the bucket list,” Allison Pulliam said.
Did the $30 price tag (plus tax) for a lobster roll give them pause?
“No, because this is probably the only time this summer I’ll have a lobster roll,” Steve Pulliam said. It was also his first time.
After standing for 40 minutes in the slow-moving line, the couple approached the window. They ordered two lobster rolls, scallops, french fries and two sodas. Total cost: “Ninety dollars even, dear,” Gagnon said.
Steve Pulliam had already justified it: “I’m glad I didn’t bring the kids.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Something Weird on the Beach Was Staining Their Feet. But What?

Jenny Greenleaf was pleased that it was finally warm enough to go barefoot when she and her husband took their regular walk along York beach in Southern Maine this week.
But when they returned to their beach chairs and began to brush the sand off their feet, they noticed that their normally pale soles were a deep black.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Greenleaf, a book designer and artist, said. “It was almost like I walked through charcoal.”
At home they showered and scrubbed their feet, but the smudge, which was neither slick nor greasy, would only partly come off.
Along Maine’s southern coast, as well as in neighboring New Hampshire, many others were also struggling to remove dark stains from their feet.
“I still can’t get it off,” said Kyra O’Donnell, who has had black feet since she visited Great Island Common beach in New Hampshire, about 14 miles south of York beach, Sunday.
Robin Cogger, parks and recreation director in the town of York, said she had fielded about 100 calls and emails about stained feet this week. Similar reports on social media came from as far south as Gloucester, Massachusetts, and as far north as Wells, Maine, a span of more than 70 miles.
Theories abounded. Algae and oil were common ones.
“In Hawaii, the sand can turn black from volcanic gas, but no volcanoes in Maine so it’s probably something gross,” one man wrote in a local Facebook group.
Greenleaf had a fringe theory, which even her own husband scoffed at, that involved a submarine she had seen in the area.
“Maybe that submarine belched out a cloud of nastiness,” she said.
On Wednesday, Jim Britt, a spokesman for Maine’s Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, offered the likely answer: Millions of tiny black kelp flies that feed on decaying seaweed appeared to have died on one stretch of beach.
“It’s not known why,” he said. “Nature does crazy stuff. This might be one of those instances.”
The insect carcasses, which seemed to have washed ashore, contain a naturally occurring pigment, he said.
Efforts were underway to identify the particular kind of kelp fly, which should also help answer where they came from. Regardless, stepping on them does not pose any health issues, Britt said.
He could not answer whether it would be bad for dogs to eat them, a question that some were asking on social media.
Linda Stathoplos, a retired National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer, did her own informal examination of the sand on Wells Beach in Southern Maine on Tuesday, collecting a sample and looking at it under a microscope.
“There were tons and tons of little bugs, about the size of a tip of a pin,” she said. Some had two wings. Others had four. “They were definitely all dead.”
She could not remember ever hearing about a similar mass “mortality event” of flies.
Neither could Joseph Kelley, a marine geologist at the University of Maine.
“I have worked on the geology of beaches for 40 years on the Maine coast and never seen anything like this (or heard about it elsewhere),” he said in an email.
On Facebook, beach vacationers with tainted feet listed all the ways they had tried to get the stain off. Neither dish soap nor baby wipes were particularly successful.
Greenleaf inadvertently discovered a foot-cleaning solution during a subsequent walk. She and her husband had returned to the beach after a rain to look for clues. Although the search was fruitless, by the end of their walk the sand and stones had buffed the stains away.
“Our feet were spotless,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: The 19th-century painter Edmund Walpole Brooke occupies a tiny, but durable place in art history. Not because of his own work, but because he offers a tantalizing look into the tragic last days of Vincent Van Gogh.
That the two shared something close to friendship during the weeks before Van Gogh committed suicide in July 1890 was a noteworthy feat given Van Gogh’s embrace of isolation during his stay in Auvers-sur-Oise, a village on the northwestern outskirts of Paris.
But Brooke had grown up in Japan, a place that fascinated and inspired the Dutch painter. And so off they would go into the plein-air on painting excursions, their relationship chronicled in a few letters that have made Brooke an intriguing figure to a Van Gogh scholar who is still struggling to understand what led him to put a bullet in his chest.
“He is a very enigmatic person,” Tsukasa Kodera, a curator and professor of art history at Osaka University in Japan, said of Brooke, who has become a focus of his research. “He might have received letters from Van Gogh, he might have received drawings or paintings as a gift — they might have exchanged works.”
Kodera has spent the better part of a decade, with limited success, hunting for information about Brooke. He has visited his grave site in Japan and found records to establish that Brooke’s work was included in exhibitions during his lifetime at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and at the 1891 Paris Salon, and was the subject of at least two solo shows in Japan.
But finding a painting by Brooke has stymied Kodera, at least until now, perhaps. In April, Katherine Mathews, a thrift store enthusiast, happened upon a watercolor with the signature E.W. Brooke while rummaging through Warehouse 839, a shop in Saco, Maine, that specializes in everything from estate furniture to odds and ends.
She paid $45 for the image, which depicts a Japanese woman and a child. On her way home, curious to know just what she had bought, she stopped in a grocery store parking lot to look up this Brooke person on her iPad. She soon saw the Van Gogh connection and later, with the help of her husband, John, made contact with Kodera.
The professor thinks they have probably discovered a rare thing, an original Brooke.
“Are there any other painters who painted this subject matter, with the name E.W. Brooke, and with a Japanese lady and a baby?” Kodera said in a telephone conversation. “We cannot imagine any other painters.”
The painting in question is small, 13 by 19 inches, and the woman is toting the child on her back. They are depicted in front of a rural home surrounded by lush foliage.
Kevin Keraghan, who owns the Maine shop, said he acquired the painting about 15 years ago from the estate sale of a family in New Hampshire. That family had originally come from California, which Kodera thought a good sign since two of Brooke’s brothers lived there.
For more than a decade, the watercolor hung in Keraghan’s home until he decided to put it up for sale. “My tastes changed,” Keraghan said.
Mathews said she was immediately drawn to the painting. It was the last item she selected that day. “The little face of the little girl peeking over the mother’s shoulder jumped right out at me,” she said.
Among the few glimpses available of Van Gogh’s last days are the moments captured in letters he swapped with his brother Theo, his mother, Anna, his sister Willemien, and a couple of others. Brooke is one of the few people mentioned in their correspondence from a time when Van Gogh, working at a typically feverish pace, created “Wheatfield With Crows,” “The Church at Auvers” and other paintings.
In the letters, Van Gogh’s perspective on Brooke, who was then 24, appears to be that he is fine as a companion but is a middling artist, so far.
“He’ll probably show you some of his studies, which are rather lifeless, but however he does observe nature,” he wrote to Theo on July 2. “He has been here in Auvers for months, and we went out together sometimes, he was brought up in Japan, you would never think so from his painting — but that may come.”
Though he was no fan of Brooke’s artwork, and was famously irascible and mercurial, Van Gogh enjoyed learning about Japan. He had been exposed to Japanese art in for the first time in Belgium in 1885 and became passionate about it. He collected, copied and festooned the walls of his studios with Japanese prints. Sometimes they even showed up in the background of his paintings. And he incorporated what he learned from Japanese artists, like Utagawa Hiroshige, into his own technique in subtle and inventive ways.
At one point, Van Gogh’s obsession grew so deep that he began to see echoes of Japan in the landscape and lifestyle of Provence. “My dear brother, you know, I feel I’m in Japan,” Van Gogh wrote to Theo in 1888, soon after arriving in Arles.
Brooke, born in Australia, was only a child when he moved to Japan, where his father, John Henry, worked as a reporter for and then director of the Japan Daily Herald, an English-language newspaper based in Yokohama. The father ultimately “came to occupy an important position in Yokohama’s expatriate society,” Kodera said in the catalog for an exhibition, “Van Gogh & Japan.”
But piecing together the rest of Brooke’s biography proved to be a major challenge. After two years of research, Kodera managed to find the artist’s grave at the Kobe Municipal Foreign Cemetery, surprisingly only 30 minutes away from the professor’s own home in Takarazuka.
“He had moved to Kobe having nothing at the age of 58,” Kodera said. “That is a very sad story.”
Similarly difficult has been finding any trace of Brooke’s work. A few years ago, the professor found a record indicating that the Redfern Gallery in Laguna Beach, California, had sold a painting by an artist named E.W. Brooke, but the gallery owner said he could not recall who had purchased it. A work by E.W. Brooke also showed up in the records for a 2014 estate sale in Los Angeles, but again the actual work proved elusive.
Kodera was as surprised as anyone when he received an email from Maine saying a painting by Brooke may have been located in a place where the artist has no known connection. Though the piece is still not fully authenticated — a particularly tricky task because there is little else by Brooke to compare it to — the early signs are very promising, according to Kodera.
A watermark on the painting’s paper has been found, identifying it as the product of J. Whatman, a firm based in England that made high-quality paper used by Van Gogh and many other artists.
The content of the painting, too, suggests it was made by Brooke, Kodera said. During his research, he found a grave in Yokohama, where Brooke lived after he returned to Japan, marked “Ume Brooke,” who the professor thinks may be the painter’s daughter.
The girl in the picture found in Maine, he said, could very well be Brooke’s child, who died at the age of 6, and her mother.
One target of the search for Brooke is the possibility that somewhere, in the environs of Brooke’s life, there would be more evidence of Van Gogh, maybe even an undiscovered work hidden away that was once a gift from the artist. But hopes for that kind of revelation, for finding even an additional example of Brooke’s work, were dented when Kodera found that Brooke’s home in Yokohama had been destroyed by the catastrophic 1923 earthquake and the terrible fires it spawned.
Now some optimism has resurfaced. If a Brooke can appear in an unlikely precinct of Maine, maybe there are others that have not been lost to time or disaster.
“This CAN be a breakthrough,” Kodera said in an email, using caps for emphasis, “to shed new light on the painter, and on Van Gogh’s last months.”

Idaho governor rescinds ban on mask mandates issued while he was out of state

Texto completo: Idaho Gov. Brad Little on Friday repealed an executive order banning mask mandates by state entities that Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin had issued a day before while he was out of state, marking another scorching volley in the coronavirus response-fueled feud between the two Republicans.
"The action that took place while I was traveling this week is not gubernatorial," Little said in a statement. "The action that took place was an irresponsible, self-serving political stunt. Taking the earliest opportunity to act solitarily on a highly politicized, polarizing issue without conferring with local jurisdictions, legislators, and the sitting Governor is, simply put, an abuse of power."
Little continued, "This kind of over-the-top executive action amounts to tyranny -- something we all oppose. How ironic that the action comes from a person who has groused about tyranny, executive overreach, and balance of power for months."
McGeachin announced her gubernatorial run last week and has repeatedly and publicly clashed with Little over the state's response to the pandemic. She had signed the order on Thursday barring state officials and entities, including schools, from requiring mask wearing.
McGeachin issued the order while Little was at the Republican Governors Association convention in Nashville this week and "did not make Gov. Little aware of her executive order ahead of time," Marissa Morrison Hyer, Little's press secretary, told CNN on Thursday.
McGeachin shot back on Friday in a scathing statement disparaging Little in comparison with other Republican governors and accusing him of being tyrannical and power-hungry.
"Today, Gov. Little chose to revoke your personal freedom by rescinding my order and imposing mask mandates on thousands of Idaho children, rejecting the conservative solutions embraced by leaders like Gov. Abbott in Texas and Gov. DeSantis in Florida," she said, adding that "I understand that protecting individual liberty means fighting against tyranny at ALL levels of government — federal, state, and local."
"As your Lt. Governor, I remain undeterred and unwavering in my commitment to defend your rights and freedoms against all who would violate them," she continued. "Now, more than ever, we must stand together against those who prioritize their own power above individual liberty."
Little's statement defended his stance on Friday, adding that while he was opposed to statewide mask mandates as inappropriate, "I also didn't undermine separately elected officials who, under Idaho law, are given authorities to take measures they believe will protect the health and safety of the people they serve."
"The executive order unilaterally and unlawfully takes away authorities given to the state's mayors, local school board trustees, and others," he said. "Just like the states begrudge federal government mandates, local governments in Idaho resent the state doing the same thing."
Even prior to announcing her campaign, McGeachin effectively established herself as the champion of the Trump wing of the party while painting Little as part of the establishment.
Little issued a stay-at-home order for the state on March 25, 2020, and let it lapse on April 30, 2020. On that date, he unveiled a four-stage process to reopen the state, beginning with a first phase that allowed 90% of Idaho's businesses to reopen.
McGeachin wrote in an op-ed in the Idaho Statesman last May, "I lose sleep at night because the heavy hand of our government is hurting so many Idahoans."
In October, Little imposed a return to Phase 3 that limited gatherings to 50 people and required people who visit nursing homes to wear masks. In turn, McGeachin and 10 Republican state legislators or legislators-elect appeared in a video in which they seemed to question the existence of the pandemic while declaring they would follow no state or local emergency orders relating to the coronavirus.
CNN's Chris Cillizza and Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin issued an executive order on Thursday banning mask mandates while Gov. Brad Little was unaware and out of town.
"The lieutenant governor did not make Gov. Little aware of her executive order ahead of time," Marissa Morrison Hyer, Little's press secretary, told CNN.
Morrison Hyer said Little is out of state this week "collaborating with Republican governors at the (Republican Governors Association) convention in Nashville." When asked whether Little supported the order and would let it stand, she pointed to a statement from the office noting that "the Governor's Office is reviewing the Lt. Governor's executive order. Governor Little has never put in place a statewide mask mandate."
The Idaho Statesman previously reported that McGeachin had signed the order unbeknownst to Little, both of whom are Republicans.
McGeachin tweeted Thursday that she had barred state entities and officials from requiring mask wearing.
"Today, as acting Governor of the State of Idaho, I signed an Executive Order to protect the rights and liberties of individuals and businesses by prohibiting the state and its political subdivisions — including public schools — from imposing mask mandates in our state," she wrote.
McGeachin, who announced her gubernatorial run last week, has repeatedly and publicly clashed with Little over the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic, effectively establishing herself as the champion of the Trump wing of the party while painting Little as part of the timid establishment.
Little issued a stay-at-home order for the state on March 25, 2020, and let it lapse on April 30, 2020. On that date, he unveiled a four-stage process to reopen the state, beginning with a first phase that allowed 90% of Idaho's businesses to reopen.
McGeachin wrote in an op-ed in the Idaho Statesman last May, "I lose sleep at night because the heavy hand of our government is hurting so many Idahoans."
In October, Little imposed a return to Phase 3 that limited gatherings to 50 people and required people who visit nursing homes to wear masks. In turn, McGeachin and 10 Republican state legislators or legislators-elect appeared in a video in which they seemed to question the existence of the pandemic while declaring they would follow no state or local emergency orders relating to the coronavirus.
"The fact that a pandemic may or may not be occurring changes nothing about the meaning or intent of the state constitution and the preservation of our inalienable rights," state Rep. Karey Hanks said in the video, reading lines from a statement they had all signed.
Little has faced similar pushback from other members of his party. The state's Senate Committee on State Affairs voted out a resolution in January to end Idaho's emergency declaration, which the governor sharply criticized.
"I believe in my heart that what the Idaho Legislature is doing is harmful to our people and wrong for Idaho," Little said in a video, adding, "I urge my partners in the Legislature to stop the political games and do what is right for the people of Idaho."
At the time, Idaho had seen 158,200 cases and 1,654 deaths from the virus, about 8,853 cases per 100,000 people -- the 15th highest rate in the country, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

Texto completo: Dear Reader,
The New York Times pieced together archival maps and photographs to construct a 3-D model of Greenwood — home of “Black Wall Street” — as it was before the violence and destruction of the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 a century ago. We created a resource that invites students to explore the neighborhood in Oklahoma, meet some of the people who lived and worked there, and learn about the devastating race riot. We also provide three additional teaching ideas for students to explore the Times archive, consider what justice should look like now and discuss the importance of history and memory.
This week we also created lesson plans and writing prompts related to Brood X cicadas; the importance of scale and relative size; teen political activism; the year since George Floyd was killed; school dress codes; and much more.
June begins next week, and that coincides with the end of our 2020-21 regular publishing schedule at The Learning Network. Throughout the summer we’ll be publishing special resources, like our Summer News Quiz and our year-end writing prompt collections. And Week 1 of our Summer Reading Contest begins on June 11. But we’re ready for a little room to breathe and reflect after a long and difficult school year. We imagine you are, too.
Sincerely,
Michael Gonchar, Editor

Texto completo: Nearly 100 million people across the Northeast and Plains were at risk for severe weather Wednesday as two separate storm systems threatened those regions with tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds.
More severe weather remains in the forecast through the rest of this week.
"The upcoming days will see widespread severe storms racing from the western high Plains to the East Coast, pushed along by a strong cold front. It's safe to say that more than a dozen states will encounter this severe weather event," said Chad Myers, a CNN meteorologist.
The most significant threat will be across Nebraska and Kansas where strong tornadoes, hurricane-force winds and tennis ball-sized hail are possible. A developing storm system east of the Rocky Mountains will trigger the rapid formation of strong thunderstorms late Wednesday afternoon.
A different storm system moving across southeastern Canada will be responsible for the risk for strong storms in the Northeast. These storms will form ahead of a cold front, which is essentially the dividing line between the hot and cool air. Therefore, after the storms pass, temperatures will fall.
A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and West Virginia until 8 p.m. ET. Quarter-sized hail and wind gusts up to 70 mph were possible with the storms in this watch area.
A second severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of the Interstate 95 corridor, including portions of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia, until 10 p.m. ET. This watch includes New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC.
A watch was in effect until 11 p.m. ET from northeastern Connecticut through southern Maine, which includes Boston, Hartford and Portland.
Strong storms usher in cooling for Northeast
A level 2 of 5, "slight" risk of severe storms was in place for much of the Northeast. Around this risk area, spotty strong storms are possible in the Ohio River Valley and closer to the coast. This includes Boston, Cleveland, Virginia Beach and Portland.
Today's severe storms pose the risk for damaging, straight-line winds, but some could produce large hail, especially in the Mid-Atlantic. A few tornadoes are possible, mainly for northern New England.
"The greatest threat for a tornado will be with any isolated individual cells that initiate midday prior to any (lines of storms forming)," said the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.
A cold front will push showers and thunderstorms eastward over the interior Northeast, reaching the coast by Wednesday night. As of midday, warnings of strong to severe thunderstorms had been issued for parts of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
The best chance for storms in the I-95 corridor will be in the evening and during the first half of the night.
High temperatures today will be in the upper 80s to low 90s -- up to 20 degrees above average. Once the storms and cold front move through, a dramatic drop in temperatures will begin through Friday.
By the end of this week, highs will only be in the 50s and 60s north of the Mason-Dixon Line. That's up to 20 degrees below average. Some locations could witness nearly a 40-degree drop in temperatures over the next 48 hours. These cool temperatures will continue into the start of the Memorial Day weekend.
Severe weather outbreak and strong tornadoes threaten Plains
An outbreak of severe weather is expected in the Plains on Wednesday night. Unlike in the Northeast where the threat will be mainly during the day, the Plains is expected to endure dangerous weather overnight.
A level 4 out of 5, "moderate" risk for severe storms is in place for parts of Nebraska and Kansas. This is only the second moderate risk issued by the Storm Prediction Center so far this month.
Severe storms are also a risk surrounding this area, covering much of the central Plains.
"Severe thunderstorms will spread across the Central Plains during the late afternoon and evening with a threat for large and destructive hail, very damaging winds, and tornadoes," according to the SPC.
The greatest risk for tornadoes will be in northwestern Kansas, and some could be strong (EF-2 or greater).
Most of the day will be dry, besides a couple spotty storms, but that will quickly change beginning in late afternoon. Clear skies over the region will allow for temperatures to rise to near 90 degrees as moderate humidity levels feed up from the Gulf of Mexico.
Heat and humidity are often two ingredients required for severe thunderstorms. Strong, varying winds in the atmosphere will also make the environment prime for tornadoes.
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to form late in the day over the central high Plains. These storms have the greatest chance at producing tornadoes through this evening before they congeal into clusters overnight. When this happens, the threat will shift to potential damaging winds and large hail.
The SPC notes the potential for very damaging winds -- depending on how these clusters evolve Wednesday night over southern Nebraska and northern Kansas.
Isolated to scattered severe storms will also be possible during the day over northern portions of the Rocky Mountains and as far south as West Texas.
Flash flooding will be possible Wednesday night for the central Plains, which could see several hours of heavy rain from the thunderstorms. Some locations will likely receive over 3 inches of rain during this time.
Severe weather continues Thursday
The storm system triggering severe storms Wednesday night in the central Plains will track south and east, shifting the risk for severe weather to the southern Plains and lower Midwest on Thursday.
"Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely on Thursday and into Thursday night from parts of the southern Great Plains into the Ozarks and middle Mississippi Valley. Very large hail, significant severe gusts, and several tornadoes are possible," said the SPC.
See when storms could impact your area >>
The SPC currently has a level 3 of 5 risk for severe storms in place from the Texas Panhandle through southwestern Illinois. Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Dallas, Wichita, Jefferson City and St. Louis are all at risk for strong storms by Thursday night.
The threat for severe weather likely decreases by Friday, but isolated, intense storms will still be possible from New Mexico through Virginia.

Texto completo: May 24 - AUGUSTA, Maine - Mainers who are fully vaccinated no longer have to wear face coverings indoors beginning Monday after Gov. Janet Mills updated the state's mask policy following new recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Just over half of Maine adults qualify as fully vaccinated - meaning it has been at least two weeks since their second dose - according to state data, with more becoming eligible to throw away their masks in the following weeks as they get their final shots. But children younger than 12 are not yet eligible to receive any of the COVID-19 vaccines.
The new policy has left many parents with questions about how to navigate the rules while they wait for their kids to become eligible for vaccinations. Here are the answers to some of your common questions.
Do my kids still have to wear a mask to the supermarket if I am vaccinated?
Yes. The governor's executive order requires everyone, regardless of age, to continue to wear masks indoors if they are not fully vaccinated. Masks are not required for children under the age of 2 and are only recommended for children between the ages of 2 and 4, according to an earlier executive order. But children aged 5 and older are required to keep wearing masks indoors even if their parents are fully vaccinated.
Is it safe to spend time with other families if our kids are not vaccinated?
Any activity has some risk associated with it, so these decisions come down to personal risk tolerance. For parents looking to minimize risk while helping their kids socialize this summer, the best thing you can do is stay outside.
Outdoor activities have the lowest likelihood of COVID-19 transmission because virus particles are easily dispersed in the fresh air, making it less likely that a person will be exposed to a large enough viral load to cause illness. So think backyard grilling rather than a movie night, or tee ball rather than bowling.
In a New York Times survey of epidemiologists, only 36 percent said it was safe to attend an indoor, maskless gathering with multiple families. But more than 80 percent said it was safe or somewhat safe for families with children to gather for outdoor activities, even without masks.
How can I keep my kids safe in indoor settings if I don't know which adults are vaccinated?
Although the U.S. CDC guidance and Maine's corresponding policy say unvaccinated adults should continue to wear masks, state health officials said they will not require businesses to ask whether people are vaccinated or enforce masking.
Some businesses have indicated they will keep their mask mandates in place for everyone in the short term, so shopping at those stores should not be any riskier for children than it has been for the past year. But at businesses that no longer require face coverings for vaccinated people, it could be hard for parents to know that they will be able to keep their children distanced from unvaccinated adults in indoor settings.
As with social gatherings, this question comes down in part to parents' risk tolerance. In the New York Times survey, just over half of epidemiologists said it was safe for children to continue to go to supermarkets and other indoor settings provided that they continue to wear masks.
What about schools?
Students, teachers and staff are still required to wear face coverings indoors in schools regardless of vaccination status. State health officials attributed the decision to the large population of unvaccinated children at schools. Masks are not required for students outside.
Masks are also required for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in health care facilities, nursing homes and on public transit, in accordance with U.S. CDC guidance.
Health officials are optimistic that rising vaccination numbers can slow the spread of the virus, including among children who are unable to be vaccinated.
"When the virus tries to jump from person to person, if it runs into somebody who's been vaccinated, it may try to get a foothold, but it's not going to get very far," Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Nirav Shah said last week. "And so by having so many folks who are fully immunized, or vaccinated or have natural immunity in our state, the risk to younger kids goes down that much further."
Gibson Parrish, an epidemiologist based in southern Maine who used to work for the U.S. CDC, said the vaccination threshold needed for herd immunity was not yet known, with estimates ranging from 60 percent to more than 80 percent. He cautioned that stopping the virus entirely would require uniformly high vaccination rates across Maine, something the state has struggled with. Otherwise, children in areas where fewer people are vaccinated would still be at risk.
"In those places, you can still have circulating virus and people getting sick from that," he said.
Could the state bring back universal masking or other restrictions if cases rise?
Shah said last week that Maine's future public health recommendations would be driven primarily by case rates. That leaves open the possibility that Maine could bring back restrictions if cases rise, although the state has generally shown a reluctance to reinstate restrictions in the past. For now, infection rates in Maine have been declining steadily for about four weeks.
"I can't speculate about what we might do in the future, but for right now we're encouraged by the progress we've seen," Shah said.
When will kids younger than 12 be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine?
Perhaps by year's end. Clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in younger children are ongoing. Pfizer, the only company whose vaccine has been approved for children between the ages of 12 and 17 so far, told shareholders earlier this month that it hoped to apply for emergency use authorization for its vaccine for use in children between the ages of 2 and 11 in September, and for children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years later in the ye

Welcome toThe Daily 202 newsletter! Tell your friends to sign up here. Big day for aeronautics: In 1927, Charles Lindbergh completes the first solo, nonstop flight across the Atlantic. In 1932, Amelia Earhart duplicates his achievement.
President Biden now faces a choice between deeper peacemaking efforts in the Middle East or returning to what has largely been a hands-off approach, preferring to focus on the pandemic, the economy and China.
Bidencampaigned on returning to the "two-state solution" to ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, but surprised some observers this week when he publicly pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to embrace a cease-fire.
There weren't a lot of clues in the president's late-Thursday remarks welcoming a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that pressed "pause" on the worst foreign policy crisis of his young presidency but left the underlying disputes untouched.
And it could take weeks, months, or longer to know whethersending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region — a development the president did not mention in his three-minute address — is a harbinger of greater involvement.
"He actually sees this as a moment of opportunity and [I] expect he and other officials will up engagement with a range of leaders in the coming days," a senior administration official told The Daily 202 on the condition of anonymity.
Under heavy andmounting pressure from Democrats in Congress, Biden had made news with increasing appeals to Netanyahu to end his airstrikes and accept a cease-fire — even as the U.S. blocked U.N. action on the crisis.
And a White House summary of a call between the two leaders on Wednesday omitted the usual American formula emphasizing unwavering support for Israel's right to self-defense.
But by last night, the Biden whoonce declared "I am a Zionist" andpromised at Netanyahu's side in 2010 "there is no space between the United States and Israel when it comes to Israel's security" was back.
"The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks from Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist groups that have taken the lives of innocent civilians in Israel," he said.
As for military aid, Biden said nothing aboutthe effort in Congress to halt the latest tranche of arms sales, but declared his "full support to replenish" Israel's "Iron Dome" defense against rocket attacks "to ensure its defenses and security in the future."
The president also promised to work with the United Nations and others "to provide rapid humanitarian assistance and to marshal international support for the people of Gaza and the Gaza reconstruction efforts."
At the New York Times,Lara Jakes reports:
"A senior Biden administration official said the United States was planning to be at the fore of an international response, most likely costing billions of dollars, to include restoring health and education services, and other reconstruction. The senior official said that rebuilding Gaza — which will most likely be coordinated through the United Nations — was at the top of a list of festering diplomatic obstacles that the administration would face between Israel and the Palestinian Authority now that the fighting was to wind down."
It's hard to decipher Biden's aim at the moment.
Arms sales to Israel, aid to the Palestinians, his top diplomat to the region — these could be routine engagement, especially in the aftermath of more than 10 days of deadly fighting, or tentative steps before a fuller diplomatic commitment.
"I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy," Biden said last night.
"My administration will continue our quiet and relentless diplomacy toward that end," the president said."I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress, and I'm committed to working for it."
Biden, who promised as a candidate to return to peacemaking predicated on Palestinians getting their own state, did not mention the "two-state solution," a phrase he has used sparingly since taking office on Jan. 20.
(The formula wasn't inthe official White House summary of his first phone call with Netanyahu, on Feb. 17, nor in those of their talkson May 12, May 17, orMay 19. But it was in summaries of calls with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on May 15.)
In her daily briefing on May 17, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters "we all know that the only way to bring an end to violence, to bring an end to this escalation of violence is for there to be a two-state solution over time."
"But in terms of what that would take or what form and what it would look like, it is going to require both parties wanting to engage in that and wanting to have a discussion about the path forward," she said.
At his confirmation hearing, Blinken had affirmed the administration's support for the "two-state" approach. But,he added, "realistically, it is hard to see near-term prospects for moving forward on that."

Lunchtime reads from The Post
"Five rural counties in liberal Oregon vote in favor of leaving state for more conservative Idaho,"by Derek Hawkins: "Voters in Baker, Grant, Lake, Malheur and Sherman counties — sparsely populated areas in the state's eastern half — approved ballot measures Tuesday requiring local officials to consider redrawing the border to make them Idahoans. Behind the push is a nonprofit called Citizens for Greater Idaho that argues the predominantly Republican parts of Oregon would be better served if Idaho incorporated them."
"Since leaving office, Trump has charged the Secret Service more than $40,000 to use space at Mar-a-Lago,"by David Fahrenthold and Josh Dawsey: "The records show that Trump's club charged the Secret Service $396.15 every night starting Jan. 20, the day he left the White House and moved full-time into his Palm Beach, Fla., club. Those charges, ultimately paid by taxpayers, continued until at least April 30, the spending records show, for a total of $40,011.15. The charges were for a single room used as a workspace by Secret Service agents, according to one person familiar with the payments."
"Eight minutes with the president: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian American in Congress, gains relevance in Israel debate,"by Michael Kranish: "Tlaib, 44, had been an outlier in her party and Congress more broadly regarding Israel. … She has embraced a 'one-state solution' that would combine Israel and the occupied territories into one democratic country with the potential to create a majority-Palestinian population rather than a Jewish state. ... But in the 11 days of intensifying conflict between Israel and Hamas leading to Thursday's announcement of a cease-fire, growing numbers of Democrats have shown a greater willingness to challenge Israel — including publicly pressing Biden to take a more aggressive posture."
… and beyond
"GOP senators dig in against January 6 commission," by the Dispatch's Haley Byrd Wilt: "In interviews with more than 20 GOP senators on Thursday, Republicans raised fears about how the commission would work, how long it would last, and whether it would amount to a partisan circus. The answers to many of these questions are in the text of the relatively straightforward, 19-page bill passed by the House this week. When pressed on the gap between the details of the bill and their portrayal of it, some senators simply admitted they hadn't read the legislation."
"Food supply chains are stretched as Americans head back to restaurants,"by the Wall Street Journal's Jennifer Smith and Paul Page: "Suppliers and logistics providers say distributors are facing shortages of everyday products like chicken parts, as well as difficulty in finding workers and surging transportation costs as companies effectively try to reverse the big changes in food services that came as coronavirus lockdowns spread across the U.S. last year."
"New York City lost 900,000 jobs. Here's how many have come back,"by the New York Times's Patrick McGeehan: "One of the clearest signals of recovery came from restaurants, which added 15,000 jobs last month. The city's full-service restaurants had three times as many employees last month as they had in April 2020, their lowest point."
"Manufacturers say ammo shortage will stretch out for years,"by the Reload's Stephen Gutowski: "As store shelves lie barren and prices for the most popular ammunition hover at two, three, or even five times their pre-pandemic levels, manufacturers said they are still scrambling to bring enough product to market. They said they are still working through several years' worth of orders that have already been placed."
The Biden agendaThe Treasury Department plans to raise an additional $700 billion through new tax compliance measures.
The move could become a "key source of revenue for the Biden administration's multitrillion-dollar spending proposals," Jeff Stein reports.
"In a 22-page report, Treasury officials identified a number of policies to increase enforcement aimed at closing the 'tax gap' between what taxpayers owe to the federal government and what they actually pay. These include increased reporting requirements, new tools for auditors, massively increasing the Internal Revenue Service's budget, and new rules on cryptocurrency, among other measures."
"Some of the changes — such as billions of dollars in additional spending at the IRS — would require congressional approval, and many Republicans have long tried to shrink the agency. But the White House said the proposed investments would pay off by allowing the agency to collect the taxes that are due."
Biden, in his first print newspaper interview, shared the “most devastating” comment made to him since taking office.
Biden spoke to Times columnist David Brooks, and said Micheál Martin, the prime minister of Ireland, questioned "the United States' ability to lead the world after its failure in controlling the coronavirus pandemic," Colby Itkowitz reports. "The most devastating comment made after I was elected — it wasn't so much about me — but it was by the Irish taoiseach" — prime minister — "saying that 'well, America can't lead. They can't even get their arms around covid,' " Biden told Brooks.
Most of the interview focused on his administration's costly liberal policies."When you look at the legislation he's sponsored or supported over the decades, you notice that the dollar amounts are generally in the millions or low billions. Today, the Biden agenda is in the trillions. So what has changed, even since January 2017, when he and Barack Obama left office?" Brooks asks. Biden responds: "I think circumstances have changed drastically. We're at a genuine inflection point in history," Biden said.
"He says we're experiencing a 'Fourth Industrial Revolution,' which encompasses developments ranging from the rise of information technology to the rise of the Chinese superstate, to shifts in the global competitive environment," per Brooks. "We've gotten to a point where I think our economic competence has a gigantic impact on our international influence and capacity," Biden said. The real risk, the president said, is going too small. "If we stay small, I don't know how we change our international status and competitive capacity," Biden told Brooks.
Help Wanted: The federal government is on a hiring spree as Biden seeks to undo Trump cuts.
"The Federal Bureau of Prisons, its staff depleted by Trump-era hiring freezes, is advertising for thousands of jobs. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is bringing on dozens of lawyers after being gutted by four years of budget cuts. The Agriculture Department is moving to replace hundreds of scientists who fled or were forced out by the last administration," Lisa Rein reports.
"That's a fraction of the growth in the federal bureaucracy that the Biden administration would like to see, according to a $1.5 trillion preliminary budget the White House released in April,"Rein writes. "Some programs that are crucial to Biden's agenda are so short-staffed that his administration can't yet fully implement his policies, among them enforcement of fair-housing and workplace safety laws. A number of decisions by the Trump administration, including the relocation of key economic research and land management offices, are proving hard to reverse."
"The annual list of troubled federal programs, released in March by the Government Accountability Office, is longer than ever, a shift workforce experts attribute to vast areas of the government the Trump administration ignored."
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirmed that the U.S. does not want to buy Greenland.
"Sitting beside Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod, Greenland's premier, Mute Egede, and Foreign Minister Pele Broberg during a news conference, Blinken confirmed to a reporter it was 'correct' that the United States does not seek to buy the country," Reuters reports. "Blinken was visiting Greenland after attending a meeting of the Arctic Council in Iceland, which he said was a signal of Washington's desire to enhance ties with 'our Arctic partners, Greenland and Denmark.'"
Flashback:"Trump and one of his economic advisers confirmed in 2019 that Trump had discussed the possibility of purchasing Greenland."
The White House enlisted major dating apps in its vaccine push so users can identify as vaccinated.
"Apps like Tinder, Hinge, Match and OkCupid will allow users to add stickers or badges to their profiles to let potential matches know they've been vaccinated. In some cases, vaccinated users can limit their searches to other vaccinated singles. Some apps are adding incentives by giving vaccinated users free access to premium content," Itkowitz reports. "While dating apps are used by people of all ages, their prime audience are young adults, who also happen to be the cohort least likely to prioritize getting vaccinated."
Quote of the dayThe future of the GOP
"After more than four months of letting their power to obstruct lie unused in the Senate, the 50-member Senate GOP is ready to mount a filibuster of House-passed legislation creating an independent cross-aisle panel to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection. If Republicans follow through and block the bill, they will spark a long-building fight over the filibuster's very existence," Politico's Burgess Everett reports. "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is plotting to bring the House's Jan. 6 commission bill to the floor and daring Senate Republicans to block it. And GOP opposition is hardening by the day. According to interviews with more than a half-dozen Republicans on Thursday, there is almost no path to even opening up debate on the bill — much less passing it."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been circumspect about his use of the filibuster, leaving the tool untouched so far this Congress. ...Now that McConnell is pushing his conference toward a filibuster of a bipartisan bill, Democrats see an opportunity to begin making their case to reluctant members that the 60-vote status quo is unsustainable. As an incredulous Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put it: 'How do you go forward if you can't make it work over something like an independent commission?' "
"Some Republicans, such as Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, are still amenable to opening debate on the bill and amending it to ensure the investigation is completed this year and that the commission is staffed in a bipartisan way. But overall, Senate Republicans have rapidly shifted into wholesale opposition to the commission."
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is grappling with the legacy of Trump amid commission talk.
"The decision to publicly align the House GOP with Mr. Trump has created both opportunities and pitfalls for Mr. McCarthy and House Republicans. They hope to tap Mr. Trump's continued popularity among the GOP base without having to confront his continued false claims about the election," the WSJ's Kristina Peterson and Lindsay Wise report.
McCarthy's challenges were highlighted Thursday, when he said he wasn't surprised that 35 Republicans backed the Jan. 6 commission."Some Republicans were frustrated this week by Mr. McCarthy's undercutting of Rep. John Katko of New York, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, saying it left lawmakers sidelined from the legislative process." Katko is the Republican pushing for the commission. "Mr. McCarthy had tasked Mr. Katko with reaching a bipartisan agreement, and Republicans widely acknowledged that Mr. Katko secured many of the GOP's demands in structuring the commission, including equal power to appoint members. ... 'John did a great job negotiating and got a lot of concessions on this bill,' said Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R., N.Y.), who voted for the legislation. 'It actually makes it a fair commission.'"
Anthony Bouchard, a Wyoming state Senator looking to challenge Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) for her House seat, said he impregnated a 14-year-old when he was 18.
Bouchard confirmed this to the Casper Star Tribune last night, hours after disclosing the relationship in a Facebook Live video to supporters. "Bouchard, who did not specify the girl's age in the video, said he went public with the information to get ahead of the story after learning that people were investigating it in opposition to his candidacy. A Wyoming state senator since 2017, Bouchard has risen in prominence since announcing he would challenge Cheney following her vote to impeach Trump. 'So, bottom line, it's a story when I was young, two teenagers, girl gets pregnant,' he said in the Facebook Live video. 'You've heard those stories before. She was a little younger than me, so it's like the Romeo and Juliet story.'
"Bouchard told the Star-Tribune he married the girl when she was 15 and he was 19. At the time, they were both living in Florida. The two were legally able to get married at the time because Florida law stated that people could marry at any age with a judge's approval if a pregnancy was involved and a parent consented. They got divorced approximately three years later... Bouchard's ex-wife killed herself when she was 20, he said."
The Arizona secretary of state said Maricopa County should replace millions of dollars worth of voting equipment because of GOP-backed recount.
"Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D), the state's chief elections officer, advised Maricopa County Thursday that it should replace all voting machines that were turned over to a private contractor for an audit of the 2020 presidential election, citing 'grave concerns regarding the security and integrity' of the machines that make them unusable for future elections," Rosalind Helderman reports. "Hobbs' guidance, outlined in a letter to county officials, is the latest fallout from a review of the election ordered by Republicans in the Arizona state Senate, who used a subpoena to order the county to turn over voting machines and nearly 2.1 million ballots to reexamine last fall's vote."
Rudy Giuliani cannot claim his job as an attorney shields him from the seizure of electronics, prosecutors said.
"The former New York mayor, through his attorneys, has argued that because of the extensive business-related communications authorities are likely to find on his phones and computers, it is impossible for the Justice Department to sort through his data without infringing on the rights of his clients," Shayna Jacobs reports. "Prosecutors argued in the letter motion that 'the mere fact that Giuliani [is a lawyer] does not mean that they are above the law or immune to criminal investigation.'"
Hot on the left
The Associated Press terminated a new staffer amid an uproar over her past tweets about Israel and Palestinians, sparking backlash."Emily Wilder started a new job as a news associate for the Associated Press on May 3. Just 16 days later, she was called and told that she had been terminated for violating the company's social media policy," Jeremy Barr reports. "Wilder was not told which of her social media posts had violated company policy, she said, just that 'I had showed clear bias.' A spokesperson for the wire service confirmed that 'she was dismissed for violations of AP's social media policy during her time at AP.' But the termination appears to be connected to tweets of hers referencing her advocacy for the Palestinian people and opposition to the actions of the Israeli government.
"Wilder, who is Jewish, said she was an active member of the pro-Palestinian groups Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine at Stanford University, from which she graduated in 2020. On Sunday, she posted on Twitter her criticism of how the news media describes the [Israel-Palestine] situation. ... The following day, the Stanford College Republicans flagged a post that Wilder made in college, characterizing her as an 'anti-Israel agitator' and criticizing the Associated Press for hiring her. ... In subsequent days, conservative outlets including the Federalist, Washington Free Beacon and the website of Fox News published stories calling out the wire service for Wilder's hiring and attempting to tie it to the Israeli army's recent destruction of the Associated Press's Gaza bureau. ... Wilder believes the Associated Press acted in response to those high-profile pieces of criticism."
Earlier yesterday, our colleagues Josh Dawsey and Sarah Ellison revealed that CNN anchor Chris Cuomo advised his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on how to respond to sexual harassment allegations made earlier this year by women who'd worked with the governor.
The story drew criticism from the left and the right, with many comparing CNN's lack of action toward Chris Cuomo to the AP's speedy removal of Wilder:

The New York Post this morning:
Hot on the right
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) insulted a "woke, emasculated" U.S. Army ad."[The ad, which Cruz shared a TikTok of, features] a brightly animated U.S. Army ad telling the true story of Cpl. Emma Malonelord, a soldier who enlisted after being raised by two mothers in California and graduating at the top of her high school class," Katie Shepherd reports. "The U.S. Army said its ad showcases the 'the deeply emotional and diverse' backgrounds of its soldiers. But to Cruz, who retweeted the [video] on Thursday, the contrast with [a] Russian campaign instead made American soldiers 'into pansies.' ... His jab did not sit well with critics, including many former service members [and] veterans groups. ... Conservative ire over changes in the U.S. military is not new. ... John Noonan, who is an adviser on military and defense affairs for Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), retweeted the same TikTok video with the comment 'We are going to be the most tolerant military in history ever to lose a war.' Cruz replied, 'yep.' ... Despite the backlash, Cruz refused to take back his disdain for the video."

COVID-19 restrictions are disappearing across the vast majority of Colorado, with mask and physical distancing requirements for fully vaccinated people in most indoor and outdoor settings removed and capacity limits lifted. But that doesn't mean the pandemic is over in this state.
Far from it. According to the state-by-state tracking system maintained by the New York Times , Colorado's COVID-19 data is the worst in the entire country as of today, May 18. And the state has been at or near the bottom of the roster frequently in recent weeks.
To put things in perspective, Colorado is currently five slots worse than Florida .
The state's status may seem surprising, given that COVID-19 case and hospitalization counts continue to fall in Colorado; the Times shows declines of 31 percent and 6 percent, respectively, over the most recent fourteen-day period. But Colorado's case rate of twenty per 100,000 people is tied with Michigan's for the highest in the U.S. right now, and the Michigan figures are improving more quickly than Colorado's. Over the past two weeks, Michigan has seen a 48 percent dive in cases and a hospitalization dip of 32 percent.
On May 17, President Joe Biden announced that COVID-19 cases were down in all fifty states, but hospitalizations are actually up for three (West Virginia, Washington and Oregon), and vaccination rates for the Times 's bottom ten are all under 50 percent. Maine is the top finisher among these states, with 49 percent of its populace vaccinated; Colorado sits at 41 percent.
That leaves 59 percent of Coloradans not yet fully protected against the virus, and an increasing number of experts fear that lifting restrictions actually disincentivizes vaccination for those who've been putting off getting the shots. On Twitter on May 17, CNN medical expert Dr. Leana Wen argued that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "got the science right: Vaccines are extraordinary at protecting against #covid19. But they got the communication wrong. We are seeing the dramatic (& I think unintended) consequences of their statements, which have led to the premature ending of mask mandates."
If Wen is right, Colorado could be among the first to feel negative repercussions — since it currently ranks last among the fifty states.
Here are the New York Times 's current COVID-19 bottom ten.

‘Even doing normal isn’t normal’ — America’s reopening is cautious, surreal

Texto completo: With climbing vaccinations and dwindling virus cases, Americans from Honolulu to Sumter, S.C., have begun to return to the things they did before — the nights out, religious services and annual traditions that made life richer. But after a year of isolation, it has all been a bit uncertain, both familiar and not quite.
“Even doing normal isn’t normal,” said Amy Holson-Schwartz, 37, who took her family to an annual sheepshearing event on a farm in Vermont that was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. She said it was odd to see other children’s uncovered faces in public and watched as her 18-month-old daughter, whose 10-word lexicon includes “mask,” gawked at other babies.
“She’s had no interaction with other kids,” Holson-Schwartz said.
The New York Times documented Americans reemerging in all 50 states in recent weeks. The approach to reopening has been much like the nation’s patchwork response to the virus: conflicting guidance, competing narratives and Americans left to gauge their own comfort levels.
(Tim Gruber | The New York Times) People gather for the first “post-pandemic” Honky Tonk dance party at Arthur's Barn in Arthur, N.D., on April 16, 2021. With safety restrictions easing, Americans from Maine to Montana are returning to concert halls, worship services and soapbox derbies in all 50 states.(Tim Gruber | The New York Times) People gather for the first “post-pandemic” Honky Tonk dance party at Arthur's Barn in Arthur, N.D., on April 16, 2021. With safety restrictions easing, Americans from Maine to Montana are returning to concert halls, worship services and soapbox derbies in all 50 states. (TIM GRUBER/)
Ashlee Wolsky, 23 and fully vaccinated, felt comfortable attending the reopening of Arthur’s Barn in Arthur, North Dakota, where revelers flipped one another over on the crowded floor of the honky-tonk. The old routine of dressing up to go out on a Friday night felt newly charged. “It had a different level of excitement that I haven’t felt before,” she said.
She delighted in seeing an older couple she recognized, dancing. “You don’t know anything about them, but it’s a familiar face in the barn,” she said. “It’s a touch of normal.”
Taking the stage
The audiences are smaller, but they are filling seats again in playhouses and music clubs, greeting performers with the warm applause that internet streams could never truly convey.
Like so many other performers, musicians who played in the McClurg jam moved their mountain music sessions outdoors. In November, cold weather and safety concerns halted the weekly jams that have been going for decades, but a warm spring brought the music back.
“There’s a lot of good musicians in these hills if you can just get ‘em out,” Alvie Dooms said.
Although major productions on America’s premier stages most likely will not happen for several months, easing restrictions on crowd sizes and live entertainment have allowed many performers to return to familiar venues.
In Oklahoma, the Tulsa Performing Arts Center welcomed an audience of 600 into its nearly 2,400-seat theater on May 2 — its first in-person performance since early 2020 — to watch “Greenwood Overcomes,” an opera marking the centennial of the massacre of Black people living in Tulsa’s then-affluent Greenwood neighborhood by a white mob.
New Orleans allowed bands to resume indoor performances on March 12, but left some restrictions on wind instruments in place, forcing some bands that played at the venue Favela Chic that night to change their usual lineup.
Actors performed “Romeo and Juliet” in masks for Kentucky Shakespeare’s celebration of the playwright on April 23, the anniversary of his death. The annual event was canceled last year.
On the job
After a devastating year, most businesses have reopened. But commerce relies on close interactions between people, a still fraught dynamic after a year of separation.
Cameron Barner and Ben Hamilton farm oysters off their company boat, Ralph, in Maine. Their business was hit hard by restaurant closures and few customers at the ones that remained open.
“We are really excited to have a comeback with full force, and have people vaccinated, and have that appetite for oysters be insatiable again,” Barner said.
David Steckel, a conductor on the Mount Cuba Meteor, checked in on passengers before the train pulled out of the station in Delaware. The Wilmington and Western Railroad, an operating railroad museum, stopped operations for several months before reopening to limited capacity that increased to 50% in April.
Lockdowns devastated businesses throughout the country. There are still 8.2 million fewer jobs than at the start of the pandemic. The dizzying whipsaw of regulations forced many restaurants to limit capacity and often lay off staff members. Many restrictions are now being lifted, as they have in New York, where indoor dining capacity was recently increased to 75%.
(Ricardo Nagaoka | The New York Times) A girl hugs a llama at the Portland Night Market in Portland, Ore. on May 1, 2021. With safety restrictions easing, Americans from Maine to Montana are returning to concert halls, worship services and soapbox derbies in all 50 states.(Ricardo Nagaoka | The New York Times) A girl hugs a llama at the Portland Night Market in Portland, Ore. on May 1, 2021.

Those changes will most likely mean more business for the food industry, but some safety precautions may remain, as they have in other industries.
Offices, like Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., are being rearranged and redesigned, although many who have worked from home for the past year may not return, which some fear could fundamentally transform cities.
Some quiet projects have resumed, too. In St. Ignatius, Mont., Sxwlekws Bell, Willie Stevens and Gary Stevens restarted work on a canoe that they had not worked on since 2019.
“It sat for a year, but at least now the wood is dried out,” Stevens said.
Breaking bread
Friends and family are gathering at the table to reconnect over shared meals. There are special occasions to celebrate, stories to tell and lockdown recipes to share.
Eddie Osman, 49, and his wife, Regina Osman, 47, celebrated getting their first dose of a vaccine over chocolate cake, espresso and tea on April 16. It was their first meal in a restaurant since last spring.
The pandemic was a blow to the food industry. Many restaurants drastically changed how they operated. Many others could not survive. In some cases, people clamored for their favorite eateries to reopen, resulting in the kinds of clusters of COVID-19 infections that led to the initial lockdowns.
But, with increased vaccinations and restrictions rolled back in most states, Americans are breaking bread together again.
In Washington, Lakisha Howard hugged her husband, Wendell, during a Mother’s Day cruise with their family on May 9.
“My husband proposed to me 15 years ago on this boat,” she said. “He re-proposed to me today, and all the kids kept it a secret.”
Sharon Nicholls and Al Simons kissed during a performance by the band BeefStu in Concord, N.H., on April 24.
“We learned, out of this, don’t waste any time,” Nicholls said.
Out on the field
Fans are once again seated in the grandstands that stood eerily empty last year as athletes played through the pandemic.
The virus’s sudden appearance led many competitions to halt last spring. Play eventually resumed, sometimes with profound changes, like professional athletes retreating into “bubbles” meant to protect them from the threat of infection.
Convoluted regulations have begun to recede for younger athletes who often risked infection for the social, emotional and academic benefits of competition.
Kreed Sanderson, a high school student, wrestled a steer at the Idaho District 7 seasonal rodeo April 24. Fewer spectators watched last year’s rodeo in early May when the state was reporting close to 30 new virus cases a day.
Rules for gyms are easing, too. In Connecticut, where Ester Sanches-Naek ran on a treadmill in an empty Club Fitness, capacity limits were lifted in March. Still, few have returned to her gym amid a boom in outdoor running.
Maureen Nafula, 13, worked on her car before racing in the Columbus Soap Box Derby Spring Rally on April 24. Racers competed for a spot in the All American Race in Akron, Ohio, in July. The Columbus race, which was canceled in 2020, had run continuously since 1962. Until last year, the Akron championship races had not been canceled since World War II.
Danny Pearson and Patrick Hegarty cheered for the Philadelphia Union, a Major League Soccer team, at their home opener on April 24. Last year, the league played a truncated season.
Casey Jones applied makeup to Selena Smith during a bodybuilding competition in South Carolina on April 24. Organizers required temperature checks and safety forms from everyone at the event. Only competitors were allowed to forgo masks.
Faith and fellowship
The faithful are praying together in houses of worship, once again sharing the rituals and sounds that connect them to one another and to the divine.
In Chicago, Rosie McGee, 94, and Patricia Butts, 65, embraced at the entrance of Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church on May 2. It was McGee’s first in-person service at the church since the pandemic began.
“It felt like coming home,” she said.
Early in the pandemic, hard-hit states like New York and California imposed strict rules on the types of religious gatherings that drove many early infections. But ritual remained a powerful draw, especially in a difficult time, and the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down such restrictions. On April 9, the court struck down California’s rules against religious gatherings in private homes.
Now, ancient traditions mingle with new precautions: temperature checks, safety questionnaires and pews marked with painter’s tape, as they were at Church of Christ Congregational in Newington, Connecticut, where Thomas Weeden led the service from behind a transparent barrier.
At the South Metro Islamic Center in Minnesota, people were encouraged to wash elsewhere, rather than at the mosque as is typical, before visiting the mosque, where blue circles on the carpet designated space for prayer rugs.
Nights out
There is a thrill to the night again, with shows to get ready for and even people to kiss outside teeming bars.
There is still a risk though, to revelers and workers alike.
Bars and nightclubs — with patrons packed in dark rooms — have proved to be effective sites for the virus to spread. Thousands of infections last summer stemmed from watering holes that reopened for the season, prompting officials to shut them down again in many cities. Now, some bouncers are asking for both ID and proof of vaccination.
Ashlee Wolsky attended the reopening of Arthur’s Barn in North Dakota on April 16 with friends. She grew up in the area hearing older neighbors talk about it and first visited when she was a freshman in college.
“Life is never going to be the same after a global pandemic,” she said. “But we can make it close to as enjoyable as before.”
In the moment
Across the country, people are coming together for annual traditions, rites of passage or just woodland walks.
Phillip Burgess posed for a photograph with his mother, professor Sheron Fraser-Burgess, and father, the Rev. Darryl Burgess, after the commencement ceremony at Ball State University on May 8.
“Today, I was humbled,” Fraser-Burgess said. “For us to see him walk across that stage, for him to do that, it means so much.”

There are paintings by Monet to ponder in Boston, llamas to hug again at the Portland Night Market and saplings to retrieve from the annual tree giveaway in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that returned after last year’s cancellation.
Children spun cartwheels in front of an ’80s cover band in Palmer, Alaska. Bikers roared through Daytona Beach, Fla. And families met dinosaurs at a balloon festival in Goodyear, Ariz.
Kira Mildenstein, 41, and her husband, Jon, took their five children to an annual tulip festival in Lehi, Utah, on April 24 for their first family outing since last spring. Attending had been a kind of family tradition, but she and her husband paused this year to weigh the risks and their own comfort. At the festival she noticed all the differences: fewer people, masks, dry water fountains and her own wariness about her children touching things.
“It was weird because so many people were treating it like any other day,” she said. “There was almost an eerie quality to it because it felt normal but still not normal at the same time.”
In Nebraska, the queen’s court wore anachronistic masks during a renaissance festival on May 9.
In South Dakota, Brynn Henning and Brooke Scheitler, both 8, paused to laugh during the Great Cardboard Boat Race at the Midco Aquatic Center.
The pandemic is not over. On May 12, the virus killed 848 people in the United States and 13,425 around the world. It may never leave us.
But after a year, grief and fear have begun to give way to optimism. There is a path back now, to the lives we knew, to something closer to normal.

Texto completo: Mask mandates may be being lifted across the country, but not in the United States House of Representatives.
In a memo sent to members Monday, the Office of the Attending Physician wrote to remind members that masks are still required.
"Extra precautions are necessary given the substantial number of partially vaccinated, unvaccinated, and vaccine-indeterminate individuals," the letter read. "These measure allow for all participants to be treated in the same fashion without displaying any unique identification feature that would separate individuals based on their vaccination or health status."
CNN has confirmed that all of the 219 House Democrats say they have received the Covid-19 vaccination, and 97 of the 211 Republicans say they have received the vaccine.
The total membership of the House Republican conference has changed from 212 to 211 to reflect the resignation of Rep. Steve Stivers from the House of Representatives.
One hundred and nine Republican offices have not responded to multiple CNN inquiries about the members' vaccination status.
The list of the members CNN has confirmed are vaccinated is below:

A man who was registered as a sex offender for having consensual gay sex is fighting to get his name removed from the list

Texto completo: - Randall Menges' name was added to multiple sex offender registries after having consensual gay sex.
- Menges told the New York Times he considered suicide because of the fallout.
- A federal judge ruled to remove him from the list, but Montana's attorney general is fighting back.
* Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
Randall Menges was just 18 years old when he was put on the Idaho state sex offender registry, according to the New York Times.
While at summer camp in 1993, Menges had consensual sex with two other teenage boys. He was charged with "crimes against nature" for having oral and anal sex and went to prison for seven years. His name was also added to Idaho's sex offender registry.
After moving to Montana, Menges was also put on that state's sex offender registry because of a law that dictates all people considered sex offenders in other states must be added to Montana's list once they relocate.
According to the Daily Montanan, a Montana federal judge ruled on May 12 that Menges should no longer be on the sex offender registry.
However, after the ruling, the state's attorney general, Austin Knudsen, said he will fight against the decision for "weaken[ing] our state's sex-offender registry law, making kids and families less safe." Knudsen argued because Idaho has yet to remove Menges from its list of sex offenders, he should remain on Montana's list as well.
Three states still place people who break sodomy laws on sex offender registries
Before 2003, when the Supreme Court ruled against anti-sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas, multiple states had laws prohibiting LGBTQ sex in some capacity, usually banning oral and anal sex between people of the same sex.
Lawrence v. Texas only outlawed sodomy laws that specifically mention sex between people of the same sex. According to the Associated Press, 12 states across the country have anti-sodomy laws that don't specifically mention people of the same sex.
Idaho, South Carolina, and Mississippi still require people who break those laws to remain on sex offender registries.
People who end up on sex offender registries are unable to get jobs, housing, and are socially shunned, which can impact their mental and physical health, according to the ACLU. Menges told the New York Times he considered suicide because of the fallout from a punishment that has followed him for nearly three decades.
Menges, now 45, said the prosecution is ignoring the personal impact these laws have had on his life for the sake of "stronger" sex offender laws.
"It's not that what I did was wrong," Menges told the New York Times.

With climbing vaccinations and dwindling virus cases, Americans from Honolulu to Sumter, South Carolina, have begun to return to the things they did before — the nights out, religious services and annual traditions that made life richer. But after a year of isolation, it has all been a bit uncertain, both familiar and not quite.
“Even doing normal isn’t normal,” said Amy Holson-Schwartz, 37, who took her family to an annual sheepshearing event on a farm in Vermont that was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. She said it was odd to see other children’s uncovered faces in public and watched as her 18-month-old daughter, whose 10-word lexicon includes “mask,” gawked at other babies.
“She’s had no interaction with other kids,” Holson-Schwartz said.
The New York Times documented Americans reemerging in all 50 states in recent weeks. The approach to reopening has been much like the nation’s patchwork response to the virus: conflicting guidance, competing narratives and Americans left to gauge their own comfort levels.
Ashlee Wolsky, 23 and fully vaccinated, felt comfortable attending the reopening of Arthur’s Barn in Arthur, North Dakota, where revelers flipped one another over on the crowded floor of the honky-tonk. The old routine of dressing up to go out on a Friday night felt newly charged. “It had a different level of excitement that I haven’t felt before,” she said.
She delighted in seeing an older couple she recognized, dancing. “You don’t know anything about them, but it’s a familiar face in the barn,” she said. “It’s a touch of normal.”
Taking the Stage
The audiences are smaller, but they are filling seats again in playhouses and music clubs, greeting performers with the warm applause that internet streams could never truly convey.
Like so many other performers, musicians who played in the McClurg jam moved their mountain music sessions outdoors. In November, cold weather and safety concerns halted the weekly jams that have been going for decades, but a warm spring brought the music back.
“There’s a lot of good musicians in these hills if you can just get ’em out,” Alvie Dooms said.
Although major productions on America’s premier stages most likely will not happen for several months, easing restrictions on crowd sizes and live entertainment have allowed many performers to return to familiar venues.
In Oklahoma, the Tulsa Performing Arts Center welcomed an audience of 600 into its nearly 2,400-seat theater on May 2 — its first in-person performance since early 2020 — to watch “Greenwood Overcomes,” an opera marking the centennial of the massacre of Black people living in Tulsa’s then-affluent Greenwood neighborhood by a white mob.
New Orleans allowed bands to resume indoor performances on March 12, but left some restrictions on wind instruments in place, forcing some bands that played at the venue Favela Chic that night to change their usual lineup.
Actors performed “Romeo and Juliet” in masks for Kentucky Shakespeare’s celebration of the playwright on April 23, the anniversary of his death. The annual event was canceled last year.
On the Job
After a devastating year, most businesses have reopened. But commerce relies on close interactions between people, a still fraught dynamic after a year of separation.
Cameron Barner and Ben Hamilton farm oysters off their company boat, Ralph, in Maine. Their business was hit hard by restaurant closures and few customers at the ones that remained open.
“We are really excited to have a comeback with full force, and have people vaccinated, and have that appetite for oysters be insatiable again,” Barner said.
David Steckel, a conductor on the Mount Cuba Meteor, checked in on passengers before the train pulled out of the station in Delaware. The Wilmington and Western Railroad, an operating railroad museum, stopped operations for several months before reopening to limited capacity that increased to 50% in April.
Lockdowns devastated businesses throughout the country. There are still 8.2 million fewer jobs than at the start of the pandemic. The dizzying whipsaw of regulations forced many restaurants to limit capacity and often lay off staff members. Many restrictions are now being lifted, as they have in New York, where indoor dining capacity was recently increased to 75%.
Those changes will most likely mean more business for the food industry, but some safety precautions may remain, as they have in other industries.
Offices, like Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, are being rearranged and redesigned, although many who have worked from home for the past year may not return, which some fear could fundamentally transform cities.
Some quiet projects have resumed, too. In St. Ignatius, Montana, Sxwlekws Bell, Willie Stevens and Gary Stevens restarted work on a canoe that they had not worked on since 2019.
“It sat for a year, but at least now the wood is dried out,” Stevens said.
Breaking Bread
Friends and family are gathering at the table to reconnect over shared meals. There are special occasions to celebrate, stories to tell and lockdown recipes to share.
Eddie Osman, 49, and his wife, Regina Osman, 47, celebrated getting their first dose of a vaccine over chocolate cake, espresso and tea on April 16. It was their first meal in a restaurant since last spring.
The pandemic was a blow to the food industry. Many restaurants drastically changed how they operated. Many others could not survive. In some cases, people clamored for their favorite eateries to reopen, resulting in the kinds of clusters of COVID-19 infections that led to the initial lockdowns.
But, with increased vaccinations and restrictions rolled back in most states, Americans are breaking bread together again.
In Washington, Lakisha Howard hugged her husband, Wendell, during a Mother’s Day cruise with their family on May 9.
“My husband proposed to me 15 years ago on this boat,” she said. “He re-proposed to me today, and all the kids kept it a secret.”
Sharon Nicholls and Al Simons kissed during a performance by the band BeefStu in Concord, New Hampshire, on April 24.
“We learned, out of this, don’t waste any time,” Nicholls said.
Out on the Field
Fans are once again seated in the grandstands that stood eerily empty last year as athletes played through the pandemic.
The virus’s sudden appearance led many competitions to halt last spring. Play eventually resumed, sometimes with profound changes, like professional athletes retreating into “bubbles” meant to protect them from the threat of infection.
Convoluted regulations have begun to recede for younger athletes who often risked infection for the social, emotional and academic benefits of competition.
Kreed Sanderson, a high school student, wrestled a steer at the Idaho District 7 seasonal rodeo April 24. Fewer spectators watched last year’s rodeo in early May when the state was reporting close to 30 new virus cases a day.
Rules for gyms are easing, too. In Connecticut, where Ester Sanches-Naek ran on a treadmill in an empty Club Fitness, capacity limits were lifted in March. Still, few have returned to her gym amid a boom in outdoor running.
Maureen Nafula, 13, worked on her car before racing in the Columbus Soap Box Derby Spring Rally on April 24. Racers competed for a spot in the All American Race in Akron, Ohio, in July. The Columbus race, which was canceled in 2020, had run continuously since 1962. Until last year, the Akron championship races had not been canceled since World War II.
Danny Pearson and Patrick Hegarty cheered for the Philadelphia Union, a Major League Soccer team, at their home opener on April 24. Last year, the league played a truncated season.
Casey Jones applied makeup to Selena Smith during a bodybuilding competition in South Carolina on April 24. Organizers required temperature checks and safety forms from everyone at the event. Only competitors were allowed to forgo masks.
Faith and Fellowship
The faithful are praying together in houses of worship, once again sharing the rituals and sounds that connect them to one another and to the divine.
In Chicago, Rosie McGee, 94, and Patricia Butts, 65, embraced at the entrance of Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church on May 2. It was McGee’s first in-person service at the church since the pandemic began.
“It felt like coming home,” she said.
Early in the pandemic, hard-hit states like New York and California imposed strict rules on the types of religious gatherings that drove many early infections. But ritual remained a powerful draw, especially in a difficult time, and the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down such restrictions. On April 9, the court struck down California’s rules against religious gatherings in private homes.
Now, ancient traditions mingle with new precautions: temperature checks, safety questionnaires and pews marked with painter’s tape, as they were at Church of Christ Congregational in Newington, Connecticut, where Thomas Weeden led the service from behind a transparent barrier.
At the South Metro Islamic Center in Minnesota, people were encouraged to wash elsewhere, rather than at the mosque as is typical, before visiting the mosque, where blue circles on the carpet designated space for prayer rugs.
Nights Out
There is a thrill to the night again, with shows to get ready for and even people to kiss outside teeming bars.
There is still a risk though, to revelers and workers alike.
Bars and nightclubs — with patrons packed in dark rooms — have proved to be effective sites for the virus to spread. Thousands of infections last summer stemmed from watering holes that reopened for the season, prompting officials to shut them down again in many cities. Now, some bouncers are asking for both ID and proof of vaccination.
Ashlee Wolsky attended the reopening of Arthur’s Barn in North Dakota on April 16 with friends. She grew up in the area hearing older neighbors talk about it and first visited when she was a freshman in college.
“Life is never going to be the same after a global pandemic,” she said. “But we can make it close to as enjoyable as before.”
In the moment
Across the country, people are coming together for annual traditions, rites of passage or just woodland walks.
Phillip Burgess posed for a photograph with his mother, professor Sheron Fraser-Burgess, and father, the Rev. Darryl Burgess, after the commencement ceremony at Ball State University on May 8.
“Today, I was humbled,” Fraser-Burgess said. “For us to see him walk across that stage, for him to do that, it means so much.”
There are paintings by Monet to ponder in Boston, llamas to hug again at the Portland Night Market and saplings to retrieve from the annual tree giveaway in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that returned after last year’s cancellation.
Children spun cartwheels in front of an ’80s cover band in Palmer, Alaska. Bikers roared through Daytona Beach, Florida. And families met dinosaurs at a balloon festival in Goodyear, Arizona.
Kira Mildenstein, 41, and her husband, Jon, took their five children to an annual tulip festival in Lehi, Utah, on April 24 for their first family outing since last spring. Attending had been a kind of family tradition, but she and her husband paused this year to weigh the risks and their own comfort. At the festival she noticed all the differences: fewer people, masks, dry water fountains and her own wariness about her children touching things.
“It was weird because so many people were treating it like any other day,” she said. “There was almost an eerie quality to it because it felt normal but still not normal at the same time.”
In Nebraska, the queen’s court wore anachronistic masks during a renaissance festival on May 9.
In South Dakota, Brynn Henning and Brooke Scheitler, both 8, paused to laugh during the Great Cardboard Boat Race at the Midco Aquatic Center.
The pandemic is not over. On May 12, the virus killed 848 people in the United States and 13,425 around the world. It may never leave us.
But after a year, grief and fear have begun to give way to optimism. There is a path back now, to the lives we knew, to something closer to normal.

Texto completo: The world's first mass coronavirus inoculation campaign for children kicked off in earnest in the United States on Thursday after the federal government recommended making the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available to those aged 12 to 15.
Even as the decision was embraced by millions of parents wearied by pandemic restrictions and desperate to get their children back into classrooms, states, counties, and school districts around the country were trying to figure out the most reassuring and expedient ways to offer the shots.
The various authorities were making plans to offer vaccines not only in schools, but also at pediatricians' offices, day camps, parks, and even beaches.
President Biden, who hailed the vaccine as “safe, effective, easy, fast, and free," said that as many as 20,000 pharmacies stood ready to start giving shots on Thursday.
Some states, including Delaware, Georgia, and Maine, had already started to offer doses to children after the authorization of the vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday.
But the ruling by the CDC was the final step in the federal process that allows for widespread inoculations of the roughly 17 million adolescents in the United States ages 12-15.
For many parents, it could not come too soon. About one-third of eighth graders, usually 13 or 14 years old, are still in remote learning.
But the authorities must also overcome a significant amount of hesitancy. A recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that many parents — even some who eagerly got their own coronavirus shots — were reluctant to vaccinate pubescent children.
States have differing standards on what could be used to prove parental consent.
In Los Angeles, the health authorities require anyone younger than 18 to be accompanied by a parent, guardian, or responsible adult and to present photo identification and verification of age, officials said.
In Maine, a parent does not need to be with the child as long as the adult provides permission over the phone or signs a form beforehand.
Federal and local officials said that there should be no problem with supply meeting demand. The expansion of the US vaccination effort underscored the widening gulf in the world's inoculation campaigns even as the pandemic gathers force in several regions.

Biden announces $7.4b to hire public health workers
The White House announced Thursday that it is investing $7.4 billion to hire more public health workers to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and future health crises. The money will come from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which Congress passed in March.
The funds could give a much-needed boost to America's crumbling public health infrastructure. After decades of chronic underfunding, US public health departments last year showed how ill-equipped they are to carry out basic functions, let alone serve as the last line of defense against the most acute threat to the nation's health in generations.
The Biden administration said $4.4 billion will go toward boosting states' overstretched public health departments, allowing them to hire disease specialists to do contact tracing, case management, and support outbreak investigations and school nurses to help schools reopen. Some of the money will also go to expanding the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which plays a critical role in containing outbreaks.
The remaining $3 billion will be used to create a new grant program to train and modernize the country's public health workforce. Applicants for those grants will be asked to prioritize recruiting staff from the communities they will serve, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds.

As demand for shots slows, officials turn to incentives
In Long Beach, Calif., the mayor is promoting free aquarium tickets for those who get vaccinated.
In New York, the immunized can grab free fries at Shake Shack — an effort that Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday while digging into his own meal.
Leaders nationwide are increasingly turning to incentives as demand for coronavirus vaccines slows. In the most dramatic offer so far, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, said this week that vaccinated residents would be eligible for $1 million lottery prizes and full-ride college scholarships.
“I know that some may say, 'DeWine, you're crazy! This million-dollar-drawing idea of yours is a waste of money,"' the governor said as he explained the initiative funded with federal coronavirus relief money. “But truly, the real waste at this point in the pandemic — when the vaccine is readily available to anyone who wants it — is a life lost to COVID-19."
Meanwhile, some states are making a very different pitch: The sooner you get a shot, the sooner the state will fully reopen.
The latest is Oregon, where the governor said on Tuesday that the state's remaining restrictions would stay in place until at least 70 percent of eligible residents 16 and older had had at least one shot.
“We still have some work to do to reach our 70 percent goal, but I am confident we can get there in June and return Oregon to a sense of normalcy," said Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat.
Oregon, where 49 percent of residents have had at least one dose, is one of the few states that is explicitly tying lifting its indoor mask requirement to the adult vaccination rate. Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania also are awaiting the 70 percent threshold before moving forward with reopening plans.
In Michigan, capacity limits for businesses will lift two weeks after 65 percent of eligible residents have been vaccinated, and the gatherings and face mask orders will end two weeks after 70 percent of eligible residents have been fully vaccinated, Governor Gretchen Whitmer said. Thirty-seven percent of residents have been immunized in the state, which has shown one of the country's steepest drops in cases over the past two weeks. The average number of new infections reported daily during that time sank 45 percent and hospitalizations were down 32 percent.
Pennsylvania is waiting for 70 percents of adults to be fully vaccinated before lifting its mask mandate. Only 37 percent of adults have been immunized in the state.
The mask requirement in Minnesota will be lifted once 70 percent of residents 16 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but no later than July 1, Governor Tim Walz said. Half of Minnesotans have had at least one dose.
On Wednesday, Maryland said that every business would be allowed to open, starting on Saturday, at 100 percent capacity, but that the indoor mask requirement would be in place until 70 percent of adults had received one dose. So far, only 52 percent have met that guideline.

40 Japanese towns give up hosting Olympic athletes
About 40 Japanese towns have pulled out of arrangements to host Olympic athletes for pre-competition events this summer, the country's Nikkei newspaper reported Thursday, in the latest blow to the already delayed and troubled Tokyo 2020 Games.
The towns cited concerns about medical capacity as Japan battles its latest COVID-19 outbreak. The East Asian nation reported 7,056 new coronavirus cases Wednesday amid rising concerns by medical professionals of a potential shortage in critical care capacity.

Texto completo: Two students and one adult suffered non-life-threatening injuries during a shooting at Rigby Middle School in Rigby, Idaho, on Thursday, according to a statement from the school district obtained by CNN affiliate East Idaho News.
The suspect, a 6th-grade student, pulled a handgun out of her backpack and started shooting in a hallway before going outside, said Jefferson County Sheriff Steve Anderson. A teacher was able to take away the student's gun, ending the shooting, Anderson said.
"During the shooting, a teacher disarmed the student and detained her until law enforcement took her into custody," Anderson said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
The suspect is in custody, he said.
Students were evacuated to a nearby high school where parents were asked to pick them up, according to a statement from the Jefferson County School District.
"This is the worst nightmare a school system can face," said district superintendent Chad Martin.
Officials don't have a motive for the shooting in Rigby, a small city about 15 miles north of Idaho Falls.
Jefferson County Prosecutor Mark Taylor said once the investigation is completed his office "will be filing appropriate charges, possibly including three counts of attempted murder."
The two injured students will be kept in the hospital overnight, according to Dr. Michael Lemon with Eastern Idaho Medical Center. The adult has been released from the hospital .
All schools will be closed Friday in response to the shooting, the school district said Thursday afternoon, but counselors will be available at Rigby High School throughout the day.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little said he was being updated on the situation and was praying to "those involved in today's tragic events."
"Thank you to our law enforcement agencies and school leaders for their efforts in responding to the incident," Little said in a Facebook post.
CNN's Paul P. Murphy and Sara Finch contributed to this report.

Texto completo: A legislative intern whose rape allegation against an Idaho state representative led to an investigation that resulted in his resignation last week was publicly named by a conservative media outlet, despite her desire to remain anonymous.
"I have worked with survivors for 14 years, and this process was the most harmful I have ever seen in my life," the intern's attorney, Anne Hightower with the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, told CNN on Wednesday.
An ethics investigation against Republican state representative Aaron von Ehlinger began after the 19-year-old intern for another lawmaker accused von Ehlinger of engaging in nonconsensual sexual acts with her after taking her to dinner. The intern -- who asks to be identified as "Jane Doe" -- made a report to the Boise Police Department saying she was raped, according to an investigation by the House Ethics Committee.
CNN does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault without their consent.
Von Ehlinger has not been charged with a crime. The Boise Police Department has not responded to multiple requests from CNN asking whether a criminal investigation is ongoing. His current attorney, Edward Dindinger, told CNN on Wednesday they have not received any further information from police about where things stand.
"It's just irresponsible to publicly accuse someone of felony crimes before the investigation is complete," Dindinger said.
Von Ehlinger told the Ethics Committee that the sexual encounter with Jane Doe was consensual. The committee heard public testimony from Doe from behind a curtain concealing her identity. But Hightower says the moment she left the committee room, Doe was hounded by activists, including two women with cellphone cameras trying to get video of her.
"Me and my co-counsel and several women who were bystanders rushed and surrounded her," Hightower said, shielding her face with umbrellas until Capitol security escorted her out of the building.
Additionally, a local TV reporter recorded the incident with a cellphone. The reporter's station subsequently apologized and erased her footage -- which was never aired -- and her Capitol credentials were revoked, according to Idaho Press Club president Betsy Z. Russell.
The scene was condemned by members of the committee. "Anybody who did harass or intimidate a witness should be reviewed for possible prosecution," Democratic state Rep. John Gannon said at the conclusion of the four-day hearing.
But Hightower says she's concerned about future victims who may be intimidated by the process. "I'm not naïve enough to think that this will never happen again," she said.
In fact, Jane Doe's identity already had been made public, when correspondence from one of von Ehlinger's previous attorneys that included her name was published by a conservative news site. That report was further publicized by Republican state Rep. Priscilla Giddings, who linked to it via social media and her official constituent newsletter.
"Rep. Giddings must be held accountable for her actions in spreading lies in social media posts, intimidating the witness Jane Doe, & more lies during the hearing," Democratic state Sen. Melissa Wintrow tweeted after the hearing.
Dindinger, von Ehlinger's current attorney, told CNN that the letter was released by a previous lawyer working for von Ehlinger, but it was done without his client's approval or consultation.
Rep. Giddings did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.
The Ethics Committee -- which is majority Republican -- did not make a judgment on whether von Ehlinger had committed a crime, but did vote unanimously last Thursday to recommend that he be censured and suspended from his duties for "conduct unbecoming" in repeatedly propositioning women who worked in the Capitol for dates. Hours later, von Ehlinger resigned before the full House could act on the recommendation.
Dindinger told CNN on Wednesday that he was not at liberty to discuss any future steps von Ehlinger may take.
Hightower says their main concern now is that future witnesses don't have to experience what happened to Doe. "Nothing we can do at this point can fix what happened to my client," Hightower said.
Clarification : An earlier version of this story identified the wrong person who included Jane Doe's name in correspondence published by a conservative news site. It was one of Aaron von Ehlinger's previous attorneys.

Texto completo: May 2 - The auditorium at Rhema Bible Training College in suburban Tulsa, Oklahoma, was filled with more than 4,000 unmasked people and onstage sat dozens more when Maine's celebrity physician, Dr. Christiane Northrup, stepped up to the podium the evening of April 16.
Disgraced Trump campaign adviser Michael Flynn had stood in the same spot four hours earlier, railing to attendees of the Health and Freedom Conference against schoolchildren wearing masks and the validity of the 2020 election. Trump attorney Lin Wood would follow her an hour later, loudly extolling the "truth" of the QAnon conspiracy and urging the execution by firing squad of those who were allegedly kidnapping, raping and eating children, a sprawling cabal of evildoers he claimed included "the Clintons, the Obamas, the Bidens and the Bushes."
Over the next 20 minutes Northrup - who once regularly graced Oprah Winfrey's television couch, delivered a commencement address to the University of Maine at Farmington, and practiced obstetrics and gynecology for 26 years in Yarmouth - rattled out a stream of falsehoods: that COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent the disease but will make humankind sterile and might kill babies breastfed by their vaccinated mothers; that people shouldn't wear masks but should fear being around vaccinated people, who could infect others with malignant vaccine particles and who are being secretly spied upon with components of the vaccine that covertly relay physiological information to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation via cellphone cameras and a patented mechanism involving cryptocurrency.
"I don't actually want to have the body fluids of anybody who's had (COVID-19 vaccines) come into my body," she said, likening them to "murder weapons" and implying the audience should indefinitely separate themselves from the inoculated, including members of their own households. "I have heard today that many, many couples in Texas are getting divorced over this one."
The crowd gave her a standing ovation. Dr. Northrup had found her new audience.
For those who remember her as The New York Times best-selling author of "Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom," a prominent obstetrician-gynecologist and champion of a feminine and intuitive approach to health and well-being, Northrup's evolution over the past year may startle. She has emerged as one of the nation's most influential figures in disseminating anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that are complicating the effort to put a lid on the global pandemic, which requires widespread vaccination to deny the virus hosts to propagate, mutate and spread.
With half a million Facebook followers, and hundreds of thousands more on Twitter and, until Thursday, Instagram, Northrup's increasingly outrageous theories have an enormous reach. The Center for Confronting Digital Hate in late March named her as one of the "disinformation dozen" who collectively generate 65 percent of all anti-COVID-19 vaccine social media shares and up to 73 percent of those on Facebook.
"The typical way anti-vaxxers are portrayed is that they are a disorganized thing, but it's actually an organized industry of highly capable propagandists," says the center's executive director, Imran Ahmed. "The content Northrup produces is dangerous and would lead people to take actions or not take actions which would protect their lives, and it's unbelievable to see that she continues to have a platform on major social media platforms despite the fact she is a threat to biosecurity."
One of the nation's most prominent epidemiologists, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Northrup and the other members of the "disinformation dozen" are causing serious damage.
"I have no doubt that the disinformation has cost us tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of lives - people who have failed to protect themselves because they don't believe in the virus," says Nuzzo, who co-wrote a foreword to the center's report. "Now we have a vaccine that can prevent deaths and hospitalizations. For people not to get vaccinated because they are convinced that the vaccines are bad for them, that's a human tragedy the magnitude of which is hard to even describe."
On April 16, U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico called on Twitter and Facebook, which owns Instagram, to act in "a swift and decisive manner" against Northrup and the other members of the "disinformation dozen."
"For too long, social media platforms have failed to adequately protect Americans by not taking sufficient action to prevent the spread of vaccine disinformation online," the Democratic senators wrote. "Many of these accounts continue to post content that reach millions of users, repeatedly violating your policies with impunity."
Northrup's Instagram account, which had 175,500 followers, was blocked Thursday for purveying disinformation, a Facebook spokesman confirmed Friday. Her Facebook and Twitter accounts remained active.
CONSPIRACIES ABOUT THE VIRUS
Northrup, who allowed her medical license to expire in 2015, did not respond to numerous interview requests. In a recent Facebook video she defended her social media messaging, saying she wouldn't "believe in unfounded conspiracies and become involved in something that would result in such defamation."
But in her social media feeds, Northrup has put forward or endorsed a wide range of unfounded and conspiratorial messaging, telling her Facebook followers that vaccinated people might be "owned and controlled" by companies owning patented materials in the vaccine and advising Instagram followers from a Tulsa airport departure lounge April 18 that they should avoid vaccinated people, including spouses, because they could expose them to harmful vaccine materials extruded from their bodies.
"What I would do is choose your friends very carefully and stay away from people who are not on the same page if you possibly can," she said in the video feed before boarding a flight to return to Maine. "Be with like-minded groups of people."
On Twitter in November and December she spread false reports on conservative websites claiming scientists had discovered that people not exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 don't spread the disease (they do); that wearing masks causes wearers permanent damage through oxygen depletion; that a "Philly mob boss" had stolen the 2020 election from Donald Trump and might "flip on Biden"; and that the "end game" of those in charge of the pandemic is "genocide."
The latter post Northrup shared claims the pandemic is planned, a "sinister plot" that aims "to cull a large percentage of the human race and to turn the survivors into a completely controlled army of slaves who own nothing and are dictated to and tracked, traced and monitored 24/7 everywhere, even inside their own homes, which of course they will no longer own."
One of her more infamous endorsements came on May 5, 2020, when she shared a 26-minute conspiracy video, "Plandemic," with her Facebook followers. An analysis by The New York Times found Northrup's share played the key catalyzing role in the phenomenal spread of the slickly produced video, which argued that a secret cabal of elites was using COVID-19 and the vaccines that would be developed to fight it to enrich and empower themselves.
"Her status as a celebrity doctor made her endorsement of 'Plandemic' powerful," The New York Times reported May 20. "After Dr. Northrup shared the video, more than 1,000 people also shared it, many of them to groups that oppose mandatory vaccinations."
Northrup herself expounded on a vaccine conspiracy in a widely circulated video interview apparently recorded in October 2020, in which she claimed COVID-19 vaccines would change people's DNA and infiltrate their bodies with tiny "nanoparticle" robots with two-way 5G antennas. "They have the ability to take your biometric data - not only your vaccine record, but your breathing, your heart rate, your activity, sexual activity, these drugs that you're taking, where you travel - all of that and then take that data and store it in the cloud," she said. This information, she said, would then be paired with a barcode that would "connect us to cryptocurrency, so that would become literally slaves to the system."
"Once those nanoparticles go in, there's no detoxing from them, there's no getting them out of there," Northrup continued. "They combine with your DNA and you are suddenly programmable, and with the proposed 5G networks the body would be an antenna where you could be controlled from outside of yourself."
On Nov. 13 she retweeted a post from another member of the "disinformation dozen," Sherri Tenpenny, that stated the "asymptomatic carrier con" was "the most evil genius ever devised to create a mass of subservient unthinking obedient slaves that are willing to give up being human just to stay 'safe.'" Northrup prefaced the retweet with her own comment: "This is just plain TRUE! A crime against humanity."
Her ungrounded theories have real-world impacts. In April a private Miami school her grandchildren attend, Centner Academy, announced it would no longer employ anyone who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. The school cited debunked information that echoed Northrup's recent talking points in Tulsa and on social media: that "tens of thousands of women" were experiencing "adverse reproductive issues simply from being in close proximity with those who have received any one of the COVID-19 injections."
"No one knows exactly what may be causing these irregularities, but it appears that those who have received the injections may be transmitting something from their bodies to those with whom they come in contact," the school's statement continued.
None of the COVID-19 vaccines have been linked to reproductive or neonatal problems, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise pregnant women to get vaccinated.
"She's spread a bunch of lies abut the safety of these vaccines, so obviously this can lead to more and more people catching the virus and more and more people getting sick and dying from it," says Jonathan Jarry of the McGill University Office for Science and Society, who tracks scientific disinformation and has followed Northrup's social media evolution.
"The larger picture is that she tells her followers to trust their gut and their intuition and to not stop and think carefully about things first but to trust the first answer that pops into your head," Jarry adds. "That's dangerous, because there's a lot of things in our world that are not intuitive."
FROM O's COUCH TO Q'S STAGE
Over the past quarter-century, Northrup's path has led her from Oprah's couch to the QAnon stage. A native of Buffalo, New York, and graduate of the Dartmouth Medical School, she has said she always had skepticism about conventional (and often male-dominated) approaches to medicine. In 1986 she opened a private practice in Yarmouth, Women to Women, that combined conventional and alternative medicine and helped pioneer the women's health movement in Maine.
She catapulted into national celebrity after the publication of "Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom" in 1994, which was a New York Times best-seller, sold 1.6 million copies, was translated into 17 languages and landed her as a regular guest as a wellness expert on Oprah Winfrey's and Dr. Oz's shows. Oprah credited another of Northrup's best-selling books, "The Wisdom of Menopause," with inspiring her to lose weight and get in shape.
"She was able to go from a fairly straight-laced gynecologist with a legitimate practice and the social status that came with it to branching out to a national and international network of new age publishing and conferences," says cult researcher Matthew Remski, co-host of the Conspirituality podcast, who has followed Northrup's career. "When she comes out with 'Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom,' she is playing this edge between offering fairly conventional medical advice and also opening her audience up to the idea that Chinese herbs and acupuncture might also be effective."
Northrup stressed alternative therapies and was skeptical of vaccines long before the pandemic struck. In 2006 she began speaking out against what she saw as dangers with Gardasil, the HPV vaccine, and encouraged parents not to have their daughters receive it and to focus on good health and nutrition instead.
But by her own account to a QAnon podcaster, it was Maine's 2019 law removing religious and philosophical vaccination exemptions for students and school and nursery school staff that made her become "very galvanized" around vaccination and certain public health mandates. When she went to testify against the bill on March 13 of that year, she was flabbergasted by the presence of so many experts supporting it.
"My colleagues get up there (like) someone inserted a tape deck into their head and said - this is the official narrative - 'vaccines are safe and effective, and we need them for public health,'" she told the host of the QAnon FAQ podcast on May 20 of last year. "And I'm looking around at the people and the narrative and the science, and I'm thinking, 'Am I in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"?'" - a reference to the movie set in a mental health institution.
When the coronavirus hit the United States in March 2020, Northrup quickly became convinced something nefarious was at work. Confined to her house at the end of March, she spent a lot of her energy in the first month of the crisis taking care of her terminally ill boyfriend until his death April 21. Then the themes of her social media feed began to take a darker turn.
"There was this slow but steady merger between her previously held New Age fascinations and anti-vaccinations beliefs with a lot of influences from either QAnon or Q-adjacent influencers on the internet," says Remski, with her sharing of the "Plandemic" video on May 5 marking a sharp inflection point. 'We have no idea where she was spending her time online, but it was pretty clear that she started functioning as a gateway between the QAnon world and more mainstream circles."
By the time of her May 20 QAnon FAQ interview, Northrup was already suspicious of the pandemic, claiming that social distancing was "ridiculous," that COVID-19 could be cured with vitamins, and that Maine Medical Center in Portland had shut down its COVID-19 wing. "I think there's a dark agenda behind all of this," she told the host. "I really can't think anything else."
She also volunteered that she was working with two other people who would later earn places in the "disinformation dozen" - Tenpenny and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - and that they formed "a big umbrella."
"You need to know you're not alone," she told the Q audience. "You declare your sovereignty. 'We do not consent!'"
Northrup's political giving also shifted dramatically around this time. Over the previous decade she had made 17 federal campaign contributions that went overwhelmingly to Democrats or the action committees of Democratic-leaning groups like EMILY's List and NARAL, Federal Election Commission filings show. But starting May 27 she began a rapid barrage of donations entirely to Republicans, Donald Trump and the Trump MAGA committee - 570 donations in all through November totaling $16,311. House recipients included gun rights firebrand Lauren Boebert, who is under scrutiny for her ties to groups that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6; Trump-aligned mask opponent Michele Steele of California; and abortion opponent Dan Crenshaw, who received a 0 percent rating from NARAL, the pro-choice group, and a 100 percent rating from Right to Life America.
By the time she spoke in Oklahoma last month, Northrup's contrarian pandemic message had further crystallized. "Do not allow yourself to get trampled by the lemmings running toward the cliff," she told the audience, referring to people seeking vaccinations. "You are going to have the DNA that reseeds the planet, OK? You are going to have to do it. The rest of them there, there's no going back. Do not chase people into burning buildings."
Nuzzo, the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, hopes other social media platforms take action against Northrup and the other members of the dozen. "It's clear to me that this is an asymmetric fight, because doctors and nurses and public health agencies don't have the resources to combat this false information on their own," she says. "We can't communicate our way out of this spiral if there are these highly organized groups, and we in the public health community just can't match th

Texto completo: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) steadfastly refused to reveal on Sunday whom she voted for in last year’s presidential election, waving off the question with a laugh while saying that she’s going to keep her vote “private.”
Collins, who was one of eight Republican senators to vote to convict former President Donald Trump in his February impeachment trial, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union and was pressed by anchor Jake Tapper on the state of the Republican Party and her feelings on the ex-president.
After saying she was “appalled” that fellow moderate Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (UT) was booed at the Utah Republican convention, Collins also offered up her support to Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY). The GOP’s highest-ranking woman in Congress, Cheney is facing calls for her ouster from Republican leadership after saying anyone who challenged the 2020 election results should be disqualified from a 2024 presidential run.
While acknowledging that Collins voted to impeach Trump this year for inciting an insurrection based on his election lies, Tapper pointed out that the Maine senator had voted to acquit Trump in his first impeachment trial.
“After President Trump was impeached for the first time for urging Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden, you said you believed and hoped that the president learned his lesson,” the CNN anchor stated. “And I know you said that was aspirational. But after Biden won, the president obviously attempted to overturn the legitimate election results that culminated in the Capitol attack. Do you ever wonder if Trump did learn a lesson, but the lesson he learned was that he could get away with anything?”
Collins, for her part, insisted that her quote about Trump “learning his lesson” was “grossly misedited” before defending her acquittal vote, claiming she looked at the “constitutional standard” for convicting a president while noting that she also voted to acquit Bill Clinton.
“In the first two cases, I did not feel that the conduct was proven to meet the highest bar for removing a president from office,” she added. “In the third case, I felt it did.”
“Yeah, it wasn’t really a question about your behavior, it was a question about Trump and whether or not he learned the wrong lesson,” the State of the Union host retorted.
Tapper then wrapped up the interview by bringing up Collins’ tough 2020 re-election campaign and whether she was now willing to reveal if she had voted for Trump in the presidential election.
“You didn’t say who he voted for in 2020. You were running for re-election. I could understand that,” Tapper pressed. “Maine is a state with a lot of independents and independent-minded people. But now that the election is over, who did you vote for in 2020?”
Laughing out loud, Collins exclaimed: “Nice try, Jake!”
Admitting that she’s been asked that question quite a bit, Collins nonetheless said she was “going to keep my vote private.” At the same time, she also expressed hope that she could forge a working relationship with President Joe Biden.
“To me, that is important, the ability to work with the president,” she concluded. “Whether or not the president is of your party and also to be able to work across the aisle and forge bipartisan consensus on the many important issues that we face and I hope to be successful in helping to forge a bipartisan infrastructure package.”

Soldiers who went missing on secret US military mission in 1962 to be honored with Maine memorial

Texto completo: The families of soldiers lost while taking part in a secret US mission during the Vietnam War have long wanted their relatives' names included on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.
Because of complexities surrounding Flying Tiger Line Flight 739 -- which disappeared over the Pacific Ocean in 1962 -- that hasn't happened.
But relatives of the missing military members say they are at last about to receive some recognition. A memorial will be unveiled in Columbia Falls, Maine, on May 15 to honor those who were on Flight 739.
A secret mission
There are many unanswered questions about what happened to the plane.
It disappeared March 16, 1962, as it headed to the Philippines from Guam. Both locations were scheduled refueling stops on the flight from California to Saigon.
An explosion was reported near where Flight 739 should have been at the time, according to a crash report obtained by Stars and Stripes. No debris from the aircraft was found, the report said.
There were 93 US soldiers on board, 11 crew members, and three South Vietnamese soldiers. The details of their mission have not been publicly revealed. The Flying Tiger Line was the first all-cargo airline in the US, according to Flying Tigers Club. It also chartered flights for military personnel.
Jennifer Kirk, niece of Spc. Donald Sargent, who was on the flight, has been in contact with several family members of others who were on the mission. She told CNN that many of them said the men who were about to leave believed they might not be coming home.
She said her uncle did not say so explicitly, but he expressed a similar message. "He just kept coming up (to his sister-in-law), saying, 'I just need one more hug before I go. I just need one more hug,'" she said.
"Then he'd go downstairs to go to the vehicle that was picking him up and he'd come back upstairs. 'I just need one more hug.' So he knew something, but he didn't say."
No names on the wall
The Department of Defense has said those on Flying Tiger Line Flight 739 couldn't have their names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial because they weren't in a combat zone when they went missing, Kirk said.
Donna Ellis was 5 when she lost her father, Staff Sgt. Melvin Lewis Hatt. She said she doesn't remember much from that period, but she has been fighting to get her father's name on the memorial in Washington. She said because those on Flight 739 are not on that wall, they are not recognized on their state or local Vietnam memorials.
In Ellis' push to get those names included, she wrote to Sen. Gary Peters, of her home state of Michigan. Peters introduced a bill in 2019 to get the names of the soldiers from Flight 739 on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It was read twice in the Senate, but died after being referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
'Some kind of closure'
Kirk and Ellis said they will keep fighting to get their family members' names on the memorial wall, but they are looking forward to getting some closure when the Wreaths Across America monument is unveiled.
Morrill Worcester, founder of Wreaths Across America, decided to build the monument on his land after talking with Kirk's family about their loss. Kirk said her family was shocked when they heard someone was finally going to do something.
"He put his whole heart into it," Kirk said.
Wreaths Across America Executive Director Karen Worcester told CNN the Kirks' story hit home with her and her husband.
"They've just been trying to get answers and some kind of closure just to know that these people weren't forgotten," she said.
Wreaths Across America held a groundbreaking ceremony in July for the monument, which is located where brush is harvested every year to make veterans' remembrance wreaths to be placed on military headstones.
The monument will have the names of everyone on Flight 739 and their names will be read at the unveiling, Worcester said.
"We have a saying at Wreaths Across America that a person dies twice," she said. The first is when "life leaves their body, but the final time is when their name is spoken for the very last time."
In addition to the unveiling, families will be invited to take part in the Wreaths Across America Remembrance Tree Program, which includes hanging a replica dog tag on the trees used to make remembrance wreaths.
"It's a blessing," Kirk said. "They are finally going to be recognized. They are finally going to be remembered."

Texto completo: The auditorium at Rhema Bible Training College in suburban Tulsa, Oklahoma, was filled with more than 4,000 unmasked people and onstage sat dozens more when Maine's celebrity physician, Dr. Christiane Northrup, stepped up to the podium the evening of April 16.
Disgraced Trump campaign adviser Michael Flynn had stood in the same spot four hours earlier, railing to attendees of the Health and Freedom Conference against schoolchildren wearing masks and the validity of the 2020 election. Trump attorney Lin Wood would follow her an hour later, loudly extolling the "truth" of the QAnon conspiracy and urging the execution by firing squad of those who were allegedly kidnapping, raping and eating children, a sprawling cabal of evildoers he claimed included "the Clintons, the Obamas, the Bidens and the Bushes."
Over the next 20 minutes Northrup - who once regularly graced Oprah Winfrey's television couch, delivered a commencement address to the University of Maine at Farmington, and practiced obstetrics and gynecology for 26 years in Yarmouth - rattled out a stream of falsehoods: that COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent the disease but will make humankind sterile and might kill babies breastfed by their vaccinated mothers; that people shouldn't wear masks but should fear being around vaccinated people, who could infect others with malignant vaccine particles and who are being secretly spied upon with components of the vaccine that covertly relay physiological information to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation via cellphone cameras and a patented mechanism involving cryptocurrency.
"I don't actually want to have the body fluids of anybody who's had (COVID-19 vaccines) come into my body," she said, likening them to "murder weapons" and implying the audience should indefinitely separate themselves from the inoculated, including members of their own households. "I have heard today that many, many couples in Texas are getting divorced over this one."
The crowd gave her a standing ovation. Dr. Northrup had found her new audience.
For those who remember her as The New York Times best-selling author of "Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom," a prominent obstetrician-gynecologist and champion of a feminine and intuitive approach to health and well-being, Northrup's evolution over the past year may startle. She has emerged as one of the nation's most influential figures in disseminating anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that are complicating the effort to put a lid on the global pandemic, which requires widespread vaccination to deny the virus hosts to propagate, mutate and spread.
With half a million Facebook followers, and hundreds of thousands more on Twitter and, until Thursday, Instagram, Northrup's increasingly outrageous theories have an enormous reach. The Center for Confronting Digital Hate in late March named her as one of the "disinformation dozen" who collectively generate 65 percent of all anti-COVID-19 vaccine social media shares and up to 73 percent of those on Facebook.
"The typical way anti-vaxxers are portrayed is that they are a disorganized thing, but it's actually an organized industry of highly capable propagandists," says the center's executive director, Imran Ahmed. "The content Northrup produces is dangerous and would lead people to take actions or not take actions which would protect their lives, and it's unbelievable to see that she continues to have a platform on major social media platforms despite the fact she is a threat to biosecurity."
One of the nation's most prominent epidemiologists, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Northrup and the other members of the "disinformation dozen" are causing serious damage.
"I have no doubt that the disinformation has cost us tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of lives - people who have failed to protect themselves because they don't believe in the virus," says Nuzzo, who co-wrote a foreword to the center's report. "Now we have a vaccine that can prevent deaths and hospitalizations. For people not to get vaccinated because they are convinced that the vaccines are bad for them, that's a human tragedy the magnitude of which is hard to even describe."
On April 16, U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico called on Twitter and Facebook, which owns Instagram, to act in "a swift and decisive manner" against Northrup and the other members of the "disinformation dozen."
"For too long, social media platforms have failed to adequately protect Americans by not taking sufficient action to prevent the spread of vaccine disinformation online," the Democratic senators wrote. "Many of these accounts continue to post content that reach millions of users, repeatedly violating your policies with impunity."
Northrup's Instagram account, which had 175,500 followers, was blocked Thursday for purveying disinformation, a Facebook spokesman confirmed Friday. Her Facebook and Twitter accounts remained active.
CONSPIRACIES ABOUT THE VIRUS
Northrup, who allowed her medical license to expire in 2015, did not respond to numerous interview requests. In a recent Facebook video she defended her social media messaging, saying she wouldn't "believe in unfounded conspiracies and become involved in something that would result in such defamation."
But in her social media feeds, Northrup has put forward or endorsed a wide range of unfounded and conspiratorial messaging, telling her Facebook followers that vaccinated people might be "owned and controlled" by companies owning patented materials in the vaccine and advising Instagram followers from a Tulsa airport departure lounge April 18 that they should avoid vaccinated people, including spouses, because they could expose them to harmful vaccine materials extruded from their bodies.
"What I would do is choose your friends very carefully and stay away from people who are not on the same page if you possibly can," she said in the video feed before boarding a flight to return to Maine. "Be with like-minded groups of people."
On Twitter in November and December she spread false reports on conservative websites claiming scientists had discovered that people not exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 don't spread the disease (they do); that wearing masks causes wearers permanent damage through oxygen depletion; that a "Philly mob boss" had stolen the 2020 election from Donald Trump and might "flip on Biden"; and that the "end game" of those in charge of the pandemic is "genocide."
The latter post Northrup shared claims the pandemic is planned, a "sinister plot" that aims "to cull a large percentage of the human race and to turn the survivors into a completely controlled army of slaves who own nothing and are dictated to and tracked, traced and monitored 24/7 everywhere, even inside their own homes, which of course they will no longer own."
One of her more infamous endorsements came on May 5, 2020, when she shared a 26-minute conspiracy video, "Plandemic," with her Facebook followers. An analysis by The New York Times found Northrup's share played the key catalyzing role in the phenomenal spread of the slickly produced video, which argued that a secret cabal of elites was using COVID-19 and the vaccines that would be developed to fight it to enrich and empower themselves.
"Her status as a celebrity doctor made her endorsement of 'Plandemic' powerful," The New York Times reported May 20. "After Dr. Northrup shared the video, more than 1,000 people also shared it, many of them to groups that oppose mandatory vaccinations."
Northrup herself expounded on a vaccine conspiracy in a widely circulated video interview apparently recorded in October 2020, in which she claimed COVID-19 vaccines would change people's DNA and infiltrate their bodies with tiny "nanoparticle" robots with two-way 5G antennas. "They have the ability to take your biometric data - not only your vaccine record, but your breathing, your heart rate, your activity, sexual activity, these drugs that you're taking, where you travel - all of that and then take that data and store it in the cloud," she said. This information, she said, would then be paired with a barcode that would "connect us to cryptocurrency, so that would become literally slaves to the system."
"Once those nanoparticles go in, there's no detoxing from them, there's no getting them out of there," Northrup continued. "They combine with your DNA and you are suddenly programmable, and with the proposed 5G networks the body would be an antenna where you could be controlled from outside of yourself."
On Nov. 13 she retweeted a post from another member of the "disinformation dozen," Sherri Tenpenny, that stated the "asymptomatic carrier con" was "the most evil genius ever devised to create a mass of subservient unthinking obedient slaves that are willing to give up being human just to stay 'safe.' " Northrup prefaced the retweet with her own comment: "This is just plain TRUE! A crime against humanity."
real-world impacts
Her ungrounded theories have real-world impacts. In April, a private Miami school her grandchildren attend, Centner Academy, announced it would no longer employ anyone who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. The school cited debunked information that echoed Northrup's recent talking points in Tulsa and on social media: that "tens of thousands of women" were experiencing "adverse reproductive issues simply from being in close proximity with those who have received any one of the COVID-19 injections."
"No one knows exactly what may be causing these irregularities, but it appears that those who have received the injections may be transmitting something from their bodies to those with whom they come in contact," the school's statement continued.
None of the COVID-19 vaccines have been linked to reproductive or neonatal problems, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise pregnant women to get vaccinated.
"She's spread a bunch of lies abut the safety of these vaccines, so obviously this can lead to more and more people catching the virus and more and more people getting sick and dying from it," says Jonathan Jarry of the McGill University Office for Science and Society, who tracks scientific disinformation and has followed Northrup's social media evolution.
"The larger picture is that she tells her followers to trust their gut and their intuition and to not stop and think carefully about things first but to trust the first answer that pops into your head," Jarry adds. "That's dangerous because there's a lot of things in our world that are not intuitive."
FROM O's COUCH TO Q'S STAGE
Over the past quarter-century, Northrup's path has led her from Oprah's couch to the QAnon stage. A native of Buffalo, New York, and graduate of the Dartmouth Medical School, she has said she always had skepticism about conventional (and often male-dominated) approaches to medicine. In 1986, she opened a private practice in Yarmouth, Women to Women, that combined conventional and alternative medicine and helped pioneer the women's health movement in Maine.
She catapulted into national celebrity after the publication of "Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom" in 1994, which was a New York Times best-seller, sold 1.6 million copies, was translated into 17 languages and landed her as a regular guest as a wellness expert on Oprah Winfrey's and Dr. Oz's shows. Oprah credited another of Northrup's best-selling books, "The Wisdom of Menopause," with inspiring her to lose weight and get in shape.
"She was able to go from a fairly straight-laced gynecologist with a legitimate practice and the social status that came with it to branching out to a national and international network of New Age publishing and conferences," says cult researcher Matthew Remski, co-host of the Conspirituality podcast, who has followed Northrup's career. "When she comes out with 'Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom,' she is playing this edge between offering fairly conventional medical advice and also opening her audience up to the idea that Chinese herbs and acupuncture might also be effective."
Northrup stressed alternative therapies and was skeptical of vaccines long before the pandemic struck. In 2006 she began speaking out against what she saw as dangers with Gardasil, the HPV vaccine, and encouraged parents not to have their daughters receive it and to focus on good health and nutrition instead.
But by her own account to a QAnon podcaster, it was Maine's 2019 law removing religious and philosophical vaccination exemptions for students and school and nursery school staff that made her become "very galvanized" around vaccination and certain public health mandates. When she went to testify against the bill on March 13 of that year, she was flabbergasted by the presence of so many experts supporting it.
"My colleagues get up there (like) someone inserted a tape deck into their head and said - this is the official narrative - 'vaccines are safe and effective, and we need them for public health,' " she told the host of the QAnon FAQ podcast on May 20 of last year. "And I'm looking around at the people and the narrative and the science, and I'm thinking, 'Am I in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"?' " - a reference to the movie set in a mental health institution.
When the coronavirus hit the United States in March 2020, Northrup quickly became convinced something nefarious was at work. Confined to her house at the end of March, she spent a lot of her energy in the first month of the crisis taking care of her terminally ill boyfriend until his death April 21. Then the themes of her social media feed began to take a darker turn.
"There was this slow but steady merger between her previously held New Age fascinations and anti-vaccinations beliefs with a lot of influences from either QAnon or Q-adjacent influencers on the internet," says Remski, with her sharing of the "Plandemic" video on May 5 marking a sharp inflection point. "We have no idea where she was spending her time online, but it was pretty clear that she started functioning as a gateway between the QAnon world and more mainstream circles."
By the time of her May 20 QAnon FAQ interview, Northrup was already suspicious of the pandemic, claiming that social distancing was "ridiculous," that COVID-19 could be cured with vitamins, and that Maine Medical Center in Portland had shut down its COVID-19 wing. "I think there's a dark agenda behind all of this," she told the host. "I really can't think anything else."
She also volunteered that she was working with two other people who would later earn places in the "disinformation dozen" - Tenpenny and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - and that they formed "a big umbrella."
"You need to know you're not alone," she told the Q audience. "You declare your sovereignty. 'We do not consent!' "
'highly organized groups'
Northrup's political giving also shifted dramatically around this time. Over the previous decade she had made 17 federal campaign contributions that went overwhelmingly to Democrats or the action committees of Democratic-leaning groups like EMILY's List and NARAL, Federal Election Commission filings show. But starting May 27 she began a rapid barrage of donations entirely to Republicans, Donald Trump and the Trump MAGA committee - 570 donations in all through November totaling $16,311. House recipients included gun rights firebrand Lauren Boebert, who is under scrutiny for her ties to groups that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6; Trump-aligned mask opponent Michele Steele of California; and abortion opponent Dan Crenshaw, who received a zero percent rating from NARAL, the pro-choice group, and a 100 percent rating from Right to Life America.
By the time she spoke in Oklahoma last month, Northrup's contrarian pandemic message had further crystallized. "Do not allow yourself to get trampled by the lemmings running toward the cliff," she told the audience, referring to people seeking vaccinations. "You are going to have the DNA that reseeds the planet, OK? You are going to have to do it. The rest of them there, there's no going back. Do not chase people into burning buildings."
Nuzzo, the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, hopes other social media platforms take action against Northrup and the other members of the dozen. "It's clear to me that this is an asymmetric fight because doctors and nurses and public health agencies don't have the resources to combat this false information on their own," she says. "We can't communicate our way out of this spiral if there are these highly organized groups, and we in the public health community just can't match their reach."

Texto completo: Republican Idaho state Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger resigned Thursday afternoon, hours after the state's House Ethics Committee had unanimously recommended he be censured and stripped of the powers of his office without pay.
Von Ehlinger was accused of pursuing inappropriate relationships with women who worked in the state Capitol, including sexual contact with a 19-year-old intern in March. That intern filed a police report accusing von Ehlinger of rape.
"After careful deliberation and prayer, I have determined that I will not be able to effectively represent my constituents in the Idaho House of Representatives and have decided to resign my seat, effective immediately," von Ehlinger said in a letter read to the House at the beginning of its session Thursday. "I maintain my innocence of any wrongdoing of which I have been accused in this matter, let alone any violation of any law, rule or policy of the state of Idaho or this body."
The hearing against von Ehlinger had begun with the allegations of the intern, who was referred to in the proceedings as "Jane Doe." She testified privately to the committee that the legislator had not gotten her consent for sex. A committee report says von Ehlinger has not been charged with a crime.
The Boise Police Department did not return a message from CNN on Thursday asking whether there was an open criminal investigation.
Von Ehlinger acknowledged the sexual encounter, but said it was consensual.
Ethics Committee member John McCrostie, a Democrat, was unmoved by von Ehlinger's defense, saying it was not the committee's job to determine whether a sexual assault actually occurred. "Common sense and basic morality dictate that an elected representative should not entertain a relationship with a student intern, regardless of who initiated the relationship," McCrostie told the committee Thursday.
Testimony to the committee indicated that von Ehlinger had propositioned for dates at least four women who worked on the Capitol grounds -- including an assistant clerk of the House and a security guard -- despite being warned by other legislators that it was inappropriate for him to date staffers.
"His behavior has poisoned the reputation of all of us and tarnished and discredited other elected officials who serve," said Ethics Committee member Wendy Horman, a Republican.
Before the resignation was announced, Republican Gov. Brad Little released a statement agreeing with the vote of the Ethics Committee.
"I applaud Jane Doe and the other brave women for their courage in telling their stories and participating in this process to hold Representative Aaron von Ehlinger accountable for his deeply damaging and shameful actions," the governor said.
Von Ehlinger declined to testify publicly to the committee, instead choosing to provide statements that he said had been given while under a polygraph.
His attorney, Edward Dindinger, did not return requests for comment from CNN on Thursday evening.

Lewiston-Auburn leads the entire country in daily average of new COVID-19 cases

LEWISTON – Only two other metropolitan areas in the entire country have a higher daily average of new COVID-19 cases over the last two weeks than Lewiston-Auburn.
Lewiston-Auburn has an average of 71 new cases per 100,000 residents per day, according to data published Tuesday in The New York Times. That means that on average, 77 people have tested positive for the disease every day over the past two weeks.
Only Muskegon and Flint, both cities in Michigan, have a higher daily average and L-A is only one of three cities in the top 20 highest-ranking cities in the nation not in Michigan. The other two are in Oregon and Illinois.
For comparison, over the past two weeks New York City (69th), Boston (159th) and Los Angeles (582nd) have recorded an average of 30.3, 19.6 and 3.7 new cases per 100,000 residents, respectively.
There have been 1,077 new cases in the L-A area in the past 14 days, according to The New York Times.
“It absolutely dumbfounds me on why our numbers are up,” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque said Wednesday. “I have not seen a single person unmasked in Auburn in, I mean, literally months.”
Auburn City Safety Director Matthew Fifield said that compliance with safety protocols is high among businesses and the general public.
“What we have noticed as of late is there seems to be more transmission in situations that we had not seen in the past,” Fifield said. “Some medical professionals have hinted at possible variants being the cause of this change,” and that the highly contagious nature of some of the variants may be leading to increased community spread.
“During the winter we saw situations where a smaller number of family members may contract COVID-19 within a particular home and today other families are seeing the entire home contracting COVID-19,” he said.
City officials from Lewiston did not return a request for comment.
William Wallace, a lecturer at Bates College in Lewiston and a member of the Lewiston Area Public Health Committee, said he believes the fact that vaccination eligibility for Mainers under 50 only opened this month and community spread through social events are driving new cases.
“I think it’s probably those gatherings that are taking place on weekends or evenings where groups of people get together, not from their own family pod, and they’re spreading and contracting the virus,” Wallace said.
At Bates College, three unsanctioned social gatherings preceded a large outbreak and a two-week campus shutdown. The latest round of testing found only one new case, a staff member. There are two active cases among students and two among staff, including the new positive case, according to the college’s dashboard. A total of 124 members of the Bates community have recovered from COVID-19.
Wallace, who is also an assistant swimming coach, said he knew that at least one of the student gatherings was a birthday party and suspected there might have been about 10 kids in attendance.
“I think the kids probably felt awfully bad about that,” he said.
Androscoggin and Oxford counties are trailing behind the statewide average for vaccine administrations. Statewide, 55.2% of all eligible Mainers have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 43.6% have received their final dose.
In Androscoggin County, 48.4% of those eligible have gotten one dose and 37.1% have received their final inoculation. In Oxford County, 45.9% and 35.7% have gotten their first and final shots, respectively.
Turner Fire/Rescue held its third vaccine clinic this week, with Chief Lisa Bennett saying earlier this week reception has been positive.
“It’s pretty great, people are excited to get the shot,” she said. Last week’s clinic was canceled due to the pause on Johnson & Johnson vaccine administrations.
“It was a month and a half before we saw any of our vaccines,” but supply has been steady, sans the J&J interruption.
Meanwhile, the seven-day average of new cases in Androscoggin County has sustained its downward trend at 61.7 cases Tuesday, which is a significant drop from the all-time peak on April 20 when the average was 90.4 cases.
A Flourish chart
Oxford County’s seven-day average is also trending downward from an average of 33 cases on April 20 to Tuesday’s 24-case average.
State health officials reported 261 new cases statewide Wednesday, including 45 in Androscoggin County and 19 in Oxford County. There was one death, a woman in her 80s from Piscataquis County.
Androscoggin County’s cumulative case rate is still highest in the state at 657.2 cases per 10,000 people, according to statistics from the Maine CDC published Wednesday. Oxford County ranks third, with 554.5 cases per 10,000 people and Franklin County sixth, with 405.7 cases. The statewide average is 453.5 cases per 10,000.
As of Wednesday, the Maine CDC is investigating 26 outbreaks in Androscoggin and Oxford counties. That list includes 19 schools, four assisted living facilities, a commercial printing facility, a paper mill and a church.

Texto completo: Idaho on Tuesday became the second state this week to enact a so-called heartbeat ban -- a law barring most abortions at the onset of a fetal heartbeat, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant.
"We should never relent in our efforts to protect the lives of the preborn," Republican Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a statement announcing the bill signing, adding that he was "proud to sign the bill into law today."
The Idaho bill -- which states that it will go into effect only if a federal appeals court upholds another heartbeat ban -- comes after a flurry of anti-abortion bills in the early months of the Biden administration, including this week alone. On Monday, Oklahoma enacted a near-total abortion ban and a heartbeat ban. Later that day, Montana banned abortion at 20 weeks based on the scientifically disputed notion that a fetus can feel pain at that point in development.
Idaho's HB 366 requires ​that abortion providers check for a fetal heartbeat and would ban abortions if one is detected. It makes exceptions for medical emergencies "to avert (an abortion seeker's) death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function." It also includes exceptions for rape and incest if it has been reported to a law enforcement agency or child protective services and a copy of the report has been given to the abortion provider.
The states' bills -- which may soon face legal challenges in light of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability -- send a sweeping message that the state-level fight over access to the procedure is far from over. Republican-controlled states have advanced a wave of anti-abortion bills this year consistent with the trend under the Trump presidency, while the Biden administration has sought to expand abortion protections, namely by reversing Trump-era restrictions.
Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii slammed Little following the bill signing, accusing him of signing the bill only to appease his "radical followers."
"Let's be clear: Abortion is still completely legal in Idaho, even after six weeks. This legislation changes nothing," the group posted in a statement. "What it really does is simply set Idaho up for a lawsuit if a similar ban in another federal court upholds their unconstitutional legislation -- and there is nothing that indicates that would ever happen. But even if it does, we will launch a lawsuit immediately to stop it."
Idaho state Rep. Steven Harris, who sponsored the bill, told CNN in an interview Tuesday that someone not knowing they were pregnant "shouldn't change the result."
"Is there supposed to be a time frame that says, 'Within some window I can abort the baby?' " he said. "It doesn't quite make sense from a pro-life point of view."
When asked about the requirements on exceptions for rape or incest, Harris pointed to a previously passed Idaho abortion measure -- which would go into effect only if Roe is overturned -- with similar requirements for rape and incest victims, saying that "we were careful in those areas to reproduce what was already in current Idaho code as not complicating the idea with other topics."
Harris said that despite not seeing any court actions moving in the bill's favor, "the more the courts see that the states feel they have a compelling interest, perhaps the more they'll rule in our favor -- so that's the hope."
Prior to this week, South Carolina enacted a heartbeat ban in February and Arkansas legalized a near-total abortion ban in March. Of the 15 so-called gestational bans -- which bar abortions past a certain point in pregnancy -- already passed since the start of 2019, none have gone into effect after most of them have been blocked by judges. Oklahoma's bills are slated to go into effect on November 1, and Montana's on October 1.
The Biden administration has previously moved to support abortion rights across a slew of different policies. Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration removed during the Covid-19 pandemic a requirement that one of the drugs involved in medication abortion be dispensed in person, and the Health and Human Services Department moved to reverse a Trump-era rule barring certain federally funded health care providers from referring patients for abortions, a step long demanded by abortion rights groups.

From raw oysters to lobster rolls to alcohol-infused ice-cream, food trucks deliver modernized, pandemic friendly wedding spreads.
“The food truck is uniquely suited to manage the flow — and the food just arrives,” said Matt Geller, chief executive of Best Food Trucks, a Los Angeles-based company that manages food trucks for customers and locations.
Food trucks can serve 100 meals in an hour if they’re quick, so Geller recommends having at least two savory trucks plus a dessert truck for a 100-person wedding.
A decade ago food trucks had been a supplement to weddings — it wasn’t unusual to see a slider food truck slide up to a reception as guests were leaving. Today food trucks are the main meal.
Cousins Maine Lobster
The Food : It’s all about the lobster, but you won’t have to deal with the mess from cracking shells. This is a wedding, after all. Couples can choose to serve everything from lobster rolls to lobster tater tots, lobster tacos and lobster grilled cheese “sammies.”
The Business : “We’re getting inundated with people asking for our truck for their weddings,” said Sabin Lomac, an owner of Cousins Maine Lobster, which operates 40 food trucks and 11 restaurants spread throughout the United States from New York to Texas.
The Price : $3,000 minimum, starting at $40 per person for one entree (a lobster roll or a lobster taco or a lobster grilled cheese) and one appetizer (New England clam chowder, lobster bisque or lobster tater tots).
Tipsy Cones Ice Cream
The Food: Ice cream with and without alcohol (though during the process, most of the alcohol content is lost, leaving the flavor of the alcohol). Flavors include Drunken French toast (maple ice cream with hazelnut liqueur and cinnamon cookie crumbles); Lightly Toasted Almond (Amaretto ice cream with toasted almond bits); Mint Chocolate Nip (Peppermint Schnapps ice cream with chocolate chips); and Rosé Sorbet (peaches and rosé wine) are some staples.
The Business : Tipsy Cones is based in Stratford, Connecticut, and during the majority of the pandemic, Connecticut limited capacity at gatherings. “So for food trucks, that meant no festivals or large parties,” said Brooke Santagata-Albers, the owner of Tipsy Cones. They were already booked for 2020, but by the end of May 2020, all their events were moved to 2021. Now, some events have already been shuffled to 2022.
The Price : Everything is customizable, but a party of 50 in Connecticut (they only serve this state) starts at $700.
Shuckin’ Truck
The Food : Raw oysters, clams, shrimp, lobster rolls, lobster grilled cheese.
The Business : Shuckin’ Truck is a family affair based in Point Judith, Rhode Island, and does business in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. It owns two scallop boats, a year-round oyster farm and their own commercial fishing vessels. The seafood comes from their fishing vessels or from other fishermen in the Rhode Island area, and it’s picked up by the Shuckin’ Trucks the following day — when it’s served. Ninety-five percent of its fully booked schedule was postponed because of the pandemic. Everything is cooked in the truck. An entire wooden raw bar structure is provided with sneeze guards.
The Price : Starts at $55 per head with 50 people minimum for an all-you-can-eat raw bar, unlimited appetizers, lobster rolls and seafood tacos.
Silvercloud Prosecco Van
The Food : Refreshments. Serve yourself Champagne, rosés and other types of wine and craft beer from the taps attached to the trailer, or use one of its bartenders to pour and mix mimosas, bellinis and signature cocktails.
The Business : During the pandemic, the Silvercloud Prosecco Van, which is based in Austin, Texas — although the company will travel throughout the United States for bigger events — saw most of its bar service business shift from a full-service bar to a self-service model with the taps. “Since we have taps on the exterior of the trailer, guests can self-serve any of our kegged cocktails, which makes it a safe option for socially distanced events,” said Yvonne Johnson, a founder of Silvercloud. The company added staff to keep up with the increased demand for its tap trailer rentals.
The Price : Starts at $999 for three hours, which includes the trailer but no alcohol (you or your caterer can provide wine and alcohol for the trailer for this option). Before the pandemic, the most popular package cost $2,149 for three hours of service for 100 guests, which includes three hours of the trailer rental, one licensed bartender and a keg flight (wine and prosecco on tap). Silvercloud provides the curated selection of prosecco, craft beer, cider and red wine for this package.
Gorilla Cheese NYC
The Food : Grilled-cheese sandwiches, tater tots, tomato soup. These aren’t ordinary grilled cheese sandwiches — they offer expanded options such as the asiago with prosciutto and aioli; the sharp Cheddar with barbecued pulled pork and caramelized onions; and the mixed vegetable melt with Muenster, caramelized onions and herb aioli.
The Business : After the pandemic essentially shut down business for Gorilla Cheese NYC, the truck served essential workers in New York City. Since the film industry reopened, they have been catering for TV and movie sets. They serve the New York metropolitan area.
The Price : Starts at $600, but the average party is $2,100, and serves 125 guests for two hours, offering a full sandwich menu, tater tots, tomato soup shooters and nonalcoholic drinks.

College Accounts at Birth: State Efforts Raise New Hopes

Braylon Dedmon was 3 days old when his mother, Talasheia, was offered $1,000 to open a college savings account in his name.
“I was like, ‘What?’” Talasheia Dedmon recalled. Her skeptic’s antennae tingled. “I was a little scared.” Was this a scam?
It wasn’t. The offer was the beginning of a far-reaching research project begun in Oklahoma 14 years ago to study whether creating savings accounts for newborns would improve their graduation rates and their chances of going to college or trade school years later.
A few weeks after that initial conversation in 2007, the first statement arrived, showing $1,000 in Braylon Dedmon’s name. “I was shocked,” said his mother, who now lives in Muskogee, Oklahoma. “They started sending me statements every three months, and have been sending me them since then.”
The experiment, called SEED for Oklahoma Kids or SEED OK, is one of a growing number of efforts by cities and states — governed by Democrats and Republicans alike — to help a new generation climb the educational ladder and build assets. This study and others aren’t finished, but at a time when the gap between the richest sliver of Americans and everyone else is growing, the results have been encouraging.
Research about the Oklahoma project published this month by the Center for Social Development at Washington University in St. Louis, which created SEED OK, found that families that had been given accounts were more college-focused and contributed more of their own money than those that hadn’t been. And the effects are strongest among low-income families.
The approach breaks with most social policy programs created over the last half-century, which focus on income supplements. Child savings accounts, by contrast, concentrate on accumulating assets over the long term.
Michael Sherraden, founder of the center at Washington University, said the idea was to give everyone an investment in the future. Benefits of the program extend not just to bank accounts but also to behavior. Households with the seed money — especially poorer ones with parents who did not attend college — have greater expectations about higher education, are more optimistic, have lower rates of depression and save more.
College savings accounts known as 529 plans, which restrict withdrawals and grow tax-free, are used by only a tiny share of U.S. households, mostly in the upper reaches of the income ladder.
The Oklahoma program is widening that reach. The 1,300-plus children who were chosen at random to be given accounts in 2007 had an average of $3,243 saved by the end of 2019. Among the control group — another 1,300 children who were randomly selected to take part but were not given any money — only 4% had an account.
Parents of children with accounts were also roughly five times as likely to contribute money as those in the control group.
Without the SEED OK account, Talasheia Dedmon acknowledged, “I never would have put a thought about saving toward college.”
She was 21 when Braylon Dedmon was born. At the time, she said, she did not understand that savings in a bank would generate interest income. Afterward, when she had some extra money, she added to Braylon Dedmon’s account.
“He told me he was going to college,” she said, and with the money he has been accumulating, “when he’s 18, he’ll be all set.”
The first of seven children in her family to graduate from college, Talasheia Dedmon is planning to return to school in the fall to become a pharmacist. She hopes that she and her husband will eventually have enough money to start college accounts for their two younger children.
“The big thing is how a stock of assets can change the attitudes of mothers and kids,” said Ray Boshara, a senior adviser for the Institute for Economic Equity at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “College accounts change their attitude about their ability to go to college.”
“A relatively small intervention has potential to change economic outcomes,” he added. “And it has a bigger impact among people of color.”
Proposals at the federal level to establish savings accounts at birth, for college, homes, business or retirement savings, go back to the 1990s. Some of those efforts garnered Republican support, but more recent versions, like a plan by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., to create “baby bonds” for newborns, have primarily been backed by Democrats.
Sherraden, who developed the idea three decades ago in his book “Assets and the Poor,” has been pushing for savings accounts, also known as development accounts, that would automatically be opened for every child born in the United States. Canada, Israel, South Korea and Singapore have established versions of the idea.
“We need to create structures to enable people to accumulate assets over the long term,” Sherraden said. He argues that a universal program is necessary to sustain political support, but that it would nonetheless deliver disproportionate gains at the lower end of the economic spectrum.
“You will reduce the difference in the gap between the highest and lowest group over time,” he said.
In Maine, the private Harold Alfond Foundation started offering every child born in the state a $500 grant in 2009. Alfond, who founded Dexter Shoe Co., which he sold to Warren Buffett, had been writing a $500 check to each of his newborn grandchildren.
“Why shouldn’t every Maine baby receive what my grandchildren have?” he said in starting the program.
So far 116,000 children in the state have been awarded a total of $58 million. Additional family contributions total $114 million.
In recent years, state legislatures have adopted the idea. Pennsylvania, in 2018, was the first to adopt legislation to create accounts for all children born in the state — about 140,000 each year — seeded with a $100 deposit.
Last year, Nebraska started enrolling each baby born in the state in its 529 program. There is no grant money yet, but starting next year families with incomes of less than 200% of the poverty line will get matching funds for contributions.
And this year, Illinois started giving each newborn an account with $50. California has allocated $25 million for a similar program.
Rhode Island and Nevada are among the states that have established child development account programs. There are several other programs of varying scope and size across the United States, according to the nonprofit group Prosperity Now. Several programs include incentives and subsidies for lower-income families, which are disproportionately Black and Latino.
Automatic enrollment in a saving program, with the ability to opt out, turns out to have a much higher participation rate than relying on individuals to take the initiative. In the first years of the Maine program, when families had to open accounts themselves, participation never rose above 50%. In 2013, the Alfond Foundation switched to automatic enrollment, and since then, pretty much every newborn in the state has gotten an account.
William Elliott III, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan and a co-author of “Making Education Work for the Poor,” said knowledge about how to administer savings accounts and their impact had jumped over the last decade.
“It’s one of the best delivery systems” to help low-income children build assets and direct them toward college, Elliott said. He added that there was more rigorous data on the positive impact of child savings accounts than there was on student loans, government Pell grants and free college.
“A savings account for a low-income kid means a lot more to them than it does for a wealthy kid,” Elliott said, and establishing it early can transform expectations about the future.
Kandynace Boyd, who lives in Oklahoma City, hasn’t been able to contribute any additional money to her son Manuel’s account. She works part time in an acute care facility and is struggling to keep up with bills. But she said Manuel, 13, was already talking about going to culinary school.
“He’s got nearly $2,000 in it,” she said of the account. “I wish I could do it for my other two kids.”

Texto completo: As some public school districts move toward embracing critical race theory in their curriculums, others -- like in Idaho -- are doing the opposite.
Idaho lawmakers have advanced a bill that would prohibit public schools, including public universities, from teaching that "any sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin is inherently superior or inferior," which, according to the bill, is often found in "critical race theory."
It also prohibits teachings arguing that "individuals, by virtue of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin."
Critical race theory and teachings like it "exacerbate and inflame divisions on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, or other criteria in ways contrary to the unity of the nation and the well-being of the state of Idaho and its citizens," the bill reads. Proponents have argued that students are being indoctrinated.
The bill, HB 377, passed the state House last week and the Senate Monday. It now awaits the governor's signature.
Critical race theory has become politicized in recent months, with proponents arguing the area of study is based on Marxism and a threat to the American way of life. But the study, according to scholars, explores the ways in which a history of inequality and racism in the US have continued to impact American society today.
"It's an approach to grappling with a history of White supremacy that rejects the belief that what's in the past is in the past and that the laws and systems that grow from that past are detached from it," Kimberlé Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and a law professor at UCLA and Columbia universities, told CNN last year.
Though the bill references critical race theory specifically, Idaho state Rep. Julianne Young and Sen. Carl Crabtree, both sponsors of the bill, claim the legislation does not prohibit any specific subject.
"There are concerns that, in isolated instances, students have felt intimidated or coerced into certain ideologies. Every student deserves a learning environment where they can think freely and learn without prejudice," Crabtree said in an email to CNN.
In a separate email to CNN, Young claimed that critical race theorists teach discrimination.
"I support teaching in the classroom that values history and experience, encourages compassion, and treats every individual with respect," Young wrote.
Some experts in the state say the bill is looking for a problem that doesn't actually exist.
"The passage of HB 377 and the accompanying insinuations about Idaho teachers are very disappointing," said Layne McInelly, president of the Idaho Education Association, in a statement. "This is a 'monster under the bed' problem brought about by a false and misleading narrative that some legislators have willfully conflated. They aim to diminish the public's trust in our teachers and schools, just to come back next year and push to privatize education."
The bill has become a high-profile issue in the state, as dozens of Idaho students and teachers protested peacefully on the steps of the state legislature on Monday before the Senate vote, and filled the Senate gallery during the debate.
"We have a group that's put out public comments that our teachers are brainwashing our children with a liberal, leftist indoctrination and that's simply not true," Idaho state Sen. Janie Ward-Engelking said during the debate, according to CNN affiliate KIVI.
Meanwhile, Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin announced a task force earlier this month, aiming to "examine indoctrination in Idaho education and to protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism, and Marxism."
"As I have traveled around the state and spoken with constituents and parents, it has become clear to me that this is one of the most significant threats facing our society today," McGeachin said in a news release. "We must find where these insidious theories and philosophies are lurking and excise them from our education system."
Across the country, public school entities are considering the inclusion of aspects of race education in school curriculums. In March, after years of debate, California approved an optional ethnic studies model curriculum for districts to employ if they so choose.
"By affirming the identities and contributions of marginalized groups in our society, ethnic studies helps students see themselves and each other as part of the narrative of the United States," a draft of the California curriculum reads. "Importantly, this helps students see themselves as active agents in the interethnic bridge-building process we call American life."
Other locales have made similar moves. Last year, Connecticut announced it will require high schools to offer African American, Black, Puerto Rican and Latino studies, becoming the first state in the nation to do so. Also last year, the San Francisco school board approved the development of a K-12 curriculum in Black Studies.
And yet, the area of study has been weaponized by some Republican lawmakers. In September, former President Donald Trump called critical race theory "divisive, anti-American propaganda," language similar to that found in HB 377.
"Students in our universities are inundated with critical race theory. This is a Marxist doctrine holding that America is a wicked and racist nation, that even young children are complicit in oppression, and that our entire society must be radically transformed," Trump said at the time.

Texto completo: I cannot believe that some of the Democrats want to defund and get rid of the police — especially Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Maxine Waters, and Chris Cuomo. They are going to ruin this nice country.
Too bad we don’t have a good president. He listens to them. He has no backbone. We need Trump back. Because of political correctness we cannot speak. Most people are afraid. Well, I’m not.
We have amendments the Democrats don’t follow. Those who voted for Biden will be sorry. They watch CNN too much. CNN lies all the time.
We have to keep our amendments. The Democrats are trying to take them away.
Tom Hart, Lewiston

Texto completo: Inpatients are younger and from rural areas, and the virus variant from U.K. may be part of the reason.
Inpatient levels reach records at Lewiston’s Central Maine Medical Center
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 hit a record this week at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, as statewide inpatient numbers surged to highs not seen since mid-February.
The new surge, which comes even as a majority of adult Mainers have received at least one vaccine shot, is different in that many of the patients needing inpatient care are younger than 60 and most are from rural areas.
In the past, few infected people younger than 60 became so sick they needed to be admitted to a hospital.
“Those who are getting sick are younger, and the ones getting hospitalized are mostly in their 40s and 50s, whereas in January they were primarily from urban areas now they’re almost all from rural Maine,” said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, the state’s largest hospital network.
“It’s a different type of pandemic right now.”
That is probably the case. A more-contagious, more-virulent form of the coronavirus, the B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the United Kingdom, was found in Maine in early February and is now the dominant strain in the United States. It appears to more readily transmit between young people, but is not resistant to vaccines.
All of the COVID-19 inpatients recently admitted to Maine Medical Center in Portland, the state’s largest hospital, were unvaccinated, Mills said, but their average age was 49, down from 75 last spring.
“E.R. docs say they are busy, busy, busy with lots more young people sick with COVID, though the majority go home,” Mills said. “I guess it’s a call to arms. We need more arms and to get vaccine into them.”
The number of people statewide hospitalized with the disease hit 119 on Thursday, the most since Feb. 8.
Officials said 48 were in intensive care, the most since Feb. 3, creating an extra burden at a time when many hospitals are responding to pent-up demand from non-COVID-19 patients who might have delayed treatment until after they were vaccinated.
“The occupancy of our hospitals (is) quite high right now, and EMMC is at very, very high occupancy,” said Dr. James Jarvis, physician incident commander at Northern Light Health and director of clinical education at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, the state’s second-largest hospital. “If we were to have other COVID-positive patients, it would be hard for us to meet other people’s needs now without delaying care.”

EMMC saw a sharp increase in COVID-19 inpatients over the past week, going from six last Friday to 13 on Thursday, for an average of 7.7 per day for the week, up from 4.9 last week.
The 352-bed hospital was the site of the worst single-day burden of the pandemic Dec. 31, when it had 55 confirmed inpatients. All of the inpatients receiving care Thursday were from outside Penobscot County, Jarvis said.
Lewiston’s CMMC, now the state’s hardest-hit hospital, saw an average of 18.2 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients daily for six days ending Wednesday, breaking its record of 16 in late January. Eight of the 17 inpatients receiving care Wednesday were younger than 60, and five were younger than 50, according to the 250-bed medical center.
Androscoggin County has one of the highest-per-capita new COVID-19 case rates in the country, with a daily average of 80 cases per 100,000 residents over the past 14 days, the second-highest rate in the Northeast, after Providence, Rhode Island, according to The New York Times.
York County’s largest hospital, Southern Maine Health Care medical center in Biddeford, saw a sharp increase in COVID-19 inpatients, going from an average of 6.7 last week to 12.3 per day for the week ending Thursday.
MaineGeneral in Augusta has seen a slow but steady increase in COVID-19 inpatient burden over the past month, which now stands at 12.3 inpatients per day, up from 10.4 last week and the most since early February.
Maine Med’s COVID burden went down slightly, from an average of 18.6 inpatients per day last week to 12.4 this week, though the 613-bed hospital has high occupancy from non-COVID-19 patients. Its intensive care unit was at 75% capacity Thursday, according to MaineHealth spokesman John Porter, and SMHC’s was fully occupied.
In his media briefing Thursday afternoon, Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control % Prevention, said new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization trends had been moving in tandem, but that over “the past eight or nine days,” admissions had risen disproportionately.
“That’s of concern,” Shah said.
Northern Light’s Jarvis urged Mainers to continue to wear protective masks, practice social distancing and get vaccinated.
“We’re not out of the woods yet,” he said.
With vaccines being rolled out, the pandemic had eased in recent months in the United States, but new cases are trending slightly higher now than a month ago. States reported an average of 62,956 positive tests and 720 deaths a day for the week ending Wednesday, according to The New York Times tracker.
For much of the pandemic, Maine has been one of the best performing states in the country in terms of per capita disease prevalence, but as of Thursday it had risen to the sixth worst in the country, with 31 new cases a day per 100,000 residents, the highest rate in New England and far exceeding that of Massachusetts, which ranks 12th (with 24 per 100,000), according to the Times.
Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator in that they typically occur one to three weeks after a person is exposed to the disease, but unlike other metrics, it is not dependent on who and how many people were tested. They can end in three ways: Recovery, death or transfer to another facility.
The Press Herald compiles inpatient data directly from the hospitals and hospital networks. The data does not include outpatients or inpatients suspected of having the virus but who were never tested. The survey includes most of the state’s hospitals, accounting for nearly all of the statewide hospitalizations reported each week by the Maine CDC.

York County’s largest hospital, Southern Maine Health Care medical center in Biddeford, saw a sharp increase in COVID-19 inpatients, going from an average of 6.7 last week to 12.3 per day for the week ending Thursday.
MaineGeneral in Augusta has seen a slow but steady increase in COVID-19 inpatient burden over the past month, which now stands at 12.3 inpatients per day, up from 10.4 last week and the most since early February.
Maine Med’s COVID burden went down slightly, from an average of 18.6 inpatients per day last week to 12.4 this week, though the 613-bed hospital has high occupancy from non-COVID-19 patients. Its intensive care unit was at 75% capacity Thursday, according to MaineHealth spokesman John Porter, and SMHC’s was fully occupied.
In his media briefing Thursday afternoon, Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control % Prevention, said new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization trends had been moving in tandem, but that over “the past eight or nine days,” admissions had risen disproportionately.
“That’s of concern,” Shah said.
Northern Light’s Jarvis urged Mainers to continue to wear protective masks, practice social distancing and get vaccinated.
“We’re not out of the woods yet,” he said.
With vaccines being rolled out, the pandemic had eased in recent months in the United States, but new cases are trending slightly higher now than a month ago. States reported an average of 62,956 positive tests and 720 deaths a day for the week ending Wednesday, according to The New York Times tracker.
For much of the pandemic, Maine has been one of the best performing states in the country in terms of per capita disease prevalence, but as of Thursday it had risen to the sixth worst in the country, with 31 new cases a day per 100,000 residents, the highest rate in New England and far exceeding that of Massachusetts, which ranks 12th (with 24 per 100,000), according to the Times.
Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator in that they typically occur one to three weeks after a person is exposed to the disease, but unlike other metrics, it is not dependent on who and how many people were tested. They can end in three ways: Recovery, death or transfer to another facility.
The Press Herald compiles inpatient data directly from the hospitals and hospital networks. The data does not include outpatients or inpatients suspected of having the virus but who were never tested. The survey includes most of the state’s hospitals, accounting for nearly all of the statewide hospitalizations reported each week by the Maine CDC.

Texto completo: Hospitalizations for COVID-19 hit a record level at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston this week as statewide inpatient numbers surged to highs not seen since mid-February.
The new surge - which comes even as a majority of adult Mainers have received at least one vaccine shot - is different in that many of the patients needing inpatient care are younger than 60 and most are from rural areas. In the past, few infected people under 60 became so sick they needed to be admitted to a hospital.
"Those who are getting sick are younger and the ones getting hospitalized are mostly in their 40s and 50s, and whereas in January they were primarily from urban areas now they're almost all from rural Maine," said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, the state's largest hospital network. "It's a different type of pandemic right now."
That is probably literally the case. A more contagious and virulent form of the coronavirus, the B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the United Kingdom, was found in Maine in early February and is now the dominant strain in the United States. It appears to more readily transmit between young people but is not resistant to vaccines.
All of the COVID-19 inpatients recently admitted to Maine Medical Center in Portland, the state's largest hospital, were unvaccinated, Mills said, but their average age was 49, down from 75 last spring. "E.R. docs say they are busy, busy, busy with lots more young people sick with COVID, though the majority go home," she said. "I guess it's a call to arms - we need more arms and to get vaccine into them."
The number of people statewide hospitalized with the disease hit 119 Thursday, the highest level since Feb. 8. Forty-eight were in intensive care, the most since Feb. 3, creating an extra burden at a time when many hospitals are responding to pent-up demand from non-COVID patients who may have delayed treatment until after they were vaccinated.
"The occupancy of our hospitals (is) quite high right now, and EMMC is at very, very high occupancy," said Dr. James Jarvis, physician incident commander at Northern Light Health and director of clinical education at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, the state's second largest hospital. "If we were to have other COVID-positive patients, it would be hard for us to meet other people's needs now without delaying care."
EMMC saw a sharp increase in COVID-19 inpatients over the past week, going from six last Friday to 13 Thursday for an average of 7.7 per day for the week, up from 4.9 last week. The 352-bed hospital was the site of the worst single-day burden of the pandemic on Dec. 31, when it had 55 confirmed inpatients. All of the inpatients cared for Thursday were from outside Penobscot County, Jarvis said.
Lewiston's CMMC, now the state's hardest-hit hospital, saw an average of 18.2 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients daily for six days ending Wednesday, breaking its record of 16 in late January. Eight of the 17 inpatients being cared for Wednesday were under 60, and five were under 50, according to the hospital, a 250-bed medical center.
Androscoggin County has one of the highest per capita new COVID-19 case rates in the country with a daily average of 80 cases per 100,000 residents over the past 14 days, the second highest rate in the northeastern U.S. after Providence, Rhode Island, according to The New York Times.
York County's largest hospital, Southern Maine Health Care medical center in Biddeford, saw a sharp increase in COVID-19 inpatients, going from an average of 6.7 last week to 12.3 per day for the week ending Thursday.
MaineGeneral in Augusta has seen a slow but steady increase in COVID-19 inpatient burden over the past month, which now stands at 12.3 inpatients per day, up from 10.4 last week and the most since early February.

Vegetables Get the Ripert Treatment
Eric Ripert’s new collection of vegetable recipes is maybe one of the least seemingly chef-driven cookbooks. And it holds true to its title, “Vegetable Simple.” What a delightful approach, especially with summer on the horizon.
Some recipes require as few as two ingredients (tomatoes or cucumbers with salt), and most have a short list, with almost none demanding secondary preparations before you get going. It took me less than an hour to have three dishes ready to eat (glossy seared shiitakes with a jolt of spice, buttery potatoes showered with chives and tender bok choy bathed in a soy-ginger vinaigrette).
“It’s the way I cook and entertain at home,” Ripert said. “I put bowls and platters of vegetables on the table and people help themselves. They’re not meant as side dishes.”
Among the center-of-the-plate ideas are thick rounds of watermelon treated like pizza and strewn with feta cheese and olives, halved hearts of romaine broiled with Caesar dressing and a veneer of Parmigiano-Reggiano, a hearty mushroom Bolognese for pasta, meaty roasted Portobello caps, skewered eggplant slices grilled with red miso, and layered vegetables for Grandma’s Byaldi, all clearly presented and enjoying bright close-ups page after page.
Like the recipe that evokes his grandmother, many of the others reach deep into his childhood in Provence. “My aunt and my grandmother were always cooking vegetables,” he said. “At Le Bernardin seafood is the star; I apply the same philosophy to vegetables.”
His approaches are fresh, with uncommon combinations or cooking techniques. He lets mushrooms simmer for three hours to make a consommé, allows for frozen peas to make soup, emulsifies butter with cooking water to produce a sauce for potatoes, dresses butter lettuce heads whole for salad, provides good advice for cooking bok choy and shows how dazzling a risotto just made with Vidalia onions can be.
At the same time, many of these recipes are celebratory. His excellent and traditional mayonnaise-based coleslaw has Fourth of July written all over it. “I love mayonnaise,” he admits.
Vegetable tasting menus featuring dishes from the book are served at the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar.
“Vegetable Simple” by Eric Ripert (Random House, $35); Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, tasting menus $35, or $70 with wines, 151 West 51st Str., aldosohmwinebar.com, 212-554-1143
Flour Sack Towels With Flowery Appeal
The soft cotton that once went into making flour sacks is what photographer Pauline Stevens has selected for her vibrant collection of kitchen towels decorated with her food-focused photographs. Each is also printed with a literary quotation or a recipe for a dish, a drink or a sauce, most well-suited for Mother’s Day giving. There’s a special set for the holiday. One of the towels, showing a bucket of roses, has a quote from E.M. Forster: “I am sure that if mothers of various nations could meet, there would be no more wars.” The other towel in the set also has roses, and a quote from Maya Angelou. Both measure 19-by-27 inches. Most of the towels are 27-inches square and come nicely packaged with a greeting card.

A New Source for Smoked Trout
With their eyes on Spain and Portugal (and the value given tinned seafood there), Caroline Goldfarb, a comedy television writer, and Becca Millstein, who worked in the entertainment industry, decided that better domestic canned choices were needed. Now they’re in the fish business as founders of Fishwife Tinned Seafood Co. Its latest release is Idaho rainbow trout lightly smoked over alder wood in Oregon and canned in sweet little toothpick-friendly chunks in olive oil, garlic, salt and brown sugar. A plate of it with green olives and a bottle of California albariño, and you’re good to go. Trout salad, trout tossed over pasta or added to a bowl of ramen are some other options. The trout joins their smoked domestic albacore tuna. The rainbow trout is sustainably farmed, and their albacore tuna is wild-caught.

A Whimsical Chocolate Shop for the North Fork
Ursula Sala-Illa, who prefers to be known as Ursula XVII, has just opened her own chocolate shop, Atelier Disset, on the North Fork of Long Island. The pastry chef’s complicated nomenclature has to do with her Catalonian roots. In the Catalan language “disset” means 17 (pronounce it and if you know French, you’ll also understand). Ursula XVII — a native New Yorker who worked at Ai Fiori in New York and with Albert Adrià and Oriol Balaguer in Spain — has settled on the North Fork. On its website and in-store, the compact little shop sells finely crafted and decorated bonbon assortments with fillings like coconut marzipan and banana walnut, assorted bars and chunky cookies. Eventually she plans to hold workshops.

A Helper for Eastern Orthodox Easter
This year, Eastern Orthodox Easter comes on May 2. In a run-up to the celebration, there are some ingredients for traditional dishes that are worth having on hand, notably grape leaves, used for enclosing fillings to make dolmas (vine leaves stuffed with grains, meat or seafood) or to wrap fish before baking. Greek food expert Diane Kochilas has recently added organic grape leaves from Crete to her website, along with recipes.

Texto completo: A spring snowstorm is pounding New England, promising to dump more than a foot of snow on some parts of the region.
The heavy, wet snow made travel hazardous in some areas and threatened power outages from downed trees and power lines.
Some parts of southwestern New Hampshire already had received 8 inches of snow by Friday morning, with the prospect of more than a foot before the storm ends, said National Weather Service meteorologist Andy Pohl.
Winter weather warnings or advisories were posted for large swaths of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts.
"There is even the chance that snow briefly mixes in along the coast of Massachusetts, including in the Boston area, as well as in coastal areas of New Hampshire and Maine on Friday," AccuWeather senior meteorologist Brett Anderson said.
Along the coast, especially in the Boston area, winds could gust up to 50 mph during the day Friday, CNN said.
The storm is forecast to gradually move eastward into the Gulf of Maine on Saturday as the precipitation over New England slowly tapers off, the weather service said.
Snow during April is not unusual, especially over the higher elevations of New England, according to AccuWeather.
A separate winter storm also coated portions of the Rockies and Plains with snow on Friday. Over a foot of snow was reported in Aspen Park, Colorado, while the Denver metro area measured totals around 3-5 inches, as of Friday morning, CNN reported.
The snowstorms were part of a weather pattern that promised to bring more chilly air across much of the central and eastern U.S. over the coming week, forecasters said.

Texto completo: Brandy Zadrozny, a reporter for NBC News who covers online extremism, was working on a story last fall about the right-wing websites that had promoted conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden. One of her queries was to Darren Beattie, a former Donald Trump speechwriter who allegedly wrote for one of those sites.
But instead of answering her questions, Beattie lashed out at Zadrozny in a blog post calling her an "ideologically-motivated hit-man" with a practice of "targeting Trump supporters for doxing, censorship and harassment."
It might have remained a small, nasty online grudge. But Beattie soon got an opportunity to bring his views to a much larger platform: that night's episode of Tucker Carlson's prime-time Fox News show, which was watched by more than 5.3 million people.
As a photo of Zadrozny took up a good chunk of the screen, Beattie described why he thought her reporting techniques were so malevolent. "She's up to no good," Beattie said. "She uses state-of-the-art, proprietary technical tools to dig up personal information about anonymous Trump supporters online . . . basically, so she can ruin their lives."
This was a fundamental misinterpretation of Zadrozny's work, which has included reporting on individuals who discussed the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill insurrection in advance on fringe message boards, the origins of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, and a school shooter in New Mexico who participated in white supremacist Internet communities.
But Carlson expressed outrage. "Why would NBC News be doing something like this?" the most-watched man on cable news asked. "Why would they be going after anonymous Twitter users?"
"It really is disgusting," Beattie replied, likening Zadrozny to a "neo-Stasi," a reference to the East German secret police.
And then the threats against Zadrozny started pouring in. The threats got so bad, and so violent, and so specific, that Zadrozny required armed security for two weeks after the Carlson show segment.
The next day, NBC News released a statement accusing Carlson of "dangerously and dishonestly" targeting Zadrozny, saying that his employer, the Fox News Channel, had "shamefully encouraged harassment and worse."
Zadrozny, however, was hardly the only journalist to receive death threats after being called out by Carlson, a conservative pundit who recently dethroned Sean Hannity as the most-watched host on the most-watched cable news network.
Carlson cut his teeth jousting with the nation's top elected officials and brand-name pundits on CNN's "Crossfire" 20 years ago. But as his influence within the conservative media ecosystem has grown, with some calling for him to run for president in 2024, he has increasingly found fodder in criticizing lesser-known media figures whom he presents to his audience as symbols of liberalism run amok. And a subset of viewers are inspired to personally harass those journalists with threatening messages.
Los Angeles Times columnist Virginia Heffernan told The Post that she contacted local police and filed a report with the Federal Bureau of Investigation - mentioning Carlson by name - after a Feb. 8 segment on his show took aim at a column she published three days earlier.
Heffernan wrote a provocative - but "slightly satirical," she says - column sharing with readers her internal moral dilemma after her Trump-supporting next-door neighbor plowed her driveway of snow. (It drew the ire of Jim Hoft of the far-right Gateway Pundit, who called her "hateful, humorless and intolerant.")
Carlson highlighted Heffernan on his show, sharing her photo with a chyron on the screen describing her as a "loathsome L.A. Times columnist."
"Have you noticed that the angriest people in America are the ones with absolutely no useful skills?" Carlson asked. "People like Virginia Heffernan. No useful skills. Does not do anything."
Heffernan said she received waves of harassing and threatening messages, including letters mailed to her home address and a text message to her phone from a sender indicating a knowledge of where she lived. The text message in particular spooked her, and her local police department took it seriously. Officers drove past her house and around her neighborhood multiple times, she said.
While accustomed to mean tweets and abrasive letters to the editor, Heffernan said she was so unmoored by the backlash and the threats to her privacy and safety that she even hesitated when asked for her address - as a formality - in the process of filing her FBI report. "It was like, 'How do I know this is secure?' " she recalled.
In early March, New York Times technology and digital culture reporter Taylor Lorenz took note on Twitter of International Women's Day by urging her followers to support female journalists and raising concerns about the online harassment she and other women in the profession have experienced.
Carlson decided to devote a segment of his show to Lorenz's complaint - in particular highlighting her claim that online harassment had "destroyed" her life, which he mocked.
Days later, Lorenz shared on Twitter an email she had received in the aftermath of the show, repeatedly urging her to "kill yourself."
"It's not just mean tweets," said Lorenz's friend, video producer Sara Pearl Kenigsberg. "It's death threats. It's people trying to dox her, or figuring out where she lives or her family situation, or contacting and harassing her family. It's very scary." (Lorenz was not made available for an interview.)
The Times put out a statement defending Lorenz and accusing Carlson of engaging in a pattern of bad behavior toward journalists. "In a now familiar move, Tucker Carlson opened his show last night by attacking a journalist," the paper said. "It was a calculated and cruel tactic, which he regularly deploys to unleash a wave of harassment and vitriol at his intended target."
At the time, Fox responded to the Lorenz segment backlash by saying in a statement that "no public figure or journalist is immune from legitimate criticism of their reporting, claims or journalistic tactics." Asked to comment for this story, a Fox spokesperson pointed to this previous statement but did not offer further comment.
Carlson's allies, though, have countered such complaints by noting that the host, too, has been the subject of behavior he considers harassing, such as a boisterous protest outside his Washington home in November 2018 that he found threatening. A D.C. police investigation into the behavior of the protesters remains open, and no arrests have been made, a spokesperson said recently.
At the time, senior Fox executives decried the incident in a statement to The Washington Post. "The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable," they wrote, arguing that the nation has "become far too intolerant of different points of view" and calling for "the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation."
Among journalists who say they have been harassed following segments on Carlson's show, there is a reluctance to speak publicly about what happened for fear of inciting a new round of negative attention and hostility. One female journalist expressed fear of a "Tucker wave" of harassment if she were to be featured in this story.
Murray Carpenter and Tristan Spinski, two Maine-based journalists with relatively small online profiles, declined to comment for this story when asked about the harassment they received in July, after Carlson named them on his show and told his audience that they planned to reveal the location of his Maine home in a story for the Times.
At the time, both Carpenter and Spinski told Post media critic Erik Wemple that they were forced to call law enforcement. Spinski, a freelance photographer, appeared to get the worst of it - there was an attempted break-in at his house following the segment.
Beyond restating the publication's commitment to the safety of its employees, a Times spokesperson declined to comment for this article and said that "no one is available for an interview." Nearly a year later, no story based on their reporting on Carlson has yet appeared in the Times.
Organizations that call out Carlson risk entering into a never-ending back-and-forth with the host, who often laments efforts to "silence" him and turns criticisms of his show into the night's A-block of programming. After Carlson mocked the Times's statement on his March 10 show, reading it in a dramatic, sarcastic tone, above an on-screen graphic that read "New York Times Knows All About Actual Harassment," the newspaper chose not to respond.
Over time, those who have been criticized publicly by Carlson have attempted to make sense of why they ended up on his show. In addition to Zadrozny, Heffernan and Lorenz, Carlson has featured freelance journalists Talia Lavin and Kim Kelly in his programming.
"They single out these people as avatars of power, when usually they are not," Lavin said, and then turn them into "the faces of the culture war."
Kelly, who writes about labor issues, landed on Carlson's radar for a tweet of hers in 2019 expressing support for a 69-year-old activist who was killed by police when he launched an armed attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Washington state to protest Trump administration immigration policies. Kelly called the activist "heroic"; Carlson called her "sick," adding that "This country's laws cannot survive when powerful people endorse violence against those who enforce the laws. And a country can't survive when it's run by people who hate it."
Far from being a member of the "decadent rich," as he called her, Kelly says she was at the time "an unemployed freelancer from a rural working-class union family," writing an occasional column for the online publication Teen Vogue.
Carlson similarly portrayed Lorenz as a media power player, comparing her to Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Ridiculous, said her friend, Kenigsberg. "She doesn't manage people. She's not like this high-up, elitist person that they try to portray her to be."
April Ryan, a White House correspondent for the Grio, an online publication aimed at a Black audience, believes that Carlson has used her as a symbol as well, to generate heat from his audience and keep viewers tuned in. During a segment in October 2018, Carlson called Ryan a "dumb" person who made "racist attacks" against Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation process. In January of this year, Carlson accused Ryan of "[terrifying] American families, particularly American black families," about the prevalence of police brutality and violence after the shooting of Jacob Blake in August 2020.
"I am just a target that he wants to use to gin up his base and the base of Donald Trump in 2024," she said. "I've never targeted Tucker Carlson. I've never targeted him. I never said, 'Oh, go after this person.' They make personal attacks because they can't handle the truth."
Ryan said she confronted Carlson at the Politicon convention, where both spoke, a few years ago. She said she told him that "basically everything you do has put my life in jeopardy."
"Tucker Carlson Tonight" has been the top-rated show on Fox News for the past six months, averaging 4.3 million total viewers per month during that period. In February, Fox News management tapped Carlson to create "flagship" content for the network's subscription streaming service, Fox Nation, including a new streaming show called "Tucker Carlson Today," which debuted recently.
When the Anti-Defamation League urged Fox News to fire Carlson last Friday for saying in a segment that immigration serves to "dilute the political power" of Americans, the company refused. In a response letter to the organization, which works to combat antisemitism, Fox Corp. chief executive Lachlan Murdoch defended his host and argued that Carlson actually "decried and rejected replacement theory," despite what critics alleged.
It's all a little much for Heffernan, who said she tried to ignore Carlson's show before the segment on her in February, opting out of the daily discussion that takes place on Twitter about his nightly broadsides.
On March 26, Heffernan tweeted a photo of a letter that she received telling her to "get COVID and choke." The response was huge.
"It turns out that most people online, maybe disproportionately men, don't know what this sounds like or feels like at all and they're completely shocked," she said.

Texto completo: Brandy Zadrozny, a reporter for NBC News who covers online extremism, was working on a story last fall about the right-wing websites that had promoted conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden. One of her queries was to Darren Beattie, a former Donald Trump speechwriter who allegedly wrote for one of those sites.
But instead of answering her questions, Beattie lashed out at Zadrozny in a blog post calling her an "ideologically-motivated hit-man" with a practice of "targeting Trump supporters for doxing, censorship and harassment."
It might have remained a small, nasty online grudge. But Beattie soon got an opportunity to bring his views to a much-larger platform: that night's episode of Tucker Carlson's prime-time Fox News show, which was watched by more than 5.3 million people.
As a photo of Zadrozny took up a good chunk of the screen, Beattie described why he thought her reporting techniques were so malevolent. "She's up to no good," Beattie said. "She uses state-of-the-art, proprietary technical tools to dig up personal information about anonymous Trump supporters online. . . . basically, so she can ruin their lives."
This was a fundamental misinterpretation of Zadrozny's work, which has included reporting on individuals who discussed the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill insurrection in advance on fringe message boards, the origins of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, and a school shooter in New Mexico who participated in white supremacist Internet communities.
But Carlson expressed outrage. "Why would NBC News be doing something like this?" the most-watched man on cable news asked. "Why would they be going after anonymous Twitter users?"
"It really is disgusting," Beattie replied, likening Zadrozny to a "neo-Stasi," a reference to the East German secret police.
And then the threats against Zadrozny started pouring in. The threats got so bad, and so violent, and so specific, that Zadrozny required armed security for two weeks after the Carlson show segment.
The next day, NBC News released a statement accusing Carlson of "dangerously and dishonestly" targeting Zadrozny, saying that his employer, the Fox News Channel, had "shamefully encouraged harassment and worse."
Zadrozny, however, was hardly the only journalist to receive death threats after being called out by Carlson, a conservative pundit who recently dethroned Sean Hannity as the most-watched host on the most-watched cable news network.
Carlson cut his teeth jousting with the nation's top elected officials and brand-name pundits on CNN's "Crossfire" 20 years ago. But as his influence within the conservative media ecosystem has grown, with some calling for him to run for president in 2024, he has increasingly found fodder in criticizing lesser-known media figures whom he presents to his audience as symbols of liberalism run amok. And a subset of viewers are inspired to personally harass those journalists with threatening messages.
Los Angeles Times columnist Virginia Heffernan told The Post that she contacted local police and filed a report with the Federal Bureau of Investigation — mentioning Carlson by name — after a Feb. 8 segment on his show took aim at a column she published three days earlier.
Heffernan wrote a provocative — but "slightly satirical," she says — column sharing with readers her internal moral dilemma after her Trump-supporting next door neighbor plowed her driveway of snow. (It drew the ire of Jim Hoft of the far-right Gateway Pundit, who called her "hateful, humorless and intolerant.")
Carlson highlighted Heffernan on his show, sharing her photo with a chyron on the screen describing her as a "loathsome L.A. Times columnist."
"Have you noticed that the angriest people in America are the ones with absolutely no useful skills?" Carlson asked. "People like Virginia Heffernan. No useful skills. Does not do anything."
Heffernan said she received waves of harassing and threatening messages, including letters mailed to her home address and a text message to her phone from a sender indicating a knowledge of where she lived. The text message in particular spooked her, and her local police department took it seriously. Officers drove past her house and around her neighborhood multiple times, she said.

This record-breaking year for anti-transgender legislation would affect minors the most

Texto completo: Thirty-three states have introduced more than 100 bills that aim to curb the rights of transgender people across the country, with advocacy groups calling 2021 a record-breaking year for such legislation.  Many of these bills are rapidly making their way through state legislatures. On April 6, Arkansas became the first state to outlaw providing gender-affirming treatment to minors, a move that the American Civil Liberties Union said would "send a terrible and heartbreaking message" to transgender youth across the country.
According to data from the Human Rights Campaign, one of the nation's largest LGBTQ advocacy groups, at least 117 bills have been introduced in the current legislative session that target the transgender community. It's the highest number the organization has recorded since it began tracking anti-LGBTQ legislation more than 15 years ago.
The majority of bills would affect transgender youth, a group that researchers and medical professionals warn is already susceptible to high rates of suicide and depression.
Here's where these bills have been introduced, and the restrictions they seek to impose:
Bans on participation in same-gender youth sports
Thirty-one states have introduced bills that ban transgender athletes from participating in sports consistent with their gender identities. Three states -- Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee -- have already signed these bills into law this year. A similar 2020 law in Idaho was swiftly struck down in federal court.
In many states, lawmakers introducing these bills are supported by conservative legal groups, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom, which reportedly helped craft the Idaho law that was later struck down in court, according to the Idaho Press. The group released a statement praising Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. The Arkansas bill, named the "Fairness in Women's Sports Act," would prevent transgender girls and women from participating in school, intramural or club sports with their same-gender peers.
"I think that these exclusionary responses are a solution in search of a problem," said Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, interim director of GLSEN, an LGBTQ youth advocacy organization.
"There is no categorical dominance by trans athletes, but we do understand the categorical benefits for young people who play sports," she told CNN.
Lawmakers have said these bills are intended to be proactive, and to remove what they claim is an unfair advantage that transgender girls may have over their teammates. But such examples are extremely rare. In March, The Associated Press called two dozen state legislators who sponsored these bans, and found that few could name any cases where the participation of transgender athletes in youth sports had become a source of contention within the teams.
A version of the ban made its way to South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's desk in March, but Noem seemed to surprise both the LGBTQ community and conservative groups by vetoing the bill, calling it "overly broad." She sent it back to the legislature with changes that, among other things, intended to spare the state from potential economic blowback, but the bill later died in the legislative chambers.
However, days after her veto and amid intense criticism from conservative groups, Noem signed two executive orders on March 29 that would ban transgender girls and women from competing in women's sports at public high schools and colleges. But that move also prompted criticism from conservatives, who claim the executive orders are unenforceable.
Advocates hope that potential economic and political consequences could deter governors from enacting this year's wave of legislation. In 2016, North Carolina passed its so-called "bathroom bill," which meant that people at government-run facilities must use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to the sexes on their birth certificates. In practice, the law meant that many transgender and nonbinary people were unable to use restrooms in government buildings and felt unsafe to do so elsewhere in public. The bill's passage led to public outcry followed by business boycotts, and was repealed the next year.
Bans on gender-affirming health care for minors
Twenty states have introduced bills that prohibit or impede the administration of gender-affirming therapy to minors. One bill recently introduced in Alabama would make it a felony for medical providers to provide transition-related care to transgender minors.
HB 1570, named the "The Arkansas Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act (SAFE)," was originally vetoed by Gov. Asa Hutchinson after passing both chambers of the legislature, but the veto was overridden days later. It's the first bill in the US to become law that would prohibit health care professionals from administering gender-affirming care. The day the veto was overridden, the ACLU announced that the organization would sue to prevent the bill from being enacted. Currently, the bill is set to go into effect 90 days after the legislature adjourns, though it has not yet set a date for when it will do so.
Although these laws are framed as protecting children -- the legislation in Alabama, for example, is called the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act -- trans advocates and researchers believe they will do just the opposite. Pediatric groups have also protested these bills, saying that the treatment they provide to gender nonconforming or transgender youth can often be lifesaving.
Kerith Conron, research director at the UCLA Law Williams Institute, expressed concern about the implications for the mental health of trans adolescents in these states.
"Trans youth are dependent on parents, schools, institutions and pediatricians to support them, in living authentically and to access gender-affirming care -- and now on policy makers to facilitate or deny access to care," she told CNN. "It places trans youth in a precarious place."
Based on the Williams Institute's estimates of where trans adolescents live in the United States, Conron said approximately 1 in 4 could be affected by the current active bills if they were to become law.
"These laws are not grounded in science or majority medical opinion and have strong implications for the survival of trans youth in these states ...  and for long-term quality of life for those who make it through adolescence," she added.
There is a growing body of research that supports access to gender-affirming care in adolescence. A 2020 study by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that access to pubertal suppression treatment was associated with lower odds of long-term and consistent suicidal thoughts among transgender adults, a finding similar to studies done by the Williams Institute, Cornell University and other institutions.
Curriculum bans, ID restrictions and other legislation
Several states have introduced other anti-trans bills that target education, ID restrictions and more.
One Iowa bill requires that parents give written consent for teachers to discuss gender identity while their children are present in the classroom, and another stipulates that any curriculum that includes gender identity must include "the potential harm and adverse outcomes of social and medical gender interventions." A bill in Arkansas says that educators must refer to students only by their "biological sex," a disputed term that refers to the sex as listed on students' original birth certificates. Medical experts say one's biological sex should not be used to challenge people's own assertions about their gender identities.
Aiden Cloud, an 18-year-old transgender student in Tennessee, says that restricting exposure to LGBTQ education may further harm the trans community.
"The students who need to be taught about LGBTQ issues the most are also the students whose parents are going to opt them out of this," they told CNN. "The students who really need to be learning these things and unlearning certain biases wouldn't be able to."
Tennessee's legislature is currently debating HB 529, which would allow parents to opt their children out of curriculums that discuss LGBTQ issues, and HB 800, which would prohibit educators from discussing LGBTQ issues in the classroom.
Arizona, Montana and South Dakota have introduced bills that restrict ID cards and other forms of documentation from reflecting a person's gender identity. Iowa has introduced a bill that removes gender identity as a protected class under the Iowa civil rights act.
What's next for these bills?
While many of these bills have already died in the committee stage, the trans community -- and trans youth in particular -- may still feel the mental toll of seeing the bills make progress in their states.
"It's super demoralizing to see these things going through the state and getting passed," said Cloud, who is also a member of GLSEN's SHINE team of youth organizers in Tennessee.
"I've read some of [these bills] and it's so depressing that people still think of me this way in 2021. It's really demoralizing that people still believe these things and think it's OK to just go after the LGBTQ community without knowing anything about us."
These bills are also in opposition to the Biden administration's position on transgender rights. On March 31, President Joe Biden issued the first-ever federal proclamation of its kind for this year's International Transgender Day of Visibility. On the same day, the Pentagon issued new policies to allow transgender Americans to serve openly in the military, reversing the Trump administration's ban. Biden campaigned on prioritizing issues facing LGBTQ youth and has issued several executive actions intended to advance LGBTQ rights.
Advocates say that a strong response at the federal level is needed to counteract these bills, which create a patchwork of legislation across states for the trans community to navigate.
The Equality Act, which was introduced to Congress in February, would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to explicitly include gender identity and sexual orientation as protected classes. The bill passed in the House, but its fate in the Senate remains unclear.
In the meantime, Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, said she hoped that lawmakers realize the potential damage that passing these bills could create.
"In a year where we've been isolated from each other, where children in particular have had a difficult time, isolating them further in this moment is an unconscionable choice," she said in a news conference on March 24.

Texto completo: - The most beautiful McDonald's in the US is located on Long Island inside a 19th-century mansion.
- The location is a historical landmark that has been a home and a few other restaurants.
- Today it has some details reminiscent of its glamorous past but it's still just a fast-food chain.
* Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
The most beautiful McDonald's in America is a pristine white mansion nestled alongside auto shops and warehouses.
Located in New Hyde Park in Long Island's Nassau County, the 19th-century Georgian-style mansion is more than a fast-food franchise - it's also a historical landmark.
Keep reading to learn more about the famous McDonald's location and see what it's like visiting it today.
The building started as a home of a locally prominent family before housing different restaurants
Historians say the house, built in 1795, was home to the family of Joseph Denton, a descendent of one of the founders of the town of Hempstead.
The Denton family owned a farm on several thousands of acres of what is now New Hyde Park, one of Hempstead's villages.
Denton's family lived in the house for generations, but much of the property left the family's hands around World War II.
The home was then transformed into a few different restaurants - most recently one called Dallas Ribs - until McDonald's bought it in 1986.
In 1986, McDonald's bought the run-down Denton house and property for $1 million
At this point, the Denton house was damaged and boarded up, so McDonald's planned to raze the building and build a standard fast-food location.
That prompted a community outcry, and concerned neighbors fought for years to save the house, one of the oldest buildings standing in the area and one of few historical buildings left.
In 1988 the site was designated a historic landmark, which persuaded McDonald's to pursue restoration.
The company had previously done a similar project in 1984 when it built a restaurant in a historical landmark in Freeport, Maine, which allowed the chain to move in provided it retained the small seaside town's aesthetic. Complete with fireplaces and mahogany booths, that 170-year-old colonial mansion still houses the Maine town's only McDonald's today.
The town eventually approved of the restaurant with a few conditions, and the location opened in 1991
McDonald's was determined to get this location under its belt because there were no similar restaurants in the area. It eventually agreed to a multimillion-dollar restoration plan and to neighbors' conditions to prevent noise and smells.
In 1991, its opening marked the world's 12,000th McDonald's and the only one in the US in a wholly restored building.
"When we took over this building, it was a disaster, a real eyesore," said McDonald's New York regional vice president at the time. "There were pigeons all over. We had to gut the building, take it down to the rafters."
On opening weekend, The New York Times reported that traffic backed up Jericho Turnpike as dozens of cars tried to enter the jammed parking lot.
The surrounding town eventually came to appreciate the McDonald's as a local landmark. And one local auto-body shop owner told Newsday in 1998 that his property value increased by 30% after the eatery opened.
Today, the exterior of the building is generally the same as when it first opened 30 years ago
The McDonald's looks peaceful and beautiful, but it's still along the busy Jericho Turnpike, where the traffic never seems to stop. It looks like a piece of history transplanted in an otherwise metropolitan strip of Long Island.
Looking closely, the building still has distinctive gingerbread ornamentation, which was added around the 1860s when it was converted to a Georgian-style mansion. McDonald's restored the ornate external trim from the original templates.
The building doesn't seem to have changed much over the past few decades, which isn't surprising.
As a historical landmark, the franchise is barred from making significant changes to the building. But the shutters' original sea-green shade was replaced with black at some point.
The front exterior was restored to match a 1920s photograph of the house before it became a restaurant. That photo still hangs inside the restaurant, next to the cash registers.
The vestibule at the main entrance features some minimalist window designs and two black, high-backed wooden benches. It resembles a farmhouse-style restaurant, not a fast-food chain.
The entrance has a spiffy welcome sign and an imposing double staircase that leads to a second-floor gallery
When the restaurant first opened, the decor was a blend of both old and new elements, with wood and tile floors and floral wallpaper similar to what was in the house in the 1920s.
Today, the floors are ordinary hardwood and the wall colors are a nondescript palette of sage, slate, and greige. The double staircase is still quite grand, though.
Historical photos of other area businesses from the late 1800s and early 1900s hang beside the main entrance
The photos give a sense of how much this spot has changed in the past 150 years and adds to the historical mood of the place.
Walking around, I was struck by how upscale this McDonald's felt - the color palette, light fixtures, and furniture could have come straight from an industrial-chic café or coffee shop.
It was also spotless, perhaps because the dining areas were still closed to the guests amid a pandemic.
I could easily imagine how certain spaces in the restaurant were previously used - this area, for instance, might have been a reading or breakfast nook in a past life.
On a wing farthest from the kitchen is the original circular portico, now enclosed in glass
The house underwent many changes over the years, but it's believed that the portico, a structure with a roof supported by columns, and the front screened porch on the opposite side (now closed up, where the kitchen is) are original features.
To me, the portico is one of the eatery's most memorable features, the one that seems least like a typical McDonald's.
The abundance of natural light also creates a lovely ambiance for dining. Unfortunately, the view overlooks the parking lot and the towing shop across the street.
It's hard to believe that newlyweds had their wedding pictures taken here at some point. In fact, when this location first opened, the franchise owner told The New York Times that he wanted the "historic treasure" to be considered "upscale."
"I eventually want to put tablecloths and little battery-operated candles on the tables on Friday and Saturday nights," he said, "so young people can come here on dates."
I ate a meal here before the coronavirus pandemic. It was delightful and, if you could ignore the drive-thru line below, almost peaceful.
The floor-to-ceiling windows don't provide the best view today, but this must have been mostly farmland some hundred years earlier. Back then, this was probably a nice date-night spot with a great view.
I wished I could have sat in a rocking chair on the open portico with a jar of lemonade. Today, I can see why the area is closed off - the glass serves as a divider between the dining area and the sounds of cars and the smell of exhaust.
The main dining area opens up into a high cathedral ceiling with wooden rafters
These ceilings in the main dining area definitely provided a "whoa" moment for me, when I again couldn't believe this was a McDonald's and not a hip restaurant built in a former barn.
Upstairs, on the second-floor mezzanine, you can get a closer look at the ceiling, which used to house an attic and nods to the building's provenance as a farmstead.
These second-floor spaces are more tranquil, farther away from the bustling kitchen and cashier.
One room even used to have an old-fashioned soda fountain
When the franchise first opened, a dining area on the second floor was done up as an old-fashioned soda fountain, complete with a star-studded blue ceiling nook overhead with Ronald McDonald and Mac Tonight (a character with a giant crescent moon for a head) reclining inside.
Today only the counter with stools hints at this area's former glory.
The kitchen and cashier area still feels like a standard McDonald's
Around 2017, this location and 359 others underwent a $6 billion modernization aimed at transforming the customer experience.
McDonald's added new furniture and decor, self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, and remodeled counters.
The cashier area looks like a typical McDonald's, complete with digital menus, two touchscreen kiosks, and a soda fountain.
Overall, the food here is the same as it is at any other McDonald's, but the experience just feels special
The location was not allowing indoor dining at the time I visited in order to comply with safety guidelines amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
But even as I left, I noticed beautiful details surrounding the door.
This Denton House location didn't have any special menu items, but I was able to order the chain's fairly new crispy chicken sandwich. It was crispy and tender and featured Southern-style fried chicken on a potato roll.
I also had spicy McNuggets and a Shamrock Shake, a seasonal, creamy offering in honor of St. Patrick's Day that tastes of mint and vanilla.
This McDonald's location feels pretty glamorous, even though it's surrounded by hustle and bustle and serves the same old quarter-pounders you can find at any location.
When the location first opened in 1991, the Newsday restaurant critic Joan Reminick praised the "dandy architectural details" and history of the building but noted the food was "exactly the same" as it is at any other McDonald's.
Still, the critic mused about how the quarter-pounder with cheese was a "potent memory-trigger" that brought her back to the many times she and her family stopped at the chain for a quick bite.
"Perhaps my next Interstate burger will transport me to a cathedral-ceilinged room with brass sconces and period-reproduction floral wallpaper," she wrote.
Maybe my next burger will transport me to this beautiful McDonald's that's unfortunately surrounded by not-so-glamorous drive-thrus and industrial buildings.

Texto completo: Millions of Americans have been vaccinated against Covid-19, and more are getting vaccinated every day. But that doesn't mean the US can let its guard down, health officials say.
More than 100 million people in the United States have received at least one dose, according to a tweet from Dr. Cyrus Shahpar, the White House's Covid-19 data director. Almost 4 million doses have been administered since Thursday, marking a record-high seven-day average of nearly 3 million doses per day, Shahpar said.
Almost 40% of American adults have received at least one dose, with more than 1 in 5 adults fully vaccinated, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in Friday's White House Covid-19 briefing.
But she still has her concerns, she said.
"We are at 64,000 new Covid cases today and our numbers continue to increase," Walensky said. "I still continue to worry that with 80% of the population unvaccinated, that we have a lot of work to do to control this pandemic."
Walensky urged Americans to continue using the "mitigation strategies we know work," like wearing masks and keeping a social distance.
"Getting more people vaccinated as quickly as possible and taking prevention measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 is the path out of this pandemic and back to our everyday activities," Walensky said.
White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients echoed that sentiment, telling reporters, "We are working to put this pandemic behind us as fast as we can, but we're not there yet. So we need everyone to do their part."
In a news conference Friday, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said cases were rising in the state and warned residents to stay vigilant.
"I know we're all fed up with a pandemic, physical distancing and mask wearing, but we are in the last few miles of the marathon," Brown said. "We have come so far, run so hard and we are close to the finish line. Don't let the vaccines and the sunny spring weather give us a false sense that we're in the clear, because we're not."
CDC: Travel is low risk if vaccinated
You have yet another reason to get vaccinated.
In new guidance Friday, the CDC said people who are fully vaccinated can travel at low risk to themselves, though nonessential travel is still not recommended.
So long as coronavirus precautions are taken -- including wearing masks -- fully vaccinated people can travel within the United States without first getting tested or quarantining afterward.
Fully vaccinated people traveling internationally do not need a Covid-19 test beforehand unless required by the destination, the CDC said. And they do not need to self-quarantine upon return to the US.
Travelers should have a negative Covid-19 test before boarding a flight back to the US, the CDC noted, and a follow-up test three to five days after their return.
According to the CDC, an individual is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of a Covid-19 vaccine -- whether that be the second dose of vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, or the single dose required by Johnson & Johnson.
Anyone not fully vaccinated should continue to avoid travel, the CDC advised. If they must travel, they should get tested one to three days before and again three to five days after. They should also self-quarantine at home for seven days, or 10 if they did not get tested post-travel.
Additionally, all Americans should wear a mask and practice public health measures when traveling, regardless of their vaccination status.
The agency will continue to update its guidance as needed, Walensky said Friday, adding the "science on Covid-19 is constantly evolving."
"With so many people still unvaccinated, it is important that everyone -- regardless of vaccination status -- continue to take prevention measures in public and adhere to our guidance on ways to reduce the spread of Covid-19," Walensky said. "Wear a mask, socially distance, avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and wash your hands frequently."
Vaccinations now can prevent future Covid-19 variants, surgeon general says
High on the list of factors worrying experts is the spread of coronavirus variants in the US.
Michigan on Thursday said it identified its first case of a variant that was originally found in Brazil, adding to reports of variants spreading across the US. That spread, along with relaxation of social distancing and mask mandates in many states, contributed to an influential model increasing its prediction of the number of people who will die of the virus by July 1.
According to US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, while Covid-19 vaccines appear to provide protection against the identified variants of the coronavirus, vaccination is also important to prevent viral mutation in the future.
"The good news is that the vaccines that we have to date have proven to be both safe and effective, including against the variants," Murthy told MSNBC on Friday. "Our concern is that in the future, some of those variants may be much more resistant to protection from a vaccine."
He described the current situation in the US as a race between vaccines and variants. The potential development of coronavirus variants is a motivating factor to further increase vaccination rates, Murthy said.
"The more quickly we get people vaccinated, the more we'll be able to lower the overall amount of infection in our community," he said.
"When that infection is high, there are more chances for the virus to replicate, to mutate and lead to these variants."
Pfizer vaccine protects for at least 6 months, but could last years
The protection offered by the Pfizer/BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine remains high for at least six months, the companies said Thursday -- but that's "the floor, definitely not the ceiling," according to Wen.
"Most likely the protection that the vaccine will provide will be years even," she said. "But we just don't know that."
Wen added there was a possibility people may need a booster shot. "But I think that's a small price to pay now that we have these safe and very effective vaccines that are out there."
The protection from those vaccines will soon be available to many more people as states expand their eligibility. Zients, the White House coronavirus coordinator, said Friday that about 90% of adults across the US will be eligible for vaccination by April 19.
West Virginians 16 and older are now eligible to receive a vaccine, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday -- just as active cases in the state have been increasing. Justice said the state had 6,642 active cases, with 420 new positive cases reported in the last 24 hours.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday announced all individuals 16 years and older will be allowed to get a Covid-19 vaccine beginning April 5. The state had initially said it was aiming for May 1 as the target date to have all eligible residents able to receive a shot.
"Truly, this vaccine is our ticket back to normal life," Ivey said in a news release. "We are so close to getting COVID-19 in the rearview, and until then, we should all keep wearing our masks, get vaccinated and use the common sense the good Lord gave us."
California to allow indoor gatherings and events
As the number of new infections in California fall, the state will allow indoor gatherings and private events, like weddings and conferences, with limitations, starting April 15, state health officials said on Friday.
Venues can have fully vaccinated sections without social distancing, but masks will still be required, California Department of Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás J. Aragón said. Other sections must continue to maintain the 6-feet social distancing requirement.
Attendees will have to go through a self-verification process, Dr. Aragón said, like bringing their Covid-19 vaccination card or showing negative test results within 72 hours of the event.
Venue capacity will be determined by the Covid-19 risk category an area is in. A capacity of up to 200 people will be allowed in the areas in the lowest-risk category, or tier, while the limit will be 100 for the next-to-highest tier.
"Today's update to the Blueprint for a Safer Economy is a result of the progress we are making both in vaccinations and in controlling the spread of Covid-19," said Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of California's Health and Human Services Agency, in a statement.
CNN's Melissa Alonso, Maggie Fox, Deidre McPhillips, Ryan Prior, Rebekah Riess, Melanie Schuman, Anna Sturla and Sarah Moon contributed to this report.

Michelle Goldberg: The social justice purge at Idaho colleges

Texto completo: Last month, I wrote that right-wing legislatures trying to ban critical race theory from public schools and institutions were a far more direct threat to free speech than what’s often called cancel culture.
Some opponents of critical race theory responded that these bans aren’t meant to prohibit teaching about critical race theory; that they are, rather, meant to protect individuals, especially children, from coerced speech and indoctrination.
“CRT’s critics aren’t arguing that no one has the right to talk and write about CRT (particularly among adults on college campuses); they are resisting the implication that CRT is a settled and acceptable dogma,” Christine Rosen wrote in Commentary. “They also take issue with the way this theory is being imposed on schoolchildren, many of whom have been forced to denounce immutable parts of themselves, such as their skin color and sex, in CRT struggle sessions.”
I’m willing to concede at least part of what Rosen is saying. I don’t like struggle sessions; I think critical race theory as it developed in the academy is intellectually rich, but some of the ways it’s been adapted by workplace diversity trainers and education consultants seem risible. Rosen referred to a Nevada lawsuit by a Black woman who accused a charter school of making life miserable for her mixed-race son because he rejected certain ideas about privilege and oppression; if the details in it are true, he was seriously mistreated.
The right-wing caricature of progressive public schools as pampered reeducation camps is extremely far from my own family’s experience, but if any kids are being bullied and shamed for refusing to espouse social justice principles, even principles I agree with, that’s wrong.
However, the claim that the right’s war on critical race theory doesn’t threaten academic freedom is also wrong. Consider what just happened in Idaho, where last week Boise State University suspended dozens of classes, online and in person, dealing with different aspects of diversity. This week, they were reinstated, but online only and “asynchronously,” without any live discussions.
These suspensions happened the day before the Idaho Senate voted to cut $409,000 from the school’s budget, an amount meant to reflect what Boise State spends on social justice programs. The budget bill also banned state colleges and universities from using any appropriated funds to “support social justice ideology student activities, clubs, events and organizations on campus,” and requires schools to report all social justice spending to the Legislature. The Idaho Statesman quoted one lawmaker saying of schools, “They’re going to get the message.”
Some of the facts behind the class suspensions are unclear. In an email to the campus, university leaders described “a series of concerns, culminating in allegations that a student or students have been humiliated and degraded in class on our campus for their beliefs and values.” An English professor at the university tweeted that the allegation concerned a taped Zoom discussion of white privilege that had been handed over to the Legislature, but so far it hasn’t emerged publicly. (The tweets have since been deleted.)
It’s obviously impossible to evaluate the allegations without knowing what they are. If a student was humiliated, that’s serious and should be addressed. But it’s hard to see how whatever happened implicated 52 different classes, and the political pressure the university is under is undeniable.
The $409,000 taken from Boise State’s budget was a compromise; other conservative lawmakers wanted to cut far more. Ron Nate, a member of Idaho’s House of Representatives, this month called for millions of dollars in cuts to education funding targeting “social justice programming and critical race theory.” At a January hearing, he subjected Boise State University’s president, Marlene Tromp, to McCarthyite questioning over statements that some of the school’s departments issued supporting Black Lives Matter.
“Does BSU plan to continue diverting university resources to this Marxist cause and encouraging students to consume more BLM content?” he asked. He told her that her school’s funding was in jeopardy: “Many legislators, frustrated with BSU, want to defund the social justice agenda by reducing higher education spending.”
What’s happening in Idaho is not unique. All over the country, state legislators are trying to curtail teaching about racism and sexism, in universities as well as elementary schools.
“We’ve seen a spate of these bills across the country, and some of them are more concerning than others,” said Adam Steinbaugh of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a group devoted to academic freedom. “It’s comparable, I think, to what happened in Hungary, where the government there cracked down on, or banished essentially, the teaching of gender studies.”
Crusading against a relatively obscure academic discipline, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary turned it into a proxy for modernity itself.
“Integral to almost all the attacks is the implication that gender studies itself is not an academic discipline, but something larger and more mendacious,” Eliza Apperly wrote in The Atlantic. Relatively powerless academics were demonized as dangerous subversives.
There’s a similar inversion in the campaign against critical race theory. The right likes to pretend that social justice-inflected academic disciplines are full of ideological commissars browbeating conservative students. But particularly in conservative places like Idaho, it’s the professors, many of them untenured, who feel intimidated.
“With the climate as it is, I wouldn’t doubt that folks are starting to look over their shoulder,” said Melissa Wintrow, who served as director of the women’s center at Boise State before becoming a state senator.
When it comes to the campaign against critical race theory, the fear is part of the point.

The last time Republicans in South Dakota made a serious push to bar transgender girls from school sports, in 2019, their bill was known only by its nondescript numerical title, Senate Bill 49. Its two main sponsors were men. And it died without ever getting out of committee, just 10 days after it was introduced.
But when Republicans decided to try again in January, they were far more strategic in their approach. The sponsors this time were two women who modeled their bill after a template provided by a conservative legal organization. They gave the bill a name that suggested noble intent: the “act to promote continued fairness in women’s sports.” Supporters from Minnesota and Idaho traveled to the Capitol in Pierre to testify that a new law was urgently needed to keep anyone with male biological characteristics out of female competitions, even though they acknowledged only a handful of examples of that happening in South Dakota.
“These efforts appear to be far more slick and far more organized,” said Elizabeth A. Skarin of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, which opposes the bill. “Anytime they give a bill a name in South Dakota,” she added, “you know something’s up.”
Then things took an unexpected turn. Gov. Kristi Noem, who is seen as a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, demanded changes to the bill. The response was swift and harsh: Social conservative activists and Republican lawmakers accused Noem of bowing to pressure from business and athletics organizations, which have been successful at stopping laws in other states that single out transgender people for exclusion and feed ugly stereotypes. On Monday, the Legislature rejected her changes, setting up a showdown that could drag out for several days.
South Dakota is just one of a growing number of states where Republicans are diving into a culture war clash that seems to have come out of nowhere. It has been brought about by a coordinated and poll-tested campaign by social conservative organizations like the American Principles Project and Concerned Women for America, which they say are determined to move forward with what may be one of their last footholds in the fight against expanding LGBTQ rights.
Three other states have passed bills this month that resemble South Dakota’s. In Mississippi and Arkansas, they are set to become law this summer. And similar bills have been introduced by Republicans in two dozen other states, including North Carolina, where an unpopular “bathroom bill” enacted in 2016 prompted costly boycotts and led conservatives nationwide to pull back on efforts to restrict rights for transgender people.
“You make change in our society by making laws, and luckily we have some great states that have stepped up,” said Beth Stelzer, the founder of a new organization, Save Women’s Sports, that she said opposes “demolishing women’s sports for the sake of feelings.”
Stelzer, an amateur power lifter who was in North Carolina this week for the bill introduction, has also testified in support of new laws in South Dakota, Montana and Arkansas.
But the idea that there is a sudden influx of transgender competitors who are dominating women’s and girls’ sports does not reflect reality — in high school, college or professionally. Sports associations like the NCAA, which has promoted the inclusion of transgender athletes, have policies in place to address concerns about physical differences in male and female biology. The NCAA requires athletes who are transitioning to female to be on testosterone suppression treatment for a year before they can compete on a women’s team.
Stelzer, who competes in a weight lifting league that does not allow transgender women to participate, said the point is to get ahead of what she and other activists believe will become a bigger issue.
“We’re nipping it in the bud,” she said.
In high school sports, policies vary widely. Some states pose no barriers to transgender athletes; some have policies similar to those of the NCAA and others have outright bans or demand that students verify their sex if questioned.
Rarely has an issue that so few people encounter — and one that public opinion analysts have only recently begun to study in depth — become a political and cultural flash point so quickly. The lack of awareness creates an environment in which the real impact of transgender participation in sports can be overshadowed by hyperbole.
But the debate also raises questions — that ethicists, lawmakers and the courts are only beginning to address — about whether the decadeslong effort to give women and girls equal opportunities in sports is compatible with efforts to give transgender people equal opportunities in life. A lawsuit in federal court in Connecticut brought by three high school runners who lost in competition against transgender girls will be among the first to test how nondiscrimination laws apply.
A mix of factors has helped social conservatives breathe new life into the issue: activists who agreed to give up on unpopular bills regulating public bathrooms; an awareness that women, not men, could be more persuasive and sympathetic advocates; a new Democratic administration that quickly moved to broaden and restore rights for transgender people that the Trump administration had eliminated; and a political and media culture on the right that often reduces the nuanced issue of gender identity to a punchline about political correctness.
Activists who have been fighting the anti-transgender efforts say the focus on school athletics is creating a false and misplaced perception of victimization.
“There’s a sense that there’s a victim of transness,” said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the ACLU, which was successful in temporarily blocking the implementation of a transgender athlete ban in Idaho last year.
In fact, studies have shown that the majority of transgender students report feeling unsafe at school.
“What we have is a speculative fear of something that hasn’t materialized,” Strangio, who is a transgender man, added. “They’re acting like LeBron James is going to put on a wig and play basketball with fourth graders. And not one LeBron James, 100. In reality, you’re talking about little kids who just want to play rec sports. They just want to get through life.”
But the isolated instances that have been filmed or generated headlines — female weight lifting records being broken by a new transgender competitor, for example — make for viral content, bolstered by media personalities with huge followings like Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan.
The issue is much more widely covered in conservative media — and often presented with a heavy dose of sarcasm. According to a review of social media content conducted for The New York Times by Media Matters, a left-leaning watchdog, seven of the 10 most popular stories about the proposed laws targeting transgender people so far this year were from the Daily Wire, a website founded by Shapiro. Two others were from Fox News. Combined, the articles were read, shared and commented on 6 million times, Media Matters said.
The heightened media awareness on the right is due in part to how social conservative activists have improved at packaging transgender-specific restrictions. Borrowing a page from the anti-abortion movement, which was led by men for much of its early period, they have begun featuring women as public advocates.
In Arkansas, where the governor signed the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act” into law last week, the leading proponents were the attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, who is a candidate for governor, and the Arkansas Republican Women’s Caucus. The bill will prohibit transgender participation on female teams from kindergarten through college.
In many instances, lawmakers have worked closely with groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that has argued several Supreme Court cases on behalf of people claiming discrimination because of their traditional beliefs about marriage and gender roles.
In the ongoing case in Idaho, opponents of the law argued that it was exclusionary, discriminatory and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing two female college runners who said they had “deflating experiences” after losing to a transgender woman, agreed that the case was about equality, but in the context of creating “a level playing field,” said Kristen Waggoner, the group’s general counsel. “When the law ignores the legitimate differences that exist between men and women, it creates chaos,” she added.
Limiting the rights of transgender people is an issue that has resonance with an increasingly small share of the overall population. A new study by the Public Religion Research Institute reported that only 7% of Americans are “completely against” pro-LGBTQ policies. But it is a vocal group intent on showing that it can flex its power in the Republican Party.
When Noem sent the bill back to the South Dakota Legislature on March 19, despite having said on Twitter that she was “excited to sign this bill very soon,” social conservative organizations went on the attack, taking aim at her apparent presidential ambitions.
“It’s no secret that Gov. Noem has national aspirations, so it’s time she hears from a national audience,” the Family Policy Alliance, an affiliate of Focus on the Family, wrote in an email to supporters.
Noem appeared to be aware of how damaging it could be to have conservatives think she was on the wrong side of the issue.
On Thursday, she and her advisers joined a hastily arranged conference call with members of the Conservative Action Project, which includes leaders of the largest right-wing groups in the country. Noem expressed concern that if she signed the law, the NCAA would retaliate against South Dakota, as it did with North Carolina, by refusing to hold tournaments there, according to one person on the call.
The activists were respectful but clear, this person said: This was not what they expected from the conservative firebrand they had come to admire so much.

Transgender rights in the spotlight as Arkansas and Tennessee become latest states to pass anti-trans legislation

Texto completo: LGBTQ advocates are warning that the influx of anti-transgender legislation being proposed in many states will harm trans and nonbinary youth.
Twenty-eight states are considering anti-trans bills, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The bills put forth this year predominantly fall into two categories: removing trans girls' ability to participate in girls' sports, and restricting young trans peoples' access to gender-affirming health care.
While many of them may not become law, bills in three states -- Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas -- have already been passed and signed by state governors this month.
"This has been a significant part of my work at the ACLU for the past six years and I've never seen anything like this," said Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the ACLU. "There have never been this many bills targeting trans youth voted out of committee and then making it to the floor."
Three states recently signed anti-trans sports bills into law
Over 60 anti-trans bills are being considered across the country, according to the ACLU. LGBTQ advocates, including Strangio, are concerned that the proposed laws will harm trans athletes, and make it easier to limit trans people's access to health care.
"There have been many existential threats to trans existence, but there's something uniquely dangerous about what's going on right at this moment with the combination of the sports bills and the health care bills," Strangio told CNN. "I think the impulse underlying both is to try to establish governmental policy that it's harmful to be trans."
Much of the legislation that is pending or has been adopted restricts athletes' participation in public school sports to the gender that matches the sex that athletes were assigned at birth. But it's not possible to know a person's gender identity at birth, and ​for some people, the sex listed on their original birth certificate is a misleading way of describing the body they have.
While sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person's gender is an innate sense of identity. The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a person's birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories. For this reason, the language of "biological sex," as used in this legislation, can be overly simplistic and misleading.
Last year, Idaho passed a bill banning trans girls' participation in sports -- but the law was blocked by a federal judge over the summer.
"The State has not identified a legitimate interest served by the Act that the preexisting rules in Idaho did not already address, other than an invalid interest of excluding transgender women and girls from women's sports entirely, regardless of their physiological characteristics," Judge David Nye wrote in August of 2020.
This year, however, other states have introduced similar legislation more successfully.
Transgender girls and women in Mississippi's public schools and colleges will no longer be allowed to compete in women's sports after the state's Republican governor on March 11 signed the first statewide anti-trans law of 2021.
"This important piece of legislation will ensure that young girls in Mississippi have a fair, level playing field in public schools," Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said during the signing event, even though Mississippi's trans girls would see some of their rights taken away by the new law.
More recently, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed an ​anti-trans sports bill into law requiring students to prove their ​assigned sex at birth​, and compete as part of teams of the corresponding gender, in order to play in middle and high school sports.
The bill states that "a student's gender for purposes of participation in a public middle school or high school interscholastic athletic activity or event be determined by the student's sex at the time of the student's birth, as indicated on the student's original birth certificate."
Students must show proof of ​the sex they were assigned at birth if their birth certificate does not appear to be the original or does not indicate the student's ​assigned sex at the time of birth. This does not apply to students in kindergarten through fourth grade, the Tennessee bill says.
Also last week, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed the "Fairness in Women's Sports Act," which bans trans girls and women from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.
According to the law, Arkansas aims to divide school sports according to the sex listed on students' birth certificates rather than gender identity.
It applies to all sports sponsored by public schools beginning from the elementary level and up through college. Private schools will be held to the same standard if they compete against a public school.
"This law simply says that female athletes should not have to compete in a sport against a student of the male sex when the sport is designed for women's competition," Hutchinson, denying that trans women are women, said in a statement after signing the measure into law.
Advocates warn trans health care could also be at risk
Though only legislation around sports bans have been codified into law so far this year, trans advocates warn that legislation targeting access to health care is approaching passage in some states.
On Monday, the Arkansas Senate voted 28-7 to approve will the Arkansas Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act, a measure that would prevent gender transition "procedures" for trans people under age 18.
The bill makes what it calls an "exception" for some intersex people with unspecified chromosomal makeup and hormone production, and those with difficulties resulting from previous gender-affirming treatments.
For young people experiencing gender dysphoria -- a diagnosis that includes ​the significant distress that can result from identifying as a gender different than ​one's sex assigned at birth -- this would mean not being able to access puberty-blockers, a treatment option for transgender youth that is used to prevent the onset of puberty.
The treatment ​sometimes gives young people ​temporary relief from the symptoms of gender dysphoria, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
The Arkansas SAFE Act would also ban ​so-called "cross-hormone therapy,​" a gender-affirming treatment that allows for trans people to ​change their physical appearance to be more consistent with their gender identity.
Arkansas State Rep. Robin Lundstrum, who proposed the Arkansas SAFE ACT, has ​made comments that contradict the science of gender identity, and falsely positioning trans and nonbinary identities as a "choice."
"Those kids are precious. Some of them may choose to be transgender when they're older. That's okay, that's their choice," Lundstrum said during a House panel prior to passing the bill​, as an explanation for why he supports denying them life-saving medical care. "But when they're under 18, they need to grow up first. That's a big decision, there's no going back."
A dozen states have bills similar to the Arkansas SAFE Act, according to the ACLU's anti-trans bill tracker.
Some conservative, anti-trans groups, like the Family Policy Alliance and Heritage Foundation, said they back measures like the Arkansas SAFE Act and other similar proposals.
"The psychological aspect of the treatment of gender dysphoria needs to be thoroughly investigated and debated," Emilie Kao, director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion & Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, told CNN, despite extensive published research from medical experts on this topic.
"Because the most authoritative studies of those people with gender dysphoria who have gone through surgical intervention show that there is an increase in the level of suicidal ideation after going through surgeries," said Kao, citing a 2011 Swedish study ​that is frequently cited by those who seek to undermine trans rights and gender affirming health care. ​
The study's lead author, Cecilia Dhejne, has since said in an interview with The Trans Advocate that her study's findings have been widely misinterpreted, and "studies thereafter show that medical gender confirming interventions reduces gender dysphoria."
But other groups, like the American Psychiatric Association and The American Academy of Pediatrics, have come out against the health care bans.
The proposed bills contradict medical guidelines from several associations, including the Endocrine Society, which recommends that trans youth work with mental health professionals and doctors to seek appropriate treatment, including puberty blockers.
Trans advocates and experts argue that these bills do anything but protect young trans people.
"Affirming health care can literally be life or death for anyone, but particularly for trans youth," Raquel Willis, a Black trans activist and writer, told CNN. "People think that's an exaggeration. It's not. People think you can just discipline identity out of someone and that is not true and in many ways is torture."
Transgender youth have a much greater risk of suicide, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, if they have access to a puberty blocker, their chances of suicide and mental health problems in the immediate term and down the road decline significantly, a study published in January of 2020 found.
"All existing studies show that regret following gender-affirming medical care is rare," Dr. Jack Turban, a fellow in child and adolescent psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, who researches the mental health of transgender youth explained, "existing medical guidelines recommend against gender-affirming genital surgeries for minors."
He said the psychological effects of gender dysphoria can be harmful to young trans peoples' bodies.
"We have seen patients with rib fractures from being so dysphoric towards their developing chests that they tightly bind their chests with tape or ace bandages, adolescents who required surgery because their intestines were damaged from not going to the bathroom due to genital dysphoria, and countless patients who had mental health crises related to pubertal progression," Turban said.
"Our recent study in the journal Pediatrics found that those who access pubertal suppression during adolescence have lower odds of considering suicide than those who aren't able to access this intervention. In contrast, our research shows that attempts to force transgender people to be cisgender result in greater odds of suicide attempts."
Clarification: This story has been updated to provide additional explanation as to the distinctions between gender and sex.
Correction : An earlier version of this story did not fully describe the Endocrine Society's views on the use of puberty blockers. The society recommends that trans youth work with mental health professionals and doctors to seek appropriate treatment, including puberty blockers. The story also gave the wrong date for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on the risks of suicide among transgender youth. It was January 2020.

Maine GOP rejects censure of Sen. Susan Collins after her vote to convict Trump

Texto completo: The Maine Republican Party's state committee on Saturday rejected a censure measure against Sen. Susan Collins, following her vote earlier this year to convict former President Donald Trump in his Senate impeachment trial.
Collins, who won a competitive reelection last fall in a state that President Joe Biden carried, escapes censure as some of her Republican colleagues in Congress have faced backlash at home, including censures from their state parties, for bucking the former President.
The committee's final vote was 19-41 to censure Collins, her office said in a statement, which the Maine Republican Party also confirmed to CNN.
"Party leadership considers this matter settled now and the team is moving on to preparing to win elections in 2022," Jason Savage, Maine GOP's executive director, told CNN in an email Saturday.
In a statement Saturday, Collins called the committee's vote "a testament to the Republican Party's 'big tent' philosophy that respects different views but unites around core principles."
In February, some members of the Maine GOP state committee condemned Collins' vote to convict Trump as they were reportedly weighing a formal censure.
"We vehemently disagree with your vote on this matter and condemn it in the strongest possible terms," some committee members -- including the state party's chair and vice chair -- wrote in a letter to Collins at the time. Some members thought Trump's second impeachment trial was politically motivated and unconstitutional considering Trump was no longer in office.
They added that they had heard from Mainers all over the state who were "almost universally outraged at this action and have demanded we take action in response."
But committee members also said they "want to continue to work" with Collins "to help expand upon this electoral success and replicate it in other races in Maine and across New England."
Collins, the only Republican from New England remaining in Congress, was elected to a fifth term in November. She isn't up for reelection until 2026.
On January 6, a mob attacked the US Capitol attempting to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. A week later, the US House charged Trump with one impeachment article of incitement of insurrection. The Senate voted to acquit Trump in February. Collins was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict him.
The moderate GOP senator has defended her vote. In a February 13 speech on the Senate floor, she said that Trump's "actions to interfere with the peaceful transition of power -- the hallmark of our Constitution and our American democracy -- were an abuse of power and constitute grounds for conviction."
Some of the senators and representatives who voted this year in favor of Trump's impeachment or conviction have been or are facing censure from their state party. GOP Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, who's not running for reelection, and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana were censured by their respective state Republican parties for their votes to convict Trump.

Marty Odlin, who grew up and lives on the Maine coast, remembers what the ocean used to be like. But now, he said, “It’s like a desert and just within my lifetime.” In the last few years, he said, he has seen lots of sea grass and many other species virtually disappear from the shoreline.
Odlin, 39, comes from a fishing family and has a passion for the history of the ocean and the coast, both of which have informed his sense of the ocean’s decline, a small part of the catastrophic deletion of marine life over the last several hundred years.
Using his training as an engineer, Odlin has decided to try to reverse that decline with his company, Running Tide, which is based in Portland. Using a combination of robotics, sensors and machine learning, he is building an aquaculture operation that is selling oysters now and eventually clams. He is also using that system to grow kelp, with the goal of producing enough of this seaweed to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently sequester it by burying it on the ocean floor, and sell carbon offsets.
The company also plans to seed oyster reefs and clam beds along the shoreline, and restore kelp forests and sea grass, to help the coastal ecosystem by bringing back biodiversity and improving water quality, among other benefits.
Odlin’s plans are one of a number of efforts in the “blue economy,” a term used to describe commercial activity on the oceans, seas and coasts. He and others are trying to prove that ocean conservation, sustainable fishing and carbon sequestration can be good for business, especially as global shipping, aquaculture and the appetite for wild seafood increases around the world.
Odlin and his team build everything: boats, oyster floats, sensors and more, all with very high sensitivity to their environment. They measure the amount of feed in the water and the growth rate of the various species and send that information into a database that they use to make all sorts of decisions: whether to change the feed, reposition the shellfish floats or make bigger changes about the varieties they’re growing. They also use the hard-won knowledge of commercial fishermen — there are about a dozen on staff — which Odlin said was a huge advantage.
The climate crisis demands technological innovations and “hard hats and steel toes,” he said.
Dan Watson, the chief executive and co-founder of SafetyNet Technologies, also has recognized the benefits of working alongside industry and demonstrating profitability.
His company builds high-tech fishing nets for trawling boats: Attached to the nets are LED lights that flash in various patterns and levels of brightness to signal emergency escape hatches (right-size holes) for those species that fishing boats aren’t trying to catch, known collectively as bycatch.
Studies have shown that LED lights can significantly reduce the amount of unwanted species that end up in fishing nets.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 9.1 million tons, or just over 10% of all of the fish caught every year, are thrown away, with nearly half coming from trawling nets.
In an era of overfishing and shifting habitats because of climate change that defy international regulations, reducing the amount of fish or other marine animals that are caught by mistake could have important consequences for the health of various populations as well as ocean biodiversity as a whole, Watson said.
“When I started all of this, I was a student, and I had the attitude of, ‘This is going to save the world and everyone should do it,’” Watson said.
“I had to turn more towards, ‘Here is the value proposition, and there is a strong financial argument for catching the right fish,’” he added. “We can show crews, ‘Here is what you save on fuel, here is what you save on regulatory fines.’”
Others, too, see the value of working with industry groups. Whale Safe is an initiative from the University of California Santa Barbara to help big ships avoid hitting whales as they travel through ports around Los Angeles. The program came, in part, as a response to shipping companies asking for help, according to Douglas McCauley, a professor of ocean science at UCSB.
Ship strikes, as they are known, are among the leading causes of death for whales, and 2018 and 2019 were the worst years on record for collisions on the West Coast, with 27 total resulting in 22 deaths, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Scientists estimate that the actual number of whales killed by ships could be much higher — as many as 80 a year off the West Coast, according to one study — because not all of the bodies are discovered.
McCauley helped bring together ocean technologists working at UCSB to build a near real-time detection system for whales in the Santa Barbara Channel, combining three inputs: an artificial intelligence algorithm that analyzes whale sounds, classifies them by species, and sends the data for review; a remote sensing system that predictively forecasts whale presence; and plain old citizen science, where trained whale watchers log whales into a mobile app.
“It’s not helpful if you’re only able to say, ‘Southern California is forecast to be cloudy with a chance of blue whales,” and this model forecasts at a much finer scale, McCauley said.
The system delivers the information to ships in a simplified rubric of low, medium, high and very high, so that they can slow if whales are around, which can significantly reduce the number of ship strikes. Whale Safe provides data about only this particular stretch of the California coast, but McCauley said they were planning to expand to San Francisco and possibly elsewhere in North America.
When ships reduce their speed they use less fuel, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; the global shipping industry accounts for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Cargo ships typically burn dirty fuel that releases pollutants like nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which can cause various cancers and childhood asthma for people living in port cities. Air pollution in general also disproportionately affects communities of color.
In only six months, slower speeds in the Santa Barbara and San Francisco areas helped reduce pollution from nitrous oxide by more than 530 tons and greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 metric tons.
But saving the whales could also have huge climate benefits, McCauley said.
During their lives and when they die, whales help sequester enormous amounts of carbon dioxide in two ways. When alive, whales supply phytoplankton (which suck up carbon dioxide) with the nutrients they need to grow. When whales die, their bodies sink to the bottom of the ocean and over time become part of the marine sediment layer, where they can sequester the carbon dioxide they have accumulated during their life span, an average of 33 tons for a great whale species, keeping it out of the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years.
Any of these projects require a more hands-on approach to saving the ocean and a more deliberate overlap of business and conservation, which have historically been at odds, said Odlin, the founder of Running Tide.
“We have to take a more active role in solving the problem that we’re seeing,” he said. “And how do you take a more active role? The moral imperative is that you have to build something at the scale of the problem.”
Otherwise, he said, “generations in front of us are not going to forgive us.”
“We still have a chance right now, so I’m working as hard as I can.”

Texto completo: Over the pandemic year, people took to appreciating the renewable delights of this ragged and tortured planet like never before. In this country, many national parks saw record crowds in 2020, and 8 million more Americans went hiking than in the year before.
You may have noticed, had you tried to snare a rare parking place at the Fourth of July Trailhead in Colorado or won the lottery for a hiking permit in the Enchantments in Washington state, that the outdoors are crowded with refugees from the stifled indoors.
This is a moment to seize — to fortify and expand the constituency for conservation enough to make politicians tremble. It’s been too easy, for too long, for too many in office to pass off climate change as a hoax, or allow another species to disappear from the earth with a shrug.
In the last presidency we saw the largest rollback of federal land protection in the nation’s history, the slashing of Bears Ears National Monument by 85% and of Grand Staircase-Escalante to about half its previous size, both in Utah. And along with propping up atmosphere-gagging coal plants, the Trump administration opened the largest national forest, the Tongass in Alaska, to industrial logging. The time to act has long been upon us.
Building a fearsome lobby for the planet often starts with getting religion — that moment when the grays of the human-built environment give way to the technicolor of the world not of our making.
It’s not unlike falling in love. Nearly everyone who is passionate about the outdoors has a kind of origin story — seeing a heron take flight on a misty dawn, or the first pine sapling poking through the last snow of winter — to explain what transformed his or her perspective.
It’s easy to assume these transitional moments are limited to people of certain political leanings. “We’re like pro-life Democrats,” a former GOP senator said of Republican environmentalists, Barack Obama wrote in his memoir “A Promised Land.” “We’ll soon be extinct.”
Not so. Consider the case of Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, as red-state conservative as they come. After hiking in the Boulder-White Cloud Mountains in Idaho, in 2014 he described a sort of religious experience that led him to help preserve the area from plunder.
“The streams, the lakes, the forests are His cathedral,” said Simpson, according to an account from Rocky Barber, an outdoor writer, “and you don’t desecrate a cathedral, you preserve it.”
As if visited in a dream, Simpson came by a stream in his state’s Sawtooth Range and saw a 3-foot-long salmon that had made the 870-mile round trip to the ocean and back. “These are the most incredible creatures I think God has created,” recalled the congressman at a 2019 conference. “We shouldn’t mess with it.”
Last month Simpson proposed what would surely be uniformly denounced by his party as one of the most radical environmental measures in the nation’s history — had it come from anyone but a Republican congressman in Idaho. He’s promoting a $33 billion proposal to breach four dams between Idaho and the Pacific Ocean and let the Snake River run free into the Columbia and on to the sea.
It is an audacious plan to save fish that ascend mountains, fish that are sacred to the Nez Perce tribe and the regional identity of the Pacific Northwest, and it may just have a fighting chance of passage.
Anyone new to the trails that wind through the Sonoran Desert in Arizona has likely had a moment similar to Simpson’s while watching the sun dip behind a saguaro cactus. Saguaros, big-limbed succulents that seem to be waving hello, have been ravaged by wildfires in the past few years — casualties of climate change.
Help is on the way. The confirmation of former Rep. Deb Haaland as interior secretary, the first Native American to hold that position, promises to bring a fierce Indigenous voice to the battle.
Haaland, a 35th-generation New Mexican, told me a few months ago about the joy she felt hiking in Yosemite National Park. Now she’s overseeing that park, and every other square foot of the 450 million acres in Interior’s public land domain. She’ll also be trying to shape President Joe Biden’s Climate Conservation Corps, an idea borrowed from the New Deal, putting people to work on projects to mitigate climate change.
Much harder will be shutting down oil and gas drilling on public lands. The emissions from these operations are responsible for nearly 25% of the carbon put out by the United States. That means the American public, the owner of those lands, is complicit in ultimately destroying much of what makes them so life-affirming.
As a candidate, Biden promised to phase out drilling on public lands. As president, he’s been largely silent on this pledge. The growing constituency of earth defenders, people who got or reaffirmed their religion during the pandemic, should demand that the promise be kept.
And yes, those of us pushing for protection of our pandemic getaways are acting out of self-interest. We need these places for sanity and survival. The world is emptier, harder to love and harder to live in without salmon, saguaros and the other living things under our stewardship.

Texto completo: The Idaho Legislature has brought business to halt for the next two weeks amid an outbreak of Covid-19 among lawmakers and staff at the state Capitol.
The Idaho House and the Senate each voted Friday to recess and return on April 6. Idaho House Speaker Scott Bedke, a Republican, told reporters during a news conference Friday that the Legislature adjourned out of an "abundance of caution" and to "break the cycle" of Covid-19 infections, according to CNN affiliate KBOI.
As of Friday morning, there were at least 10 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among House representatives, House staff, and Senate staff, according to the House Democratic leader's office. KBOI reported that at least six House lawmakers had tested positive for Covid-19.
The pause in work comes as the state Capitol nears the end of its legislative session. Lawmakers still have a full plate of issues to consider, including a bill that would curb the governor's emergency powers and a bill prohibiting local governments from mandating mask-wearing.
Democratic state lawmakers criticized their Republican colleagues for not taking proper precautions to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 so the legislature could continue with its work.
"We could have met remotely or worn masks and distanced reliably but no, we go home now and stop doing the peoples business," Democratic state Sen. David Nelson tweeted.
The Idaho Democratic Party placed blame on the state GOP and Republican leadership for refusing to wear masks, adding in a tweet that "recessing won't stop the spread. Masks will."
CNN has reached out to Bedke's office for additional comment.
The Idaho House and Senate's Democratic leaders said Friday that they "hope our colleagues are able to heal quickly and return, so we can finish the session."
"But we can't help but be disappointed in how bad things have become at the Capitol, when we could've prevented this from becoming a hot spot all along," House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel and Senate Minority Leader Michelle Stennett said in a joint statement.
Rubel told KBOI that lawmakers work in close spaces and very few of them wear masks, so it "seemed inevitable that this would happen." She added that Democrats had previously advocated for "much more robust precautions" and even postponing the session until lawmakers could get vaccinated.
Rubel and Stennett warned Friday that the legislature "must do better when we return, or else we'll keep finding ourselves in this position."
Idaho has seen a 25% increase in daily new Covid-19 cases over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The state reported more than 380 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, according to the Idaho Department of Health. Since the start of the pandemic, Idaho has reported more than 177,000 cases of Covid-19 and 1,941 deaths.
Earlier this month, about a hundred people gathered at the Idaho state Capitol for a "burn the mask" rally.

Texto completo: With Covid-19 vaccination production and distribution ramping up in the United States, more states are expanding who is eligible to be inoculated.
On Tuesday, Mississippi is following Alaska's lead and becoming the second state to open vaccination appointments to all residents 16 years and older, Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday.
"Starting tomorrow, ALL new appointments will be open to ALL Mississippians. Get your shot friends - and let's get back to normal!" he tweeted Monday.
Officials are racing to get Americans vaccinated and manage the pandemic before variants can dominate the cases spreading around the country.
President Joe Biden has called for all American adults to be eligible for vaccines by May 1, but some are planning to expand who can be inoculated earlier.
Here is where each state stands:
Alabama
Beginning March 22, all residents 55 and older, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, critical workers and people with high-risk medical conditions will be added to eligible for vaccinations, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.
Alaska
On March 9, Alaska became the first state to eliminate all other eligibility requirements. Everyone living and working in the state is now eligible for vaccination, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said.
Arizona
All residents 45 and older will be able to be vaccinated beginning April 1, Gov. Doug Ducey told CNN affiliate KPNX. For now, eligibility ranges by county according to the Arizona Department of Health Services.
Arkansas
As of Tuesday, groups in Phase 1C of Arkansas' vaccine rollout plan -- which includes people ages 16-64 with some underlying health conditions, people who live in high-risk settings and essential workers in a range of industries -- can receive vaccines, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said.
California
The state expanded vaccine eligibility Monday to include adults in congregate facilities, including immigrants in detention centers, as well as those with certain health conditions.
Colorado
Colorado will add 2.5 million more people eligible for vaccines Friday by expanding access to residents 50 and older as well as those with high-risk conditions, Gov. Jared Polis said.
Connecticut
On Friday, appointments for vaccinations will open to residents ages 45 to 54, and by April 5, the state expects to expand to all of those 16 and older, a press release from Gov. Ned Lamont's office said Monday.
Delaware
While the state is pushing to vaccinate residents 65 and older as well as frontline essential workers, pharmacies can vaccinate anyone in the state 50 or older and doctors can vaccinate anyone with high or moderate-risk medical conditions, according to a statement Tuesday.
Florida
Florida expanded vaccine eligibility Monday to adults 60 and up, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The age will be lowered to 55 "in due time," DeSantis said, but the timing will depend on how quickly people over 60 are vaccinated.
Georgia
All adults with high-risk health conditions and those 55 and older became eligible for vaccinations Monday. Gov. Brian Kemp said that at least 5 million Georgians are eligible to receive their vaccines and should take advantage of the opportunity in order to return to some normalcy.
Hawaii
This week, Hawaii residents 65 and older and those on dialysis, with severe respiratory disease and those undergoing chemotherapy joined the list of people who can be vaccinated, according to the state's Covid-19 portal.
Idaho
The state opened vaccinations to people 55 and older with at least one medical condition Monday. On March 22, everyone 55 and over will be eligible, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.
Illinois
Those eligible for vaccines include health care workers and residents of long-term facilities, people older than 65 and non-health care frontline essential workers, the Illinois Department of Public Health said.
Indiana
Indiana added teachers, childcare workers, and people with several high-risk comorbidities Monday to the list of those eligible for vaccinations, said Dr. Lindsay Weaver, chief medical officer with the state's Department of Health.

Texto completo: Ammon Bundy, who was to go on trial after being charged with trespassing in the Idaho Statehouse last year, was arrested Monday after he refused to wear a mask in court.
According to Ada County Sheriff spokesperson Patrick Orr, the Idaho Supreme Court has a mask mandate for anyone entering a courthouse, but when Bundy showed up Monday morning for the first day of his jury trial he wouldn't wear one and was denied entry.
Magistrate Judge David Manweiler then issued a warrant for failure to appear, a misdemeanor.
Bundy was arrested and taken to the Ada County Jail where he is being held on $10,000 bond, Orr said.
CNN reached out to Bundy for comment but didn't get an immediate reply. It is unclear whether he has an attorney.
Bundy faces misdemeanor charges of trespassing and resisting arrest linked to the August incident at the Idaho Statehouse. He was arrested for refusing to leave the Capitol in Boise during a special session of the legislature.
"Troopers were forced to physically remove Bundy from the Senate Gallery," police said at the time.
Bundy and others were at the Capitol demanding an end to the state of emergency.
He made national news in 2016 when he led an armed occupation of federal land in Oregon. The takeover of a wildlife refuge headquarters lasted 41 days.
One man from the group, LaVoy Finicum, was shot and killed during an attempted traffic stop weeks into the occupation. Bundy was among several people arrested.
He and others were indicted by a federal grand jury, but he was acquitted of firearms charges and conspiracy to impede federal workers.
Bundy is the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who in 2014 engaged in an armed showdown with the federal Bureau of Land Management over grazing rights for his cattle.

When your own family is racist toward you

Texto completo: Growing up as a child of a White woman and a Black man in a small town in Maine, Victoria Anderson was constantly reminded she was different.
A close relative nicknamed her "jungle bunny," she said. Another relative once turned her framed photo so her face wasn't visible. And she wasn't allowed to play with some White cousins -- an insult that added to the discrimination she received from strangers.
"I heard from a relative in my house that she (my mother) never should have had me because you're supposed to stick with your own kind," says Anderson, now 46. "I was never taught how to take care of my hair, so it was always a mess."
Anderson is part of a growing demographic of multiracial Americans, estimated at 9 million in the last census. The number of Americans who identify as multiracial is growing at three times faster than the normal population, according to the Pew Research Center.
Like virtually all people of color, these multiracial people have encountered racism in their lives. And, as Meghan Markle alleged in Sunday's explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey, prejudicial comments or attitudes can even come from the people closest to them -- their own families.
Meghan, the wife of Prince Harry whose mother is Black and father is White, says there were "concerns and conversations" within the royal family about how dark their unborn son Archie's skin would be. Buckingham Palace later issued a statement saying Meghan's allegations were being "taken very seriously," while Prince William, Meghan's brother-in-law, told a reporter, "We're very much not a racist family."
But Meghan's remarks have been followed with interest by multiracial people, some of whom told CNN they have endured similar comments from relatives.
Racial prejudice between family members is not uncommon
Family relationships across races can add another layer of complication for people who are already straddling two or more worlds.
In the US, a vast majority of multiracial people -- roughly 90% -- say they have not been mistreated by a relative or extended family member because of their mixed-race background, according to a 2015 Pew study.
But it does happen, and to some racial groups more than others. For example, the Pew study found that 21% biracial adults who are White and Black say they have been treated badly by a relative because of their racial background.
And when the day after Meghan's interview with Oprah one London woman tweeted, "I don't think the racism mixed race kids face from their own families is discussed enough," it sparked more than 137,000 likes and a long thread of comments by mixed-race people sharing hurtful experiences.
The woman, Kemah Bob, tells CNN she sent that tweet after talking to friends who have parents from different backgrounds.
"I've heard stories about the ways they've been hurt or cast out by their families," she says. "I can't imagine experiencing racism from within my own home -- from people who say they love me."
CNN also spoke to half a dozen multiracial people who said they've been mistreated by their own family members.
Some did not want to be identified for fear of straining family relationships, but described hostile upbringings that included their parents being ostracized by other relatives for having children with someone outside their race. One man said his grandparent would call his phone to hurl expletives at him, bringing him to tears.
Anderson, the mixed-race Maine woman, was raised by her mother and grandmother in Milo, a town that hosted a Ku Klux Klan parade in the 1920s.
Some of her White family members disowned her mother because of "race mixing," she says. Another relative called her father the "Black bastard."
"Racism lets you know right away that you are not White," she says. "My Blackness stood out and was rare where I grew up, so it has always been a big part of my identity."
Multiracial people can struggle to fit in on both sides of their family
Sharon Metzger, 28, was raised by a White father and a Zambian mother. Her parents met after her father's Peace Corps stint in the southern African country of Lesotho.
They later moved to Arizona and Maryland before setting in Fishers, Indiana, where she lives. Her biggest challenge was trying to fit in both her parents' worlds, she said.
Her Zambian family described her as a "Point Five," a term implying you're 0.5, or a half of one race, and commonly used to refer to biracial people in Africa.
Trying to determine her identity as a child without making either of her parents feel left out added to the confusion.
"As a teenager I felt like 'the other,' ' she says. "I've gotten so tired of answering the 'so you're Black and ... ?' So now I state 'I'm Black' and I do so proudly."
While she was growing up, Metzger says a relative from her White side would openly lament why her father went to Africa. Metzger has two younger half-brothers whose mother is from Senegal.
"She would say, 'I wish you never went to Africa. You should have stayed in the states,' " Metzger says. "If he didn't (go) the three of us wouldn't exist."
She says other family members used to describe her hair as too wild and constantly asked her to apply relaxer on it.
"I was hurt, annoyed and frustrated," she says. "It's almost as if you're at fault for being biracial. I didn't like my hair for a long time, especially during childhood and adolescence."
Over time, Metzger says she's learned to accept herself but steers clear of some family members on both sides.
"I usually just kinda keep to myself. I'm at the point where if they're not over it, it's their loss," she says. "It's better for my mental health, plus I'm figuring out who I am as a person and trying to make my own meaning of what a Black woman is."
Racism can be difficult for families to talk about
Joy Hepp is White and the mother of a 3-year-old girl. The Los Angeles woman is expecting a second child with her Haitian partner, who is Black.
As the daughter of a half-Mexican mother, Hepp grew up surrounded by a rich mix of Latin culture. She also knows the power of representation after growing up with a sister who had blonde hair and blue eyes.
Hepp is preparing to help her children navigate a multiracial world, one that she believes will be complicated by racism. That's one of the reasons she paid close attention to Meghan's interview.
And she took notes on the subsequent conversations.
"I know at the end of the day, my kids will be seen as Black," Hepp says. "You have to open your eyes to what factors are in place. Their father and I, and the community around them, we're working to raise them into strong productive and confident individuals."
Hepp says one of her biggest challenges has been convincing her White relatives that her daughter and unborn child will face challenges due to their racial background.
"There's a lot of disbelief, like, 'oh no,' like, 'that can't be true.' Just being in denial about systemic racism that exists," she says. "How do we move forward as a country if people -- even family -- don't acknowledge it?"
Cassi Moghan can relate. Her birth mother was White and father was Black, and she was adopted into a White family at age 2.
Her racial background was a taboo that her family refused to talk about, she says. While she was not called names because of her race, she says the silence around her heritage was just as painful.
"I didn't really grow up discussing racism very much as it all seemed too complicated and painful for everyone," says Moghan, 56, who was born in England and now lives in Athens, Greece.
Moghan believes confronting White family members about their racism can be harder than calling out a friend or colleague. But she hopes conversations such as Meghan and Harry's interview with Oprah will help push issues of race within families more into the open.
"Hearing more experiences from people like ourselves can only help others not feel as lonely as I felt," she says.
It's one reason multiracial people around the world are following Meghan's clash with her royal in-laws. If she can bare her pain and emerge stronger, maybe they can, too.

Texto completo: Maine writer Lily King's latest novel about an aspiring novelist who falls in love with two men simultaneously will be turned into a movie, according to multiple media reports.
Actress Toni Collete will direct the adaptation of "Writers & Lovers," according to the trade publications Variety, The Hollywood Reporter and other media outlets. King did not reply to an email Thursday to discuss the news. Collete was nominated for a Golden Globe for her acting work in "Muriel's Wedding" and an Oscar for best supporting actress in "The Sixth Sense." The Australian actress and director will write the screenplay with Nick Payne, whose credits include "The Crown."
"I have been wanting to direct for quite some time but have been a bit busy with my day job. I couldn't be more thrilled to be bringing Lily King's beautiful, funny, moving novel to filmic life. It's an empowering story that speaks to me as a woman and an artist. It's ultimately about coming to know and believe in oneself," Colette was quoted as saying. "This is not always an easy feat, but the most important journey any person can take. It inspires me on so many levels."
"Writers & Lovers" tells the story of Casey Peabody, a young novelist from Boston who gets up early each morning to write before heading off to her waitressing job. She is grieving the loss of her mother and recovering from a hot love affair when a friend brings her to a book-signing, where she meets two men and develops feelings for both. It's set in the mid-1990s.
Released a year ago, "Writers & Lovers" was a New York Times best-seller. It is King's fifth novel. Her previous book, 2014's "Euphoria," won the Kirkus Award, New England Book Award, the Maine Fiction Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Award.
Topic Studios, which produced the movies "Spotlight" and "The Mauritanian," is financing the film.

Manchin on his veto power over Biden agenda: 'It's not a good place to be'

Texto completo: He's undecided on the nominee to head Health and Human Services. He's not sure if he'll back the No. 3 for the Justice Department, or the undersecretary of policy at the Pentagon.
He says maintaining the 60 vote-requirement to overcome a filibuster is a "red line" for him. And he's made clear he'll block advancing an infrastructure package on a party-line vote if Democrats don't work with Republicans.
In a 50-50 Senate, with most members voting the party-line, Sen. Joe Manchin stands mostly alone: effectively holding veto power over many of President Joe Biden's nominees and key elements of his agenda.
"It's a shame," Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, told CNN when asked about his newfound veto power. "There are 49 other Democrats. Please come forward."
Manchin added: "It's not good. It's not a good place to be."
But he offered this warning to his party as it tries to move legislation along straight party lines: "I'm going to make sure they don't."
Manchin, a rare Senate Democrat from a deep red state that former President Donald Trump won in a landslide, has long occupied the slot as the most likely swing vote among Senate Democrats, a position the 73-year-old has prized as he hosts senators from both parties at his boat that he lives on in Washington.
Manchin joined the Senate after literally shooting the Democrats' climate change proposal in a 2010 campaign ad -- and more recently joining Republicans in the Trump years on some of the most controversial matters, such as voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and William Barr as attorney general. Yet he also voted to convict Trump in both impeachment trials and voted against efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Manchin argues that he's simply trying to ensure the two parties work together in a highly polarized political environment. His Democratic critics say he's giving far too much deference to an opposition party eager to thwart the President's agenda.
Now, under Biden, Manchin holds a unique perch: the Democrat the new President needs to get on board when votes are bound to come down strictly along party lines. And in private, Biden has encouraged Manchin to stick by his convictions, something he has already done as he's frustrated some of the White House's agenda.
Manchin's opposition effectively sank the nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget, as he claimed her past tweets made her "too toxic." And he sent Washington into nearly 12 hours of tension when he initially balked at a last-minute change on jobless benefits, a position Democrats feared could have sunk Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan. Ultimately, he cut a deal and then backed the bill, which passed the Senate on a 50-49 vote with no GOP support.
Senate Democratic leaders say everybody in their caucus wields the same power. But Manchin is the one who wields it most frequently.
"Anybody in a 50-50 Senate is in a position to be able to do that," said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat and member of leadership. Asked if Manchin should be careful not to overreach, Stabenow: "I think all of us need to be careful about that."
With the flood of attention he's getting, some of his colleagues have no desire to talk about him, either.
"Here's what I'm going to say about Manchin: Everybody asks me about him. Why don't you just ask him?" said GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who also represents West Virginia. "Seriously. When you have a one-vote margin, everybody has a lot of influence. Talk to him about it."
Indeed, several other members who caucus with the Democrats have the potential to be swing votes, such as Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Jon Tester of Montana and Angus King of Maine, while others facing difficult reelections could break from their party -- like Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who joined with seven of her colleagues in voting against an effort to include a $15 federal minimum wage in the relief bill.
Undecided on key nominees
Yet few are generating as much attention from the White House as Manchin. With Biden's nominee to be the Pentagon's under secretary for policy, Colin Kahl, hanging by a thread, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin jumped on the phone to lobby for Manchin's support. The West Virginia Democrat also spoke with a former defense secretary, Bob Gates, and Kahl himself.
In his conversation with Manchin, Kahl expressed regret for his past tweets, and Manchin said they were "nowhere near as prolific" as Tanden's.
"Tweets," Manchin said, sounding exasperated. "I don't know why people want to get on there. I really don't know."
Other nominees have come to woo Manchin as well -- the latest being Xavier Becerra, who was nominated as secretary of Health and Human Services. With GOP opposition lining up, on the grounds Becerra is too liberal for the post, Manchin's support could be decisive.
"Here's the thing, I've been pretty differential on that, you follow me?" Manchin said of presidential nominees.
On Becerra, Manchin said: "His political background is different than mine. OK? I really appreciate his fight for the ACA because of all the people with preexisting conditions and 800,000 West Virginians would have lost, and he fought for that. But some of his other stances are different than mine. But you understand, it's not his policy he's pushing" if he were to be confirmed.
It remains to be seen whether any Republicans will back Becerra, with both GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine signaling they were undecided and still having discussions with Becerra, and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah telling CNN he planned to oppose him.
"He's just out of the mainstream of his own party with regards to abortion and with regards to religious freedom," Romney said of Becerra on Wednesday.
Other nominees could potentially hinge on winning all Democratic support, such as Vanita Gupta as the No. 3 at the Justice Department, though Manchin signaled he has yet to review her nomination.
For Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, they recognize the significance of Manchin's vote -- something that became clear through the course of a hectic day of negotiations last Friday over the relief package. Schumer bluntly warned Manchin that supporting a Republican alternative on jobless benefits would kill the overall relief bill, while Biden engaged in more of a soft sell: encouraging him to vote his conscience.
"I wanted Donald Trump to succeed," Manchin said in the interview. "I want Joe Biden to succeed. ... But like he said, 'Joe,' he said, 'I've never asked you to go against your convictions.' And I told him, 'I appreciate that, Mr. President, because I won't.' "
Manchin vows to block party-line efforts
Indeed, as Democrats are trying to push forward a massive infrastructure package, Manchin has bluntly said he would block the effort if they try to advance the plan on a straight party-line vote and use a budget process called "reconciliation" -- and don't try to win over Republicans first. It's the same process that Democrats used to pass the sweeping relief bill that cleared Congress on Wednesday.
Yet if Democrats don't use the budget process, they'll have to win at least 10 Republicans to break a filibuster, which requires 60 votes, something that could be a daunting task.
"It would be nice to find some common ground first," Tester said of trying to win over Republicans before moving ahead on reconciliation. He added with a laugh: "But I don't want to sound like Joe Manchin."
Many Democrats over the weekend were heartened when Manchin signaled an openness to revising the filibuster, a tool he has long vowed to protect in the name of his predecessor, the late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, a fierce defender of the Senate.
Manchin is suggesting he could be open to forcing senators to hold the floor -- rather than the current situation, where a simple threat to filibuster is enough to slow down the body and force a vote at a 60-vote threshold.
But Manchin has made clear he won't back away from the 60-vote threshold, telling CNN that it's a "red line" for him. That means Democrats won't have the votes to change the filibuster rules in order to allow 51 senators to advance legislation, even as a growing number in their party are demanding that monumental change in the face of GOP opposition to many of their big-ticket agenda items.
"The red line is having minority participation in your process," Manchin said. "That's the way we were designed. ... I haven't seen any reason to come off the 60."
Manchin's colleagues on both sides are watching him closely.
"I hope he sticks to his guns," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. "I'm sure Robert Byrd would want him to. And the people of West Virginia. We cease to be the Senate if that goes away."

Texto completo: A group of parents urged their children to burn masks on the steps of the Idaho State Capitol on Saturday, videos show, in a state that has never had a statewide mask mandate.
“Destroy them! Feed them to the fire! We don’t want them in our world anymore!” young children are heard shouting as they grab handfuls of surgical and cloth masks and toss them into a barrel of flames. Adults in the background cheer them on.
Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, has resisted a mask mandate in Idaho, despite research showing mask mandates are linked to fewer infections and Covid-19 deaths in counties across the United States. Conservative lawmakers in the state have nonetheless pushed legislation banning any such measures, The Associated Press reported.
The videos, taken by an Oregon Public Broadcasting reporter and a New York Times contributor, Sergio Olmos, show about 100 people on the steps of the state capitol building.
In one video, several children not much taller than the burning barrel itself approach to drop in masks. “Here fire, you hungry?” says one child. In another video, police officers approaching a woman about a fire are repeatedly told to back off. “Leave her alone!” protesters call out. Idaho State Police said in a statement that open flames were not allowed on State Capitol grounds and that the incident was under review.
The demonstrations were in part organized by Darr Moon, the husband of Dorothy Moon, an Idaho State representative.
In a video posted to YouTube on Friday, Ms. Moon, along with another state representative, Heather Scott, called the demonstrations a “grass-roots project that we have become aware of and fully support.”
Ms. Moon claimed in the video that the state has a low caseload that doesn’t justify protective measures. A total of 1,880 people in Idaho have died from the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database.

Colleges That Require Virus-Screening Tech Struggle to Say Whether It Works

Before the University of Idaho welcomed students back to campus in the fall, it made a big bet on new virus-screening technology.
The university spent $90,000 installing temperature-scanning stations, which look like airport metal detectors, in front of its dining and athletic facilities in Moscow, Idaho. When the system clocks a student walking through with an unusually high temperature, the student is asked to leave and go get tested for COVID-19.
But so far the fever scanners, which detect skin temperature, have caught fewer than 10 people out of the 9,000 students living on or near campus. Even then, university administrators could not say whether the technology had been effective because they have not tracked students flagged with fevers to see if they went on to get tested for the virus.
The University of Idaho is one of hundreds of colleges and universities that adopted fever scanners, symptom checkers, wearable heart-rate monitors and other new COVID-screening technologies this school year. Such tools often cost less than a more validated health intervention: frequent virus testing of all students. They also help colleges showcase their pandemic safety efforts.
But the struggle at many colleges to keep the virus at bay has raised questions about the usefulness of the technologies. A New York Times effort has recorded more than 530,000 virus cases on campuses since the start of the pandemic.
One problem is that temperature scanners and symptom-checking apps cannot catch the estimated 40% of people with the coronavirus who do not have symptoms but are still infectious. Temperature scanners can also be wildly inaccurate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cautioned that such symptom-based screening has only “limited effectiveness.”
The schools have a hard time saying whether — or how well — the new devices have worked. Many universities and colleges, including prominent research institutions, are not rigorously studying effectiveness.
“So why are we bothering?” said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security technologist who has described such screening systems as “security theater” — that is, tools that make people feel better without actually improving their safety. “Why spend the money?”
More than 100 schools are using a free virus symptom-checking app, called CampusClear, that can clear students to enter campus buildings. Others are asking students to wear symptom-monitoring devices that can continuously track vital signs like skin temperature. And some have adapted the ID card swiping systems they use to admit students into dorms, libraries and gyms as tools for tracing potential virus exposures.
Administrators at Idaho and other universities said their schools were using the new tech, along with policies like social distancing, as part of larger campus efforts to hinder the virus. Some said it was important for their schools to deploy the screening tools even if they were only moderately useful. At the very least, they said, using services like daily symptom-checking apps may reassure students and remind them to be vigilant about other measures, like mask wearing.
Some public health experts said it was understandable that colleges had not methodically assessed the technology’s effectiveness against the coronavirus. After all, they said, schools are unaccustomed to frequently screening their entire campus populations for new infectious diseases.
Even so, some experts said they were troubled that universities lacked important information that might help them make more evidence-based decisions on health screening.
“It’s a massive data vacuum,” said Saskia Popescu, an infectious-disease researcher who is an assistant professor at George Mason University. “The moral of the story is you can’t just invest in this tech without having a validation process behind it.”
Other medical experts said increased surveillance of largely healthy college students seemed unduly intrusive, given that symptom checkers have limited usefulness and the effectiveness of wearable health monitors against COVID-19 is not yet known.
The introduction of campus screening tools has often been bumpy. In the fall, the University of Missouri began requiring all students, faculty and staff to use CampusClear, a free app that asks users about possible symptoms, like high temperature or loss of smell. Users who say they have no symptoms then receive a “Good to Go!” notification that can clear them to enter campus buildings.
The school initially did not enforce the use of CampusClear at building entrances, however, and some students used the app only infrequently, according to reporting by The Missourian, the campus newspaper. In October, the university began requiring people to show their app passcode to enter certain buildings, like the student center and library. The university has promoted the app as a tool to help educate students.
But how effective it has been at hindering coronavirus outbreaks on campus is unknown. A spokesman for the University of Missouri said the school was unable to provide usage data on CampusClear — including the number of students who had reported possible symptoms through the app and later tested positive for the virus — requested by a Times reporter.
Jason Fife, marketing director at Ivy.ai, the startup behind CampusClear, said nearly 425,000 people at about 120 colleges and universities used the app last semester, generating about 9.8 million user reports. Many schools, he noted, use data from the app not to follow individual virus cases but to look for symptom trends on their campuses.
Ivy.ai, however, cannot gauge the app’s effectiveness as a virus-screening tool, he said. For privacy reasons, the company does not track individual users who report symptoms and later test positive for the infection.
At some universities, administrators acknowledged that the tech they adopted this school year did not pan out the way they had hoped.
Bridgewater State University in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, introduced two tools last semester that recorded students’ whereabouts in case they later developed virus infections and administrators needed to trace their contacts. One system logged students’ locations every time they swiped their ID cards to enter campus buildings. The other asked students to scan printed-out QR codes posted at certain locations around campus.
By the end of the semester, however, only about one-third of the 1,200 students on campus were scanning the bar codes. Ethan Child, a Bridgewater senior, said he had scanned the QR codes but also skipped them when walking by in the rain.
“I think it’s reasonable to ask students to do it — whether or not they’ll actually do it is another thing,” he said. “People might just pass it by.”
Administrators discovered that the key to hindering coronavirus outbreaks was not technology but simply frequent testing — once a week, for on-campus students — along with contact tracing, said Chris Frazer, executive director of the university’s wellness center.
“I’m glad we didn’t spend an exorbitant amount of money” on tech tools, Frazer said. “We found what we need is tests and more tests.”
The location-tracking tools ultimately proved most useful for “peace of mind,” he added, and to confirm the findings of contact tracers, who often learned much more about infected students’ activities by calling them than by examining their location logs.
Other schools that discovered location tracking was not a useful pandemic safety tool decided not to deploy it at all.
At Oklahoma State University, in Stillwater, administrators said they had planned to log students’ locations when they used campus Wi-Fi for possible later use in contact tracing. But the school never introduced the system, said Chris Barlow, the school’s health services director, partly because administrators realized that many students had contracted the virus off campus, in situations where public health measures like mask wearing were not followed.
At the University of Idaho and other schools, administrators described devices like fever scanners as add-ons to larger campus safety efforts involving student testing and measures like social distancing.
In the fall, for instance, the University of Idaho tested its students for the virus at the beginning and middle of the semester, with some random testing as well. The school also used a wastewater testing program to identify an impending virus outbreak at fraternity and sorority houses, proactively quarantining more than a dozen chapters before cases could spread widely through the community.
“We got out in front of it early,” said C. Scott Green, president of the University of Idaho. “We were able to isolate those that were sick, and we got back under control.”
Still, there were hiccups. The university required food service employees who worked at the dining hall to undergo temperature checks using hand-held scanners. But several developed virus infections anyway, and the university was forced to temporarily close the dining hall over a weekend for deep cleaning.
As for the free-standing temperature-scanning stations, Green himself has experienced their limitations. He said one mistakenly stopped him from entering an athletic building right after he got out of a hot car.

Texto completo: with Tobi Raji
Good Monday morning. Half a million people in the U.S. have died from the coronavirus; millions are still without drinkable water in Texas; and we might still be wearing masks in 2022 . This is the Power Up newsletter – thanks for waking up with us.
The campaign
SCOOP FROM THE LONE STAR STATE: We got our hands on the Texas Democratic Party's post-election review – an autopsy on what went wrong and what it thinks it needs to turn the state blue by 2024.
State Democrats, whose entreaties for more spending in the state by the Biden campaign were denied in the final stretch of the election, are optimistic they can do better next time – if they can beef up their voter registration program to register 100,000 to 150,0000 more Democrats than Republicans per cycle.
The "2020 Retrospective" attributes the across-the-board losses to three things: limited spending in the state, sub-par outreach to and mobilization of Latino voters, and the suspension of in-person voter contact due to the coronavirus that hindered efforts to turn out low propensity voters.
"We need to massively expand our voter registration ambitions," according to the review conducted and authored by Hudson Cavanagh, the Texas Democrats' director of data science. "From 2018 to 2020, we lost ground in terms of voter registration, losing about 26,000 net votes. However, there are more than enough potential registrants to flip the state if we invest in and execute effective programs at scale." Read our full piece here.
Short of high expectations: Democrats thought they could not only beat Trump, but be competitive in the Senate race to topple GOP Sen. John Cornyn, flip the state house and several U.S. House seats. But Cornyn handily won reelection against MJ Hegar, and Texas Republicans largely held Democrats off.
"Republicans did better in activating their base in Texas among high-propensity voters, low-propensity voters and everyone in between. Republicans had a better turnout operation than we did," the report states.
Still: President Biden came closest to flipping the Lone Star state than any other Democrat in the last 25 years – losing the state to Donald Trump by 631,221 votes. (The last Democratic presidential candidate to win the state was Jimmy Carter in 1976.)
And demographic changes since the 2016 election bode well for the left. At least 2 million people moved to the state from California, New York and Florida – many of them Democrats – and an estimated 800,000 young Latino Americans turned 18.
The report cites modeling projecting over 2 million "solidly Democratic unregistered voters in Texas," based on figures from the 2010 census. In turn, Texas Democrats want the national party to make major investments to turn the state "sustainably blue," according to the report.
Coronavirus effect: Democrats' "inefficient targeting" of low-to-moderate propensity voters, wrote Cavanaugh, was "partially a symptom of our inability to do in-person canvassing because we were not able to effectively reach large portions of our base for whom we lacked quality contact information."
"The pandemic prevented us from getting the most out of our most powerful competitive advantage: our volunteers. We struggled to reach voters for whom we did not have phone numbers, who were disproportionately young, rural and folks of color," the report concludes.
Abhi Rahman, Texas Democratic Party spokesman, told me that "unwilling to put staff and volunteers at risk" by undertaking contact operations – but going forward, they've devised "safe ways to do things in person."
The report also zoomed in on the party's failure to turn out Latinos in rural Texas. The report found a significant increase in Latino support in rural counties and concludes there was a "pronounced differential turnout effect among Latino voters in Texas that hurt Democratic candidates up and down the ballot," Cavanagh writes.
"Many have interpreted this as 'Latinos voted for Trump', but it's more accurate to say, 'Latinos who were already Republicans turned out more than Latino Democrats,'" Cavanagh said. "Roughly two-thirds of Latinos continue to support Democrats, but Republicans Latino voters turned out at a higher rate than Democratic Latino voters in the 2020 cycle, relative to expectations."
On the Hill
STIMULUS WEEK:"House Democrats will face their biggest test of unity yet as they prepare to get President Biden's $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief package closer to the finish line," The Hill's Cristina Marcos reports.
Today,the House Budget Committee will vote to advance the bill. It includes"a third round of stimulus checks of up to $1,400, a minimum-wage increase [from $7.25 to $15 per hour], $130 billion to help K-12 schools reopen for in-person learning and renewed [$400] unemployment insurance benefits." Read the text.
On Friday: The House plans to vote on the stimulus package, setting up a Senate vote as soon as next week.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) "has previously said that she expects the covid-19 relief package to be on Biden's desk by March 14, when some jobless benefits expire," CNN's Lauren Fox and Daniella Diaz report.
The full $1.9 trillion stimulus bill faces an uphill battle."Senate Democrats are preparing to move the legislation through a budget reconciliation process that requires only a simple majority," CNN's Jeremy Herb reports. But "the reconciliation process also requires that Democrats adhere to a strict set of rules."
"Democrats must show that every item in their bill has a real budgetary impact that isn't just an 'incidental' effect of a bigger policy change — which is why some have doubted that the minimum wage increase could make it through the process," he writes.
Once Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough "sets the parameters of what could be allowed in the bill, it will be up to Democrats to decide what provisions to include in the Senate version," Bloomberg's Erik Wasson and Laura Davison report. "Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) have all expressed doubts about the minimum wage increase."
Democrats also face roadblocks from Republicans. "With no Republicans expected to cross party lines to support the package, Democrats have little room for error to ensure it satisfies the centrist and progressive wings of the caucus that make up their razor-thin majorities," The Hill reports.
Worth noting: "More than 7 in 10 Americans back Biden's aid package," the New York Times's Emily Cochrane and Jim Tankersley report. "That includes support from three-quarters of independent voters, 2 in 5 Republicans and nearly all Democrats."
TANDEN NOMINATION IN JEOPARDY: Biden's pick to lead the White House budget office may be doomed now that Manchin has announced his opposition – and so has Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) a moderate typically considered among the most likely Republicans to break ranks.
Collins told Politico this morning that "Congress has to be able to trust the [Office of Management and Budget] director to make countless decisions in an impartial manner, carrying out the letter of the law and congressional intent. Neera Tanden has neither the experience nor the temperament to lead this critical agency. Her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend."
Manchin says: "I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next [OMB] director." Manchin's announcement "underscored the outsize power that any one senator holds over the success of Biden's administration and agenda," the New York Times's Emily Cochrane reports.
Tanden's tweets have come back to haunt her. Per Jeff Stein and Colby Itkowitz: "At her contentious confirmation hearings this month, Senate Republicans repeatedly brought up Tanden's prior attacks on GOP lawmakers, particularly on Twitter. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) cited tweets from Tanden calling Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) 'the worst' and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) a 'fraud.' He also cited a Tanden tweet that said, 'Vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz,' referring to the Republican senator from Texas. Tanden has also compared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to 'Voldemort.'"
GARLAND ON THE HILL TODAY:Merrick Garland will appear before the Judiciary Committee today and tomorrow as Biden's pick to lead the Justice Department.
"Garland plans to tell the Senate that if confirmed, he will strive to lead an agency committed to battling discrimination in American life and extremist attacks on democracy," our colleague Devlin Barrett reports.
Also appearing before the Senate this week:
Tuesday: Health and Human Services nominee Xavier Becerra.
Wednesday: CIA director nominee William J. Burns.
The people
Our colleagues Artur Galocha and Bonnie Berkowitz explain the enormity of the coronavirus death toll in the U.S.
Special report: The number of children killed by coronavirus in the U.S. remains small but"each death represents a shattered family and a trauma deepened, parents say, by the rampant belief that kids can't get covid, or that it doesn't much harm them when they do," our colleagues report.
"Although relatively few children die of covid-19, 'it's not fair to say it's a benign disease among children,' said Sean O'Leary, an immunization researcher at Children's Hospital Colorado and vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. 'For every one of these deaths, quite a few kids spend a long time in ICUs and suffer lingering effects.'"
"The children who have died of covid-19 are, even more than among adults, disproportionately children of color — about three-quarters of those who've succumbed to covid so far, according to CDC data."
Outside the Beltway
ABBOTT UNDER SCRUTINY: "Critics have charged that [Texas Governor Greg Abbott's] response to the storm has at times resembled the government failures after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005," our colleagues Annie Gowen, Tim Craig, and Arelis R. Hernández report. Over 50 Texans have died since the storm hit last week.
"As of Sunday, more than 14 million Texans were under orders to boil their water before drinking it or did not have water. Across the state, neighbors lined up at municipal spigots for water, melted snow to flush their toilets, and lined up for food at poorly stocked grocery stores."
"The anger was palpable, with petitions circulating online demanding the resignations of Abbott (R) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who briefly escaped the cold by flying to Cancún. Citizens across the state posted angry memes on social media about the governor, crafting basketball-sized snowballs they wanted to aim at him and superimposing 'Where is Greg Abbott?' over a hellscape." (Abbott remained out of sight at the start of the crisis – before combative performances on TV news, including blaming the Green New Deal.)
"Short term, I am absolutely certain that the governor's popularity will suffer as a result of this," Bill Hammond, a Republican lobbyist and former head of the Texas Association of Business told our colleagues. "He is the head of state government at this time . . . and it's just like the quarterback, the blame and the credit go to the quarterback."
BIDEN 'EAGER' TO VISIT: White House officials said the president could head there as soon as this week, per Paulina Firozi, Amy B Wang and Peter Whoriskey.
From the courts
Democrats are working hard to shape Biden's first Supreme Court pick.
Although there isn't a Supreme Court vacancy yet, Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) is "already maneuvering to champion candidates that might come as soon as this summer, when Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who is 82, [is expected to] retire," the New York Times's Jonathan Martin reports.
His pick?District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs. Childs, 54, "did not attend an Ivy League university [but] won a scholarship to the University of South Florida. She later graduated from the University of South Carolina's law school and became the first Black woman to make partner at one of the state's major law firms."
Why it matters:"The early jockeying illustrates how eager Democratic officials are to leave their mark on Biden's effort to elevate historically underrepresented contenders for a landmark Supreme Court nomination."
Viral
WATCH LIST: CNN'S 'HISTORY REFOCUSED.'It's a new series about the untold stories of America's past.
The first episode spotlights Claudette Colvin, a "15-year-old [girl who] was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white person on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, [nearly 10 months before Rosa Parks did]," CNN's Brandon Tensley and Skylar Mitchell report.
"People said I was crazy because I was 15 years old and defiant and shouting, 'It's my constitutional right!'" Colvin told CNN's Abby Phillip on the show.
"Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton took center stage in the mid-century Black freedom struggle. Meanwhile,others, including women, were rendered relatively invisible, despite their sizable contributions," CNN reports.

Texto completo: A man snowmobiling in the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho died Friday after triggering a large avalanche.
The snowmobiler was riding up a steep slope in the Smoky Mountains, roughly 8 miles from Galena Summit, when he triggered the avalanche, according to the Sawtooth Avalanche Center.
"We are saddened to report that a snowmobiler was caught and killed in an avalanche yesterday in the upper reaches of the Smiley Creek drainage," the avalanche center said in a Facebook post.
"The avalanche danger was rated considerable at the time of the accident," the center said. "We extend our heartfelt condolences to the victim's friends and family."
The rider deployed his avalanche airbag and was not buried, according to the center, but died from severe injuries sustained during the torrent of snow.
His partners discovered him on the surface and were unable to revive him.
"The avalanche broke 3-4' (feet) deep and over 500' (feet) wide on a south-facing slope at 9100' (feet)," the center said.
A deadly avalanche season
The snowmobiler's death marks the latest in a series of deadly avalanches that have killed 29 people across the United States this winter season, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
The deadliest avalanche years occurred in 2008 and 2010, when 36 avalanche fatalities were recorded by CAIC.
Nikki Champion, a forecaster at the Utah Avalanche Center, told CNN earlier this month that the deadly season could be attributed to more people enjoying more time outdoors and a "really dangerous snowpack."
This year's avalanche season has likely been more active because of a "persistent weak layer" of snow, according to Champion.
Although avalanches can form any time if the right conditions are present, there is typically a sharp increase in avalanche deaths during January and February.
CNN's Mallika Kallingal, Jenn Selva, Hollie Silverman, and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.

Members of Maine GOP state committee condemn Sen. Susan Collins' vote to convict Trump

Texto completo: Members of the Maine Republican Party state committee are condemning "in the strongest possible terms" Republican Sen. Susan Collins' vote to convict former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial this month -- another sign of the backlash against lawmakers who bucked Trump, but one that may not have immediate impact given that Collins just won a fifth term.
"We vehemently disagree with your vote on this matter and condemn it in the strongest possible terms," members of the committee -- including the state party's chair and vice chair -- wrote in a letter to Collins posted to Facebook on Wednesday, adding that they had heard from Mainers all over the state who were "almost universally outraged at this action and have demanded we take action in response."
The letter comes in the wake of local reports that the committee was weighing a formal censure of Collins for her decision to find Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection. The Maine GOP did not reply to CNN's multiple requests for comment, including whether the committee was planning on censuring Collins.
In a letter Wednesday replying to the committee, Collins stood by her vote, saying the decision she made was "based on the Constitution and the evidence before me, not on my membership in a political party or any other external factor."
The only GOP senator who voted to convict who's facing voters next year -- Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski -- could be facing her own backyard backlash soon, with the state party expecting to discuss her vote and debate any GOP effort to censure her at a meeting next month, according to the state party chairman Thursday.
The decision from members of the Maine GOP to issue a letter rather than formally censure Collins -- as some Republican state parties have done to other GOP lawmakers who voted in favor of Trump's impeachment or conviction -- could be a sign that Maine Republicans cannot afford to alienate Collins, who is the only GOP federal office holder in New England.
Collins, 68, isn't up for reelection until 2026, but her 2020 race against Democratic challenger Sara Gideon was highly competitive.
In their letter condemning Collins' vote, the members of the committee said they "appreciate all the work" Collins does as a senator and for the Maine Republican Party, adding, "We know that you understand the electoral challenges that our party faces."
"We want to continue to work with you to help expand upon this electoral success and replicate it in other races in Maine and across New England," they wrote.
In her response, Collins noted her status as the only Republican in Congress from New England and the rarity of her ability to carry a state won by the opposite party's presidential nominee. President Joe Biden won Maine in 2020, at the same time Collins won reelection. Acknowledging that "other races in Maine did not go as well," Collins also said, "Now would be a good time for us to consider how we can improve our performance in the 2022 and 2024 cycles," before encouraging the state party to be engaged in an upcoming special election in a state Senate district.
CNN affiliate WMTW reported that the chairs of the state's 16 GOP county committees had met virtually Monday night to discuss censure and possibly scheduling a state party meeting to consider the option.
On Tuesday, responding to the threats of censure, Collins told local station WGME that she is "not surprised given what has happened in other states" but that the "Maine Republican party has generally embraced a big tent philosophy."
Maine GOP Executive Director Jason Savage on Wednesday argued that it's only public discourse between Collins, whom he called an "independent thinker," and the state committee "advocating for what they believe is right."
"I have, in my time here, have largely been able to keep that type of disagreement behind closed doors. In this case, it's not," Savage said during a radio interview Wednesday with WGAN Newsradio. "But I believe that at least the dialogue is respectful. It's about this vote and about a disagreement on a vote." Savage did not response to CNN's multiple requests for comment.
In their letter Wednesday, the members of the committee said they had met with Collins prior to the impeachment trial, when they "expressed their view that the trial was unconstitutional because President Trump was no longer in office." They also argued that the impeachment was "politically motivated" by Democrats.
In a speech on the Senate floor explaining her vote Saturday, Collins said that Trump's "actions to interfere with the peaceful transition of power -- the hallmark of our Constitution and our American democracy -- were an abuse of power and constitute grounds for conviction."

Texto completo: Publication: The Daily Kent Stater, , Kent State University , Kent, OH
-- The Senate has acquitted former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial Saturday, voting that Trump was not guilty of inciting the deadly January 6 riots at the Capitol.
The vote was 57 guilty and 43 not guilty, short of the 67 guilty votes needed to convict. Seven Republican senators voted that Trump was guilty of incitement, but most Republicans argued that the trial itself was unconstitutional because Trump was no longer president, saying that fact trumped any evidence presented during the trial.
The final vote came quickly Saturday on the fifth day of the Senate trial after a surprise Democratic request for witnesses earlier Saturday threw the trial briefly into chaos.
The move to the trial's finishing stages was a final twist after the House managers' surprise request for witnesses had appeared to extend the trial indefinitely. The Senate voted 55 to 45 to consider witnesses -- with five Republican joining Democrats -- after the managers said they wanted to hear from Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington Republican who had told CNN new details about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's phone call with Trump. But after several hours of intense negotiations between Senate leaders, the managers and Trump's legal team, the managers agreed to enter Herrera Beutler's statement into the trial record as evidence and move forward without hearing from witnesses.
LIVE UPDATES - Trump's second impeachment trial: Day 5
On Saturday morning, Democratic senators had expected House managers to move past witnesses onto closing arguments and a final vote. But the lead impeachment manager, Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, announced when the trial got underway that the managers wanted to subpoena Herrera Beutler about her knowledge of McCarthy's phone call, following a CNN report Friday. Herrera Beutler, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last month, confirmed in a statement Friday that McCarthy said the President told him on the call, "'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'"
The trial recessed after the witness vote and Senate leaders tried to hash out the next steps. Calling witnesses could have opened up the trial to a lengthy new phase, as Trump's team vowed to call hundreds of witnesses in response, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Republican senators demanded that each side receive an equal number of votes.
Closing the House managers argument, Raskin played to senators' sense of history in urging them to convict the former President for inciting the rioters to attack the Capitol on January 6 and failing to stop them after the violence had unfolded.
"This is almost certainly how you will be remembered by history," Raskin said. "That might not be fair. It really might not be fair. But none of us can escape the demands of history and destiny right now. Our reputations and our legacy will be inextricably intertwined with what we do here, and with how you exercise your oath to do impartial justice."
Trump's lawyer Michael van der Veen argued that Trump did not incite a riot that had been preplanned, again repeating the falsehood that the rioters represented both left and right fringe groups, when video evidence and court documents conclusively show that the riot was perpetrated by Trump supporters.
Concerns that calling witnesses would backfire 
After the last-minute decision calling for witnesses, House Democrats ultimately decided to cut a deal because of the unpredictability of how that would turn out and fears that doing so could backfire and undermine their case, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the discussions.
Democrats didn't make a decision to call Herrera Beutler to testify until shortly before the proceedings began Saturday morning, sources said. The managers debated until nearly 3 a.m. ET Saturday morning about whether to call witnesses following news of the McCarthy call.
According to a Democrat familiar with the matter, House Democratic impeachment managers did not tell top Senate Democrats they wanted witnesses until five minutes before the proceedings. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer didn't even know until that point, but he told the managers Friday night and Saturday morning that Senate Democrats would support whatever decision the mangers made -- and reiterated that point on a caucus call Saturday.
"After the vote, it was clear the managers had no plan," the Democrat said. "Senate Democrats gave them the votes, but the managers didn't know what their next step was."
They ultimately settled on submitting her statement to the record as long as Trump's attorney made a public statement agreeing to submit it as evidence. The reason: They believed that pushing forward with her testimony would add little beyond her statement and could potentially cost them GOP support, while dragging out the proceedings further.
GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska voted in favor of witnesses. Before the vote was finalized, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was changing his vote to yes -- the idea being to support Trump's lawyers also calling witnesses in addition to the managers' request.
The sources told CNN that Democrats were uncertain how Herrera Beutler's testimony would come across after she was subject to cross examination, with some concerns that she could potentially undercut their case if there were holes in her account.
Moreover, if they called other witnesses, it could also backfire. For instance, McCarthy could provide testimony that defended Trump, undermining what they believe is a rock-solid case that Trump incited the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, the sources said.
Plus witnesses would not ultimately change GOP senators' minds, they concluded, while hearing from witnesses could bog down the Senate for weeks and imperil President Joe Biden's agenda.
With Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Angus King of Maine, who are two centrist members of the Senate Democratic Caucus, telling CNN there needed to be an equal number of witnesses on both sides, that meant that the trial could be delayed for an indefinite period, perhaps weeks. The concern was that the Trump team could try to call witnesses like Pelosi and put them in an awkward position.
And with a weeks-long delay, it could threaten Democrats' ability to advance Biden's agenda since they need consent from Republicans to schedule votes on nominees and other matters. With no consent, the Senate could be in a state of gridlock because Schumer would be forced to take procedural steps to overcome an objection, a process that takes days for each objection.
Democrats had been debating whether to call witnesses leading into Saturday's session in light of new details that have emerged with the trial underway this week. In addition to the McCarthy call, Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville confirmed that, in a call he had with Trump as the riot unfolded, he told Trump that Vice President Mike Pence was being evacuated. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, whose phone Trump had called when he spoke to Tuberville, submitted phone records showing the call at 2:26 p.m. came two minutes after Trump had tweeted an attack on Pence.
Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, one of the impeachment managers, argued that the call showed Trump was more concerned about delaying the certification of the November election than Pence's safety. Trump took no actions after learning Pence had been evacuated, Cicilline said.
GOP senators focus on constitutional argument 
While there was plenty of drama over witnesses at the trial Saturday, the reality for Democrats was that additional evidence was still unlikely to change the final outcome of the trial. The final vote was already telegraphed earlier in the week, when the Senate voted 56-44 that the impeachment trial was constitutional. The GOP senators who voted the trial of a former president was unconstitutional said that was what would determine their final vote, leaving the Senate well short of the two-thirds -- or 17 GOP senators who would have to join all 50 Democrats -- needed for conviction.
McConnell told his colleagues Saturday morning he would vote to acquit Trump, according to a source familiar with the conversations. McConnell plans to explain his decision after the final vote.
The six Republicans who voted the trial was constitutional are the GOP senators who have left open the possibility they could vote that the former President is guilty, after 10 House Republicans joined Democrats to impeach Trump in the House last month. Several of those Republican senators -- Collins, Murkowski, Romney and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana -- pressed Trump's lawyers during the Senate's question-and-answer session Friday over the actions Trump took when he learned about the riots unfolding and tweeted Pence was lacking courage while he was being evacuated from the Senate.
The House managers have argued throughout the trial that Trump should be convicted and barred from holding future office because he was responsible for the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6 and endangered the lives of lawmakers and Pence. They've made the case that Trump incited the rioters through months of false claims that the election was being stolen from him, then failed to take any action to stop the violence or condemn the rioters afterward.
The defense team offered its rebuttal on Friday in a brief presentation, in which they sought to equate Trump's rhetoric with that of Democrats, arguing that political rhetoric is protected by the First Amendment and Trump's language did not incite a riot that was pre-planned.

Statistically speaking, Idaho is one of America’s greatest economic success stories. The state has low unemployment and high income growth. It has expanded education spending while managing to shore up budget reserves. Brad Little, the state’s Republican governor, has attributed this run of prosperity to the mix of low taxes and minimal regulation that conservatives call “the business climate.”
But there is another factor at play: Californians, fleeing high home prices, are moving to Idaho in droves. For the past several years, Idaho has been one of the fastest-growing states, with the largest share of new residents coming from California. This fact can be illustrated with census data, moving vans — or resentment.
Home prices rose 20% in 2020, according to Zillow, and in Boise, Idaho, “Go Back to California” graffiti has been sprayed along the highways. The last election cycle was a referendum on growth and housing, and included a fringe mayoral candidate who campaigned on a promise to keep Californians out. The dichotomy between growth and its discontents has fused the city’s politics and collective consciousness with a question that city leaders around the country were asking even before the pandemic and remote work trends accelerated relocation: Is it possible to import California’s growth without also importing its housing problems?
“I can’t point to a city that has done it right,” said Lauren McLean, Boise’s Democratic mayor.
That’s because as bad as California’s affordable housing problem is, it isn’t really a California problem. It is a national one. From rising homelessness to anti-development sentiment to frustration among middle-class workers who’ve been locked out of the housing market, the same set of housing issues has bubbled up in cities across the country. They’ve already surfaced in Boise, Denver, Nashville, Tennessee, Austin, Texas, and many other high-growth cities. And they will become even more widespread as remote workers move around.
Housing costs are relative, of course, so anyone leaving Los Angeles or San Francisco will find almost any other city to have a bountiful selection of homes that seem unbelievably large and cheap. But for those tethered to the local economy, the influx of wealthier outsiders pushes housing costs further out of reach.
According to a recent study by Redfin, a national real estate brokerage, the budget for out-of-town homebuyers moving to Boise is 50% higher than locals’ — $738,000 versus $494,000. In Nashville, out-of-towners also have a budget that is 50% higher than locals. In Austin it’s 32%, Denver 26% and Phoenix 23%.
Frustrating as this is for prospective homebuyers, the real pain is felt among low-income tenants, a quarter of whom — about 11 million U.S. households — are already spending more than half their pretax income on rent. As rising costs filter through the market and the rent burden gets more severe, food budgets get squeezed, families double up and the most vulnerable end up on the streets.
In city after city, studies have shown that homelessness has a distinct financial tipping point. As soon as the local rent burden reaches the point where renters on average spend more than a third of their income on housing, the number of people on the streets starts to rise sharply, according to researchers at Zillow and elsewhere.
Cities are built around jobs, and the nation’s inequality reflects that. In a trend that has been exhaustively documented by economists and journalists, over the past four decades the U.S. economy has bifurcated into high-paying jobs in fields like tech and finance and low-paying jobs in retail and personal services. It could be described as two separate societies, but in U.S. metropolitan areas these societies are intertwined.
This is as true in Boise as it is in San Francisco. Some work has to be done in person. No matter how high housing costs get, there is not, as of yet, a way to telecommute to a cleaning job. So unless the hordes of expatriate Californians flocking to cheaper cities expect their children to be in remote school forever, to never again eat at a restaurant, to always tidy their own homes — and unless companies leaving California expect to do without the services of janitors and security guards — the underlying problem will persist in every next city that has the misfortune of becoming desirable.
Scholars started documenting California’s affordable housing crisis in the mid-1970s, and since then liberal and conservative economists have identified stringent zoning regulations and not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) politics as leading causes of the nation’s housing problem. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have taken up the NIMBY issue. Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development for the first President George Bush, convened a housing advisory commission whose 1991 report was called “Not in My Back Yard: Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing.”
President Barack Obama spoke against “rules that stand in the way of building new housing” in a speech in 2016, and President Donald Trump, echoing Bush, signed an executive order in 2019 establishing a White House council on affordable housing. ( Trump reversed course a year later, ending an Obama-era program intended to combat racial segregation in the suburbs.)
The problem is that opposition to new housing also has bipartisan agreement. Blue cities full of people who say they want a more equitable society consistently vote to push housing costs onto others. They will vote for higher taxes to fund social programs, but also make sure that whatever affordable housing does get built is built far away from them. Red suburbs full of people who say regulation should be minimal and property rights protected insist that their local governments legislate a million little rules that dictate what can be built where. What does it mean to respect property rights? In zoning fights, it gets fuzzy.
“Normally we think of ownership as determining who has a right to use a piece of property in a certain way,” said Emily Hamilton, an economist and director of the Urbanity Project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. But when a city tries to add density, she said, it’s common to see this framed “as harming the property rights of people who could experience changes in their neighborhood.”
It’s a distant memory now, but in the weeks before the pandemic shut down the economy, housing policy was having a minor political moment. The field of Democratic presidential candidates, including President Joe Biden, had released a flurry of federal housing proposals that varied in their particulars but revolved around a series of tax breaks, affordable housing funds and promises to encourage intransigent local governments to make it easier to build.
The track record of previous administrations suggests that the federal government can accomplish only so much. That’s why Hamilton, who closely follows local housing policies, is encouraged that there are also a flurry of proposals coming out of state and local governments.
In 2018 the City Council in Minneapolis voted to outlaw the practice of declaring some neighborhoods off limits for apartment buildings — what’s known as single-family zoning — becoming the first major U.S. city to do so. Since then, a half-dozen states have introduced bills to limit single-family zoning. Others have passed laws to prevent cities from banning backyard cottages and require them to permit more apartments. McLean, the mayor of Boise, recently started an effort to rewrite the city’s zoning code.
The action might be local, but the message should carry nationwide: The only way to solve the housing crisis is to address it in every city it affects. Otherwise, we’re just spreading it around.

Texto completo: A TSA officer is being praised for helping a confused family that landed in Portland, Oregon, instead of their intended destination more than 3,000 miles away in Portland, Maine.
A travel agency booked the family of three on a flight to the wrong airport late last year, and the family didn't realize the mistake until they landed, according to a statement from the Transportation Security Administration.
TSA Officer Martin Rios was called in to translate for the Spanish-speaking family members because their English wasn't very strong.
He found out they had arrived at Portland International Airport (PDX) at 7 p.m. the night before and had to spend the night in the terminal.
"They were at the checkpoint. They were trying to see if they could get someone to help them," Rios told CNN affiliate WMTW. "We were able to figure out that they were in the wrong Portland. ... They were pretty surprised, too."
Rios took the family to a ticket counter to get the correct tickets to Portland International Jetport (PWM) in Maine, the TSA said.
They had only about $200, so Rios used his own money to help them buy the tickets.
"(Rios) is a go getter and the fact that he chose to support these passengers in their time of need was no surprise to both his team and our leadership," said Senior TSA Manager Jeremy Alanis said in the statement. "Martin is, and has been since day one, a shining example of what it means to be a team player. (He's) the kind of officer and person any airport in the country would be proud to have as a member of their team."
He was awarded PDX's Make the Connection Quarterly Award for his customer service.
"I guess I understood their situation, being in a foreign county and with the language, you can't really communicate to anyone else and being thousands of miles away from where you're supposed to be," Rios told WMTW.
Rios said he'd heard about people flying to the wrong Portland by mistake, but this was the first time he'd seen it himself.
He said he hasn't heard from the family since the incident and hopes they got to where they needed to go safely.
"However much I helped them with, it might not have seemed like a lot to me, but it was a difference for them," Rios told WMTW.

"It" writer Stephen King is donating $6,500 to an elementary school in Maine so the students can write and publish books of their own.
The money will go to the students in the Author Studies Program at Farwell Elementary School in Lewiston who have already written two books, Principal Amanda Winslow told CNN.
CNN affiliate WMTW says the books, an original and its sequel, are about a kid's adventures during the pandemic. The students worked with Gary Savage, another Maine author, to adapt his 2016 novel "Fletcher McKenzie and the Passage to Whole."
Winslow said the students had spent four years writing the books and with King's money the 290-page manuscript would be printed and made available for purchase.
"I think it's hard for kids to really understand the lesson of perseverance and patience, but ... they're definitely starting to reap the rewards of their hard work," Winslow told CNN.

Avalanches have killed 15 people so far in February, regional experts see spike in backcountry use

Texto completo: Feb. 10Avalanches nationwide have killed 15 people in February, including Steve Houle, a Washington State Patrol trooper from Cle Elum.
Houle's body was found Monday night, according to WSP's Twitter account.
On Saturday, eight backcountry skiers were caught and four were killed in an avalanche in Utah. That same day, a snowmobiler in Montana was caught and killed as well.
That's the most recreation-related avalanche deaths in the past 100 years, the New York Times reported Tuesday. Some experts believe that's due, at least partially, to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"The snowpack is the first-order reason  people are dying because it is very dangerous," Simon Trautman, an avalanche specialist for the U.S. Forest Service's National Avalanche Center, told the New York Times. "The question is the second-order or third-order effect. I don't know, but what I do know is that there are more people out there this year because of COVID. There's just no doubt about it."
As the Times' article notes, it's also due to an unusual snowpack. In many places, including in North Idaho and Washington's Cascade range, early snow followed by a relative drought of snow, created a weak layer of surface hoar. Recent storms throughout the west have deposited new heavy snow on that buried weak layer. That's known as a persistent weak layer and makes predicting when or where an avalanche occurs harder than normal.
On Sunday, The Spokesman-Review ran a story about the tricky and dangerous avalanche conditions in the region.
Forecasters urged backcountry users to check local avalanche conditions and recreate cautiously, noting that there had been several close calls.
Regional land managers and avalanche forecasters have seen an increase in backcountry usage, although quantifying exactly how many more people is tricky.
The Colville National Forest has seen increased use, although there have been no reports of avalanches, said Starr Farrell, a spokesperson for the Colville National Forest.
"Tonasket Ranger District is definitely seeing the greatest impacts since they are closer to the mountains," Farrell wrote in an email. "The cross country and snowmobile areas have seen at least three times the visitation on the weekend versus last year. Weekday use has increased, but not to the same extent."
Meanwhile, the Three Rivers, Republic and Newport-Sullivan Lake Ranger Districts have seen an increase in visitation compared to previous years.
"The focus has been on teaching people to not walk on tracks or groomed areas," Farrell said. "We are seeing a lot more dogs visiting the forest, so that has been a teachable opportunity."
The story is similar in the Panhandle National Forest in Idaho, according to Melissa Hendrickson, a natural resource specialist and avalanche forecaster.
About 500 more people are following the Idaho Panhandle Avalanche Center's social media account and about 400 more people have joined the Panhandle Backcountry website, which is run by two IPAC board members.
"We sold out all our avalanche safety classes in record time," Hendrickson said in an email. "This is over a hundred people for both skiing and snowmobiling that are taking a Level 1 avalanche class. I know that stats are similar for the other local avalanche safety providers in this area."
Meanwhile, trailheads in the Silver Valley have seen more use and snowmobile parking lots are at capacity on nice weekends with good snow, she said.
Parking lots at Lookout Pass, which offers some of the areas most accessible backcountry skiing, have been full or overflowing with people "parking across the highway bridge and onto the ramps, which is definitely a safety issue." There have also been more RVs than normal, suggesting that many are traveling to ski in Idaho which has less restrictive COVID-19 protocols. That jam-packed parking situation has occurred every weekend since the ski resort opened.
Most concerning, though, have been reports of people trying to "hike" to remote and potentially dangerous areas, like Steven's Peak.
"This is one of the most complex and dangerous avalanche terrain areas in our region and terrifies me when I see people headed in for a hike," Hendrickson said.
There have been no deaths or serious injuries in Idaho.

Texto completo: Author Stephen King is giving back, by donating thousands of dollars to an elementary school in his home state of Maine so that a group of students can publish their own books.
King will be donating $6,500 to Farwell Elementary School, located in Lewiston, Maine, so the students in its Author Studies Program can publish the two books they've written, Farwell Principal Amanda Winslow told CNN.
As a group, the students -- some of whom have graduated and are now in middle school -- have been working on the books over the course of four years -- mapping out the character development, plot, and overall storyline with the help of another Maine author, Winslow said. The end result is two books -- an original and a sequel -- and a 290-page manuscript.
Now, the books are ready for publication, and with the help of King's donation, they'll be sent to a publishing company and available for purchase.
CNN reached out to representatives for King for comment but did not hear back.
"It was, like, mind-blowing," said seventh-grader Ella Leo to CNN affiliate WMTW.
And the books are, in part, based on the Covid-19 pandemic. The sequel novel is reworked from G. R. Savage's "Fletcher McKenzie and the Passage to Whole," to be made about a boy's adventures during the pandemic, WMTW reported.
"I've been in it for the last four years, and only the people in my school have ever gotten to read what I've written, and it's really cool to think that (now) pretty much anyone can read anything you write," fifth-grader Hailey LaBrecque told WMTW.
Winslow told CNN she's proud of the students and what they've accomplished.
"I think it's hard for kids to really understand the lesson of perseverance and patience, but they've been working on this book ... and they're definitely starting to reap the rewards of their hard work," she said.
King is the author of many acclaimed horror and thriller books, including "It" and "The Shining."

Texto completo: A fast-moving weather system could produce the second big snowstorm to hit the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions in less than a week.
Residents from West Virginia to Maine are still digging out from a record nor'easter that hit just six days ago.
Winter storm alerts stretch from northern Georgia through Maine as the system moves through on Sunday.
While this system won't be the record breaking nor'easter that dumped 18-36 inches across the regions last week, it will still pack a punch for some locations.
One interesting possibility to note is that Boston may end up getting more than three times what they picked up from the previous nor'easter. As of now, the forecast calls for 3-6 inches for the city on Sunday, far more than the 1.2 inches the city received during the last storm.
How much snow is uncertain
There is still some uncertainty about exactly how much snow the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic will get with this system.
"The factors that could limit snowfall with this system is how fast the storm tracks up the coast, and also how close to the coast the storm tracks," says CNN meteorologist Haley Brink.
"If the system tracks farther off the coast, the heaviest precipitation will be over the Atlantic. If the storm hugs the coast, the heaviest snow bands could directly impact several cities up the I-95 corridor."
Speed is an important factor with this storm compared to the previous one on Monday.
"If this coastal low tracks quickly up the coast, this will limit the amount of time snow has to accumulate," Brink said.
For most of New Jersey, Connecticut, and eastern New York, the snow will begin Sunday around sunrise and end around sunset. The storm is forecast to drop 6-10 inches in that period of time, which is several inches less than the previous storm.
"A mix of rain and snow is forecast to move north throughout the day today and bring a few inches of snow from Washington D.C. to New York City," according to the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center office. "Farther northeast, upwards of 6 to 8 inches of snow could fall across far southern New England, including Cape Cod."
For the Mid-Atlantic and southern Appalachian regions, the main concern is the freezing mark. These regions will experience rain and snow mixed together, so even a slight variation of temperature will alter how much snowfall accumulations are seen from northern Georgia up through Washington, DC.
Gusty winds combined with the heavy snowfall will reduce visibility in many of these locations.
Other impacts from this storm will include dangerous driving conditions as well as power outages.
The snow is here to stay
The coldest air of the season is set to move in across much of the lower 48 states in the coming days.
More than 40 million people across the contiguous US are forecast to see temperatures below zero over the next seven days. The coldest temperatures will be in the central US with the weather service predicting bitterly cold temperatures and dangerous wind chills in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest this weekend.
"The North Central U.S. is forecast to remain stuck under a dome of frigid temperatures that encompasses a large area from Montana to the western Great Lakes. Daily minimum temperatures both Sunday and Monday are likely to be -10 to as low -20 degrees," the Weather Prediction Center says.
From Sunday through Thursday, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Detroit will see high temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below normal, keeping them below freezing for almost a full week.
Much of the Great Lakes region and interior New England will remain below freezing for much of the upcoming week as well. This means whatever snow falls on Sunday is likely to stay there.
"Expect hazardous travel conditions on Sunday with re-freezing of snow and ice on untreated roads and surfaces Monday morning," according to the Weather Prediction Center.

Texto completo: A man charged in connection to the January 6 Capitol riot made racist and xenophobic remarks during a public hearing before the Maine legislature in 2017.
Video obtained by CNN shows Kyle Fitzsimons referring to immigrants as "replacements," echoing White nationalist rhetoric that immigrants to America are coming to wipe out White people.
From the start of his almost three-and-a-half minute speech on May 10, 2017, Fitzsimons' bigotry and xenophobia were on full display.
"I'm from New York; I'm from Rhode Island," he said, holding two license plates up. "I did grow up in those states and I have to tell you that I think they are multicultural hell holes."
CNN obtained the video from an eyewitness to the speech, who asked not to be named because of safety concerns. Mainer News was first to report Fitzsimons' remarks.
Legislature records, public records and four eyewitnesses all confirm to CNN that Fitzsimons is the man seen in the video making the bigoted remarks. His comments came during the public hearing for a proposed bill that would have largely expanded funding for teaching immigrants English, among other things geared toward helping them.
During the January 6 riot and insurrection in Washington, DC, federal prosecutors say that Fitzsimons assaulted police officers, among other crimes.
CNN has been unable to reach Fitzsimons directly but in response to the video and Fitzsimons' remarks, his public defender in the Capitol riot case told CNN, "no comment."
In the 2017 speech, Fitzsimons' arguments mirrored some of the core tenets of the White nationalist "great replacement" theory. The belief is a delusion often held by White nationalists and supremacists, and it falsely claims there's an active effort to bring in immigrants from other countries to wipe out White people.
"I'll level this at all of you because you're sitting elected officials during the opioid crisis that is affecting Maine and killing us off," Fitzsimons said. "Killing off Yankee New England cultural; you're doing nothing to do nothing about it."
He then said that the legislators were "bringing in the new third world" and that they were "bringing in the replacements."
"I was legit scared for my colleagues"
Fitzsimons then turned around, gesturing to someone in the audience who had spoken in favor of the bill. John Kosinski, who was in the audience that day, told CNN it was a Black man.
"This gentleman behind me, I believe he was on the news yesterday," Fitzsimons said. "You cleaned up very nice."
He claimed the man had been standing in front of a poster the previous day that read, "help the immigrant population navigate the juvenile criminal justice system."
"What's wrong with your culture that you need to know that much about how to teach your kids to stay out of jail," Fitzsimons said to the man.
Despite an interjection by a legislator, Fitzsimons continued his White nationalist rhetoric, saying, "Keep Maine, Maine.
"The state motto is, 'I Lead,' 'Dirigo,'" he said, alluding to the state flag. "It's got two White laborers on it; don't put them at the end of the line."
Shortly before the video ends, Fitzsimons walks away from the podium and out of frame.
"I remember the gasps," former legislator Roger Katz told CNN. Katz was the sponsor of the bill that Fitzsimons was speaking against.
He described Fitzsimons' remarks as "the most racist comment I heard in the eight years I spent [in the legislature]."
"I was legit scared for my colleagues," remembered state Sen. Mattie Daughtry, who was listening to the hearing while at the dentist.
Daughtry and state Sen. Rebecca Millett both confirmed to CNN that after the comments, a member of the Maine Capitol Police stood in the committee room during hearings for some time afterward.
"I will tell you sitting in that committee room... I felt exposed," Millett told CNN. "Not terribly safe, and unsure what this gentleman was going to do given his demeanor."
"I hope this guy doesn't shoot me in the face"
The 2017 speech wasn't the last time that Fitzsimons had a tense run-in with a member of the Maine legislature, according to state Rep. Michele Meyer.
"In the Spring of 2019, Kyle Fitzsimons, who I knew only in his capacity as an employee of a local Kittery business I shop at frequently, followed me into a parking lot, parked his truck behind my car, and positioned himself so close to my car I could not have opened the door," she told CNN in a statement. "It happened quickly."
During the confrontation, Meyer said in the statement, "he spoke of the 2nd Amendment, made disparaging remarks about the Governor and speculated America was headed to civil war over gun rights."
In an interview with CNN, Meyer said that the entire ordeal with Fitzsimons -- he was not her constituent -- lasted roughly two minutes. She, at the time, said she had co-sponsored a number of bills relating to gun safety.
She remembers she just listened to him, something she did often as a nurse with patients.
"I listened, because I didn't want to escalate the situation in any way," she said. "I had no desire to argue with him, nor to defend my position, [because] it didn't seem like that would be the wise approach on my part."
After letting him talk, Meyer says she asked him to move his vehicle so she could leave, which he did.
"When those kind of things happen a lot of things run through your head very quickly," Meyer said. "I thought very quickly -- among the fleeting thoughts I had -- was I hope this guy doesn't shoot me in the face."

The Need to Spend Without Delay in Battling the Coronavirus

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
The United States is in grave danger of repeating a central error: reacting to the coronavirus, instead of getting ahead of it.
One of the biggest failings in dealing with the COVID-19 health crisis has been moving too slowly, responding to events rather than anticipating problems and preventing them. Waiting to see how things went before imposing additional travel restrictions, wearing masks or restricting large gatherings ended up creating enormous amounts of unnecessary suffering.
Now the United States might repeat that mistake on the economic front.
Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, two of the Republicans most open to working with President Joe Biden, recently objected to considering another big bill only one month after passage of a $900 billion package. This past week, they became part of a group of 10 Republicans who recommended an alternative aid program less than one-third the size of Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion package, which is making its way through the House and the Senate along strict party lines. The group has indicated a desire to wait and see whether more will really be necessary.
They may think they are being prudent. But further delay in approving a larger relief program would be a mistake. That “wait and see” approach has proved to be deeply wrong since the pandemic began. The issue is what I have called the No. 1 rule of virus economics: If you want to help the economy, you have to stop the virus. The main economic problem faced today by the United States and much of the world remains much as it has been for almost a year: The virus is out of control and causing people to withdraw from the economy.
It’s important to recognize that this economic withdrawal is not just the result of state lockdown policies. My own research shows that places that never had lockdowns fared about the same as places that did. Regardless of the governments’ rules, people need to feel safe for the economy to flourish in much of the service sector (think airlines, dentists, beauty salons, restaurants, theme parks, and many others).
In a way, the debate over the proper federal response is about the difference between stimulus and relief.
Traditional economic stimulus like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of the Obama administration, in which I was an adviser, is money the government spends to overcome a broad downturn in the economy, in an effort to jump-start growth. Proponents of stimulus debate how to get the timing for this spending right, but the idea is to “prime the pump” so the economy starts to grow on its own.
Relief payments are different. This is money to keep someone’s gas from being shut off, prevent an eviction or keep a restaurant from declaring bankruptcy: payments that may prevent permanent damage but won’t jump-start growth. They mainly show up as catastrophes avoided. By a proper economic accounting, they have an important impact — things would be much worse if you didn’t make the relief payments — but evaluated as classic stimulus, relief payments may seem disappointing because they won’t make economic indicators start rising again.
The virus is simply not under control, so the economy needs help desperately. The package Congress passed in December was long overdue: It was needed because the original relief money was running out, and more is already needed. Relief payments are life support. To avoid permanent damage, they need to last as long as the virus does. Without them, the chance of deterioration and irrevocable harm soars.
Indeed, that dynamic may be playing out right now in the economy.
More than 10 months ago, at the end of March, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act authorized close to $2 trillion in relief. The economy began to rebound rather quickly after the initial collapse, and that apparent success led the Trump administration and Congress to delay additional relief on the grounds that it might not be needed.
But it was needed. The country did not get control of the virus — a second surge in July morphed into an even bigger third surge in November and December. Everyone should have realized that would mean more economic trouble. Instead, Congress waited until late December to enact an additional $900 billion in relief. Job growth stalled before the economy had even recovered three-quarters of the jobs lost and has now turned negative. As losses pile up, there is a real prospect of slipping into double-dip recession.
Much damage has already been done — and it is evident not only in lost jobs but in lost income and lost companies. This harm could have been prevented. It definitely should not be repeated now.
The wait-and-see strategy also neglects a hard-earned lesson in politics from 2009 when President Barack Obama was fighting the last recession. Waiting in the expectation of more aid just didn’t work. Counting on doing more “if it’s needed” relies on a common understanding of what conditions warrant action. It is premised on a spirit of cooperation — and not deliberate opposition to any bill the president puts forward. Without such an understanding, and with such implacable opposition, economic reinforcements will never arrive.
Indeed, the recent history of political dysfunction has many economists calling for the enactment of more extensive automatic stabilizer spending tied to economic conditions (like extending unemployment insurance whenever joblessness exceeds a certain threshold), so in future crises there would be less need to rely on Congress to take action.
The current problem in the United States is easy to understand. If the country gets control of the virus, the economy will grow again, as it has in places like China, South Korea and New Zealand. If the virus continues its relentless advance, the economy will need more support or the damage will become permanent. There’s no waiting-to-see-what-happens with the pandemic economy. By the time you can see it, the damage will already be spreading.
The loss from spending too much will be modest and easily fixed through monetary or fiscal action. The loss from spending too little is potentially catastrophic and would be concentrated among the people who had already been hardest hit.
These days “wait and see” is better described as “prepare to fail.” Getting ahead of the pandemic is the only way to prevent it from getting worse.

Congress passes key step to allow Democrats to pass Covid-19 relief without threat of GOP filibuster

Texto completo: Both chambers of Congress have now passed a budget resolution, a key procedural step that sets up the ability for Democrats to pass President Joe Biden's sweeping $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package without the threat of a filibuster from Republicans who oppose it.
The Senate passed the budget resolution early Friday morning 51-50 on a party line vote after Vice President Kamala Harris showed up at the Capitol to break the tie. The House passed the resolution later in the day Friday. The House had already passed the budget measure earlier in the week, but because it was amended in the Senate it needed to go back to the House for a final vote.
Passage in the Senate followed hours of voting on amendments in an exhausting ritual known as a "vote-a-rama," when senators can theoretically offer as many amendments to the budget resolution as they desire.
Those amendments largely serve as a way for each party to force the other side on the record about controversial issues, and most of the GOP amendments were defeated.
But the process also highlighted some bipartisan consensus. One of the more significant amendments came from a bipartisan group of senators, led by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, that would prevent "upper income taxpayers" from being eligible to receive $1,400 Covid relief checks. While the amendment was adopted 99-1, it is not binding and does not mean that the eligibility requirements will be changed in the final Covid relief bill. But it expresses broad consensus to make the changes.
On one closely watched issue, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa offered an amendment to prevent a hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour during a pandemic. Democrats want to include a $15 minimum wage in the Covid relief bill, but her measure could have been complicated for centrist members -- like Manchin, who has a different position than most of his caucus and supports a more modest increase in the minimum wage.
But before a roll call vote was called, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is the chair of the Budget Committee and a champion of the $15 minimum wage, intervened and said his proposal would actually make the jump to $15 over five years, not right away as Ernst had formulated in her amendment. With that, her amendment was quickly adopted by unanimous consent.
An amendment by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas in opposition to expanding the Supreme Court, the so-called practice of court packing that is advocated by some progressives to offset the conservative majority of the court, was defeated on a 50-50 vote.
What happens now?
The budget resolution that passed is not the Covid relief bill. It simply sets the stage for Democrats to be able to use a process known as "budget reconciliation" to pass the relief bill on a party-line vote, possibly in late February or March, after the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is complete in the Senate.
Embedded in the budget resolution are reconciliation instructions for multiple congressional committees to formally draft and approve legislation on things like funds for vaccine production and distribution, unemployment insurance, stimulus checks and more.
The House already passed the budget measure earlier in the week. But because it was amended in the Senate, the House had to revote on it Friday.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that next week, they will begin working on the specifics of the bill, and predicted that the House will send a bill to the Senate "hopefully in a two week period of time," so that "this will be done long before the due date" of the expiration of unemployment insurance in March.
Biden has said he is willing to go forward without the support of Republicans, but he's also stressed that he's willing to make certain concessions if it will earn bipartisan support.
A Biden aide told CNN Friday the Senate's passage of the resolution is a "positive step forward" and that the White House is "looking forward to continued progress to getting assistance to the American people."
Congressional Democrats have also made clear that they think time is of the essence on the proposal, and a deep divergence remains between Biden's $1.9 trillion and the $618 billion GOP proposal.
The counterproposal still includes $160 billion to battle the pandemic, but Republican senators want to send smaller, more targeted relief checks and only extend unemployment benefits through June, not September.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated during a briefing this week there are certain "bottom lines" that Biden wants to be in the next round of Covid-19 relief, including direct payments reaching more Americans than what the Republican proposal would include.
"His view is that at this point in our country, when 1-in-7 American families don't have enough food to eat, we need to make sure people get the relief they need and are not left behind," Psaki said, adding that the administration views the risk "is not going too big, it is going too small."
Reconciliation has been used many times by both parties to pass controversial legislation over the objections of the minority party, including then-President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act in 2010 and Trump's sweeping tax cuts in 2017.
Republicans are unhappy Democrats are resorting to the aggressive tactic, though, arguing it will set a partisan tone for the rest of Biden's presidency and that he's not operating as the political unifier he pledged to be.
The 10 Senate Republicans who met with the President to discuss his relief package are pushing for talks to continue, sending a letter to the White House Thursday that was obtained by CNN.
"We remain committed to working in a bipartisan fashion and hope that you will take into account our views as the legislative process moves forward," the group, led by Maine Sen. Susan Collins, said.
This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.
