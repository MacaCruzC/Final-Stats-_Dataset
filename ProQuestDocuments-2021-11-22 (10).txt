Texto completo: ‘Medicare for All’ best way
Editor: My experience with Medicaid and mental illness has proven to me that Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” plan is the only solution to the treatment gaps that exist in mental health care.
In 2012, I was in my third year of college, with a five-year plan, and set to graduate a semester early. Then, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I discovered that my insurance - paid for by my mother who worked at a hospital - considered therapists and psychiatrists specialists. Therefore, the co-pays were doubled.
I was deemed medically unable to work by my psychiatrist yet my monthly mental health care costs were several hundred dollars. How could I access the treatment I needed and hope to recover when my health care plan was billing my treatment as a luxury? I couldn’t.
I was and remain so thankful for the Medicaid coverage I have received since my diagnosis that drastically reduced the costs of hospitalizations and co-pays for prescriptions, counseling and psychiatrist visits. I consider myself lucky because I have had such wonderful treatment but I don’t think luck should dictate whether someone receives comprehensive healthcare coverage. Sanders’ Medicare for All bill is the only inclusive plan that addresses every aspect of health care to provide the coverage we deserve and that is why I endorse him.

Liberal joins GOP ranks
Editor: I have become a “liberal/progressive” Republican.
Too many national Democrats who are women come across as being “anti-men” and as though they dislike men. Men’s lives “matter,” too.
Research indicates that by 2044 more than 50% of the nation will be “nonwhite.” Too many national Democrats go overboard and pander to get the votes of all minority groups, including the future votes of legal and illegal immigrants.
Their love affair with illegal immigrants is really all about wanting to get their votes. They really don’t care about these people as human beings. I care more about them than they do.
Too many national Democrats come across as being anti-business. Too many no longer prioritize the economic and financial needs and struggles of our lower class and middle class as well as our poor, our near-poor and our senior citizens. They no longer fight for our federal government to do more to help at-risk groups of Americans. They no longer “have their backs.”
I miss the national liberal-Democrats of the 1960s who championed and fought for at-risk Americans.

Recovery help available
Editor: Around this time of year - especially during the holiday season - there are many stressors in general, but these are felt even more by people in recovery.
I am one of thousands of people in Lackawanna County working on sobriety every day. So far, I have more than three years.
Holiday parties, including family gatherings, New Year’s Eve bashes and even gift-shopping can be triggers. When I first got sober, I stayed away from these people, places and things.
Now, I use my life lessons to help others as a certified recovery specialist at the Wright Center for Community Health. Recovery specialists share their experiences as well as strength and hope. Services are open to anyone, as addiction does not discriminate. If an individual in crisis is willing to take steps into recovery, she can contact us by phone, online at thewrightcenter.org or simply by stopping in one of our locations, including our new building at 501 S. Washington Ave., Scranton.
Those seeking help with the Wright Center would meet with a recovery specialist to develop a recovery plan and goals and work to achieve them. I meet individuals where they are, such as in their home, a coffee shop or at an inpatient program. I believe that working with a recovery specialist as part of a support system is beneficial. We not only relate to each other, but take steps to control our destinies.
The main thing that I love about working at the Wright Center is that we function as a team, from recovery specialists to doctors and case managers. Many of us are in recovery, so we’ve been there and done that.
Recovery is not easy. But judging by how quickly my life has changed for the better, it was well worth the hard work and suggestions taken.

Lies part of Trump’s act
Editor: Sondra Myers (“Basic values under threat,” Dec. 22 ) delivered another of her tiring tirades about President Trump.
But this one has a new twist insofar as she is concerned about those “whose ideas and beliefs I share but who have crossed a line to support Donald Trump and his presidency.” Surely, if these individuals had been reading The Times-Tribune with its carping editorials, its careful selection of only those Associated Press and New York Times stories that place the Trump administration in a bad light, its editorial cartoons, each new one more despicable than the last, they should have developed the same animus as Myers.
Let’s not forget the letters to the editor that provide daily fodder for the Trump hate machine. Or, might it just be that the “line crossers” have come to realize that the country is doing very well indeed despite media bias that refuses to admit the fact.
Oh, but there are his “lies.” Trump often exaggerates, misstates and cracks crude jokes. It’s all part of his shtick. He has never uttered an untruth that has endangered the nation. Nevertheless, our cultural elites who revel in glib, carefully scripted politicians simply can’t handle this political outsider and disrupter. In retaliation, they engage in the real prevarication.
Yes, those highly placed individuals in the FBI and intelligence community who conspired to bring down a duly elected president deserve to be called “scum.” The Department of Justice inspector general has so intimated as has the chief FISA judge. The ongoing John Durham federal inquiry, now elevated to a criminal investigation, will shed further light on their treacherous deeds and it will be interesting to see how the press reacts if indictments are handed down.

Texto completo: Images and videos of child sexual abuse don't only exist in the dark corners of the internet. They are hiding in plain sight across New Mexico.
From January through Nov. 1, there were 977 investigations in the state into reports of adults creating, possessing or distributing images of child sex crimes, and committing other sex crimes against children, over the internet. That number, experts say, is more than double the number from last year. And while every viewing of those images is a crime, prosecutors say it also is a sign that a person might plan to — or already has — sexually abused a child.
"These are individuals that, generally speaking, are extremely dangerous, and a lot of times, there's this misnomer that these are just images," said state Deputy Attorney General Clara Moran.
Moran and other prosecutors do not like the commonly used term "child pornography" because it likens images of abuse to the legal, somewhat regulated industry of adult pornographic content, she said. Moran makes it plain: Many of these images are of children being raped.
While some people tend to believe such images involve children in faraway places, the reality is much different. Almost 90 percent involve children in the U.S., including New Mexico, said Anthony Maez, special agent and commander of the state attorney general's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
The task force has reviewed about 1,400 cyber-tips received from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, peer-to-peer networks and individuals, Maez said. Of the five types of crimes investigated by the group, the number involving images of child sexual abuse is by far the largest.
Not every tip leads to an investigation.
In 2019, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force has received 592 documented complaints about possession of images of child sexual abuse, 304 about distribution of such images and 63 about creation of images, according to data provided by Maez.
"The number of tips that we see coming in, the volume is very high," he said, "and unfortunately there isn't enough law enforcement officers around the state to work these types of tips."
State law enforcement agencies have ratcheted up their battle against internet crimes against children. About 276 agents across 90 local, state, military and tribal agencies investigate these crimes. Together, they have received 76 documented complaints of child enticement, 21 complaints of a person traveling to meet a child with intentions of abuse, 52 complaints of adults directing obscenities to a minor and 14 complaints of sex trafficking of children, according to data collected by the task force.
An exploding problem Maez points to the ever-evolving world of social media and apps that make it easier to exploit children.
A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed many predators connect with children through gaming or social media platforms and chatrooms — venues that weren't as accessible five to 10 years ago. In 2008, the newspaper reported, 3,000 images of child sexual abuse had been reported. In 2018, there were more than 18 million.
Each new app, Maez said, is a new opportunity for child exploitation.
Criminal complaints, grand jury indictments and affidavits for search warrants filed in New Mexico's First Judicial District Court show how prevalent the use of social media and electronic devices is when it comes to the exploitation of children.
One such affidavit, filed Nov. 18, says blogging sites Tumblr and Reddit reported a 24-year-old man from Chimayó had uploaded images of child sexual abuse. A search of online court records shows he has not yet been charged with a crime. Another affidavit, filed in 2017, goes into graphic detail about a series of videos of girls ages 7 to 10 that authorities believe were shared by a Santa Fe man on a peer-to-peer website.
Española police Detective Ernest Saucedo wrote in a Dec. 3 affidavit that he received three tips from the attorney general's internet crimes task force accusing a 21-year-old man of uploading images of child sexual abuse online using three Yahoo email addresses. The man, Austin Martinez, has been charged with one count of possession of a visual medium of sexual exploitation of a child under 13.
There is no overarching profile of a person who views graphic images of children being sexually abused. Offenders live in both rural and urban areas, and while they tend to be male, they can be of any age.
A growing fight Each month, the task force receives about 110 tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for all reports made to the cyber-tip line, as well as reports from social media companies, which monitor their sites for potential illegal activity.
Of those 110 reports in New Mexico, Maez said about 63 percent originated from a person who saw an image on Facebook and reported it or from the company's detection software.
Facebook's latest transparency report says the company removed 11.6 million child abuse images worldwide from its social network from July through September of this year. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 512,000 images.
"Each time it is shared is a revictimization of that child victim," said Matt Baca, a spokesman for the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. "It is important for people to recognize that the sharing and individual viewing is a reoffense."
Concerns over the spread of images of child sexual abuse on the internet has prompted smaller police departments to become more aggressive. Roger Jimenez, interim chief of the Española Police Department, said his agency recently began working with the task force.
"It definitely does hit closer to home for some of the officers that actually live in a community where they're investigating these specific crimes," he said.
Often, officers will already know victims or the accused, Jimenez said, and that added level of familiarity makes the cases more difficult to handle.
Finding perpetrators Task force members say the long road to success in prosecuting internet crimes against children is similar to other kinds of sensitive investigations: Extensive interviews and researching a suspect's past are key before executing a search warrant.
You get one shot to find evidence in these types of cases, New Mexico State Police Agent Jessie Whittaker said, because once a suspect knows what investigators are looking for, they often will try to destroy or hide devices containing images -- or any trace that they created or distributed them.
He could go into a house armed with a search warrant but minimal information and "get a little bit of evidence for the case — maybe nothing," Whittaker said, and then realize later that he missed something key to prosecuting the case.
"What's the chance it's going to be there that next time coming back?" he asked.
Whittaker said he seizes cellphones or other devices while executing search warrants and takes them to the FBI's Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory in Albuquerque. He either gives the agency the materials to review or reviews the evidence himself.
The internet crimes task force also operates a mobile forensics lab, as well as labs across the state, Maez said, to avoid a bottleneck of cases.
"You can't arrest someone until forensics is completed," he said.
Moran said prosecutors typically will seek detention of a suspect after criminal charges are filed. But they are not always successful. In the case of Martinez, state District Judge Jason Lidyard rejected Assistant District Attorney Ihsan Ahmed's motion seeking a detention until trial, ruling the state did not prove Martinez is a danger to the community.
Such decisions frustrate investigators and prosecutors.
"What you get a lot from the defense is that these are just images, they're just images — and that's just not true," Moran said.
Investigators say they believe people who view graphic photos and videos of child sexual abuse could be — and are likely to be — sexually attracted to children and might physically abuse a child.
"If someone is sexually attracted to children, it is not something that goes away," Moran said.
According to experts quoted in the New York Times investigation on the psychology of pedophiles, one study of 127 online offenders who had been arrested showed that less than 5 percent admitted to having molested a child. During in-depth interviews and polygraph tests, however, another 53 percent admitted to having touched a child. Moran said this holds true for New Mexico.
"Sometimes prosecutors can ask for a polygraph, and what we find is that these offenders oftentimes disclose ... they have been hands-on abusers and just haven't been caught or that they are planning to put hands on a child," she said.
Prosecutors and investigators say a law passed this year by the Legislature — the Electronic Communications Privacy Act — makes it more difficult to prosecute crimes against children.
The law requires law enforcement to obtain warrants including the specific information they are seeking on electronic devices, as well as the specific person or account targeted. It also requires that any evidence collected under a search warrant that does not fall under the specifications of the warrant be destroyed within 30 days.
That timeline sometimes does not allow for adequate development of a case involving images of child sexual abuse, Moran said.
"It's essential to these types of cases for law enforcement officers to be able to comb through all of the images," she said. In some cases, there can be terabytes of information to sift through.
Whittaker said the tight timelines also can make it difficult to retain exculpatory evidence, which can help establish a person's innocence if the suspect is arrested and his or her case goes to trial.
Privacy concerns and data breaches also have pushed social media platforms and apps to use end-to-end encryption, which makes conversations between a sender and recipient private and unable to be seen by a third party. In March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to introduce the technology on Facebook Messenger.
"If Facebook decides to encrypt everything and not (see) who is doing what on the site or have that available, the tips will go down, but the exploitation is taking place out there," Maez said.
Awareness of these crimes, though distasteful, is critical, Maez said. While the majority of investigations by the internet crimes task force involve cases in which a child has been abused previously, Maez said the group also pursues local tips to stop such abuse from ever occurring.
Each year, the task force runs a public service announcement advertising the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's cyber-tip line. Maez also holds bimonthly training on investigatory techniques, such as how to mimic a person who is posting or responding to online ads for child exploitation, dark web surveillance and the use of cryptocurrency like bitcoin to purchase images of child sexual abuse.
"We are trying to cover every possible place where an individual may exploit a child," he said.

When do crimes become terrorism?

Texto completo: One man goes on a stabbing spree at the home of a rabbi during a Hanukkah celebration. Another opens fire with a shotgun inside a Texas church with deadly results.
INSIDE, 3A
Federal hate crime charges filed against suspect in Hanukkah attack.
One shot felled gunman in Texas church attack, official says.
But when do these two apparently unrelated acts of hate during the holiday season become clear cases of domestic terrorism? And should perpetrators be prosecuted as terrorists under the law?
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn't hold back in labeling the machete attack in Monsey on Saturday night "an act of domestic terrorism." Officials have yet to characterize or offer a motive for the killing of two worshipers at the West Freeway Church of Christ in the Fort Worth suburb of White Settlement the next morning.
In the New York case, the 37-year-old suspect faces five charges of attempted murder. The criminal complaint against him, as obtained by The New York Times, says he had been researching Adolf Hitler online before the attacks. In Texas, the 43-year-old gunman was shot to death by a member of the church security team who is being hailed as a hero.
Whether or not it was the primary intent of the attackers, both incidents struck fear into those gathered as members of communities of faith. And that would basically fit the definition of domestic terrorism under the USA Patriot Act of 2001: acts violating criminal laws to "intimidate or coerce a civilian population" or to try to affect the policy or conduct of government.
Domestic terrorism may be part of the law, but prosecutors can't file it as a charge. Those deemed responsible in highly publicized incidents that many would consider acts of terrorism may face charges of homicide, assault or commission of hate crimes depending on how heinous their actions, but not a charge of inciting terror itself.
To some experts, it's a hole that ought to be filled.
"I think we do need it," said Mary McCord, legal director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former acting U.S. assistant attorney general for national security. While hate crimes can overlap with what is generally considered terrorism, having domestic terror as a separate prosecutable act would recognize it as unique.
"A lot of domestic terrorism crimes could be hate crimes. But not everything," she said. For example, she said a domestic terrorism law might better protect the U.S. from anarchists rather than just people whose hate takes on a personal agenda.
That appears to be true when it comes to suspect Grafton Thomas in the New York attack, said Jason Blazakis, director of the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism for the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
"The Thomas attack should be considered both a hate crime and an act of terrorism – these two things aren't mutually exclusive," he said.
Terrorism, along with hate, is changing. Instead of being organized in groups, many terrorists are loners.
"Today's terrorist is oftentimes the lone person who feels a connection to others who have committed violence in the past," often from readings culled on the internet, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
That could make it harder for prosecutors. "A lot of times we don't know when an act of mass violence is ideologically driven even though it may have a terroristic effect," Levin said.

Don't sleep on getting 8 hours of shut-eye

Texto completo: In theory, we all know we should be getting around eight hours of sleep per night. But for many, this may seem totally unattainable.
Whether it's stress, a busy lifestyle, or something else eating into those hours when you should be resting, eight hours of shut-eye are difficult to achieve. It might mean sacrificing time spent exercising, cooking, socializing, or playing with your kids - just to spend time asleep.
The truth, however, is that sleep is as essential to good health as eating right and exercising. Sleep is arguably the most important component of a healthy life because, without it, everything else crumbles.
In fact, there are a number of studies that conclude the more sleep you get, the longer you will live. So what happens when you skimp on those eight hours and try to function on six or even fewer?
The good
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise that between the years of 18 to 60, we need over 7 hours of sleep each and every night.
Sleep improves memory, cleanses the body of harmful inflammation, increases creativity, helps you to perform better, is responsible for higher grades in school, makes it easier to focus, helps you control your weight, makes you a happier person, and more. In essence, the proper amount of sleep is critical to enhancing everything that is good in life.
If you'd like to take a more in-depth look at sleep, consider The New York Times bestseller, Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, which takes a deep dive into the power and purpose of sleep. We also recommend Dr. Nicole Moshfegh's handy reference guide of sleeping strategies called The Book of Sleep: 75 Strategies to Relieve Insomnia.
The bad
Most people mistakenly believe that missing a few hours of sleep is the equivalent of skipping a meal - you can do it safely and you might even reap some benefits. Unfortunately, research has determined that sleeping is more akin to breathing - if your body is deprived of oxygen for even a short amount of time, it may be irreparably damaged.
Not sleeping enough prevents your body from repairing itself. You may notice that your colds linger a little longer than they should, which might not seem too horrible. On the inside, however, your blood vessels aren't healing, so your risk for cardiovascular disease increases, even if you're eating right and exercising.
When you don't sleep, your body releases insulin, which increases your risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Your need to eat will increase, making it harder to maintain a healthy weight, and your ability to make decisions will be impaired. Your overall mood will spiral, making you lose interest in people, relationships, and activities that once brought you joy.
Solutions for
a restful night
While some solutions may require lifestyle adjustments such as exercising regularly, avoiding stimulants, keeping a journal, and establishing healthier routines, there are a number of items that can help you achieve a more restful night.
Reduce stress
To better manage the accumulated stress of the day, stretch out and release the day's tension on a Clever Yoga Non-Slip Yoga Mat or gently knead those knots away with a massage pillow, like the Zyllion Shiatsu Pillow Massager with Heat. It also might be helpful to meditate before bed if you find that your mind is racing at bedtime, so a Seat Of Your Soul Meditation Cushion is a great item to keep on hand and near the bed.
Create a more restful environment
To make sure the environment is more conducive to sleep, a Sound+Sleep High Fidelity Sleep Sound Machine can help create the perfect environment with 30 non-repeating sound options that can put you in the proper mood for slumber. Additionally, Best Home Fashion's Thermal Insulated Blackout Curtains can keep light from slipping in to disturb your rest.
Prevent interruptions
The two most common reasons you're prematurely roused from a restful night's sleep are light and sound. With ASUTRA Premium Lavender Silk Eye Pillow and Flents Quiet Time Ear Plugs, you can eradicate those two distractions so you're assured a peaceful night's rest.
Increase comfort
You won't believe the difference the right accessories add to the quality of your sleep. A Casper Pillow can provide much-needed neck support while aligning your spine. A Calming Comfort's Weighted Blanket offers the luxurious feeling of security so you can effortlessly drift off in the embrace of a blissful night's sleep.
Why we can't/don't sleep
There are many factors that can keep you from getting a proper night's sleep. Following is a quick list of possible reasons why your sleep is not as effective as it should be.
Medications: Some medications make you feel drowsy and some keep you awake. Either type can interfere with your regular sleep patterns.
Stress: If something is troubling you, it can keep you from both falling asleep and having a restful night when you do.
Snoring: Whether it's you or a partner, snoring can keep you from having uninterrupted sleep. Try earplugs or a white noise machine.
Light: The light from a nightlight, a glow from a lamp, or falling asleep with the TV on can all affect the nerve bundle located behind the eyes to keep you from getting a proper night's rest. Try blackout curtains or an eye mask.
Hunger: You don't stop feeling hungry just because you fall asleep. Those pangs can make for a restless night. Try drinking a protein shake before bed.
Exercise: In almost all instances, exercise helps with sleep. The one time it doesn't is if you do intense cardio within 2 hours of bedtime. Wear a fitness tracker to make sure you're getting enough activity each day.
Stimulants: Anything that affects you, such as caffeine, chocolate, nicotine, or alcohol, can keep you from getting a good night's sleep. Switch to herbal tea if you want a cup before bed.
Interruptions: Noise, lights, and movement from your partner can all create undesirable interruptions. Even if your sleep is only momentarily disturbed, it can have a negative impact on the rest you get for the entire night.
Discomfort: If you feel any sort of discomfort, whether it is from an injury, a medical condition, or just an old pillow, you will not sleep as well as you should. Try out a new pillow or mattress topper.

Texto completo: Twenty years ago at The Times, the turn from 1999 to 2000 was commemorated with Champagne, filet mignon, a jazz band -- and more than a little Y2K anxiety.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Times Square, the site of the country's biggest New Year's celebration, was named after The New York Times. And 20 years ago, as Dec. 31, 1999, approached, The Times planned a shindig befitting the turn of the millennium. (Who cared that technically the new millennium was still a year away? This was a full four-digit change.)
Filet mignon, shrimp, prosciutto and salmon were ordered. Champagne flutes were engraved. (The copy desk most likely had not reviewed the text on them: It read "01-00-00." Oops!) Navy blue fleece vests were delivered, embroidered with the words "The New York Times Millennium Issue."
A jazz band was hired, featuring the mellifluous voice of Deborah Auer, a Times employee who had worked in news administration since the 1980s. Ms. Auer has kept her Y2K vest for two decades -- and her Champagne flute, too. She doesn't seem to mind the typo. "That was the loop in the Persian rug," she said. "They say you should never be perfect."
Long before the merrymaking unfolded at Times headquarters on 43rd Street and down the block in Times Square, the technology staff at The Times had made rather more serious, yet no less elaborate, plans of its own. Fears abounded over the Y2K bug: Some older computers used only the last two digits of the four-digit year, so that the year 2000 would be read as 1900, possibly causing crashes, crippling key systems -- and preventing the production of the newspaper, whose print advertising was at that time the company's biggest moneymaker.
Michael Williams, who was the chief information officer at the time, said Y2K anxiety led The Times to begin testing its myriad computer systems, including its 20-year-old Atex publishing system, as early as 1997. Seeing the aging equipment firsthand the following year, Mr. Williams said, he "almost had a heart attack." No improvements or upgrades had been made to the system in 20 years, he said, other than minor patches. "The only thing holding those things together was dust," he said.
The Times inspired so much loyalty in its workers, Mr. Williams said, that people who had retired or moved to other departments were eager to join a "moonlighting staff" to help shore up the computer networks.
Atex was connected to hundreds of other computer systems, meaning that "along the way," Mr. Williams said, they ran into several other issues that needed to be corrected. By Dec. 31, 1999, they were well prepared, but vigilant. "Almost everybody was on call," he said, "and those who weren't on call certainly were interested."
At 5:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve, dinner was served in the 11th-floor dining rooms as the band played and Ms. Auer sang. Ms. Auer remembered that the executive editor, Joseph Lelyveld, arrived while she was singing an up-tempo Duke Ellington tune. "Joe and Bill Keller and a couple of other people came in their tuxes, looking so great," she said.
At the same time, the technology staff at The Times was in close contact with administrators of Atex systems around the world, Mr. Williams said. As the workers learned about Atex problems that arose in other time zones, sometimes causing delays, they made sure that the newspaper's systems were solid.
"When it came time, we all sang 'Auld Lang Syne,"' Ms. Auer said. "And Joe sang. Everybody sang." And they toasted with the mislabeled Champagne flutes. "As I remember, it wasn't cold, so people ran outside to see the ball drop," Ms. Auer added.
Mr. Williams was among them, by that point breathing easy. "The only time I ever spent New Year's in Times Square was the night of Y2K," he said.
Despite the exploding media coverage of the Y2K bug, nothing actually did explode at the stroke of midnight, except for fireworks. New York rang in Jan. 1, 2000, long after much of the rest of the world -- which most definitely had not exploded -- so much of the hand-wringing over the bug proved to be unfounded.
The Times rolled off the presses around the country and in College Point, Queens, carrying the front-page article about Y2K by Steve Lohr: "Despite a few sputters and glitches, the world's computers appear to have survived the year 2000 rollover without major problems -- and with humanity's faith in technology intact, at least for another day."

Texto completo: Wyze Labs executives said the data breach, which lasted 23 days, was caused by an employee's mistake.
Choosing to gift the budget-friendly, internet-connected home-security camera from Wyze Labs was an easy decision for holiday shoppers after the gadget landed on several top tech gift guides. But on Monday, Wyze executives said that the information of 2.4 million of their customers had been exposed to the public.
Camera information, Wi-Fi network details and email addresses of customers were exposed from Dec. 4 to Dec. 27, the executives said.
The breach was made public by the Twelve Security blog on Dec. 26. Twelve Security is a consulting firm that works to create secure computing environments.
Executives at Wyze Labs were made aware of the data breach when a customer posted the blog post from Twelve Security on a Wyze online forum.
Wyze immediately began to audit its security protocols and found a second breach on Dec. 27, Dave Crosby, a co-founder of Wyze, said Monday. An investigation into the breaches is ongoing.
The indoor home-security camera was a popular gift for the holidays. This year, Wirecutter and CNN put the one made by Wyze Labs on their lists of top tech gifts. (Wirecutter is a review website owned by The New York Times Company.)
Wyze Labs offers a discreet, Wi-Fi connected camera at the budget price of $ 20. Other indoor cameras sold by Ring or Nest start at $ 60 or $ 200.
The first Wyze breach occurred after an employee created a flexible database to quickly pull user analytics, such as camera connectivity rates, user growth and the number of devices connected per user, Mr. Crosby said.
That employee removed the security protocols on the new database, exposing customers' personal information. Customers' passwords were not saved on the breached database, so hackers could not access live camera feeds, said Dongsheng Song, a co-founder at Wyze.
"We didn't properly communicate and enforce our security protocols to new employees," Mr. Song said. "We should have built controls, or a more robust tool and process to make sure security protocols are followed," he added.
Wyze executives said that the employee who made the mistake is still employed at the company.
"It was an accident," Mr. Crosby said. "We are very, very sorry and taking it very seriously."
Wyze plans to send an email to its customers on Monday night detailing the first breach and the actions the company is taking to further protect their information, Mr. Crosby said.
In a time where people expect to be connected around the clock, home indoor security cameras are having a moment.
New parents want to keep their eyes on a fussy newborn. Pet owners want to make sure that the family dog isn't chewing through their closets when they aren't home.
A cloud-enabled, Wi-Fi-connected home-security camera alleviates many of those worries. But the convenience of keeping tabs on things may create an opportunity for hackers.
"Consumers have zero control," Jennifer King, the director of consumer privacy at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, said on Monday. "We are definitely at the point where if we want to change anything, we need regulation."
In the last month, there have been several cases of hackers gaining access to indoor home-security cameras. In one case, a hacker called the child of a biracial couple a baboon. In another case, a hacker told a child that he was Santa Claus and called her a racial slur.
"The more all of this data goes on the cloud, the more vulnerable we are," Dr. King said. "If the company isn't necessarily practicing the best security practices you can do all you can and you're still going to be exposed."
The United States has yet to enact a consumer data protection law and an independent agency to enforce it. Americans have the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that oversees policy privacy but has increasingly failed to police tech companies.
"The F.T.C. is an old agency and they don't have the same rule-making authority that an agency like the Environmental Protection Agency has," Dr. King said.
Some senators have tried to create a space for consumer data to be protected by the F.T.C. In October, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, introduced the Mind Your Own Business Act. The bill would allow the F.T.C. to impose fines for privacy violations and would make it a crime for companies to lie to regulators about their data practices.
While Congress has not yet passed federal legislation to provide consumers with protections against data breaches, all 50 states and D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted laws that require companies like Wyze to make their customers aware of data breaches that involve their personal information, Riana Pfefferkorn, the associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said in an email Monday.
"In recent years an increasing number of states have enacted data security laws as well," Ms. Pfefferkorn said. "Those laws require entities that hold personally identifiable information about a state's residents to make reasonable efforts to secure that information -- to prevent a breach from happening in the first place."
Affected consumers often bring class-action lawsuits against companies for careless security practices.
"We can anticipate that Wyze will be hit with regulatory investigations and consumer lawsuits in the near future," Ms. Pfefferkorn said.
Executives at Wyze said they understood that their customers' trust is what keeps the company in business.
"Our whole business model is built on trust," Mr. Crosby said.
Ms. Pfefferkorn said consumers should be conscious of how much cloud-enabled tech they truly need.
"Consumers should be wary of low-priced 'smart home' devices -- what you save in money, you might pay for with a breach of your sensitive information," Ms. Pfefferkorn said. "In addition, consumers should think twice about just how 'smart' they need, say, a scale to be anyway."

Texto completo: WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas (AP) — Two people were killed in a shooting at a church near Fort Worth, Texas, on Sunday morning and a third person has been taken to a hospital in critical condition, officials said.
MedStar Mobile Healthcare spokeswoman Macara Trusty told the Associated Press that two people were fatally shot at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement. A third person in critical condition is being treated at a hospital and all of the victims are male, she said. MedStar is an ambulance service.
Authorities have released scant details about the victims, the shooter and what led to the attack.
An elder at the church told the New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter, calling him a dear friend.
“He was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us,” said the elder, Mike Tinius.
“It’s extremely upsetting to see anyone committing violence,” he said.
Tinius said he didn’t know the gunman and that the shooting appeared to be random.
A woman who answered the phone at the West Freeway Church of Christ told the AP she could not answer any questions and that she was told to direct inquiries to authorities.
WFAA, a Dallas-based TV station, reported that the church live-streamed the service on YouTube and that the video showed a man wearing a long coat produce a rifle or a shotgun which he fired twice before someone shot back. Some members of the congregation ducked behind pews while others with handguns rushed the gunman, WFAA said. It said church members can be heard screaming and crying.
The AP hasn’t seen the video, which is marked as private on the video-sharing website.
Trusty said she was told by a supervisor at the scene that one of the people who died was the shooter. In an interview with Dallas TV station KTVT, Mike Drivdahl, the spokesman for the Fort Worth Fire Department, said he believes the gunman was among the three who were shot. White Settlement police have not responded to AP requests for comment.
Two people with minor injuries were treated at the scene, Trusty said.
Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state to pray for the victims, their loved ones and the community of White Settlement, about 8 miles west of Fort Worth.
“Places of worship are meant to be sacred, and I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life,” Abbott said in a tweeted statement.
It is not the first deadly shooting to take place at a church in Texas. In November 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on the congregation at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing more than two dozen worshippers, before taking his own life.

Liberal Media Scream: Chuck Todd disses Trump supporters, ‘believe in fairy tales’

Texto completo: This week’s Liberal Media Scream features Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, this time quoting a letter to the editor claiming that supporters of President Trump “believe in fairy tales.”
On Sunday, he highlighted a “fascinating” letter to a newspaper, which suggested that people support Trump “because people have been trained, from childhood, to believe in fairy tales” and “the more fairy tales and lies he tells, the better they feel.”
Still reading, Todd said, “Show me a person who believes in Noah’s ark, and I will show you a Trump voter.”
iFrame Object
Todd proceeded to make clear the letter matches the view of his staff, as he relayed how something “my executive producer likes to say, is ‘Hey, voters want to be lied to, sometimes. They don’t, they don’t always love being told hard truths.’”
Todd devoted the Dec. 29 edition of his show to “Alternative Facts: Inside the Weaponization of Disinformation.”
Todd read the letter during a segment with guests Marty Baron and Dean Baquet, the top editors of the Washington Post and New York Times, respectively:
“I want to read you guys a letter to the editor that we found in the Lexington Herald-Leader. It was a fascinating attempt at trying to explain why some people support President Trump. Here’s what he says. ‘Why do good people support Trump? It’s because people have been trained, from childhood, to believe in fairy tales. This set their minds up to accept things that make them feel good. The more fairy tales and lies he tells, the better they feel. Show me a person who believes in Noah’s Ark, and I will show you a Trump voter.’ Look, this gets at something, Dean, that my executive producer likes to say, is ‘Hey, voters want to be lied to, sometimes. They don’t, they don’t always love being told hard truths.’”
Media Research Center Vice President of Research Brent Baker explains our weekly pick: “That Todd felt so comfortable about showing such disdain for the ‘deplorables’ who support Trump, with a twist of anti-Christian bigotry thrown in, shows just how little respect those in the press corps have for those with a differing political view. Todd would never deride any ‘fairy tales’ believed by liberal voters and it’s hard to imagine him daring to make such a flippant remark about the religious beliefs of any religion other than Christianity.”

Texto completo: Una nueva investigación periodística revela que altos cargos de la administración Trump expresaron su inquietud ante la retención de la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que el país del este de Europa anunciara investigaciones en contra de rivales políticos del presidente estadounidense.
El New York Times publicó el pasado domingo una descripción detallada de la consternación que habían mostrado los funcionarios que tenían que implementar las órdenes que finalmente llevaron a Trump a un juicio político este mes de diciembre.
El reportaje del Times muestra a una administración dividida entre los cargos que apoyaban la decisión de Trump de detener la ayuda y quienes cuestionaban la legalidad, moralidad y las posibles consecuencias de las intensiones del presidente.
La investigación asegura que el secretario de Defensa, Mark Esper; el de Estado, Mike Pompeo y el exasesor de seguridad nacional, John Bolton intentaron sin éxito convencer a Trump de emitir la ayuda durante una conversación que tuvieron en la oficina oval.
“Esto es por el interés del país”, diría Bolton mientras Esper trataba de hacer ver a Trump los beneficios que traería a Estados Unidos una Ucrania fuerte. Pero ninguno de los argumentos movieron un ápice la postura del presidente , que siguió ordenando la retención de la ayuda hasta que, en septiembre, cuando saltaron las alarmas de que un informante secreto había revelado el escándalo.
El Times también halló que Mick Mulvaney, jefe de gabinete y de la oficina de Administración y Presupuesto, coordinó a funcionarios para detener la ayuda. Esos mismos funcionarios se encargaron primero de negar los hechos y de culpar a otros de la administración cuando se intensificó el escrutinio en su contra.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - They were 235 days that shook the world, rattled China's regime and refuted the most pernicious wishful thinking since the appeasement of dictators collapsed eight decades ago. Nothing more momentous happened in 2019 than Hong Kong's heroic insurrection.
It began with the April 3 introduction by Beijing's Hong Kong satraps of an extradition bill that would have facilitated the sweeping of inconvenient people into the mainland's suppression machinery that is both Kafkaesque and Orwellian. The convulsions culminated in, but did not end with, Nov. 24's cymbal-crash elections in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which had counted on the island city's majority to rebuke the demonstrators, learned the limits of its sterile program of purchasing subservience by promising prosperity.
Elsewhere on China's periphery, Taiwan has a presidential election in less than two weeks. China's President Xi Jinping began 2019 with a Jan. 2 speech identifying Taiwan as the focus of his campaign to make China great again. If - when, probably - on Jan. 11, 2020, Taiwan reelects President Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese will have joined Hong Kongers in disdaining the "one country, two systems" fudge as a formula for the incremental suffocation of freedom.
Thirty autumns ago, as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union teetered, approximately 1.5 billion people lived under communist regimes. Today, approximately 1.5 billion people still do. The 1989 figure was 29% of the world's population compared with 20% in 2019, but 89% of today's 20% are caught in the tightening vise of China's Leninism, whose inviolable tenet is that nothing shall challenge the party's supremacy.
With this year's revelations about the million, or perhaps millions, swept into the gulag archipelago in northwestern China, it is possible to hope that in 2020 we will hear less from American businessmen who are as obtuse as they are cocksure. Just 51 days before The New York Times published more than 400 pages of documents on China's concentration camps, presidential aspirant Michael Bloomberg said the CCP's leaders "listen to the public," and "Xi Jinping is not a dictator."
Not content to just "listen to" the public, the CCP, using ever-more-sophisticated technology, surveils almost everything done by almost everyone. Perhaps 2019 foreshadowed the day when today's Bloombergs will be remembered as Charles Lindbergh and others are remembered because they thought dictators in the 1930s were "the wave of the future."
Would that America's serial grovelers had the gumption of the creators of "South Park." When China, a supposedly great power that was actually discombobulated by this animated TV series, banned it, the creators said: "We welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. ... Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. ... Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?"
"We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi," said America's president, who also said of Xi: "He's a friend of mine."
North Korea's Kim Jong Un does not have to settle for mere friendship - in 2018 Trump said "we fell in love" - but in 2019 the romance seemed unreciprocated. Kim ended a 522-day self-imposed moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but Trump minimized their importance because the missiles could not reach the continental United States - just South Korea, Japan and the 80,000 U.S. forces in both places. However, North Korea has given Trump until right now - the end of this calendar year - to make additional U.S. concessions, beyond the scaling back of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, to avoid "shocking punishment." Fresh concessions are North Korea's price for resumption of negotiations that will lead, if the future is like the last 25 years, to other concessions.

MEXICAN AMERICANS STILL GRIEVE FOR EL PASO IT WAS A BLUE HOLIDAY FOR MANY ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST

Texto completo: SAN DIEGO
In El Paso - and throughout the Southwest - many Mexican Americans had a blue Christmas.
This year, our hearts are filled with pain because, fewer than 150 days ago, a white man who was terrified of brown people picked up a high-powered rifle and drove more than 10 hours to that border city. Then he allegedly opened fire at a Walmart aiming to - as police say he told them - "kill as many Mexicans as possible."
Twenty-two people died that day. Last month, residents witnessed the unveiling of a memorial to the victims - a 30-foot-tall golden obelisk called the "Grand Candela" - in the parking lot of the big box store, which has now reopened.
People were just starting to get back on their feet. Then came the wallop of Christmas.
On Aug. 3, anyone who looked Mexican was a target - no matter which side of the border they call home.
The day after the massacre, my wife and I were having Mexican breakfast - huevos con chorizo - with my parents. My dad couldn't wrap his head around the idea that, if he had been at that El Paso Walmart that day, he might have been killed. He was born in the United States, and English is his primary language. He served in the U.S. Army and spent 37 years in law enforcement. He takes as a given that he belongs on this side of the border. Yet, because he also has dark skin, he would have probably been singled out.
For the nation's nearly 30 million Mexican Americans, the shooting was a poignant "guess what" moment. Over the past few months, I've had heartfelt conversations with other Mexican American journalists about the tragedy that brought us down to earth. For those of us who have earned passage on the American Dream Express, the blood spilled in El Paso forces us to think about the price of the ticket.
One veterano journalist, an El Paso native, described how - despite the fact that he has, at 60, checked off all the items on his personal "bucket list" - he had begun to feel like a "failure." It wasn't because of where he was in life, but because he knew that life was so difficult - and in some cases, dangerous - for other Mexican Americans. Nobody wins unless everybody wins.
Trapped between Mexico and the United States, between whites and blacks, Mexican Americans are cursed to spend our lives invisible. The media lets African Americans speak for us. Hollywood casts white actors to depict us. In the presidential race, political pundits welcomed an Irishman named Robert Francis "Beto" O'Rourke as a stand-in for Mexican American Julian Castro.
When they visit the Southwest, the 2020 Democratic front-runners - Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders - boil down their outreach to the only three issues they think Mexican Americans care about: immigration, immigration and immigration.
Americans will mark the anniversaries of Selma, Kent State, Wounded Knee and the Stonewall riots - any tragedy with a constituency - for decades after the event.
Yet, over the last few months, many people have been eager to get past the worst massacre of Mexicans and Mexican Americans since the land grab known as the U.S.-Mexican War. One reader told me to stop writing about the shooting, lest I become "just another obnoxious Mexican."
I won't stop. For a columnist, "obnoxious" is part of the job description. Besides, the people who died deserve to be remembered, along with why they died. Let's not sugarcoat racism to make it easier to swallow. We can't stamp it out for good, until we call it out by name.
In a hail of bullets, we got the message loud and clear. Some of you will never see us as your equal or accept the fact that we belong in this country as much as you do.
That's your problem. We're here. We've been here for generations. In fact, when your grandparents came out to the Southwest from Ohio, Missouri and Oklahoma, we welcomed them. And we're not going anywhere.
Meanwhile, in the border city they call "El Chuco," it's no surprise that the song "Amor Eterno" (Eternal Love), by the Mexican singer Juan Gabriel, has become the unofficial anthem of the horror.
"Tanto que me duele que no estes. ... Como quisiera que tu vivieras."
(How much it pains me that you're not here. ... How I wish that you were still living.)
The haunting ballad will break your heart, just like the atrocity that left so much of my community limping into this holiday season battered and bruised. But not broken.

BUTTIGIEG KNOCKS BIDEN ON IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg on Sunday knocked Joe Biden for his vote in favor of authorizing military force against Iraq in 2002 when the former vice president was a senator, calling it "the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime."
"Well, I certainly respect the vice president, but this is an example of why years in Washington is not always the same thing as judgment," Mr. Buttigieg told Iowa Public Television in a Sunday morning interview while campaigning in the state. "He supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime, which was the decision to invade Iraq."
Mr. Biden has faced criticism for his support of the war, though he later became a vocal critic of the conflict. In 2002, then a senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden voted in favor of the Iraq War resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to attack Iraq if Saddam Hussein refused to give up weapons of mass destruction as required by United Nations resolutions. The Senate passed the resolution in a 77-23 vote, with support from both sides of the aisle.
The intelligence used by the Bush administration that claimed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction has since been discredited, and support for the war has declined in the years since it began.
Mr. Biden has said his vote for the Iraq War resolution was a "bad judgment," and that he "was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration," in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion - though a CNN fact check into Mr. Biden's claims found him defending his vote well into 2003.
For his part, Mr. Buttigieg, a military veteran, declined to say Mr. Biden's vote was disqualifying in his run for president, telling CNN at a subsequent stop in Knoxville.
Pressed on whether Mr. Biden has the foreign policy judgment to be president, Mr. Buttigieg dodged.

U.N. Rebuke For Myanmar Over Rohingya

Texto completo: The General Assembly passed a resolution denouncing human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minority groups.
UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations General Assembly has approved a resolution strongly condemning rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minority groups in Myanmar, including arbitrary arrests, torture, rape and deaths in detention.
In a 134-9 vote with 28 abstentions on Friday, the body approved the resolution, which also calls on Myanmar's government to take urgent measures to combat incitement of hatred against the Rohingya and other minorities in the states of Rakhine, Kachin and Shan. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they often reflect world opinion.
Myanmar, where most citizens are Buddhist, has long considered the Rohingya to be "Bengalis" from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all Rohingya have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering the group stateless, and they are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.
The Rohingya crisis exploded in August 2017, when Myanmar's military launched what it called a clearance campaign in Rakhine State in response to an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. The campaign led to an exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh and to accusations that security forces had committed mass rapes and killings and burned thousands of homes.
Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations, U Hau Do Suan, called the resolution "another classic example of double standards" and "selective and discriminatory application of human rights norms designed to exert unwanted political pressure on Myanmar."
He said the resolution did not attempt to find a solution to the complex situation and refused to recognize government efforts to address the challenges.
The resolution, the ambassador said, "will sow seeds of distrust and will create further polarization of different communities in the region.""
The resolution raised alarm at the continuing influx of Rohingya Muslims into neighboring Bangladesh over the last four decades. The displaced now number 1.1 million, including 744,000 who arrived since August 2017 "in the aftermath of atrocities committed by the security and armed forces of Myanmar."
The Assembly also cited an independent international fact-finding mission's documentation "of gross human rights violations and abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities" by security forces, which the mission said "undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law."
The resolution called for an immediate cessation of fighting and hostilities.
It reiterated "deep distress" at reports that unarmed people in Rakhine State continue to be subjected to abuses by the military and security forces.
The resolution also called for Myanmar's forces to protect all people, and for urgent steps to ensure punishment for rights violations.
It also urged the government "to expedite efforts to eliminate statelessness and the systematic and institutionalized discrimination" against the Rohingya and other minorities, to dismantle camps for Rohingyas and others displaced in Rakhine, and "to create the conditions necessary for the safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of all refugees, including Rohingya Muslim refugees."
It noted that the Rohingya have twice refused to return to Myanmar because of the absence of these conditions.

Texto completo: Chuck Todd highlighted a letter to the editor that claimed anyone who believes in “fairy tales” such as the Biblical story of Noah’s ark supports the president during a special ripping President Trump.
Todd used the full hour on Sunday's Meet the Press to discuss disinformation campaigns, which he compared to Trump propaganda. As part of the special, he referenced a letter to the editor of the Lexington Herald-Leader by David Bowles. In the letter, Bowles claimed people only support Trump because they believe his “fairy tales.”
“The question of the decade is: Why do people support President Donald Trump? We all know why white supremacists do, that is obvious. But why do good people support Trump? It’s because people have been trained from childhood to believe in fairy tales,” Bowles wrote.
He later continued, “The more fairy tales and lies he tells, the better they feel. Trump is a master liar who knows what makes people feel good and that is what he goes with. [...] Show me a person who believes in Noah’s ark and I will show you a Trump voter. There are multiple solid scientific reasons the ark did not happen. Some people learn this and some don’t, and those who don’t will accept Trump. But can the world survive on fairy tales?”
Todd called the letter a “fascinating attempt to try and explain why some people support President Trump" and suggested that perhaps "voters want to be lied to" sometimes.
New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet and Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron responded to the letter by pushing back on the accusation that voters "want to be lied to" and by explaining that the president’s supporters deserve respect from the media.
“We can’t dismiss everybody that supports Donald Trump,” Baquet said. “I think we have to get out in America much more than we do and talk to people.”

Texto completo: Several of the people gathered at a Hanukkah celebration likely saved the lives of their peers by throwing furniture at a man as he attacked the Jewish gathering with a machete Saturday night.
Josef Gluck, 32, recounted the horrific attack that took place on the seventh night of the Jewish festival. In an interview with the New York Times, Gluck explained that the attacker, who has been identified by police as Grafton Thomas, 37, shouted, “I’ll get you,” as he continued to swing his machete.
“At the beginning, he started wielding his machete back and forth, trying to hit everyone around,” Gluck explained, later adding, “I grabbed an old antique coffee table, and I threw it at his face.”
Gluck and his fellow worshipers forced Thomas to flee the home by continuing to beam him with pieces of furniture. In total, five of the Hasidic Jews gathered to celebrate Hanukkah were harmed in the attack. Two are still in serious condition.
Thomas was arrested by authorities two hours after the attack took place. He was found after authorities tracked his license plate to his home address, which was north of Monsey, New York, where the attack took place. Thomas pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary during his arraignment on Sunday morning, and a judge set his bail at $5 million.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the attack an "act of domestic terrorism" during a press conference Sunday morning.
“We have seen enough in New York,” Cuomo said. “This is violence spurred by hate. It is mass violence, and I consider this an act of domestic terrorism. Let’s call it what it is. These people are domestic terrorists, and the law should reflect that, and they should be punished as if it was an act of terrorism.”
President Trump also condemned the attack, vowing to "fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism" in a tweet expressing his condolences.

Texto completo: Writer Gracy Olmstead penned an op-ed for the New York Times earlier this month that carried the headline, "Taking from the poor, giving to the wealthy."
I thought to myself that there's been an awful lot of that going on lately.
Olmstead was talking about the Trump administration's plans to make it tougher for some people to qualify for food stamps or SNAP, as the program's now called. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the feds will no longer grant states waivers from requiring able-bodied adults to work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive help.
Some states, particularly those that have areas of economic distress - in other words, few job opportunities - have been granted permission not to enforce the federal rule.
Perdue quipped that "we need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand." His action means that 700,000 low-income Americans will lose their eligibility.
Olmstead pointed out that Perdue isn't so persnickety about government handouts when it comes to wealthy agribusinesses under his purview. Yes, we all understand that there's a financial crisis in the agriculture industry thanks to declining milk prices and, of course, Donald Trump's tariff war.
But, the $28 billion package to assist farmers has mainly gone to the big corporate farms, not those struggling family farms we all care about. According to the Environmental Working Group, one farm alone has received $2.8 million - more money than it actually lost during this crisis.
Then there's that 2017 tax cut, supposedly Donald Trump's signature domestic achievement. As we get deeper into that "tax reform," it's being discovered that the poor aren't faring well. Under the act, for instance, the federal child tax credit was increased to $2,000 per child.
But, low-income families are now discovering that because their jobs don't pay enough, the tax credit is nowhere near that figure. According to a Columbia University study, among those excluded from the full credit are 50% of Latino individuals, 53% of black individuals and 70% children with single mothers.
Nor have the cuts resulted in increased wages as had been promised. Big corporations that had stashed money overseas brought it back, all right, but didn't invest it in wage hikes, using it instead to buy back stock from investors. Meanwhile, we now learn that many of these corporations have been able to avoid federal income taxes at all. The average tax load on corporations has now dropped to less than 12%, the rate paid by individuals earning more than $13,851.
Here in Wisconsin, you couldn't help but notice the irony in the squabble last week over whether the Foxconn deal needs to be rewritten, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos vigorously defending the $4 billion subsidies to the highly profitable international conglomerate.
And at the very same time, Vos applauded the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee for refusing to cave in to Gov. Tony Evers and release $3 million to help bolster homeless programs in the state. Legislative leadership found it necessary, though, to give itself a raise in per diem money.
So, yes, there's a lot of taking from the poor and giving to the rich these days.
If I have one wish for 2020, it's that it will be a year when we return to our senses.

Texto completo: Las plantas de procesamiento de pollo donde hubo redadas en Mississippi el pasado agosto han recuperado una parte de fuerza laboral.
Un informe del New York Times revela que miembros de la comunidad negra en la región han tomado las plazas de trabajos en plantas como Koch Foods. El reporte indica que muchos fueron contratados en los días posteriores a las redadas en las que 680 inmigrantes hispanos fueron detenidos.
Los trabajadores negros volvieron a la industria en la que laboraron entre finales de la década de los 60 y mediados de los 80, antes de que las plantas decidieran ir por trabajadores migrantes a México para bajar costos operativos, motivados por la oportunidad de ganar más de $11 dólares por hora. Esos sueldos no se pueden ganar en tiendas minoristas o restaurantes de comida rápida, donde el pago es el mínimo del estado ($7.25).
Un gerente de un restaurante Sonic Drive-In dijo al diario neoyorquino que perdió 10 empleados a los pocos días de las redadas.
El reportaje de Richard Fausset también hace un recuento del dilema ético para los trabajadores negros ya que muchos lamentan la separación de familias hispanas y la persecución a los inmigrantes. Muchos son solidarios porque recuerdan los tiempos de la esclavitud.
Finalmente, el texto deja claro que el trabajo en las plantas de procesamiento de pollo es calificado como “duro” por los trabajadores. Esto lleva a pensar que la contratación actual podría estancarse, y las empresas podrían enfrentar a una escasez de trabajadores en el futuro.

Nonprofit boards and your personal liability

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

'Psychopath': SEALs decry Gallagher; Shut out of war crimes trial, Iraq veterans get a chance to speak out against Navy officer.

Texto completo: Navy SEALs who were never called to testify in the war crimes trial of Chief Petty Officer Edward R. Gallagher told naval criminal investigators about behavior they witnessed, including the alleged stabbing of a wounded Islamic State fighter that led to murder charges against Gallagher.
The two SEALs were granted immunity to testify in the trial last summer but were never called to do so.
Their interviews with criminal investigators will be available for streaming Friday on Hulu, on "The Weekly" from the New York Times. It will be broadcast on FX on Sunday at 10 p.m.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service conducted the SEAL interviews more than a year before the court-martial of Gallagher, who was charged and acquitted of several war crimes counts, including murder.
One of those SEALs -- Petty Officer 2nd Class Ivan Villanueva -- told investigators he witnessed the stabbing of a wounded Islamic State fighter that led to murder charges against Gallagher.
"I saw it happen," Villanueva says during his interview.
The Navy has never explained why Villanueva was not called to testify at Gallagher's court-martial, and did not respond to inquiries on Thursday.
The case created a national firestorm as President Trump intervened again and again on Gallagher's behalf -- and culminated this week with a visit by Gallagher and his wife, Andrea, with Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
Trump and other supporters say "warfighters" don't need their actions questioned by bureaucrats in the military.
While the accounts of the witnesses aren't new -- the San Diego Union-Tribune published a summary of their stories on the eve of trial -- hearing those accounts from the witnesses themselves is.
The episode, titled "The Gallagher Effect," presents these SEALs' stories in their own words and voices, framing their actions as courageously going against the traditional brotherhood of the Navy SEALs.
In separate interviews, the SEALs tell NCIS agents that Gallagher behaved like a "psychopath" during their 2017 deployment to Mosul, Iraq, where the platoon took on Islamic State. One by one, his men tell NCIS that their platoon served as Gallagher's "personal sniper escort" and that the chief was "medal chasing."
They also describe his actions during the deployment as war crimes.
"I saw Eddie take a shot at probably a 12-year-old kid," one says.
Three SEALs tell investigators they saw Gallagher stab a wounded Islamic State fighter in the neck.
These interviews led to the murder charges against Gallagher in 2019 -- charges the SEAL denied. He was found not guilty in July of murdering the wounded fighter and shooting civilians.
Gallagher says his men made up the accusations because they were unhappy with his leadership style.
In a written statement sent via his attorney, Gallagher said: "My first reaction to seeing the videos was surprise and disgust that they would make up blatant lies about me, but I quickly realized that they were scared that the truth would come out of how cowardly they acted on deployment. Soon after I got to the brig at Miramar, one of these guys came to visit me and apologize for what they did but that they had to stick with the fake stories or be charged with making false statements."
Gallagher's attorney, Tim Parlatore, told the Union-Tribune in an interview Thursday that there was nothing new in the videos and predicted the New York Times would edit and cherry-pick which parts of the statements to air.
"You're never going to understand these interviews without a trained criminal investigator looking at it," Parlatore said. "Those videos were so helpful to me -- they gave me a road map to acquittal."
According to Parlatore, the full videos revealed flawed NCIS interrogations that were key to his trial preparation.
"No question, these videos demonstrate all of the failings of the investigation," Parlatore said. "They were fantastic -- very rarely in a case do you have something as great as these videos to help you prepare."
One witness in the videos is Corey Scott, a petty officer 1st class who, along with Gallagher, was treating the wounded Islamic State fighter's injuries after he was wounded in an airstrike. Part of the medical treatment involved inserting a breathing tube into the man to treat what witnesses said was "blast lung."
Scott told NCIS in his interview that he saw Gallagher stab the fighter multiple times and that he remained with the man until he died. At trial, however, Scott told a different version of his story -- one in which he says he killed the fighter after Gallagher stabbed him just once.
In court, Scott said that after Gallagher stabbed the fighter, Scott suffocated him by covering his breathing tube.
Audio of Scott's court-martial testimony -- and his startling admission -- is included in "The Weekly."
Parlatore said he knew Scott wasn't telling the whole story during a preliminary interview when Scott told him the fighter had suffocated.
"His lawyer shut me down" during that interview, Parlatore said. "He wouldn't let me ask [more questions] until they worked out the immunity issue."
Also included in the videos are statements by Villanueva and another witness, Petty Officer 1st Class Joe Arrington. Both were granted immunity to testify, but prosecutors never called them to the stand.
According to Navy investigation records, Arrington saw Gallagher shoot civilians. Villanueva told investigators he saw Gallagher stab the wounded Islamic State fighter.
Arrington, Villanueva and Scott all share the same attorney, Brian Ferguson. After Scott's testimony, prosecutors appeared to change course in the trial and did not call Villanueva or Arrington to the stand.
A Navy prosecutor at the time declined to answer a Union-Tribune question about why Villanueva -- who told investigators he saw the stabbing -- was never called to testify.
Ferguson declined to comment.
The case gained renewed importance in November, when Trump intervened and granted Gallagher clemency, restoring his rank to chief petty officer and undoing a rank reduction ordered by a military jury.
Although the jury acquitted Gallagher of the most serious charges against him, it found him guilty of posing for a photo with the corpse of the Islamic State fighter he was accused of killing.
After Trump restored Gallagher's rank, the Navy moved to strip Gallagher of his SEAL trident and boot him from the elite community. The president pushed back in Gallagher's favor and, before all was said and done, Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer lost his job over his handling of the case.
Gallagher retired from the Navy in November.
"The Weekly" also delves into Gallagher's activity on social media after he was accused. Gallagher has lashed out at his perceived enemies, including Navy prosecutors, Navy Special Warfare Commander Rear Adm. Collin Green and the witnesses who turned him in, who he and some supporters refer to as the "Mean Girls."
One SEAL who testified against Gallagher told the Union-Tribune on Tuesday he is frustrated that Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) and Trump got involved in the case.
"When you look at politicians getting involved in military justice -- whether it's a congressman from San Diego or the president -- with their involvement, it isn't justice," the witness said. "It's political, when shooting civilians and executing prisoners shouldn't be."
The witness spoke to the Union-Tribune on condition of anonymity, saying he still fears for his safety.

Texto completo: A father and two children, ages 9 and 16, who died in a pool at a resort on the Costa del Sol, found themselves in deep water and unable to get out, the authorities said.
LONDON -- The deaths of a father and two children who drowned in a swimming pool at a resort in southern Spain this week were "a tragic accident" that came about because none of the victims knew how to swim, the authorities said on Friday, in a conclusion that was quickly challenged by a family member.
The victims, including a 9-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, were tourists on a family vacation at a resort in Mijas, in the Costa del Sol.
The family's three children, including the two who died and a 14-year-old girl, had been bathing in the shallow end of a pool at about 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday while their parents sunbathed, according to a statement by the Civil Guard, a Spanish police force.
The 9-year-old at some point moved into deeper water and could not get out. Her brother, the 16-year-old, tried to help but then found himself also in trouble, prompting the father to jump in, the statement said. None of the three could swim, the police said.
A church in Britain, the Redeemed Christian Church of God, said in a statement that the victims included a pastor, Gabriel Diya, 52, who had worked at Open Heavens, a branch of the organization in Charlton, southeastern London, along with one of his daughters, Comfort Diya, and his son, Praise-Emmanuel Diya.
Mr. Diya's wife, Olubunmi, said in a statement Friday that all three knew how to swim. She said that the children had used steps to enter the pool, "but found themselves dragged into the middle, which was deeper and called for help when they could not get out."
"I believe something was wrong with the pool that must have made swimming difficult for them at that point in time," she said. "By the time assistance came, the three of them were under the water."
She added that investigations by the Spanish police were "still ongoing."
The father and daughter were British citizens and the teenage son was American, the authorities said. The five members of the family were said to have arrived at the resort, the Club La Costa World, on Sunday.
"He was a loving husband and devoted father," the statement from the church said. "He was also a humble, friendly and committed pastor and Christian leader."
Jorge Martín, a spokesman for the civil guard in Spain, said by telephone on Friday that the water was about six and a half feet deep at the pool's deepest point.
An initial report that a resort employee who entered the pool during the episode had also struggled to get out suggested that there might have been a problem with the pool's filtration or drainage systems, Mr. Martín said.
That led to suspicions that a malfunction might have sucked the three victims underwater, but the police statement said that investigators had checked the equipment at the resort and found no problems.
Mr. Martín said the employee had clarified that he had had trouble exiting the pool because he was trying to retrieve the bodies.
Samples of the water were also taken and were being analyzed, the statement said, but autopsies found no evidence of chemical intoxication and ruled the cause of deaths as drowning.
The civil guard said that the deaths were "a tragic accident caused by the victims' lack of expertise in swimming when they found themselves in a deep area of the pool where they could not put their feet down."
The operator of the resort, CLC World Resorts and Hotels, said that the company was providing care and support to the family and other guests. The authorities "have carried out a full investigation and gave formal permissions to reopen the pool as they found no concerns relating to the pool or procedures in place," the company said in a statement.
Experts warn that even if children are confident in the water, vigilance is needed whenever they go swimming. For those who cannot swim competently, arm's-length supervision is recommended.
Nicole Hughes, a teacher in Tennessee, has been an advocate for legislation to provide more barriers around pools since her 3-year-old son, Levi, drowned while on vacation in Alabama in 2018. She told The New York Times in July that it was frighteningly simple for accidents to happen.
"We took water safety very seriously -- if you'd given me a list of 1,000 reasons one of my kids would die, drowning would have been the 1,000th," Ms. Hughes said at the time.
The numbers back up the warnings. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 people die in the United States by accidental drowning every day, two of them children under 14.

Texto completo: I spent a week at Gitmo's military court, drawing the people involved in the Sept. 11 trial. It was a challenge in every way imaginable.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When I first walked into the military court at Guantánamo Bay in September, I was the first civilian artist in almost three years that the Pentagon had approved to sketch at the court on the base, and only the fifth ever.
I was there to make drawings for an article I worked on with Carol Rosenberg, The Times's Guantánamo reporter, about the people involved in the Sept. 11 trials: lawyers, defendants and others. Specifically, Ms. Rosenberg would write about -- and I would draw -- what they chose to wear in court, in all its significance. No photography was allowed.
I had put all my Pentagon-approved art supplies in Ziploc bags to make it through two security checks and into The Gallery. That's the viewing room where members of the news media and N.G.O.s, as well as law students and family members of people killed on Sept. 11, watch the trial, happening in the courtroom on the other side of triple-pane, soundproof glass.
The courtroom is about 60 feet deep -- nearly as long as a six-story building is tall. My stomach sank. Ms. Rosenberg, who has been covering Guantánamo for 18 years and knows every corner and angle of the place, had warned me about the courtroom's size. I'd brought opera glasses for the distance, but I was told I couldn't use them. How was I going to draw portraits of people I could barely see?
I arranged my paints, brushes, pens, water and paper towels on a folding chair next to my seat, just like I had a million times. Except here, there were rules. A partial list of things I couldn't draw: guards and certain people in certain seats and/or locations; exits, cameras; papers, displays on computer screens; walls.
And there was no redacting. If I slipped and drew any of these things, I wasn't allowed to cover it up; they'd have to confiscate the drawing. While a redaction conceals the specifics of something, I was told, it also reveals that something classified exists in that location, which defeats the purpose. Instead, I was instructed to avoid drawing those things altogether, and to compose my drawing in such a way that a viewer couldn't tell that I'd removed anything.
Final rule: Under no circumstances was anyone inside the spectators' gallery to make eye contact with, or otherwise acknowledge, anyone on the other side of the glass. As an illustrator with a background as a social worker, this is in every way the opposite of how I work. I base my drawings of people on our personal interaction, on a real human connection. And while part of me was outraged, if I'm honest, I was also relieved. I didn't know how to handle eye contact with the people on the other side of that glass.
I work with white space all the time. Every illustrator and visual journalist chooses what to include or exclude in an image. In the case of these drawings, however, some of these choices were made by the military.
I knew I'd have a limited time to draw, so I had been studying photos of the detainees online for weeks, drawing them to get familiar with their faces. The five men who walked into the courtroom looked nothing like the photos I've seen. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed has grown a long beard and dyed it orange. And he's tiny, just five-foot-four. In fact, every one of the five detainees was smaller than I imagined.
When I draw, time slows down. My thoughts stop darting about, and they become quiet and focused on what is in front of me: lines, angles, shapes and shadows that make up a person's posture and expression. I stop making up stories about them or judging myself for doing so. I'm able to look closely at things I usually am afraid of or willfully ignore.
At Guantánamo, I drew in a notebook with a pen: No drafts. I looked hard and drew fast and hoped it would work out. After the drawings were finished, I painted. A picture of an individual might take 15 minutes; an entire scene might take two hours. When I finished one, I put it under my chair, hoping it would dry before I placed the next one on top of it.
While drawing, I listened to the court proceedings, but between my visual concentration and the legalese, I understood maybe a quarter of it. Later at night around the media's picnic table over whiskey and beer, the reporters would decode for me what had happened that day. I was almost thankful not to know the details they shared while I was drawing: the very specific, horrific acts the detainees and the C.I.A. are accused of, and all the legal rabbit holes the lawyers are exploring. I stopped smoking 10 years ago, but after two nights in Guantánamo, I started again.
At the end of each day in court, I stayed behind and waited to meet with Jeffrey A. Lavender, a security officer whose job is to make sure no classified information gets out. One by one, I presented my drawings to him -- much like showing sketches to a creative director for approval.
Mr. Lavender was stone-faced. After examining each drawing for several moments, scanning corner to corner and flipping each one over, he either nodded or shook his head. A nod meant the drawing was approved for public viewing. He'd affix a sticker onto the drawing, after which it was officially approved and couldn't be altered. No Photoshopping off a stray line, no adding a little more color. He signed the sticker with a ballpoint pen. I told him since the sticker was such an important part of the image, and since we both signed the art, it was a true collaboration.
Of the 30-something drawings I presented, Mr. Lavender shook his head at only two. The first contained some classified items in the courtroom. That made sense. The second was a handwritten list of everything that I was not allowed to draw, which I'd made to use as a reminder while working. I wanted to keep it. He refused.
I argued that the information it contained had been disclosed elsewhere. But Mr. Lavender and his supervisor came to the conclusion that my handwritten list was indeed a drawing, technically containing things I couldn't draw. My "No" list was a no-go.
That's Guantánamo.
After a week of stifling heat, whiskey, cigarettes, talk of torture and the challenge of trying to accurately capture the courtroom, I flew home, clutching a stack of watercolor war court drawings wrapped inside a floral-scented garbage bag for protection. I scanned them in my studio, making sure not to alter the images, sent them to The New York Times, got into bed and didn't move for two days.
Ms. Rosenberg had warned me that the gulf between the world back home and what I would find at Guantánamo was huge. She also told me a person can understand it only after being there. She was right on both counts. I'd anticipated the logistical and physical challenges of drawing there, but not the psychological and emotional ones: the grieving families, the killings and torture, the journalists reporting the horrific details year after year, and the bizarre banality of daily life in Guantánamo Bay. There was no way to prepare for those. Those I'm still processing.

Texto completo: COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Disc jockey Don Imus, whose career was made and then undone by his acid tongue during a decades-long rise to radio stardom and an abrupt public plunge after a nationally broadcast racial slur, has died . He was 79.
Imus died Friday morning at Baylor Scott and White Medical Center in College Station, Texas, after being hospitalized since Christmas Eve, according to a statement issued by his family. Deirdre, his wife of 25 years, and his son Wyatt, 21, were at his side, and his son Lt Zachary Don Cates was returning from military service overseas.
Imus survived drug and alcohol woes, a raunchy appearance before President Clinton and several firings during his long career behind the microphone. But he was vilified and eventually fired after describing a women's college basketball team as "nappy headed hos."
His April 2007 racist and misogynist crack about the mostly black Rutgers squad, an oft-replayed 10-second snippet, crossed a line that Imus had long straddled as his rants catapulted him to prominence. The remark was heard coast to coast on 60 radio stations and the MSNBC cable network.
Despite repeated apologies, Imus - just 10 years earlier named one of Time Magazine's 25 most influential Americans - became a pariah for a remark that he acknowledged was "completely inappropriate ... thoughtless and stupid."
His radio show, once home to presidential hopefuls, political pundits and platinum-selling musicians, was yanked eight days later by CBS Radio. But the shock jock enjoyed the last financial laugh when he collected a reported multimillion dollar settlement of his five-year contract with the company.
Imus' unsparing on-air persona was tempered by his off-air philanthropy, raising more than $40 million for groups including the CJ Foundation for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He ran a New Mexico ranch for dying children, and often used his radio show to "solicit" guests for donations.
A pediatric medical center bearing Imus' name was opened at the Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.
Imus, born on a Riverside, California cattle ranch, was the oldest of two boys - his brother Fred later became an "Imus In the Morning" show regular. The family moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, where Imus joined the Marines before taking jobs as a freight train brakeman and uranium miner.
Only at age 28 did he appear on the airwaves. His caustic persona, though it would later serve him well, was initially a problem: Imus was canned by a small station in Stockton, California, uttering the word "hell."
The controversy only enhanced his career, a pattern that continued throughout the decades.
Imus, moving to larger California stations, earned Billboard's "Disc Jockey of the Year" award for medium-sized markets after a stunt where he ordered 1,200 hamburgers to go from a local McDonald's.
His next stop was Cleveland, where he won DJ of the year for large markets. By 1971, he was doing the morning drive-time show on WNBC-AM in New York, the nation's largest and most competitive radio market. Imus brought along a destructive taste for vodka, along with a growing reputation for irascibility.
In 1977, Imus was ignominiously dismissed by WNBC and dispatched to the relative anonymity of Cleveland. Within two years, though, he turned disaster into triumph, returning to New York and adding a new vice: cocaine. While his career turned around, his first marriage (which produced four daughters) fell apart.
Imus struggled with addiction until a 1987 stint at a Florida alcohol rehabilitation center, coming out just as WNBC became the fledgling all-sports station WFAN - which retained Imus' non-sports show as its morning anchor.
Imus' career again soared. Time Magazine named Imus one of the 25 Most Influential People in America, and he was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame. His show began simulcasting on cable's MSNBC in September 1996.
In the decade before his "nappy headed hos" debacle, Imus redefined his show by mixing his comedy segments with A-list guests: politicians (Sen. John Kerry and Sen. John McCain(, journalists (NBC-TV's Tim Russert and The New York Times' Frank Rich, musicians (Harry Connick Jr. and John Mellencamp).
A book plug on Imus' show guaranteed sales, and authors were soon queuing up for a slot on the show.
But he rarely missed a chance to get in trouble, even in the good times. He engaged in a long-running feud with shock jock Howard Stern, who usurped Imus' position as the No. 1 morning host in New York City.
And he outraged guests at the annual Radio and Television Correspondents Association Dinner in 1996, cracking wise about President Clinton's extramarital activities as the first lady sat stone-faced nearby. "We all know you're a pot-smoking weasel," Imus said at another point about Clinton.
A White House spokesman called Imus' bit "fairly tasteless."
One year later, he was sued by a Manhattan judge after ripping the jurist on air as a "creep" and "a senile old dirtbag." Critics carped over the show's content, with Imus' claim that he was an all-inclusive offender deflecting most complaints - although one show regular was fired in 2005 after a particularly vile crack about cancer-stricken singer Kylie Minogue.
A February 2006 profile in Vanity Fair contained the quote that might best serve as Imus' epitaph.
"I talk to millions of people every day," he said while riding home in a limousine after one show. "I just like it when they can't talk back."
Imus remarried in December 1994, to the former Deirdre Coleman. They had one son, Wyatt.

Texto completo: The day has come: the new "Letterkenny" season is out.
While Canadians got the gift of Season 8 on Christmas, those in the U.S. can now watch the show via Hulu.
"Letterkenny" Season 8 runs seven episodes with some big name Canadian cameos (no spoilers) early on.
Show creator Jared Keeso, who also plays leading character Wayne, seems to like the new season very much.
Keeso tweet
The series has a 89% average audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and was named one of the 30 best international TV shows of the decade by the New York Times.
The "Letterkenny" crew will go on tour with a live show in Canada and the U.S. early in 2020, with a Pittsburgh date set for March 21.

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer’s hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell’s and Trump’s urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial.
I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party’s reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe’s idea took off in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories — at least they seem to be crazy theories — have emerged.
Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump’s head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats aren’t saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard. There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It’s not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations.
Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big — basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair — might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly.
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible.

Democratic lawmakers insist Durham resign Connecticut US attorney accused of partisan investigation of FBI probe into Russian election meddling

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats who fear Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham may be conducting a partisan investigation into the origins of the FBI's probe into Russian meddling in U.S. elections are calling on him to resign.
Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., has written Attorney General William Barr and Durham, saying "neither of you possess the integrity necessary to serve in the Department of Justice."
Signed by 10 of Johnson's House Democratic colleagues - but none from Connecticut - the letter's demand for Barr's resignation is not unique.
In May, for instance, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Barr should "probably resign" because, the senator said, the attorney general had mislead the public about the conclusions of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian meddling.
But calls for Durham's resignation are new.
The letter - signed by Johnson, Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., Jared Huffman, D-Calif., Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., and five other progressive Democrats - said Barr and Durham should be ousted because they "inappropriately interfered in independent Department of Justice investigations and intentionally used (their) positions to mislead the American public in defense of President Donald J. Trump."
The letter was prompted by the response of Durham and Barr to Inspector General Michael Horowitz's recently issued report on his own investigation of the origins of the Russia probe.
Both men issued statements critical of Horowitz's report.
Durham's statement was opaque, saying "based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened."
Barr, meanwhile, launched a campaign aimed at discrediting the inspector general's conclusion that the FBI acted appropriately when it launched an investigation into whether the Trump campaign wittingly or unwittingly helped Russia influence the election in Trump's favor.
"Mr. Barr, you even went so far as to suggest during an interview on Tuesday, December 10 that the FBI under the Obama administration was a greater threat to our democracy than Russia," the lawmaker's letter said, "Your uncorroborated and inappropriate statements on the OIG report legitimize fringe conspiracy theories and erode public trust in the Justice Department's credibility."
"Mr. Durham is equally as complicit" in the mission to discredit Horowitz's report, the lawmakers wrote.
"We demand your immediate resignation as Attorney General and that of U.S. Attorney Durham," the letter concludes.
The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment about the letter.
The offices of Connecticut's Democratic lawmakers, who are on break, also did not respond Monday to requests for comment.
Durham, who has been tight-lipped about this investigation and previous cases he's handled, surprised many with his statement about the inspector general's report. In a Washington Post op-ed this month, former Attorney General Eric Holder cautioned him.
"Anyone in Durham's shoes would do well to remember that, in dealing with this administration, many reputations have been irrevocably lost," he wrote.
Holder tapped Durham in 2009 to investigate the alleged torture and killing of terror suspects by CIA interrogators. and said in his op-ed that he has been proud to know Connecticut's U.S. Attorney for nearly a decade.
There are also concerns over Durham's trips with Barr overseas to collect "evidence" of what Democrats say are Trump conspiracy theories into the origins of the FBI's investigation. And, last week, Barr indicated that Durham's probe has expanded beyond the FBI.
"He is not just looking at the FBI," Barr said in an interview on Fox News. "He is looking at other agencies."
The New York Times reported last week that Durham is investigating former CIA director John Brennan's role in the Russia investigation and has requested Brennan's emails, call logs and other documents.
Trump has long attacked Brennan as part of a so-called "deep state" cabal of Obama administration officials who tried to sabotage his campaign.
Barr chose Durham to lead the "investigation into the investigators" in May. At that time, Durham was already investigating FBI media leaks in the probe of Moscow's involvement in U.S. elections.
Durham has a long and impressive resume and has been tasked by both Democratic and Republican administrations to handle sensitive investigations.
Durham has served in the U.S. attorney's office since 1989, holding a number of positions, including acting U.S. attorney.
Before that, he served on the Justice Department's Boston Strike Force on Organized Crime, where he led the prosecutions of several mob bosses, including James "Whitey" Bulger.

Highlights from a year of local listening

Texto completo: With the season of reflection upon us, the final Classical Notes column of the year offers brief thoughts on some praiseworthy local recordings that appeared during 2019.
SARAH BOB: …nobody move…: Commissions and Premieres for the New Gallery Concert Series (Avie) Bob is an excellent pianist, but it's her role as a catalyst and inspiration that makes her so important to Boston's new music scene. This collection is a generous sampling of works brought into being for her invaluable New Gallery Concert Series, now in its 20th year. The title work, by Randall Woolf, marries a noir toughness with acidic harmony, and Curtis K. Hughes's “Avoidance Tactics #1" generates a playful storm of acoustic and electronic timbres.
BOSTON EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL: CHARPENTIER: “LES PLAISIRS DE VERSAILLES" AND “LES ARTS FLORISSANTS" (cpo) On the heels (relatively speaking) of BEMF's previous Charpentier recording (which won a Grammy) comes this offering of two of the composer's mini-operas, which are packed with humor and charm. Every character is sung with, well, character, and the lissome, slender voice of soprano Teresa Wakim is a highlight in each, as is the irresistible swing of the orchestra's playing.
BOSTON MODERN ORCHESTRA PROJECT: KEERIL MAKAN: DREAM LIGHTLY (BMOP/sound) BMOP's diligent efforts to document American music of the present and recent past reaches Makan, a composer on the MIT faculty. Shimmering textures, slowly unfolding processes, and lingering tones dominate in these four pieces, which form a bridge between Makan's abrasive earlier work and the more open, tonally rooted music of his recent scores. Traces of darkness are never far from the surface, though, especially in the 25-minute title work, which unfolds like a eerie, half-remembered dream.
BOSTON CAMERATA: FREE AMERICA! (Harmonia Mundi) Unlike many early music groups, the Boston Camerata has always approached its work with a complete lack of affectation or mannerism. That's crucial to the success of this wonderful album of early American hymns, marches, and songs. Under Anne Azéma's direction, the ensemble sounds as though it's been transformed into a group of crusading Revolutionaries. Though centuries old, the themes of this music — political liberty, religious freedom, social union — echo strongly in today's political climate.
TAKÁCS QUARTET/MARC-ANDRÉ HAMELIN: DOHNÁNYI: PIANO QUINTETS, STRING QUARTET NO. 2 (Hyperion) The Boston-based Hamelin, one of the world's most inquisitive and talented pianists, and the Colorado-based Takács team up once again, this time for authoritative readings of the two piano quintets of Hungarian composer Ernö von Dohnányi (grandfather of conductor Christoph). Dohnányi was a conservative, tradition-oriented composer, and the echoes of his mentor Brahms are easy to spot, but so is his craftsmanship. These performances, expansive and passionate, make an unusually strong case for his work.
IAN BOSTRIDGE/THOMAS ADÈS: SCHUBERT: WINTERREISE (Pentatone) This duo gave a shattering performance of the greatest of all song cycles at Jordan Hall in 2016, one of many highlights of Adès's ongoing tenure as the Boston Symphony Orchestra's artistic partner. This live recording echoes the power of that encounter. Bostridge bends his voice in almost expressionistic ways, and Adès finds a wealth of hidden details in the score. The fresh light they throw on this well-loved piece ward off a listener's complacency, and make it newly dark and unsettling.
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA/ANDRIS NELSONS: BOSTON SYMPHONY COMISSIONS (Naxos) New music hasn't been a central aspect of Andris Nelsons's music directorship of the BSO; New York Times critic David Allen described his approach as “supporting new music without really championing it." Still, the recent commissions on this disc are all eminently worth making available. Each of the four composers — Eric Nathan, George Tsontakis, Timo Andres, and Sean Shepherd — shows a gift for arraying a stream of ideas in vivid orchestral colors. Robert Sheena, the BSO's longtime English hornist, is the superb soloist in Tsontakis's “Sonnets."
BLUE HERON: OCKEGHEM SONGS, VOL. 1 (Blue Heron Records) Continuing to go from strength to strength, the early-music vocal ensemble presents the first release from its “Ockeghem@600" project. The Franco-Flemish composer's chansons are both courtly and sensual, and Blue Heron sings them with a purity of tone that makes clear their intricate contrapuntal foundations. Blue Heron director Scott Metcalfe has ranked Ockeghem's gifts in this area to Bach's; listening to these performances, you strongly suspect he's onto something.
DANISH STRING QUARTET: PRISM II (ECM) How, you might wonder, can a critic get away with calling this outstanding Scandinavian foursome a local group? At a Cape Cod Chamber Music Festival concert in Dennis a few years ago, one player joked that they perhaps should have called themselves “the Dennis String Quartet." OK, it's a stretch (and not a great joke), but at that concert they gave a scintillating performance of Schnittke's dense, allusion-heavy Third String Quartet, much like the one on this superb album. Their reading of Beethoven's Quartet in B-flat, Op.130 is, if anything, even better, so complete is their command of the ethereal Cavatina and the still-unruly Grosse Fuge. Hear them do both works at Jordan Hall in May.

Texto completo: A documentary about the British synth-pop band Duran Duran debuts on Showtime. And the latest "Men in Black" movie airs on Starz.
What's on TV
DURAN DURAN: THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW 9 p.m. on Showtime. The British synth-pop band returns to a format that helped make them stars -- television -- in this made-for-TV documentary, which debuted last year on BBC Four and will make its stateside debut on Showtime Friday night. The program revisits the band's breakout years, in the 1980s, when their danceable beats, big hair and fashionable music videos (long a ubiquitous presence on MTV) made them household names. It also looks at the group's work in the decades since. Telling the story are Duran Duran's four current members (Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, John Taylor and Roger Taylor) and interviewees like Cindy Crawford and Boy George. "The '80s were fabulous to us as a group," Le Bon told The New York Times in 1995, "then it went down a bit." Expect him to elaborate on both of those experiences here.
MEN IN BLACK: INTERNATIONAL (2019) 7 p.m. on Starz. Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth wear sharp suits and use the memory-erasing stick once wielded by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in this most recent entry in the "Men in Black" franchise. While the movie adds in some fresh locales (Marrakesh and London provide backdrops, in addition to the series' native New York), "Men in Black: International" basically relies on the same combination of shape-shifting aliens, half-kidding action and creative weaponry that were the calling cards of the first three movies."'Innocuous!' would be my pull quote," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times.
What's Streaming
QUEEN OF KATWE (2016) Stream on Disney Plus; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "If there is anyone out there capable of remaining unmoved by this true-life triumph-of-the-underdog sports story, I don't think I want to meet that person," A.O. Scott wrote in his review of this biographical drama for The Times. Part of the backlog of movies available on Disney's new streaming service, "Queen of Katwe" is a sports biopic about the Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi, who develops into a world-class player while pushing back against poverty and discrimination. She's played by Madina Nalwanga, who made her film debut here alongside two seasoned performers: Lupita Nyong'o, who plays Phiona's mother, and David Oyelowo, who plays Phiona's coach. The film, directed by Mira Nair, "has a richness and unpredictability that separates it from other, superficially similar movies," Scott wrote.

For a very different portrait of a chess prodigy, see this drama about the American chess master Bobby Fischer's famous, politically freighted match against the Soviet grandmaster Boris Spassky. The film casts Tobey Maguire as Fischer, a mastermind whose talent lands him in the center of what is essentially a Cold War battle between nations -- and whose mental well-being gets caught in the crossfire. Liev Schreiber plays Spassky.

Texto completo: The evangelical site criticized a pro-impeachment editorial in Christianity Today.
A scathing anti-Trump editorial published by the prominent evangelical magazine Christianity Today continues to provoke fierce debate. A response in The Christian Post on Monday denounced the editorial, prompting an editor there to resign in protest.
Christianity Today, a leading publication founded by the Rev. Billy Graham, published the anti-Trump editorial on Thursday, following the House vote to impeach President Trump on charges that he had abused his power and obstructed Congress.
The magazine's editor in chief, Mark Galli, argued that it was "profoundly immoral" that Mr. Trump had attempted to persuade his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate a political rival, and called for the president's removal from office.
The Christian Post rebuttal, published on Monday, noted the "firestorm of criticism and dissent" the editorial had provoked, noting that white evangelicals have strongly supported Mr. Trump despite repeated controversies.
The authors, John Grano and Richard Land, wrote that Christianity Today's "disdainful, dismissive, elitist posture toward their fellow Christians may well do far more long-term damage to American Christianity and its witness than any current prudential support for President Trump will ever cause."
This apparently proved too much for an editor at The Christian Post, Napp Nazworth, who wrote on Twitter on Monday that he was "forced to make the difficult choice" to leave the site, where he had worked since 2011, most recently as politics editor.
In an interview on Tuesday evening, Mr. Nazworth said he wanted the publication's politics section "to be an open space for both sides." He said the site had worked to include voices that praised and criticized the president, and he objected to labeling the column as an editorial representing the site's opinion.
"There was an impasse. We couldn't find a compromise," he said. "I said, 'If this is what you represent, you're announcing that The Christian Post is joining Team Trump."'
In a statement, The Christian Post said that it was "so very grateful for Napp's contribution over these many years."
"We wish him the best," the statement added. "We will remain a publication rooted in our Christian faith and committed to objectivity in our reporting and diversity in our opinions."
The original editorial has stirred controversy for days -- starting, not surprisingly, with Mr. Trump himself. "I guess the magazine, 'Christianity Today,' is looking for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or those of the socialist/communist bent, to guard their religion," he said on Twitter the day after it was published. "How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!"
Mr. Trump's re-election campaign announced that he would go to Miami on Jan. 3 to start an "Evangelicals for Trump" coalition.
The Christian Post response noted that nearly 200 evangelical leaders had signed a letter condemning the Christianity Today editorial, which was also the subject of a news story on its home page. The letter said that the editorial "offensively questioned the spiritual integrity and Christian witness of tens-of-millions of believers who take seriously their civic and moral obligations."
The Post also noted that Franklin Graham, whose father was Billy Graham, continued to support the president. In a response to the editorial, Franklin Graham wrote on Facebook that his late father had voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, a revelation he had never before made publicly.
The Christian Post was started in 2004 to provide news and commentary of interest to Christian readers, and is not linked to any particular sect or congregation, according to the site.
A recent poll from the Public Religion Research Institute found that 77 percent of white evangelical Protestants approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing in office, including half who strongly approve. Mr. Nazworth had taken issue with those figures in a recent article, arguing that evangelical support for Mr. Trump had been greatly overstated.
Mr. Nazworth said that since his resignation, "a lot of people have been reaching out with words of encouragement and support." He said he had no idea what he would do next.
"I thought I would be working at The Christian Post until both of my kids graduated from school," he said.

Texto completo: A retail survey showed an 18.8 percent rise in online shopping. Consumer confidence has been bolstered this year by a low unemployment rate.
Americans keep spending, driving the economy at a time when unemployment is at a half-century low point despite headwinds from the trade war.
Holiday sales rose 3.4 percent this year over 2018, according to a survey by Mastercard SpendingPulse. Online sales grew much more sharply -- 18.8 percent -- marking the continuing change in how people shop.
The increase this year, both over all and online, is smaller than it was in 2018, but the findings will be welcomed by retailers, which depend on year-end splurges to drive their annual sales.
Consumers are responsible for the largest chunk, by far, of economic activity in the United States, and their willingness to keep shopping has offset declining business investment in the face of the trade war and an uncertain outlook. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2019 and has been expanding for 11 years -- one of the longest periods of continuous growth ever.

Employers added 266,000 jobs in November, and unemployment remained at 3.5 percent, the 21st consecutive month with an unemployment rate of 4 percent or lower.
Helped by the Federal Reserve's decision to ease up on interest-rate increases, stocks are on a pace for one of their best years in decades. The S&P 500 index is up 29 percent in 2019.
The SpendingPulse survey tracked sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 that were made using Mastercard's network of payments systems, and included estimates of purchases made with cash and other kinds of payments. Automobile sales were excluded.
Apparel sales gained 1 percent over last year and 17 percent online. Spending on jewelry went up 1.8 percent over all and 8.8 percent online. Sales of electronics and appliances rose 4.6 percent, and home furniture and furnishings grew 1.3 percent.
The move to more online shopping has come at the expense of brick-and-mortar stores. The retail industry has announced more than 9,000 store closings in 2019. The SpendingPulse survey found a 1.8 percent decline in sales at department stores, which have been hit particularly hard by the transformation of consumer shopping. Another sign of the troubles facing department stores: Their online sales grew only 6.9 percent.

Whicker: Santa Anita turns to technology in effort to limit horse tragedies

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Jonathan Groff sticks close to Lancaster roots while branching out in film, stage and TV

Texto completo: When he is on stage at the 270-seat Westside Theatre in New York, Jonathan Groff says he often thinks about the Ephrata Performing Arts Center.
He is playing Seymour in an off-Broadway production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” which is being directed by Michael Mayer, of “Spring Awakening” fame, with Broadway veterans Christian Borle and Tammy Blanchard at Westside.
“Everyone is doing this for the fun of it,” Groff says. “It reminds me of EPAC. Nobody is trying to gain anything from it. There are no ulterior motives.”
The show is largely sold out, and reviews have been strong.
Ben Brantley, of the New York Times, wrote that Groff “is generating major nerd charisma.”
For Groff, 34, being onstage is his “ultimate existence.”
“That’s when I’m happiest,” he says. “ ‘Honk’ and ‘Bat Boy’ (shows he performed in at EPAC), it doesn’t get much better than that. And that’s how I feel with ‘Little Shop.’ ”
Hometown plans
Home is never far from Groff’s mind. He returns to Lancaster frequently, though sometimes just for a day.
“He was here for less than 24 hours on Thanksgiving,” says his mother, Julie Groff.
And he recently purchased a house and property next to his father’s farm in Christiana.
It’s a place to live when he’s home, but also, Groff has plans for it.
“I want to turn the barns into creative spaces — a recording studio, an editing suite, a place to write, or a place to have small workshops,” Groff says. “I want it to be inspiring, quiet and peaceful.”
It’s in the future — Groff says it is a 10-year plan — but he is excited about the possibilities.
He got the idea while he was playing Melchior Gabor in the cast of “Spring Awakening,” which he did off and then on Broadway from 2006 to 2008.
“Gideon Glick (who played Ernst and will be replacing Groff next month in ‘Little Shop’) was the first to leave the show, and my mother got a school bus and brought everyone in the cast to Lancaster,” he recalls.
“We hung out in the barn and had a bonfire outside. Gideon said how rejuvenating and inspiring it felt, and that got me thinking. It’s close to New York. Someone could come and spend a couple days here. My dad (Jim Groff) loves the idea, and I love the farm,” Groff says. “So as the years go by, we’ll make it a creative place.”
“When I bought the horse farm in 1987, the Realtor bought the frontage (of the property) and built eight houses. Jonathan bought one of those houses,” says Jim Groff, who is a horse trainer and a jockey. “The view out back is, well, you can’t beat it.”
Both Groffs note that their son won’t be tearing any of the barns down and won’t be changing the house much. As a creative spot, it will not have concerts or performances, but will be a quiet place.
“He wants to keep it all natural,” Julie Groff says. “It’s going to look sharp.”
Big movies
Groff’s career is going at hyperspeed these days.
He had to take time away from the “Little Shop” run for an intense press junket for “Frozen II,” the animated musical film that was released last month and is turning into another massive hit for Disney.
And it was announced recently that Groff will be appearing in “Matrix 4,” a film sequel scheduled for theatrical release in May 2021.
“He’s working with a personal trainer. The ‘Matrix’ people are getting him in shape,” says Jim Groff. “He’s working out every day, and he’s on a really strict diet. What gets me is he had to take a picture of everything he ate for a while.”
“He basically barely has enough time to eat,” says Julie Groff. “He is loving this, but I am sure it will catch up with him.”
There is no rest for the weary. Groff is set to leave “Little Shop” on Jan. 19.
The next day, he starts working on “Matrix 4,” which is being filmed partially in Chicago.
------------
Frozen
“I find it so easy to talk about ‘Frozen II,’” Groff says. “It’s so good, and the relationships with the directors and the the cast have been so positive.
------------
“He’s always wanted to appear in a big action movie,” Julie Groff says. “But he’s really a Disney fan. He always wanted to be in a Disney movie, and that turned out well.”
Indeed. “Frozen,” in which Groff voices mountain man Kristoff, was a global phenomenon and the largest-grossing animated film in history. The sequel is breaking records, too.
“I find it so easy to talk about ‘Frozen II,’” Groff says. “It’s so good, and the relationships with the directors and the the cast have been so positive.
“A lot of my interviews have been with Josh Gad (who voices Olaf the snowman),” he says. “We had such good time. It’s almost like a vacation.”
Groff says that when the first “Frozen” film came out in 2013, nobody expected it to be as huge as it was.
“We had all scattered after the film and didn’t really have a chance to do a lot of publicity,” he says. “So this was like a celebration for us.”
Anybody with children of a certain age will tell you how powerful “Frozen” was for their kids, particularly their daughters. Groff thinks part of the success of the movie was how it empowered the female characters.
“Kristoff is an evolved mountain man,” he says. “I love that he is there to serve the women — a man letting women take the spotlight. That flips convention.”
For a few weeks, Groff was all over TV, appearing on just about every talk show out there, from Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show” to Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show.”
During his most recent appearance with Colbert, Julie Andrews was another guest.
“Can you believe I met Julie Andrews!” Groff says.
On the show, Groff showed footage of his 3-year-old self dressed as Mary Poppins for Halloween, and noted that his older brother, David, was dressed as The Entertainer, complete with top hat and cane. In the family video, David Groff says of his brother, “He has lipstick on — oooooh!”
“He was trying to upstage me,” Groff says, laughing.
“You’ve got a great mom (to let you do that),” Colbert said.
“I do have a great mom,” Groff replied.
“ ‘Mary Poppins’ was Jonathan’s first real movie. He watched it every single day,” says Julie Groff. “It was my two-and-a-half hours to get things done. He became obsessed with the movie and acted out all the parts.”
His father says that he has always studied movies and other actors onstage.
“When he did stuff at the Fulton or at EPAC, smaller stuff, he would sneak around the corner and watch them every night — watch the changes the actors made,” Jim Groff says.
“Even today he does that,” Julie Groff says. “He never stops learning.”
“I like to call him up and give him my notes after I see a show,” Jim Groff says. “We get a laugh out of that.”
Not easily recognized
You’d think Groff would get stopped by people all the time, especially because of appearances on Fox’s “Glee,” HBO’s “Looking” and the Netflix series “Mindhunter,” in which he plays FBI agent Holden Ford. (Groff says the show is on hiatus at the moment.) But he says he rarely gets recognized.
“I look like a generic white person,” he says. “And I’m mainly on my bike because that’s how I get around New York. I sign autographs if people ask.”
“He said he walked down the street in his King (George) outfit from ‘Hamilton’ once and nobody paid any attention to him,” says Jim Groff with a hearty laugh. “In New York, people don’t bother you much.”
“Things may change with ‘Matrix 4,’ though I hope not,” Julie Groff says.
But Groff hasn’t changed. He still visits with friends from home backstage during a show. He is still accessible and friendly to everyone he meets.
“With Jonathan, what you see is how he has always been,” Julie Groff says.
Right now, Groff says, life is very full. His career is going great, he’s in a relationship with New Zealand-born choreographer Corey Baker, who lives in London, and he’s closer than ever with his family.
“This is a sweet moment in time,” he says.

Texto completo: Trump Derangement Syndrome doesn’t take a single day off.
Yes, the phenomenon that has driven some critics of President Trump insane in their hatred for the leader manifested itself even on Christmas this year, which should really be an apolitical day and time of truce if there ever was one. But a few sad columnists in the liberal media just couldn’t let the holiday pass without attempting to weaponize it to attack Trump and Republicans.
For instance, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman penned a Christmas-themed column, promoted on the paper’s homepage on Christmas morning, titled “The Cruelty of a Trump Christmas,” with the subhead reading “Republicans aren’t Scrooges — they’re much worse.” Krugman, who once won a Nobel Prize in economics, has, of course, long ago gone off the rails. I suppose that while it’s sad to see him pen such an unhinged holiday column, it’s not exactly surprising. This, after all, is the same man who blamed Sarah Palin for the shooting of a Democratic congresswoman and called Republicans enablers of terrorism. Tweet
But it wasn’t just Krugman.
Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank dubbed the holiday “A Trump Christmas, with ill will to all,” blaming the president for the (admittedly awful and uncalled for) abuse Milbank has been subjected to by some Trump supporters online. This alone isn’t reasonable. But Milbank went on to call Trump “a president who exults in violence, name-calling and human misery.” Yes, in a holiday column written just before Christmas and promoted throughout the day.
There are plenty of valid criticisms to be made of Trump. But there's no valid reason they must literally be made on Christmas day.
Sigh. I had truly hoped, perhaps in youthful naivety, that we opinion journalists could take one day off from partisan warfare and tribal attacks. It’s not that I think Christmas columns should be totally apolitical. That’s, of course, not in keeping with the spirit of the holiday and its inherently religious nature. For instance, a Washington Examiner op-ed we published on Christmas Eve, “No, Jesus was not a socialist,” was both interesting and timely, and of course, political. But notably, it was about disputing economic concepts and a point of historical contention — not bashing Nancy Pelosi or the Democratic Party.
This is the right way to do holiday-themed commentary. Readers and participants alike are exhausted by the never-ending personal sniping. In Krugman’s case, he literally exploited Christmas to launch hyperbolic criticisms of Republicans for what is an eminently reasonable and debatable policy: work requirements for welfare programs. He and Milbank both assumed the worst of their opponents’ intentions, even on Christmas.
This is par for the course in modern media, with some conservative columnists no doubt guilty of the same behavior. (You'll forgive me, I hope, that I didn't spend the day cruising the internet for even more bad takes.) But there’s no doubt that Trump has driven liberal media a bit crazy and increased their propensity for tribal attacks no matter the cost. Let’s just hope, come Christmastime next year, we can all do better.

Customs and Border Protection chief uncertain if administration can complete wall by deadline

Texto completo: Acting Customs and Border Protection Chief Mark Morgan expressed uncertainty in regards to whether or not the Trump administration will be able to achieve its goal to build a wall along the southern border by the end of President Trump's first term in office.
Trump's demand for a wall separating the United States and Mexico was one of his earliest campaign promises, and yet as of last month, the administration has yet to build any part of the wall where there wasn't fencing previously located. The president, while it's unclear as to the final path for the wall, has promised to build 450 miles of it along the border by 2021.
“It’s hard right now to say whether we’re still going to meet that goal,” Morgan told the New York Times. “But I’m confident we’re going to be close.”
One aspect of building the wall that appears to have caused the administration some difficulties include an investigation into construction contracts, monetary delays, and a legal ruling blocking emergency access to Defense Department funds to build the wall. While those are situations that could derail the administration from meeting its goal, another controversial topic is private landowners who aren't keen on giving up their land to the federal government. The administration has filed 48 lawsuits citing eminent domain laws — the right for the government to seize private land for compensation.
One hundred sixty-two miles of border wall is expected to run through southern Texas with more than 140 miles coming on private property, according to CBP. The administration has acquired only three miles of private territories dating back to 2017.

Texto completo: When you happen to be dating Aaron Rodgers, getting the Green Bay Packers quarterback to be a guest on your podcast becomes a whole lot easier.
Danica Patrick sat down with Rodgers for an hour and 45 minutes for the latest episode of her Pretty Intense podcast that debuted Thursday. It's a wide-ranging conversation that covers spirituality, smarts, football, winning and losing, religion, Chives Restaurant, music, leadership, authenticity, UFOs, food, "Jeopardy," Johnny Cash, badminton, social media, Wisconsin weather, scotch, Scooby-Doo, mustaches and Dairy Queen Blizzards.
Here are 10 fun takeaways to get you started, but be sure to stick around until the end of the podcast for the "I love you's. "
1. Rodgers does eight to 12 crossword puzzles a week. Spending time with his grandparents as a kid introduced him to his love of crosswords. He does them on his New York Times app, in USA TODAY and occasionally the local newspaper for both fun and to help keep his mind sharp. Sometimes he’ll even do one in the three hours before a game at Lambeau Field.
“I do enjoy them, but also I’ve had a number of concussions and you worry about your future brain functions, and I feel like doing crosswords, doing Sudoku, doing KenKen, watching ‘Jeopardy,’ brushing your teeth with a different hand, tying your shoes in different orders, there’s a lot of different things that you can do to stay sharp mentally, and I think that’s one of them, crosswords. ”
2. He has a serious sweet tooth. There was a time when he could easily polish off a half-gallon of ice cream or a bag of Starburst jellybeans — two things he has given up since cycling off dairy and meeting Patrick, who he said is “way more disciplined” in her eating habits.
“I’ve always had a major sweet tooth. I love just about anything sweet,” he said.
That includes waffles for dinner, Jordy Nelson’s grandma’s candy bar pie and Patrick’s (healthy) vanilla cupcakes. She asked if it made him mad when she called him out for too much peanut butter or maple syrup.
“No, because I have a love affair with food. You can’t put a damper on it. ”
While Patrick never has a cheat day, Rodgers did admit to a couple of cheat meals when she’s not around (and also raiding the vegan chocolate chips that she sometimes tries to hide from him in the pantry. ) Patrick has helped him with his diet, reading labels and being more aware of where food comes from.
“I miss Blizzards for sure from Dairy Queen, 100 percent,” he said. His Blizzard of choice: Oreo and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup mixed together.
3. He's never had a speeding ticket. He likes to remind Patrick that he’s a fantastic driver, telling her, “You may have been a professional race car driver, but I’m a professional in-street driver, highway driver. ”
4. He doesn’t just read a book, he gets out the highlight marker. A passionate reader with what Patrick categorized as “a giant book collection,” he counts John Krakauer among his favorite authors and cited his 2009 book, “Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman” as one of his favorite reads. He also listed “The Shack” by William P. Young as interesting to him when he was younger, and “Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell, and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived” by Rob Bell as meaningful.
“I enjoy reading books on JFK. I recently read a crazy expose with just unbelievable detail about his life. The most dense book. I literally read it three times just to try and wrap my head around the information in it,” Rodgers said.
Patrick pointed out that he also went through multiple highlight markers in the process.
“I love to highlight and underline in my reading,” he said, saying that he also took notes. “Because there’s so much information, and I want to retain it. ”
5. His pregame playlist sounds like this: Bon Iver, Trevor Hall, Nahko, Lord Huron and Jon Bryant, along with old favorites like Counting Crows, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Foo Fighters. Last year, he was on a Johnny Cash kick. (Unrelated fun fact but too good not to mention: He says he can sing a mean karaoke version of “Wind of Change” by The Scorpions. )
6. His idea of fun covers a lot of territory. “I enjoy watching ‘Jeopardy. ’ I enjoy reading. I enjoy doing crosswords. I really enjoy being out in nature. I like traveling. ”
He considers golf a good escape, likes to hike and loves the ocean and lakes. He looks forward to skiing and skydiving when he retires from football, and traveling to Egypt is on his bucket list.
7. He’s all about the calm in the clutch. Patrick, calling him “the most clutch player ever,” said you can almost feel his mental shift into a new space when it’s down to the final minutes and the game is on the line. She asked him what that feels like for him.
“Calm. Yeah, very calm. When I was 5 and I watched Joe Montana take the Niners down the field against the Bengals and throw a touchdown to John Taylor for the win, I remember thinking that’s what I wanted to do. Then fast forward to 14 and I’m watching MJ, Michael Jordan, last game with the Bulls, and he crosses up (Bryon) Russell at the foul line and drains a mid-range shot and that’s what I always said, 'I want to do that. I want the ball in the clutch moments. ' ”
8. The three best concerts he has ever seen were all at iconic venues. Nahko and Trevor Hall earlier this year with Patrick at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado; Tegan and Sara and Death Cab for Cutie at the Hollywood Bowl; and The Killers for a standing-room-only show at The Rave in Milwaukee in 2009. He also gave shout-outs to live shows by Pearl Jam at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Foo Fighters in Madison, Prince and Brad Paisley.
9. Patrick has changed his life. From a practical standpoint, that means fewer cheat days when it comes to eating, and having dogs in the house (she has two).
“From an emotional standpoint, I think you’re a very steady person, so that’s been nice to have a steady energy," Rodgers told her, adding she brings a calm to the house. "You're a peacemaker. Sometimes you fight for it, but you’re a peacemaker. ”
He also talked about what an amazing cook she is, her work ethic ("You put your mind to something and you're going to do it") and her sense of curiosity. When she said she can sometimes be stubborn, Rodgers can be heard with a well-timed clearing of the throat.
10. He knows his mustache can be “a little creepy. ” He always wanted to have a great mustache, thanks to “Tombstone,” one of his all-time favorite movies and basically a showcase of bad-ass mustaches (Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton). His dad also had a mustache when Rodgers was growing up.
"It's a little creepy at times but I do enjoy it," he said of his own at age 36, pointing out that the creepy goes away a little when it covers the top lip. Then it's just cowboy.

The Contrived Playoff Isn't Victimless

Texto completo: A reawakened fan loves the regular season, but says the playoff is more arbitrary invitational than actual tournament.
The end of the American calendar sports year features a festival of college football bowl games that fill television airwaves -- if not attendant stadiums -- and since 2014 a four-team playoff to determine which of the blessed chosen gets to shout from a mountaintop that is, arguably, mythical.
This year, however, the most memorable season's punctuation really should be the likely conclusion of the college career of the brilliant Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. In mid-November, he played one series -- or one game, if extreme pragmatism is your choice of perspectives -- too long.
In sending Tagovailoa onto the field against Mississippi State one week after clear evidence that he was not fully recovered from the surgical aftermath of a high ankle sprain, Coach Nick Saban played for high-risk stakes with the arbiters of the sport and -- much worse, for Tagovailoa's sake -- with the purveyors of fate.
Against any sub-.500 team in America, which is what Mississippi State was at the time, the star-laden Crimson Tide would be a heavy favorite, with or without its starting quarterback. With a four-touchdown lead late in the first half, Saban opted to have Tagovailoa work on the two-minute drill before taking him out.
The coach wound up watching gloomily as a player widely projected to be a next-level star was carted off the field with a serious hip injury, clouding Tagovailoa's foreseeable future, months before the N.F.L. draft.
And for what? In part, at least, to impress upon the all-powerful playoff selection committee that Alabama, despite losing to its rival powerhouse L.S.U. the previous week, might still be considered for the appointed final four. If not for the quality of its victories, then for the steamrolling of those vanquished.
"Tua wanted to play in the game, so I don't really make a lot of decisions based on worrying about guys getting hurt," Saban said afterward.
Callous as that sounded, the rationale merely meant that football is inherently dangerous for all players on any play of every game. And since it could not be proved that the ankle injury factored into the hip injury, criticism of Saban's decision not to sit Tagovailoa for the entire game, while not totally illegitimate, is not my main point.
The problem is more with a process that is at best contrived and at worst tortured. The playoff is more arbitrary invitational than actual tournament, creating the season-long need to tantalize 13 judges by humiliating opponents and the inevitable related lapses in logic.
Let me disclose that I have come to the conclusion that the College Football Playoff is little more than an overhyped, made-for-television event by way of impassioned partisanship.
My son was a Penn State upperclassman during the 2011 Jerry Sandusky pedophilia horror. The quicker-than-anticipated re-emergence of the program occurred as I was concluding my decades-long career as a sports journalist. The graduate and I bonded in conjunction with the reboot.
As a child of New York, I grew up rabidly supporting the Yankees and Knicks, but the rooting interests of youth are typically the casualties of a professional life covering sports. There is nothing like story line and deadline pressure to inflict full compliance with the ethics of neutrality.
But when Penn State, led by the ascendant running back Saquon Barkley, recovered from two early defeats to win the Big Ten championship in the fall of 2016, I had just retired from The New York Times as a full-time writer.
Looking to re-engage as a fan of something, I was captivated one October Saturday night when the Nittany Lions shocked the juggernaut Ohio State. In the misguided view of the committee, the Buckeyes, with only one regular-season loss, were later deemed the better team and therefore more deserving of the playoff.
No small consolation, Penn State instead went to the venerable Rose Bowl, but the committee had prioritized consensus opinion over concrete achievement. Its very existence exposed the sport's intentions.
Rather than automatically reward conference winners and leave no argument in the wake of those who qualified, its preference was self-empowerment for marketing means, co-opting multiple network partners and a compliant news media to relentlessly debate its weekly rankings, topped off by the grand announcement and staged anointment.
When it came to cumulative airtime, impeachment had nothing this fall on the College Football Playoff.
Something else occurred to me after the 2016 season -- the first of what I now consider my guilty pleasure, given the participatory health risks and endemic exploitation of those playing for the revenue-rich Division I football factories, Penn State included. That Rose Bowl game, lost narrowly to U.S.C., was wildly entertaining but felt like little more than a glorified exhibition, an embellishment compared to what had been a gripping regular season.
To begin with, the major bowl games and the playoff occur a month after the conference title games, and with N.F.L.-bound stars increasingly sitting them out rather than risk injury in games that have historically existed as warm-weather junkets for well-heeled friends of the program. The 2016 Big Ten championship, which Penn State claimed weeks earlier, 38-31, in a breathtaking rally against Wisconsin, provided a far greater sense of seasonal culmination.
Long before I had any rooting interest in college football, I never quite got the obsession with crowning the king of all 50 states via various rankings methodologies. Beyond exploding television revenues, what has it really accomplished besides the creation of a never-ending arms race to spend that money on palatial facilities and outrageous coaches' salaries -- from the pockets of strapped taxpayers at the major state universities.
Worse has been the trickle-down effect of this holy quest for national pre-eminence, especially on youth sports culture. What began years ago with national ratings of high school football teams and a champion presumably chosen by people throwing darts at a map, has devolved into rankings for children not yet 5 feet tall.
Websites currently chart the top prospects in a variety of sports for the college freshman class of 2028 -- in other words, an exercise in the inflation of 10-year-old egos, inspiring too many wishful parents eager to spend huge sums on a statistically improbable outcome of college or professional stardom.
Remember the ad campaign by Nike -- You don't win silver, you lose gold -- for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta? Reasonable people denounced it as competitive heresy, but the superpower compulsion that America is or must be No. 1 in everything -- even when cold, hard facts would indicate otherwise -- took root in its sporting culture.
Winning a town league or even a state title these days is almost considered quaint, just not proportionally conclusive enough.
On the final weekend of the 2019 regular season, Saban's gamble loomed large as Alabama lost a second game, this one to Auburn, and failed to make the playoff for the first time since its inception. Meanwhile, the selection committee prattled on about choosing the best teams for its premier events while sending Virginia, ranked 24th, to the Orange Bowl -- thanks to contradictory deals the major conferences cling to in order to ensure their piece of the postseason pie.
As for my Nittany Lions, they finished a laudable 10-2, with an invitation to the Cotton Bowl to play Memphis, champion of the unsung American Conference -- a game in which the best they can do in the eyes of the critics, I suppose, is not embarrass themselves.
I'll watch, of course. I'm an addict now -- even my son looks at me suspiciously when I inform him of the latest five-star recruit landed or lost. But our season really climaxed in late November with a third excruciating loss in three years to Ohio State.
It wasn't falling off the playoff committee's radar that hurt most -- it was the loss, once again, of good, old-fashioned neighborhood bragging rights, the Big Ten East Division title. That mountaintop, thankfully, merely requires winning the game -- not styling for the sake of a television spectacle.

Texto completo: I jumped at the chance to work on "Dark Waters" for one simple reason: Todd Haynes. And I won't lie, everything else about the project scared me to death.
Based on Nathaniel Rich's New York Times Magazine cover story, "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare," "Dark Waters" centers on Rob Bilott, a corporate attorney for the chemical industry who discovers that DuPont has been contaminating his childhood community of Parkersburg, W.Va. (the culprit is a toxic chemical used in Teflon, now present in the blood of 99% of human beings).
Rob embarks on a decades-long legal battle against not only DuPont but the scientific, legal and governmental establishments the company had long held captive.

At our very first meeting, Todd and I shared how much we loved the great whistleblower films of the '70s and '80s -- "All the President's Men," "The China Syndrome," "Silkwood." In the story of Rob Bilott, we had a chance to pay homage to a great American genre with a story that spoke urgently to our time. Here was a corporate defense attorney -- a true believer in "the system" -- suddenly ensnared in the mousetrap he'd helped build. Fighting his way out would cost him everything.
Mark Ruffalo, our passionate producer and star, puts it best: "Rob Bilott is a hero not because we want to be him but because we don't."
Yet Todd, Mark and I felt strongly that "Dark Waters" could not be about one legal case, or even one hero. It would be about us, in 2019. About American communities and institutions coopted by corporate power, lulled into the belief that if problems exist, someone else will fix them. System failure.
That was a story that I knew to be true, because for 15 years, I was a congressional staffer and later a lobbyist in D.C. So I have no illusions that the hero always wins or that justice necessarily prevails. The systems of power that Rob Bilott crashes up against in "Dark Waters" are real. As Rob says in our film, "I know. I was one of them."
But from a writer's perspective, "Dark Waters" seemed like a nightmare. First off, the story was massive. Spanning nearly 20 years and two legal cases, each with its own complicated facts and characters, I'd be wrestling an octopus. Thankfully, Matthew Michael Carnahan had done exactly that in his first draft of the script, and I'm very grateful to him. (Matt was in Morocco directing when Todd got attached and brought me on.)
And not only was the story huge, it involved science. Actually, worse than science: chemistry. You know that dream where you wake up and, 20 years after your last class, the test is today? Well, the test was today.
I faced these demons the only way I knew how: denial. I couldn't write an opus about chemistry even if I'd wanted to. I could only write a story about one man -- and from his struggle would emerge a universal story.
With incredible support from Todd and Mark (who are as kind as they are unbelievably talented), I would dig beyond the legal story to find what lay below: decades of trauma wrought upon Rob, his family and the community of Parkersburg.
The final script of "Dark Waters" tells an intensely human story, a deeply personal one. And for that I am deeply indebted to Rob and his wife, Sarah. Through months of incredibly honest and lengthy conversations, they invited me into the most personal corners of their lives. The 18 years depicted in the film were a time of immense pain for the Bilotts, yet not once did they hesitate to "go there."
And in fact we did go there, and not only with the Bilotts. Rob brought Todd and me to Parkersburg to spend time with the Tennants and the Kigers, the families whose courage to confront DuPont -- which had held their community captive for generations -- gave Rob the opening he needed to crack the maze.
And yet, as we see in "Dark Waters," the maze remains. Cracked, but standing. There are no happy endings. But there are Rob Bilotts.

Allee Willis, 'Friends' Theme and 'September' Songwriter, Is Dead at 72

Texto completo: She also wrote or co-wrote "Neutron Dance" for the Pointer Sisters, "What Have I Done to Deserve This?" for the Pet Shop Boys and Dusty Springfield, and other hits.
Allee Willis, one of the music industry's most colorful figures, whose eclectic credits as a writer and co-writer included Earth, Wind & Fire's "September" and the "Friends" theme song, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72.
The cause was cardiac arrest, her publicist, Ellyn Solis, said.
The animator and producer Prudence Fenton, Ms. Willis's partner of 27 years, posted a photo on Instagram with the caption: "Rest in Boogie Wonderland," referring to the Earth, Wind & Fire disco hit that Ms. Willis wrote with Jon Lind.
Ms. Willis, who grew up in Detroit, never learned to play music. But she was drawn to Motown as a child, and said she learned how to become a songwriter by sitting on the lawn outside the record company's studios and listening to the rhythms seeping through the building's walls.
"A lot of times I would learn a bass line and then I'd hear the records and I'd go, Oh, that was 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine,"' she told The New York Times last year.
She attributed her career to her love of Motown.
"I'm so insanely attached to Motown and all the music that was coming out of Detroit, and it gave me a love for that kind of music," she told The Detroit Free Press last year. "There's no question: Had I grown up anywhere else, I would not ever have been a songwriter. Because I certainly don't have the skills to be it."
She started her career writing advertising copy and liner notes, and while her first foray into making her own music -- an album called "Childstar" -- didn't get far, it brought her to the attention of Bonnie Raitt, who asked Ms. Willis to collaborate. (Ms. Willis and David Lasley wrote Ms. Raitt's 1974 song "Got You on My Mind.")
"September," released in 1978, was an instant smash and went on to become a staple at wedding receptions, with its driving beat and its opening lines, "Do you remember/The 21st night of September?," all but guaranteed to propel people onto the dance floor.
She told NPR in 2014 that while she was working on the song with Maurice White, the leader of Earth, Wind & Fire, she was annoyed by the recurring nonsense phrase he had written, "Ba-dee-ya." She asked Mr. White what it meant, and he said, "Who cares?" That led her to a revelation: "I learned my greatest lesson ever in songwriting from him, which was never let the lyric get in the way of the groove."
Later songs included Top 10 hits for the Pointer Sisters ("Neutron Dance") and the Pet Shop Boys and Dusty Springfield ("What Have I Done to Deserve This?"), as well as tracks for Ray Charles, Sister Sledge, Cyndi Lauper, Nona Hendryx, Taylor Dayne and Toni Basil.
"I, very thankfully, have a few songs that will not go away," she told The Times of her successes, "but they're schlepping along 900 others."
Ms. Willis won her first Grammy in 1986 for writing (with Danny Sembello) Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the soundtrack to "Beverly Hills Cop."
In 1995 she was nominated for an Emmy for "I'll Be There for You," performed by the Rembrandts, best known as the theme song for the sitcom "Friends."
She lost to the main title theme music from "Star Trek: Voyager." But "I'll Be There for You" was arguably more indelible in the culture, as it played during the opening credits of "Friends" for 10 seasons plus years of reruns over images of the cast frolicking in a water fountain. The lyrics also captured the angst of their lives: "So no one told you life was gonna be this way/Your job's a joke, you're broke/Your love life's D.O.A."
Ms. Willis called it "the whitest song I ever wrote."
Along with Stephen Bray and Brenda Russell, she wrote the music for the Tony-winning musical adaptation of Alice Walker's novel "The Color Purple," which ran on Broadway from 2005 to 2008. When it was revived on Broadway in 2016, she was part of the team that earned a Grammy for best musical theater album.
In 2018 she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. But songwriting was far from her only passion. She was well known as a collector of kitsch, and her pink 1937 Los Angeles home housed her collection of candy-colored ephemera, cataloged online at her Museum of Kitsch.
Her passions also included making art (the walls of her home are lined with works by Bubbles the Artist, her alter ego), the internet (in the '90s she developed her own social network of sorts, called Willisville), and hosting wild parties that drew a fascinating cross section of Hollywood.
Last year she told The Times that putting together parties was "my No. 1 skill." She explained: "I always had a music career, an art career, set designer, film and video, technology. The parties really became the only place I could combine everything."
Allee Willis was born on Nov. 10, 1947, in Detroit, where she was raised. Her father, Nathan, was a scrapyard dealer; her mother, Rose, was a schoolteacher. Her mother died suddenly in 1964, when Allee was a teenager.
In addition to Ms. Fenton, Ms. Willis's survivors include her brother, Kent, and her sister, Marlen Frost.
Ms. Willis went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where she majored in journalism and graduated in 1969. The upheaval of the 1960s transformed her, she told the university's alumni magazine this year. "I started off a sorority girl," she said, "and ended up marching and demonstrating."
After college, she moved to New York City. Within a month of starting as a secretary at Columbia Records, she was promoted to the advertising department, where she worked with artists she idolized, among then Barbra Streisand, Laura Nyro and Janis Joplin.
"Childstar," Ms. Willis's first and only album as an artist, was a disappointment. She realized she hated performing, and Columbia dropped her.
For nearly four years, Ms. Willis checked hats at a comedy club and hung posters for a cabaret.
At the beginning of 1978, she was living on food stamps. But then she met Mr. White of Earth, Wind & Fire, and she helped him write the lyrics to "September." It reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B singles chart and No. 8 on the pop chart. By the end of the year it had sold 10 million records.
In recent years, she shifted gears to performing one-woman shows and curating her museum-home, known as Willis Wonderland.
She never lost her curiosity and ambition to do as much as possible.
"I want to do more things that involve everything I do: the music, the art, the technology, the social aspect of things," she said last year. "Life is too short, and I am too tired!"
Of all of her hits, Ms. Willis seemed most awed by the enduring power of "September."
"I'm someone that absolutely loves writing very joyful music," she told the website Songfacts in 2008. When people learn she co-wrote "September," she said, "they just go, 'Oh my God,' and then tell me in some form how happy that song makes them every time they hear it. For me, that's it."
She added: "I literally have never been to a wedding, a bar mitzvah, anything, where I have not heard that song play. So I know it's carrying on and doing what it was meant to do."

Texto completo: In the digital age, book clubs are still thriving from coast to coast.
According to a recent study, there are more than 5 million book club members in the United States. Most communities have at least one club open to those interested in reading common books and then meeting to discuss the narrative themes and schemes.
For Brandon, you can add two clubs to that number as the Brandon Book Club and the Young-At-Heart Book Club each meet once per month at the Brandon Library. Both started just over a year ago, and the participation consistently ranges between 8 and 12 people.
"Book clubs are a lot of fun, and it's a mixture of a lot of things," said Brandon branch librarian Sharon Hall. "We've read biography and things that are historical in nature and yet we still read mysteries and thrillers. It's a whole smattering of genres."
Understandably, discussion in the small group goes from the content of the books to the others in the group, to Brandon and more.
"It's fun having discussions. You learn a lot about each other and some history from the area," Hall said. "We talk about people's past experiences when they were young, or even their ancestors. That has come out in discussions. It's very interesting."
Hall is the branch librarian in Brandon, Garretson, Valley Springs and Baltic. She leads the general book club in Brandon that meets the first Thursday of every month at 10:30 a.m. January's club will meet on Jan. 9 due to the New Year's holiday.
Monica Newton from the Brandon library leads the Young-At-Heart club, which is intended for adults who enjoy reading books that were written for teens and young adults. Books such as "A Fault in Our Stars" and "The Outsiders" have been popular in young adult book clubs.
The Young-At-Heart club in Brandon meets the third Tuesday of every month at 7 p.m. Graphic novels are also a favorite, and the club in Brandon just finished New York Times bestseller "Nimona" by Noelle Stevenson. That book is actually based of Stevenson's web comic.
"Especially over the past few years it's become more popular for adults to read young adult material," Newton said. "A lot of books are cross-overs. They're great for teens as well as adults who enjoy them."
Ultimately, Newton said, the book clubs are a chance for people who love reading to come to the library and talk about their shared passion.
"It's just having a fun group of people who get together to enjoy reading a similar young novels," she said. "It is always a fun get-together."
Hall said the clubs are free and open to the public. All of the books selected for each club are available at the library and can be checked out.
"We're open to anyone who's interested," she said. "It's always fun, and it's always interesting."

Mama Cax, 30, a Model, an Activist and an Inspiration

Texto completo: A Haitian-American, she landed fashion campaigns, appeared on the cover of Teen Vogue and walked runways at the White House and at New York Fashion Week.
Mama Cax, a Brooklyn-born advocate for people with disabilities and a rising model who challenged the fashion industry's standard of beauty by not shying away from displaying her prosthetic leg on the runway and in fashion campaigns, died on Dec. 16 in London. She was 30.
Her agency, Jag Models, confirmed the death, at Royal London Hospital. A cause was not given. Mama Cax, who lived in New York, said on her official Instagram account on Dec. 12 that she had experienced severe abdominal pain while in London and later learned that she had several blood clots. A statement posted on the site said she had spent her last week in the hospital.
"As a cancer survivor, she had grown accustomed to taking on life's several challenges head on and successfully," the statement said. "It is with that same grit (fervor) that she fought her last days on earth."
She was born Cacsmy Brutus on Nov. 20, 1989, in Brooklyn. She studied in New York, France, Tunis and Rome, and had bachelor's and master's degrees in international studies, according to her website.
She was a teenager when she learned she had bone and lung cancer. After treatment she had a hip replacement, she said in an interview with Glamour magazine, but when her body rejected the hip, the decision was made to amputate her right leg.
She struggled to accept the changes.
"I probably spent one or two weeks without looking at my body whatsoever," Mama Cax told the magazine. "That sort of disgust lingered and lasted throughout my early years in college. Feeling beautiful or being in a space where I would feel beautiful was not at all on my radar. It wasn't a priority because I figured I could never get there."
She later began blogging about lifestyle and travel. She used her prominence to inspire other amputees, drawing attention by dressing up her prosthetic leg.
"I didn't see body appreciation being shown to people with disabilities or people with scars, so I started sharing my story on Instagram," she told The New York Times in May. "I was sharing for women who don't see themselves as beautiful and don't see their bodies celebrated."
She secured her first advertising campaign in 2017 before signing with Jag Models. "It was so surreal knowing there can be a space for me in beauty," she said. "From that point on, I knew I had an ability to break certain barriers."
She went on to land campaigns for Tommy Hilfiger and Sephora and appeared on the September 2018 cover of Teen Vogue. She walked in a fashion show at the White House in 2016 as well as in shows for Chromat and Savage X Fenty, a brand by Rihanna, who called Mama Cax a "powerhouse beauty" on Twitter.
Mama Cax is survived by her mother, Marie Vilus; her father, Cacsman Brutus; and four sisters, Sabienne, Lei, Cassline and Ashley Brutus.
"She was representing a whole community that's always been either misrepresented or just been invisible," Jillian Mercado, a friend and fellow model, said on Saturday. "She was really good at educating people on not only her disability, but how you can be an ally to the community. She was one of the first people who had a disability on the catwalk."
Stephanie Thomas, who is a fashion styling expert for people with disabilities and who worked with Mama Cax, said her impact on the fashion industry was "undeniable."
"She wasn't afraid to be herself," she said. "What I loved about it is that she challenged norms not by putting other people down, but by having the courage to, you know, really express herself through fashion."

Texto completo: Sin sorpresa para muchos, Nueva York ha sido calificada de lejos como la ciudad con la gente menos amable en todo el país , según una nuevo sondeo realizado por Business Insider.
34.3% de los encuestados dijeron que los neoyorquinos eran los más rudos del país, casi el doble que el segundo clasificado, Los Ángeles (19.7%).
Los resultados se basaron en dos encuestas en línea realizadas en octubre y noviembre de 2019. A más de 2 mil adultos estadounidenses se les pidió elegir las cinco ciudades menos amables de una lista de las 50 áreas metropolitanas más grandes de la nación.
La noticia no es una sorpresa para muchos. En 2011 el historiador de la ciudad de Manhattan, Michael Miscione, dijo a The New York Times que los neoyorquinos han sido considerados groseros desde finales del siglo XVIII.
“No he visto a un verdadero caballero, un hombre bien educado, desde que vine a la ciudad”, dijo el ex presidente John Adams sobre NYC en 1774: “En sus entretenimientos no hay conversación que sea agradable; no hay modestia, no hay atención el uno al otro. Hablan muy alto, muy rápido y en conjunto . Si le hacen una pregunta, antes de que pueda pronunciar tres palabras de su respuesta, se lanzarán sobre usted nuevamente y hablarán”.
Nueva York es además la ciudad más cara del país y la que recibe más turistas.
Detrás de NYC y Los Ángeles, las siguientes ciudades más rudas fueron Washington D.C. (18.9%), Chicago (18.6%) y Boston (14.9%).

Texto completo: Johanna Lindsey, the best-selling romance writer who sold more than 60 million steamy novels worldwide over a prolific 40-year career, has died at age 67.
"Hearts Aflame," "Stormy Persuasion," "Temptation's Darling," "Wildfire In His Arms" and "Marry Me by Sundown" were just a handful of the hot-blooded historical romances Lindsey penned.
Lindsey's publisher Simon & Schuster confirmed the news with a statement:
"We are greatly saddened at the news that Johanna Lindsey, passed away. A true legend in her field, her groundbreaking works were treasured and enjoyed by millions of readers worldwide. We offer our deepest condolences go out to her family during this difficult time. "
The New York Times reported that the author died on Oct. 27 in her Nashua, N. H. , hometown following complications of treatment for Stage 4 lung cancer, but her family was too devastated by her death to announce the news earlier.
Lindsey, who spent much of her life in Hawaii, told the Honolulu Star Bulletin in 1981 that she conceived of the idea of her first novel, "Captive Bride," years before she submitted it to Avon Books to be published in 1977.
"Desert sheikh, romance, kidnapping — that’s about all I started with," she said. “I just sat down one day and wrote the middle scene, the love scene in the tent. I amazed myself — I couldn’t stop writing. "
She followed that over the next four years with "A Pirate’s Love," "Brave the Wild Wind," "Fires of Winter" and "Paradise Wild. " Her books featured dramatic cover art, launching the career of flowing-haired model Fabio Lanzoni, who appeared on the cover of 1987's "Hearts Aflame. "
The best-selling novel and cover were so successful that Fabio, painted by cover artist Elaine Duillo, became a fixture with Lindsey's books.
In a statement to USA TODAY, Fabio paid tribute to Lindsey, calling her "an amazing person and an incredible author. "
"I loved being featured on her covers. To this day, 'Man of My Dreams' is still one of my all time favorites" wrote Fabio. "Rest in peace, Johanna. Thank you for sharing your gift. You will be missed. "
The prolific author's readable, face-paced "bodice-ripping" tomes were so popular that a 1993 USA TODAY article pointed out that she sold "a book every eight seconds somewhere in the world. "
After 37 best-sellers, Lindsey left Avon Books for Simon & Schuster in 2001. In July she published her most recent novel, "Temptation's Darling. "

A #MeToo backlash in an insular world

Texto completo: It was early October 2017, an earthshaking expose in The New York Times had unveiled a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, #MeToo was taking over social media, and the entire world seemed to wait for another shoe — any shoe — to drop.
“Classical music is much more insular than Hollywood, and equally if not more open to predators," musicologist and scholar Will Robin tweeted, sharing an article by a former opera singer who claimed to have experienced and witnessed countless instances of misconduct. “I doubt there will be a reckoning, and if there is, it will be ugly."
Then, down came a reckoning, domino after domino falling. The “open secret" that was James Levine's lifetime of abuse was revealed, analyzed, and taken to court. The names kept coming: conductors Charles Dutoit and Daniele Gatti, countertenor David Daniels, Cleveland Orchestra concertmaster William Preucil, and many others who never loomed so large in the national consciousness but still held inestimable power at conservatories and smaller companies around the country.
But if the last three months of 2017 and most of 2018 can be counted as a time for reckoning, 2019 was the year the ugliness bled through like never before.
As long as there have been #MeToo cases in classical music, there has been backlash. Speaking to classic.fm in April 2018, soprano Anna Netrebko called allegations against Levine and Dutoit “total [expletive]," saying that “nobody will ever force you to do anything ... if you did it, it means that you allowed that." (The singer later clarified that she wasn't trying to blame victims, citing concern about accused people's careers being impacted by public outcries.) It was never hard to find someone saying that the accusers were just raising a fuss to get money or attention, whether that was an anonymous Twitter troll or a lawyer speaking on the record.
But in 2019, actual institutions started to make their own statements. Dutoit and Gatti were back on the podium in Europe; reports about the former's last-minute engagement at Orchestre National de France indicated that a majority of musicians opposed his return but orchestra administration decided he was the only conductor available with the credentials to lead Berlioz's “The Damnation of Faust." When violinist Lara St. John told The Philadelphia Inquirer this summer that she had been sexually abused in the 1980s by her teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music, the late Jascha Brodsky, and then had her claims dismissed by the school's administration, the school announced it would review its sexual assault policy, but not before sending an e-mail to students, parents, and alumni asking them not to discuss the article publicly or on social media, “out of respect for those involved."
Don't talk about it, keep everyone else from talking about it, and maybe it'll go away; this was the approach also initially adopted by Metropolitan Opera general manager Peter Gelb in response to his staff's concerns about the world's most famous ex-tenor, Plácido Domingo, whose ability to sell out a house apparently outweighed 20 women's accusations of harassment, detailed and corroborated in two articles by the Associated Press. The singer withdrew from his Met engagements roughly 24 hours before he was slated to take the stage as the title character in Verdi's “Macbeth"; many engagements in Europe still stand. He was received with standing ovations at this year's Salzburg Festival, where he'll also be singing in 2020 pending any new information uncovered by the internal investigation by LA Opera, which he formerly directed.
Is the backlash indication that things will slowly trend back to a status quo of silence? I'm trying my best to instead see it as an encouraging sign, the desperate death rattle of the old lies. Some organizations are visibly and proactively doing their part: When Boston Lyric Opera presented Britten's “The Rape of Lucretia" and Ruders's “The Handmaid's Tale" last spring, they worked with Boston Area Rape Crisis Centerc and Casa Myrna to train staff on sexual violence 101 and offer support and resources to audience members. And when tenor Vittorio Grigolo was reportedly caught groping a female chorister during a curtain call, the leading man was swiftly suspended and then fired from London's Royal Opera as well as the Met, following an investigation.
Of all the myths and cliches that persist about classical music, the king of them all is that liking it, listening to it, or being good at playing it automatically makes you a better person, as if our darkest impulses can be somehow obliterated by its Apollonian beam. And in its composers, conductors, and teachers, classical music continues to lean hard on the great-man myth — they are almost always men, our master Maestros — and brush aside any inconveniences in their biographies, such as sexism or Nazism.
Few will outright admit it, but the old myth lingers in the classical music world's reaction to its celebrities behaving badly. Is it so surprising that institutions would be invested in polishing their legacies, not taking their statues off the pedestals? Blinking, we ask how someone who created such beauty could do these awful things. Then, when necessary, their faces vanish from the concert-hall walls, their biography Web pages turn up with “Not Found" messages, their recordings disappear from the gift shop, and the conversation stops. The way forward, then, is not to let this fire die.
When survivors speak up about what happened to them, when institutions proactively work to destabilize power structures that keep a select few “geniuses" above accountability, and when music lovers of all stripes refuse to tacitly accept abuse as part of the culture, it becomes more difficult for music organizations to maintain the illusion of neutrality. Then, perhaps we can start talking about how there was never a neutral position in the first place, and the real, messy, long reckoning can begin.

Sexual predator Weinstein is living the good life

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein, once one of the most brash and powerful men in Hollywood, has lately been having issues with his ankle bracelet.
The shunned former movie producer is wearing a court-ordered monitor while he awaits trial for allegedly raping one woman and forcing another to let him perform a sex act on her.
Last week, a Manhattan prosecutor told a judge that the tracking device on Weinstein's ankle had stopped transmitting at least 57 times during a two-month period.
"These were not technical glitches in any shape or form. Mr. Weinstein did not want people to know where he was," asserted the prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon.
Weinstein's attorney said the ankle monitor randomly quit working because of dead batteries and shaky wireless connections. The hearing ended when the judge doubled Weinstein's bail to $2 million, which Weinstein promptly secured with stocks and other equities.
Such are the problems of super-rich sexual predators, trying to decide which seven-figure assets to post with your bondsman.
Weinstein, 67, was notorious in the entertainment world long before his monstrous behavior was chronicled in the New Yorker magazine and New York Times, igniting the #MeToo movement.
He got away with it so long because he could wreck young careers -- and threatened to do just that. So people feared him. What finally brought him down were brave women who agreed to go public.
Unlike the late Jeffrey Epstein, Weinstein has so far been able to sleep in his own bed and avoid the indignities of incarceration. However, if convicted of the most serious criminal charges, he could be in prison the rest of his life.
Weinstein also has been sued in civil courts by more than 30 actresses and former employees who say he assaulted or harassed them.
Three of his most well-known accusers– Salma Hayek, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie – have spoken up but not joined the lawsuits.
Weinstein's lawyers say he's looking forward to clearing his name. On the same day he faced the judge about his ankle monitor, another set of attorneys was working to finalize a $25 million settlement with dozens of his alleged victims.
Eighteen of the women would divide $6.2 million, and another $18.5 million would be earmarked for others who are part of a class-action suit and for future claimants.
Still, the deal would be a coup for Weinstein and the board of his now-bankrupt movie studio. Under the proposed terms, the money paid to the women would come not from Weinstein's pocket but, rather, from the insurance companies representing the studio.
The total package of $47 million would also generously include $12 million to cover some of the legal expenses for Weinstein, his brother Bob and other former members of the board.
As a capper, the settlement would not require Weinstein to admit any wrongdoing.
Some of the women who've signed off on the settlement have said they're displeased, but they also know it could be their last shot at being compensated. Weinstein reportedly might soon file for personal bankruptcy -- even though prosecutors say he has sold $60 million worth of real estate in New York.
Not all of Weinstein's accusers will participate in the settlement. An attorney for TV producer Alexandra Canosa, who has stated that Weinstein raped and threatened her, said there is "nothing fair or just" about the agreement.
It's natural to be incensed by a deal that allows a wealthy creep to slither off without paying the victims any of his own money, or even acknowledging responsibility for the pain he has caused.
But settling a messy civil lawsuit is different than beating sexual assault charges in criminal court.
True, most predators aren't rich and surrounded by smart lawyers – but ask Bill Cosby if that's always helpful when your victims are on the witness stand, telling their stories to a jury.
The fact is, Weinstein probably will never admit what he's done, much less apologize. He'll continue to insist that many of his accusers are making up incidents that never occurred and that the rest of them had sex with him consensually.
Weinstein's trial is set for Jan. 6. In the meantime, he remains free, staying at home in the New York suburb of Bedford.
His lawyers have assured the judge that their famous client isn't going anywhere.
They said he's actually hired someone to help him make sure that his ankle monitor is working properly.

In no particular order, here is a list of Wisconsin-inspired books with picks for readers of differing ages to enjoy — and gift — this holiday season and the whole year through. Books are available online, at bookstores and at the local libraries.
"Black House" by Stephen King and Peter Straub In the mood for a tale of horror? Stephen King and Peter Straub offer readers just that on a Wisconsin-shaped platter in "Black House."
The sequel to "The Talisman," Black House follows Jack Sawyer, a retired Los Angeles Police Department detective, who lives Tamarack, a small village on the state's west side — the same area where Wisconsin native Straub spent time as a child, according to the La Crosse Tribune.
When in nearby French Landing, a person called "The Fisherman" begins to kill children in the style of serial killer Albert Fish, local law enforcement friends reach out to Jack for help. During the investigation, Jack is called back to the same parallel universe he entered as 12-year-old, where he must explore his past and seek for answers to the present, according to the book's description.
The book ties into the King's "Dark Tower" series, a body of work which is referenced in several of the master of horror's novels, such as "The Shining," and places them in the same universe, according to CinemaBlend.
"Shotgun Lovesongs" by Nikolas Butler Small-town Wisconsin life and deeply rooted relationships are at the heart of Wisconsin author Nikolas Butler's debut novel "Shotgun Lovesongs."
Henry, Lee, Kipp and Ronny have been friends since childhood. Despite moves, marriages, ailments and fame, their relationships endured into adulthood — some remaining stronger than others.
As the book begins, readers find the quartet — with the addition of Henry's wife Beth — reuniting for Kipp's wedding. But, while they are together once more, the town and the relationships don't feel the same for each person. What follows is a test a lifelong friendships and marriage, shaking even the strongest of foundations.
Although its setting of Little Wing — a small town on Wisconsin's western side — is fictional, the small-town feel it emulates is known to readers who lived in the state. Readers will recognize familiar sites: the large expanses of farm land, the water tower which offered views high above buildings, and the watering hole where everyone gathers, too.
"Wisconsin Death Trip" by Michael Lesy Published in the early 1970s, Michael Lesy's "Wisconsin Death Trip" became a cult classic with its chilling real-life account of a small Wisconsin town mired in tragedy.
The book profiles Black River Falls from 1890 to 1910, a time when the town began to spiral down after the mines — its lifeblood — shut down. Using photos from the town photographer, Charles Van Schaik, Lesy pieces together a narrative of residents' lives as they confront business closures, suicide, murder, diphtheria, mental illness and, in one account, a woman being buried alive, according to Artful Living.
Although not the most lighthearted of books, "Wisconsin Death Trip" gives an eye-opening account of what it was like to live in a time of much uncertainty. For those who want more, the book was turned into a documentary of the same name in 1999.
"Seventeenth Summer" by Maureen Daly Considered to be the start of the modern young adult genre, "Seventeenth Summer" takes place in early 1940s Fond du Lac — the city Author Maureen Daly grew up in — and follows teens Angie Morrow and Jack Duluth.
In the summer before Angie leaves for college, she catches the eye of Jack, the high school basketball player, who too plans to leave the city to move to Oklahoma. Despite what may come, a relationship between the two slowly blossoms into love.
Along with capturing Fond du Lac landmarks, like Lakeside Park and Pete Mengl's, the story captures the time period as well — an era of courtships, strict propriety and soda drinking at the drug store.
"Better off Friends" by Elizabeth Eulberg For those who love a will-they-won't-they story, the young adult novel "Better off Friends" serves one up with Wisconsin touches.
The story begins when California native Levi moves with his family to Wisconsin, where, at his middle school, he meets Macallan. While she first is only tasked with showing him around, Macallan and Levi quickly bond and become best friends.
Through both Macallan's and Levi's perspectives, readers follows the friends into high school where they must figure out if their relationship should remain just platonic — all while enjoying Packer games and trips to Culvers for ButterBurgers.
"The Bloody Trail: In Quest of the Best Wisconsin Bloody Marys" by Susan Fiebig Readers looking to take a tour of the state's bloody mary offerings will find a guide in "The Bloody Trail: In Quest of the Best Wisconsin Bloody Marys."
For the past 15 years, Fond du Lac resident Susan Fiebig has traveled across the United States in search of the best bloody marys. In the interactive 46-page book, Fiebig focuses on her Wisconsin travels — the state which she said has the best — and profiles the 11 best stops, while giving a history on the drink itself.
Those in search of more bloody marys across the state can read Fiebig's sequel "Adventures on the Bloody Trail: The Quest Continues" created with the help of readers. The book includes a map of 20 restaurants and bars that make the drink, as well as bloody mary trivia.
"American Gods" Neil Gaiman Deities new and old walk in Wisconsin in "American Gods" a novel by Neil Gaiman, a British author with a residence in Wisconsin.
Days after Shadow's wife and best friend are killed in a car accident, he is recruited to work for businessman Mr. Wednesday. What follows is a road trip across America as legendary and modern gods fight for power in America, according to the book description.
Multiple chapters take place in the state, such as in a Northwoods town called Lakeside, and the House on the Rock, what, in the novel, is the "one of the holiest places in the United States," according to Neil Gaiman.
The television network Starz recently adapted the book into a TV series and, in March 2019, renewed it for a third season, according to Entertainment Weekly.
"The Women" T.C. Boyle "The Women" shares the story of famed Wisconsin architect Frank Lloyd Wright's relationship with four women throughout his life.
Told from the perspective of a fictional Japanese architect writing a biography of Wright's life, the book looks at his first wife and mother to six children Catherine "Kitty" Tobin; Mamah Borthwick, his lover who was murdered; his second wife Maude Noel; and third and final wife Olgivanna Lazovich Milanoff, according to The New York Times.
While architecture is not the main focus of the story, part of the story takes place at Taliesen, the home south of Spring Green Wright built to protect he and Borthwick from the press. It is also where a servant murdered Borthwick and her children, according to The New York Times. The other women also spend time at the rebuilt home, including wives Milanoff and Noel.
"Little House in the Big Woods" by Laura Ingalls Wilder A staple of childhood literature, "Little House in the Big Woods" chronicles part of the life of author Laura Ingalls Wilder near Pepin, Wisconsin.
In the Big Woods of Northwest Wisconsin, Ingalls Wilder lived with Ma and Pa, and her sisters Mary and Carrie in a log cabin surrounded only by trees and wild animals, like the wolves that howled at night. Days were filled with a mix of hard work and fun — salting and smoking venison for the winter, picking up wood chips, harvesting sap for maple syrup and on cold nights listening to Pa play the fiddle.
The book was the first in the "Little House on the Prairie" series and survey conducted by School Library Journal in 2012 placed it as number 19 in the Top 100 Children's Novels of All Time. However, the series is not without criticism.
With its depiction of Native Americans and minstrel shows, the series portrays "dated cultural attitudes towards Indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities," according to a statement from the Association for Library Service. For this reason, critics recommend reading the books with the historical context in mind, according to The Atlantic.
"Crymost" by Dean H. Wild A Wisconsin resident, author Dean H. Wild pulled on the small towns surrounding him for inspiration as he wrote his tale of horror and the paranormal in "Crymost."
"Crymost" is set in Knoll, Wisconsin, a somewhat-segregated fictional town which, if placed on a map, would be found between Dodge and Fond du Lac counties, Wild told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in January 2019. On the edge of town is a place which residents called the Crymost.
Back in the early 19th century, residents noticed a feeling of sadness hanging over them at cliff. Decades later, they bring their suffering and offer mementos to it. As the supernatural awakens at Crymost, small town secrets begin to be spilled, and the town is put in jeopardy.
While the story calls on fictional forces, the story is grounded in real-world settings and gives shout outs to towns and cities Wisconsin readers will recognize, like Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, and Milwaukee, Wild told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in January.
"What the Moon Said" by Gayle Rosengren Readers will take a step back in-time and see the world through youthful eyes as they delve into Gayle Rosengren's Great-Depression-era novel, "What the Moon Said."
The child of Russian immigrants, Esther Vogel's life is filled with superstitions of her mother, who spends more time searching for signs than showing affection to her daughter. But when her father loses his job in Chicago, Esther's day-to-day is upended as the family moves to a Wisconsin farm and makes a deteriorating house with no electricity their home, according to Publisher's Weekly.
Geared towards middle-grade readers, the book gives readers a look at Wisconsin life in the 1930s as Esther finds adventure in the farm land and its animals, school and new friendship. All the while, she seeks to show her mother how much she can do, and see life for more than just the possibility that comes with superstitious signs, according to Penguin Random House.
"A Reliable Wife" by Robert Goolrick Wisconsin-based historical fiction comes wrapped in a suspenseful and romantic package with Robert Goolrick's "A Reliable Wife."
In the early 1900s, a train from Chicago brings Catherine Land to rural Wisconsin. She is there for one purpose: to meet the man who placed a newspaper ad "for a reliable wife."
However, she doesn't intend to be the "simple, honest woman" she described herself to be. Catherine plans to slowly poison Ralph, and profit off his death, according to Workman Publishing. Little does she know, the businessman waiting on the platform for her, Ralph Truitt, has plans of his own.
These plans and later plot twists play out in a small Wisconsin town against the backdrop of the frigid Wisconsin winter landscape, which serves to keep the characters close and build tension.
"Death Stalks Door County" by Patricia Skalka One of Wisconsin's most popular vacation destinations becomes the site of a series of summer murders in "Death Stalks Door County" by Patricia Skalka.
After the deaths of his wife and daughter, former Homicide Detective Dave Cubiak leaves Chicago and moves to Door County, where he takes a position as a park ranger. Although in a different place, Dave isn't able to outrun death. In the days leading up to the Fourth of July Festival, six people die in Door County, according to Publisher's Weekly.
With pressure from a Peninsula State Park citizens advisory board member to figure out what is going on as the festival approaches, Dave begins to dig into the deaths and see if they are only just accidents or more sinister murders.
For those who can't get enough of the Door County landscapes Skalka writes about, the book is the first of five books in the Dave Cubiak Door County Mystery series.

Texto completo: The financial planning he'd done his whole life paid off -- to me, not him.
Last week I got new checks in the mail. It had been years since I needed any; like most people I find myself writing fewer and fewer checks these days. Cutting open the package, I was struck by the fact that where I used to receive a whole box of checks, I now got a slim envelope with only two books -- one more paper item that used to be solid and institutional was now, like so much else, swiftly passing into irrelevance. I couldn't help feeling a twinge of loss.
When I saw the new checks I was suddenly flooded with a regret I didn't anticipate at all. I had forgotten this new batch would have my name on it -- only my name. My husband's name, which had also been on our checks for nearly 20 years, was gone. He died in 2015. In the four years since, I gave or stored away virtually all of his stuff, but his name on the joint bank account stayed. I thought of it as a lingering bit of post-mortem paperwork that was no big deal, something I could do anytime I had five minutes to go into the bank. That I never went spoke to how much I am still connected to Alan, especially in matters of money. For all kinds of reasons, many to do with Alan himself, I never wanted to face money alone.
In the past I'd pretended there was nothing to face. Finances for me had never been a big deal, not unimportant but only one fact of life among many. When I was single and a modestly salaried journalist, I pretty much spent what I made -- I reasoned that's what money was for. As long as I could pay rent and essentials and not incur too much debt, I was content, successful even. When I got married in 2000, the idea of joining my money with my husband's was exciting and endearing. What might we buy together? What would we save up for? The possibilities alone of expanded wealth, monetary and spiritual, made me feel rich.
Alan was much less romantic about money. I discovered he was very anxious about it, as anxious as I was determinedly indifferent. Throughout our nearly 15 years of marriage, he always wanted to call money into account, to make budgets and forecasts, to plan. I wanted to buy things in the moment and not think too much about the future. I was partly trying to counterbalance Alan's tendency to imagine a dark fiscal future in which we were always broke and overextended, even when the facts and figures of our joint assets said otherwise.
Then roughly halfway through our marriage, in the late aughts, the journalism business began to come apart. I started losing gigs and getting paid dramatically less than the salary I had started married life with: We were no longer equally yoked. Though our love persisted, it didn't conquer a nagging but mostly unvoiced tension about who was more valuable than who, who was a deficit and who was not.
All of this dovetailed uncomfortably with racial difference, with how we saw ourselves and our fortunes. I'm black and Alan was white. I wasn't opposed to financial success, of course, but it was hardly a given among the black people I grew up with. More often people struggled simply to have full-time jobs or steady work at all. The real goal, whether you had money or not, was to feel affirmed and fulfilled in a country that in a million ways told black people they were worth less, if not actually worthless.
Alan had grown up seeing financial security as natural and normal, almost a birthright. Even though we both grew up working- to middle-class (though in very demographically different parts of Los Angeles) he saw that status as temporary -- his generation would of course make more money than the previous one. In other words, he was deeply invested in the American dream and his place in it as a white person, while I had always stood outside of it. The irony is that Alan was a fiercely progressive history teacher who knew very well the false promise and racial hypocrisies of that dream. But he couldn't snuff out his expectations of prosperity entirely, just as I couldn't snuff out my corresponding sense of estrangement from money.
When I lost writing work and scrambled to make it up, Alan was alternately supportive and critical as he struggled mightily with a fear, almost a terror, of being poor. Though I was more circumspect, I couldn't help but feel I was dragging him into a reality he had never counted on. Per the power dynamics of race, I instantly assumed responsibility for making things worse. I was disrupting our good life not just because I wasn't making enough money now but also because my husband was obliged, by our marriage, to experience a bit of the long-term struggle so common to black people, even educated people like me.
In my joblessness I fought feeling a kind of shame very similar to the shame I felt as a grad student 30 years earlier when a white professor accused me of plagiarizing a term paper I had written because, he said, people like me simply weren't competent enough to write like that. I knew he was wrong, yet that didn't keep me from feeling that I would always be kept from real success -- especially financial success -- because of beliefs like his. On some level I accepted that.
When Alan died, the unimaginable happened: I came into money. I wasn't rich but I was O.K., and would be O.K. for years to come. The financial planning Alan had done his whole teaching life to keep away the demons of poverty paid off -- to me, not him. It was hard for me to accept his sudden, terrible death and my new struggle-free state he'd made possible. I responded with a mix of bewilderment and gratitude, and decided that I was only taking care of Alan's money in his absence. Having his name on the checks helped me believe that and kept me from contemplating the unfamiliar truth that I was in charge of not just money, but also the life it was paying for.
That truth arrived with the new checks. But after the initial flood of regret came a surprising calm. Four years on, the truth of being financially alone is not jarring or life-changing so much as mundane. Buying a car, donating to nonprofit radio, regularly paying far too much for veterinary bills and property taxes -- these are now the facts of my life, a few among many.
Alan is not among those facts anymore. His permanent absence has created a poverty I'll always live with.

The World Christmas Made

Texto completo: The Christian past shapes the secular present. Does it matter?
In early November, a study published in the journal Science claimed to trace the whole social course of modernity -- the decline of clan and tribe, the turn to nuclear families, the rise of individualism -- back to Roman Catholicism's opposition to incest.
The medieval church's sweeping ban on cousin-marriage, the researchers argued, broke up traditional kinship networks and gave rise to new family patterns and eventually a new psychology -- a less conformist, more individualist, very clearly modern mind-set that according to their research is much more common in regions that had sustained exposure to Catholicism before 1500 A.D.
"Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence," runs a famous line from John Maynard Keynes, "are usually the slaves of some defunct economist." This goes for practical modern people and deceased theologians as well: You may think that you don't want to marry your cousin for sound reasons of genetic hygiene, but in fact you're just following injunctions laid down by French ecclesiastics in the sixth century after Christ.
The Science study naturally provoked a certain discomfort among people disinclined to credit Western Christendom for anything save stained glass and inquisitions. The more interesting question, though, is what actual believing Christians should make of it, and of the larger genre to which it belongs: Historical accounts that emphasize our religion's essential role in the making of the modern world, even as that same modernity has obviously been a time of dissolution for many people's faith.
This is a good Christmas-season question, for the time of year when the threads still binding us to the old-time religion shine red and green and silver, and it's sharpened by an example of the genre that would make a good last-minute Christmas gift: The British historian Tom Holland's new book Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World, a galloping tour of Christianity's influence across the last 2,000 years, with vivid vignettes scattered across the centuries, and a concluding argument the Christian faith, "the most influential framework for making sense of human existence that has ever existed," still shapes the way that even the most secular modern people think about the world.
Assume for the sake of argument that Holland's account is largely true. Does that get actual Christian belief anywhere in contemporary debates? Is anyone persuaded to take up a faith, or consider it anew, because ideas they value are historically and intellectually dependent on its premises?
I think there are historical moments when this can happen: The little renaissance in Christian thought in the aftermath of World War II, for instance, clearly owed something to a desire to get back to the West's religious roots, after Auschwitz and Hiroshima made a certain kind of secular optimism seem foolish.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
But it took a uniquely horrifying moment to produce that impulse -- like a person turning to a priest in the aftermath of a literal demonic visitation. In our own era Christians still fear the possibility of a post-Christian totalitarianism, but nonbelievers fear elements of conservative Christianity rather more, and often share the hope expressed in my New Haven neighbor Samuel Moyn's review of Holland -- that a secular, social-justice left can preserve the best of the Christian ethical inheritance, while leaving the metaphysics and a considerable part of the morality behind.
In the long run I am not sure this hope is warranted: Human movements have a drive toward coherence in their world-pictures, and one reason secular utopianism unmoored from Christianity has become radical and murderous so often is that a coherent atheist materialism will tend to exclude as mere sentiment the ideas about inherent human dignity and the "thou shalt nots" that the Christian revolution introduced.
But societies can also live with ideological inconsistency for quite some time before that drive manifests itself -- and in the between-time, I don't expect many secular readers to leap into religious faith because a newspaper columnist complains about their system's incoherence.
Which is no doubt why the scriptures that inspire this holiday season contain more simple miracles than they do clever arguments about consistent world-pictures. Indeed if I am honest, the key difference between a regretful doubter like Holland, convinced of Christianity's moral power but unable in his book's conclusion to quite make the leap of faith, and a fumbling believer like myself, may be as simple as this: I grew up around mystical and supernatural-seeming happenings, which primed me to permanently doubt the reasonableness of materialism in all its forms, both confident and sorrowful.
So as much I enjoy arguing about modernity's debt to Christianity, what most often sustains faith in a secular age are the surprising answers given to different people every day, with God only knows what patterns and purposes, to W.H. Auden's Advent prayer:
Nothing can save us that is possible:
We who must die demand a miracle.
There's no harm in asking for yourself, this week. Merry Christmas.

Texto completo: Huawei believes politics, trade and technology are behind the U.S. vendetta against it. U.S. officials say Huawei is the worst of many Chinese companies whose close ties to the Chinese government and military put American national security at risk. Moreover, they say Huawei and other export-oriented Chinese companies have no choice but to follow the dictates of the state and the Communist Party should either want to attack or otherwise damage foreign adversaries.
Is there a smoking gun? Not exactly. But U.S. officials describe a long list of wrongdoing they believe proves the company to be a bad actor.
Companies often get hit with litigation -- think of the patent wars between Apple and Samsung that have lasted years. Huawei officials have shown The Times studies they say indicate Huawei has been named in fewer lawsuits involving intellectual property than other big tech companies. Huawei also says that neither the company nor any of its key executives have been convicted of any crimes. And it says that most of the cases brought against it were dismissed or resulted in small settlements.

Still, what's striking is the broad range of allegations leveled against Huawei outside China since it was founded in 1987, as well as the role that U.S. officials, agencies and prosecutors have played in keeping tabs on it or in bringing criminal charges against it. In almost every case Huawei has denied the charges, and it has been willing to hire top-flight lawyers and lobbyists to successfully defend it in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions outside China.
This timeline is broadly categorized by accusations levied against Huawei and the reaction from the U.S. government and others, who have often moved to retaliate against the company or curb its actions:

Cisco fires the first shot
Cisco filed suit in eastern Texas in 2003 alleging Huawei violated at least five patents and copied Cisco's operating system source code verbatim, command line interface, manuals and help screens. Even the bugs were identical, Cisco alleged. "This lawsuit will be a precedent for enforcement around the world," Terry Alberstein, director of Asia-Pacific corporate affairs for Cisco, said at the time. Cisco and Huawei settled in 2004 after Huawei agreed to change its source code and stop using some technology. The terms were confidential.

RAND reports Huawei worked closely with China's military
The RAND Corp. produced a report for the U.S. Air Force arguing China's booming IT firms partnered with the military and state-owned research organizations to advance China's military. Companies such as Huawei, chosen as "national champions," got staff and funding from the military, state banks and other agencies. Huawei denies close connections with the military.

Accused of lying
FBI interviews Huawei's Ren Zhengfei and concludes that he lied
In July 2007, FBI officers interviewed Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on whether Huawei had had dealings with Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions. His denial was a lie, according to a 2019 U.S. fraud indictment of his daughter, Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meng is accused of misleading banks by denying Huawei's control over Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech, a company doing business with Iran. Huawei and Meng deny any wrongdoing.

U.S. blocks Huawei from buying part of 3Com
In 2003, 3Com, a U.S. manufacturer of router and networking products in China, formed a joint venture with Huawei. Five years later the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States blocked Huawei's bid to buy 16.5% of 3Com, which was supplying networking security software to the U.S. military, according to the Financial Times. The deal was blocked over concerns that Chinese spies could hack the U.S. military using Huawei equipment, the New York Times reported.
Leak shows Huawei secretly helped North Korea
Huawei worked secretly with Chinese company Panda International Information Technology for at least eight years to build and maintain North Korea's wireless system, according to documents leaked to the Washington Post by a former Huawei employee. If Huawei supplied Panda technology containing substantial U.S. components without a license, this would have violated a U.S. export ban.

Rival says China subsidizes Huawei, breaching global trade rules
The EU Commission investigated a complaint that the Chinese state arranged tax breaks, cheap loans and research subsidies to Huawei and another China tech firm, ZTE, enabling them to undercut rivals' prices, against international trade rules. The complaint came from a Belgian wireless technology firm, Option.
Huawei denied the accusations. The Belgian firm dropped its complaint when it made a deal with Huawei. The Chinese firm paid it 45 million euros to license its technology and buy a subsidiary that made semiconductors.
JULY: Accused of theft
Documents marked "Motorola Confidential Proprietary"
In a July 2010 lawsuit, Motorola accused Huawei of stealing technology. The lawsuit said former Motorola employee Pan Shaowei and two colleagues flew to China in 2003 and handed trade secrets to Ren. Later, Pan emailed more secrets to Ren: "Attached please find those document about SC300 (CDMA 2000 1X) specification you asked." Every page was marked "Motorola Confidential Proprietary."
Motorola also sued Illinois firm Lemko (where Pan was chief technology officer), accusing him, Motorola employee Hanjuan Jin and others of passing trade secrets to Lemko -- which it alleged was working with Huawei to sell products based on stolen technology. Jin was arrested trying to flee to China with $30,000 and thousands of documents, according to Motorola's suit. She was later sentenced to four years in jail for theft of trade secrets.
The next year, Huawei sued to block Motorola from selling its networking unit, because the deal involved some Huawei technology. The two sides settled in 2011.

Texto completo: Washington • The financial aid stranglehold on students who commit to colleges may be broken.
In a proposed agreement announced this month to answer Justice Department antitrust accusations, the National Association for College Admission Counseling said it would allow its member college and university counselors to recruit students even after they have committed to another school and would permit members to encourage students to transfer after they have already enrolled.
Colleges and universities have been heavily criticized for encouraging potential students to enter into agreements, particularly for early admissions, with the understanding that an accepted applicant could not then turn to another school. That understanding, which was not legally binding but was widely followed, prevented universities from competing for applicants by offering more enticing financial aid packages.
Now colleges will be free to offer perks, like special scholarships or priority in course selection, to early-decision applicants — students who are less likely to need tuition assistance and use the process to secure a spot at their first-choice schools. For many selective colleges, more than half of an incoming freshman class will have been accepted through early admission.
Institutions will also be able to continue recruiting students beyond a widely applied May 1 deadline that is typically imposed for students who have applied through a regular decision process and are considering offers based, at least in part, on financial aid packages.
The changes stand to shake up the admissions process in the next year, affecting some colleges’ ability to predict the size of their freshman classes while allowing some students to benefit from competitive financial aid packages or even bargain for assistance right up until they walk onto a campus.
The agreement brings to a close a two-year investigation into the association’s code of ethics by the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which enforces laws governing fair consumer and competitive market practices. In a complaint, the Justice Department maintained that the organization’s recruitment standards violated antitrust laws because they “substantially reduced competition among colleges for college applicants and potential transfer students and deprived these consumers of the benefits.”
The department began investigating shortly after the National Association for College Admission Counseling adopted new recruitment rules in 2017, which sought to protect students and families from undue pressure and aggressive tactics that could be construed as coercive. The rules were part of a broad set of voluntary professional standards that the 82-year organization writes for its members, more than 15,000 high school and college admissions counselors.
The Justice Department took issue with three provisions: Schools should not offer incentives, like prime housing, to persuade students to apply early decision; colleges should not knowingly recruit or offer enrollment incentives to students who are already enrolled, registered or have submitted their deposits to other institutions; and members must not initiate contact with students to lure them into transferring.
In September, the organization preemptively voted to strike the provisions from its ethics code to avoid a costly legal fight with the Justice Department, saying such litigation would have “dire consequences on the association’s finances and ability to operate in the future.”
The association “continues to believe that the now deleted provisions provided substantial aid and protection to students in their process of choosing and moving from high school to college,” the organization said in a statement. “However, the association understands its obligations under the decree and intends to strictly implement and abide by its provisions.”
In a statement, Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general who leads the antitrust division, called the settlement “a victory for all college applicants and students across the United States who will benefit from vigorous competition among colleges for their enrollment.”
“While trade associations and standards-setting organizations can and often do promote rules and standards that benefit the market as a whole, they cannot do so at the cost of competition,” he said.
In the early 1990s, the antitrust division investigated the eight colleges and universities in the Ivy League, which used “overlap meetings” to share information and collaborate on financial aid offers.
Last year, the Justice Department began investigating whether colleges and universities were violating antitrust laws by exchanging information about prospective students who make early-decision commitments.
Higher education experts anticipate that the changes will be mostly felt by smaller or less-selective institutions, many of which are already forecasting enrollment losses because of a looming “demographic cliff” from falling birthrates and diminishing interest from foreign students. Institutions may also have a harder time predicting their fall enrollment, and that uncertainty could affect their ability to pull from waiting lists or project how many students they lose over the summer.
Jon Boeckenstedt, vice provost of enrollment management at Oregon State University, anticipated that the changes would prompt colleges and universities to lower costs for some prospective students.
“If there is anything good that comes out of this, it might be that colleges looking to fill their last slots might go and find some low-income students who are extremely price sensitive and would be thrilled to take a slot for a discounted price,” he said.
Brian Rosenberg, president of Macalester College, in St. Paul, Minnesota, said he did not believe there would be enough slots for those students. Affluent students will still disproportionately apply for early decision, Rosenberg said, and with the increased competition, colleges will rush to recruit tuition-paying students to secure their revenue early.
“It results in more benefit to the people who already benefit,” Rosenberg said. “The problem that it creates, and the problem that’s most endemic in our higher education system, is the students that stand to be most harmed are the ones already disadvantaged.”

Texto completo: The bipolar days are here, half the planet at its farthest remove from sunlight and warmth, the other half engulfed by fires and some of the hottest days ever recorded.
We live by laws that have no control over the great certainty of the earth: that it spins on a tilted axis, and this week cast one sphere mostly in darkness and the other in light. The great uncertainty, the fragile construct of civilization, had a solstice of sorts in the nation’s capital Wednesday. It was a fine day for the Constitution.
People are capable of doing extraordinary things in the season of inertia and gloom. The Continental Army of 1777 built a winter camp of 12,000 stragglers just 18 miles from British-occupied Philadelphia. Many of the desperate and the cold at Valley Forge would eventually defeat the mightiest empire on earth. Two thousand others would not see the springtime.
Seventy-five years ago this month, an army of kids in thin jackets and shredded boots faced down the last big western thrust of the Nazi war machine in the frozen Ardennes forest. For Americans, the Battle of the Bulge was the bloodiest in the war against the greatest evil of the 20th century.
A handful of the soldiers who survived that carnage, now in their final years, were asked this week at a battleground memorial why they made that sacrifice for others. Their answer was quoted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as she assumed her role in executing the gravest act a government of the people can take against a tyrannical president.
“We came here to fight for you not because you are Americans,” she said, explaining the why of the soldiers, “but because we are Americans.”
President Donald Trump took a can of spray paint and a hammer to that history. Rather than help a struggling ally, he sought to extort it. He used American taxpayer money as a club to induce a foreign power to intervene in our election, and then obstructed efforts to get at the truth of the betrayal. These facts are not in dispute, which is the only reason Republicans in the Senate refuse to hold a legitimate trial.
As it is, a fog of criminality hangs over all of Trump world. When Rick Gates, the former Trump deputy campaign chairman, was sentenced to jail this week, he became the fourth close associate of the president to be locked up. Two others are awaiting sentencing on serious felonies.
That our president is a monumental cheater — on his wives, on his country, on his charity, on truth, on numerous business contractors, and even his golf game — is also not in dispute. The greater sadness is how the inflammation of Trumpism has spread to people and institutions that were once thought to be immune from his indecency.
Is it just a coincidence that the first team to win a World Series in the inaugural year of Trump’s presidency, the Houston Astros, is now under investigation for systematic cheating?
On impeachment day, a heartless president was true to form. He accepted no responsibility, not even a smidgen, for the actions that will put him on the dark side of Mount Rushmore, the third president to be impeached in the history of the republic. He picked a fight with a widow, Rep. Debbie Dingell, suggesting that her husband of 38 years, the late John Dingell, a World War II Army lieutenant and the longest-serving member of Congress ever, was in hell.
But as I said, the season of darkness presents many opportunities for light-starved souls. Going into the Christmas season a few years ago I got a grim note from Brian Doyle, a gifted storyteller and writer, New York born, Oregonian by choice. He had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, he said. He died a few months later, in the spring of 2017 at the age of 60.
“We’re only here for a minute,” Doyle told another wonderful writer, David James Duncan, in “One Long River of Song: Notes on Wonder,” a new book of Doyle’s essays. “We’re here for a little window. And to use that time to catch and share shards of light and laughter and grace seems to me the great story.”
So we use those shards of light for the great story. At this moment, that means an unstable world, made more so by an unstable president, needed a firm statement of principle. We got it on Wednesday.
But in the meantime there is the Senate, where that contagion of Trumpism has spread to all but a handful of Republicans. If the president had truly done nothing wrong, Senate leaders would call witnesses and air the facts. Instead, they will attack the process and ignore the substance of the high crime at the center of Trump’s impeachment.
And many will follow Sen. Mitch McConnell, swearing an oath to “do impartial justice,” only to violate that oath before proceedings begin.
As usual, Oscar Wilde, my favorite Irish ghost, had it right: “The one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it.” The rewriting, and righting, of the Trump era gets closer now that the days are getting longer.

Texto completo: A reader finds the criticism of a lack of diversity among the seven on the debate stage ignores the real picture.
To the Editor:
Re "December Democratic Debate: A Smaller, Whiter Stage" (nytimes.com, Dec. 19):
Amid all the commentary about a lack of diversity on the debate stage, can we have a little perspective? Sure, it would have been better if Cory Booker and Julián Castro had been included, but still, out of seven candidates, two are women, one is openly gay and another is Asian-American.
Judging from the Republican congressional caucus, what would we have seen in a comparable G.O.P. debate? Seven straight white men in gray suits?

There isn't 'plenty of blame to go around' in this disastrous impeachment. It's all Democrats' fault

Texto completo: The psyche of the Democratic Party is reflected in every single New York Times editorial. So to understand how frustrated they are at the moment, read the one published on Wednesday.
Right after House Democrats voted to impeach President Trump, the paper asked, “So why does it all seem so banal? The outcome so foreordained?”
The New York Times continued, carefully blaming everyone, but as usual, reserving a special condemnation for Republicans for not damning the leader of their party to hell.
It isn’t supposed to be this way. There’s plenty of blame to go around for the intense — really, infantilizing — degree of polarization that has overwhelmed American politics across the past 40 years. But the nihilism of this moment — the trashing of constitutional safeguards, the scorn for facts, the embrace of corruption, the indifference to historical precedent and to foreign interference in American politics — is due principally to cowardice and opportunism on the part of Republican leaders who have chosen to reject their party’s past standards and positions and instead follow Donald Trump, all the way down.
Gee, that does make removing him from elected office a little more difficult, doesn’t it?
You can almost hear the editors shouting: "I want an Oompa Loompa now!"
Well, in the words of Violet Beauregarde, "Can it, you nit!"
The truth is that there isn’t “plenty of blame to go around.” Democrats, on the record, declared their intent to impeach Trump even before Inauguration Day. It was Democrats who egged Robert Mueller on in the never-ending quest to find a Russia-collusion conspiracy to match their paranoid theorizing. It was Democrats who dragged Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh through the mud in his confirmation hearing. And it’s the Democrats who insisted on driving impeachment at 85 miles per hour over a phone call Trump had with the head of Ukraine just a couple of months ago, without compelling evidence that he did anything wrong. This helps explain why support for impeachment among independent voters has fallen throughout the process.
The “plenty of blame to go around” rhetoric is only used by the national media when the culprit is clear but inconvenient.
Back in 2017, James Hodgkinson, 66, sprayed bullets on a baseball field outside of Washington, D.C., where congressional Republicans were practicing, nearly killing Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise. The New York Times editorial board chalked the incident up to "vicious American politics,” even though we knew that Hodgkinson was a Democrat and a fanatical supporter of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who had run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.
A bemused editorial in the Washington Post asked, "Who knows what mixture of madness and circumstance causes someone to pick up a gun and go on a rampage?" The paper then helped spread responsibility for the tragedy among everyone, saying that it should "cause a gut check about what passes for political discourse in this country." Except that would probably require every journalist to stop calling Trump a racist, so you know that isn't going to happen.
The willfully clueless Scott Pelley, then anchor of the CBS Evening News, ended one of his programs decrying unspecified "leaders and political commentators who set an example" for having "led us into an abyss of violent rhetoric."
Remember the kids of Covington Catholic High School, who the media framed as a bunch of white, privileged brats disrespecting an old American Indian man? New York Times columnist Frank Bruni could not keep up the initial media lie, but he nonetheless found equal fault in conservatives who had exposed it. “Some conservatives are gleeful about how this went down,” he wrote at the time. “But isn’t their vengeful joy its own rushed celebration, its own self-serving simplification of a complex sequence of events?”
Why, no, Frank, there’s nothing vengeful or joyous about defending children from a media that wants to embarrass them on a national scale. And no, there was no blame to spread around.
I know it’s frustrating for Democrats and the New York Times editorial board to see impeachment blow up in their faces. But it’s not everyone’s fault — it’s just theirs.

Texto completo: As a photographer and a playwright, she helped document the rise of a generation of theater artists who wanted to tell their own stories their own way.
Christine Chambers, a photographer whose pictures of actors of color helped document the rise of a newly energized black theater movement that emerged in New York a decade ago, died on Dec. 4 in Manhattan. She was 39.
Her sister, Essie Jane Chambers, said she died at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital from complications of a lung infection. She had also had lupus, a chronic disease of the immune system, since she was 12.
In addition to being a photographer, Ms. Chambers was a playwright. The daughter of a white mother and black father, she frequently explored themes of race and identity. She was proud of being a woman of color, her sister said, but it was being biracial that provided the grist for her writing.
With a longtime involvement in the theater, she understood the intimate dynamics of the live stage and photographed hundreds of actors, often during performances. In doing so, she captured the spirit of a new generation of theater artists who wanted to tell their own stories in their own ways.
"She made us proud of who we were and where we came from, and that's what we were trying to express onstage," the playwright Kelley Girod, a close friend, said in an interview.
"She helped us see ourselves in the act of claiming ourselves," said Ms. Girod, who is founder and executive producer of the Fire This Time Festival, which features the work of playwrights of color.
Ms. Chambers was commissioned to photograph theatrical productions at that festival and at other theatrical festivals and venues.
Over the last eight years, she documented more than 14 productions and other events at National Black Theater in Harlem, which exhibited her work. "She helped crystallize our brand," Jonathan McCrory, the theater's artistic director, said in an interview. "She gave visual amplification to innovative black storytelling."
This fall, Ms. Chambers undertook two projects for the Public Theater. She photographed the creative team, made up entirely of women of color, for its revival of Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf." And she captured the all-black, all-female cast of "Measure for Measure," produced by the Public Theater's Mobile Unit, which traveled with the play to the city's five boroughs.
Her work appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, among other publications, as well as in playbills.
Ms. Chambers began taking pictures as a child. By the time she was in graduate school at Columbia University, she was taking professional head shots of friends there and at Juilliard. She followed them through the black theaters and theater festivals that have become pipelines to television, film and Broadway for artists of color as their careers -- and hers -- took off.
Among those she photographed were the actresses Amber Gray ("Hadestown"), Samira Wiley ("Orange Is the New Black"), Teyonah Parris (Spike Lee's "Chi-Raq"), Amelia Workman ("Fefu and Her Friends") and April Matthis ("Toni Stone"), as well as the singer Martha Redbone and Jon Batiste, the bandleader on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."
"She had a particular way of working with her subjects, especially with us, people of color," her sister said. "It was nurturing and empowering. People trusted her and loved the way she made them look and feel."
In helping her subjects to center themselves, Ms. Chambers would tell them: "Close your eyes. Breathe in. Exhale. Look at me."
Mr. McCrory, of National Black Theater, said the hallmark of a Chambers photograph was her ability to elevate tangible elements -- the person's eyes, the release of tension in the face, the use of lighting to showcase physical attributes -- onto an intangible plane. "She invited her subjects to lean into their discomfort," he said, "and they would find it to be a loving space."
In addition to her portraits, Ms. Chambers liked to take pictures outdoors. One of her most notable street scenes was of the dancer Jayniece Carter doing an exuberant grand jeté leap across a Manhattan street amid the hustle and bustle of traffic.
Her photographs were all the more remarkable because in recent years her illness took so much out of her. "Her hands and joints were stiff from arthritis," her sister said. "Even just holding the camera was an effort."
Ms. Chambers freely discussed on social media what it was like to live with lupus. She developed a large online following and bonded with others with chronic diseases. As she wrote on Instagram in May, "Just because we (ppl w/autoimmune) have invisible illnesses does not mean we need to make ourselves invisible."
Christine Jean Chambers was born on Sept. 8, 1980, in Northampton, Mass. Her father, John Walker Chambers, taught sociology, first at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and then at Greenfield Community College, also in Massachusetts. He later became a social worker. Her mother, Molly (Pratt) Chambers, was a therapist and social worker.
In addition to her sister, Ms. Chambers is survived by her parents and her brother, John Chambers.
At Wilbraham and Monson Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts, she was a member of the Academy Repertory Company and Academy Players and appeared in productions of plays as varied as "Cabaret" and "The Trojan Women." She graduated in 1999.
She received her bachelor's degree in English from the University of Virginia in 2004 and studied for her master's of fine arts in playwriting at Columbia.
Over the last decade, she wrote several plays that explored what it meant to be biracial.
"So much of her identity was about living in this in-between world, where she wasn't black and wasn't white," Ms. Girod said. "That space in between was important to her; it's the space that defined who she was."
Her plays, staged at small theaters in New York, include "Half Brothers," about a man who becomes executor of his father's estate and meets his two half brothers for the first time, and "The Eternal Return," about a black couple examining their failed relationship.
In her play "One Quarter," a multiethnic woman, Sarah, considers what her relationship might have been like with a daughter she had lost when she had a miscarriage. With a half-black mother and a white father, that daughter would have been one-quarter black.
"What if no one sees her?" Sarah asks, worried that her daughter's blackness would be diminished. "What if she looks at me and can't see herself?"
She concludes, "What if my daughter comes into this world and I still feel alone in it?"

Texto completo: More and more Americans became aware this year of just how broken our criminal justice system has become.
There has been a widespread reassessment of the tough-on-crime attitude that caused our jail and prison populations to balloon. Nonviolent offenders were released early from federal custody. Voting rights were restored to former felons. There is a broad consensus that the war on drugs was a failure.
These are welcome developments, but there is still work to do.
The United States incarcerates more people than any other country in the world. And most of the men and women in prison are black and brown, which is a big part of the problem, and one that feels especially stinging as states across the country begin to embrace laws legalizing recreational drug use.
The friends and family of the men and women behind bars are also caught in the dragnet, although the challenges they face often go unnoticed.
Family visits can make prisoners less likely to reoffend. But visiting isn't always easy when many prisons and jails are in rural areas. Families can send money to help provide clothes, food and things like soap for their loved ones in prison. But they have to go through approved vendors with prices that aren't always affordable. Families don't commit the crimes. But they are often still on the hook for court fees, restitution and fines.
Last year, I wrote about my own experience with my older brother, one of the country's many incarcerated African-American men. I know that even the smallest act of kindness can mean so much to someone like him. And this feels especially true during the holidays when we are all reminded of how important it is to be surrounded by friends and family.
In collaboration with The Marshall Project, a nonprofit newsroom covering the United States criminal justice system, Race/Related, The New York Times's newsletter focused on race, identity and culture, spent a week looking at the issue of family and incarceration during the holidays.
My hope for the partnership was to show how America's vast criminal justice system affects the lives of the family and friends on the outside. National data on this is rarely gathered. So to better understand the issue, The Marshall Project asked people to share their experiences. Hundreds responded, and this week we shared their stories.
Race/Related subscribers received a daily special edition of the newsletter focused on the lengths families go in order to connect with a loved one behind bars during the holidays. There was the woman who sleeps at a campground near a prison to be nearer her incarcerated husband. There was a couple who found ways to bring holiday cheer into their lives despite being separated. There was the husband who shared his frustration around the downside of video visitations.
I was especially moved by the story of Telita Hayes. Her story, as captured by Nicole Lewis and Beatrix Lockwood, two reporters from The Marshall Project, revealed so much to me about how families cope with the hidden costs of incarceration. And I was also struck by the work done by Cecelia Whitfield, whose son was incarcerated in a remote prison in Indiana that wasn't accessible through public transportation.
Ms. Whitfield started giving rides to other families headed to the same prison, buying a van and later a bus so more people could ride along. Her son has been released, but the car pool Ms. Whitfield started decades ago is still going strong. It is now a statewide ride-share service.
America's broken criminal justice system is an urgent matter, and these families know more about that than anyone. If you would like to share your experience as a family member who has a loved one who is incarcerated, please reach out to us at racerelated@nytimes.com.

passed since President Donald Trump signed an executive order addressing anti-Semitism on college campuses, and people from across the political spectrum have weighed in.
Much of the initial conversation, particularly on social media, was focused on the pros and cons of defining Judaism as a nationality. But the executive order does not actually define Judaism that way.
Rather, the "Executive Order on Combating AntiSemitism," signed Dec. 11, says that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should prohibit anti-Semitic discrimination. Title VI requires that programs and activities receiving federal funding not discriminate based on race, ethnicity or shared national origin. The executive order says that Title VI should be enforced against discrimination rooted in anti-Semitism "as vigorously as against all other forms of discrimination."
Many Jewish organizations - including the Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, the American Jewish Committee, the Zionist Organization of America, B'nai B'rith International and StandWithUs - hailed the executive order, which was signed at the first White House Chanukah party.
"In a climate of rising anti-Semitism, this executive order provides valuable guidance on anti-Semitism, giving law enforcement and campus officials an important additional tool to help identify and fight this pernicious hate," ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.
"The executive order is modeled on language in the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, which has benefited from bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress," a statement from the Jewish Federations of North America said. "It bolsters tools that help prevent discrimination on college campuses, which have been hard hit by a near 90% increase in anti-Semitic incidents over the past three years. It is deplorable that Jewish students continue to experience hate and hostility."
The executive order reiterates 2010 guidelines from the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights that state, "While Title VI does not cover discrimination based solely on religion, groups that face discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics may not be denied protection under Title VI on the ground that they also share a common faith."
The executive order also notes that First Amendment rights shall not be infringed. But some pundits and Jewish organizations are concerned.
"This executive order, like the stalled congressional legislation it is based on, appears designed less to combat anti-Semitism than to have a chilling effect on free speech and to crack down on campus critics of Israel," said J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami. "We feel it is misguided and harmful for the White House to unilaterally declare a broad range of nonviolent campus criticism of Israel to be anti-Semitic, especially at a time when the prime driver of anti-Semitism in this country is the xenophobic, white nationalist far-right."
But both the ADL's Greenblatt and JFNA see it differently.
"It reaffirms protection of Jews under Title VI without infringing on First Amendment rights," Greenblatt said of the order.
"These new tools are not inconsistent with First Amendment protections," read the JFNA statement.
In a New York Times opinion piece, White House advisor Jared Kushner elaborated on the fact that the order charges executive departments and agencies to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism, as well as the contemporary examples of anti-Semitism identified by the alliance.
The latter includes, Kushner writes, "'the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,' and those who deny 'the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor' or those who compare 'contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.'"
On local campuses, students have divergent opinions about the executive order.
Noah Werksman, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying economics with a concentration in marketing and operations, said he thinks university administrators will be more cautious about allowing BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) activity and anti-Semitic rhetoric to spread.
"In the last 11 months before the next election, (Trump is) going to be making these kinds of moves that make him look more popular, and my perception of it is that this move was very popular," Werksman said. "The New York Times can say as much as they want about how people are worried about it - but for someone who is middle-of-the-line, who's informed, has friends on both sides, this was a major win for him."
Madeleine Fortney, a Drexel University senior studying communication who is president of the Drexel Hillel student board, opposes the order.
"Jared Kushner claims that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism, and I believe that those two things are entirely different," Fortney said. "I believe that Zionism allows for critiques of Israel and its politics, and caring about Israel in any form means struggling with Israel and its actions. I think that this is an attempt to suppress college students' freedom of speech rather than mitigate the rise of anti-Semitism."
Fortney thinks universities wary of losing government funding may change their behavior as a result of the order. "It's possible that administrators will want to punish student and faculty speakers in order to avoid federal investigation."
Werksman doesn't think the order will have much of an impact on students.
"I think the only reason why it won't affect students is because a lot of people don't read the news or don't care," Werksman said.
Bend the Arc: Jewish Action and the Jewish Democratic Council of America, among other groups, released statements opposing the executive order.
"This is truly the arsonist attempting to serve as the firefighter, and we'd prefer Trump stop inciting the flames of hatred against Jews," JDCA Executive Director Halié Soifer said. "It's not up to Donald Trump to define, stereotype or use Jews for his own political advantage, and we reject his attempts to do so." *

CAN 2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE THE FOCUS OFF EACH OTHER AND TURN IT TO TRUMP? Thursday’s Democratic debate in Los Angeles will test the 2020 candidates’ ability to put the focus back onto President Trump’s attacks on Obamacare and off the internal disputes they’ve been having thus far about “Medicare for all” and the public option.
Yesterday’s 5th Circuit Obamacare ruling complicates the Democratic case that Trump poses an immediate threat to voters' healthcare: The court ruled Obamacare’s individual mandate was unconstitutional, yet sent the case back to the lower courts for further analysis.
In some sense, the 5th Circuit’s ruling will make 2020 Democrats’ task to unite behind defending Obamacare difficult. Had the judges ruled the law was unconstitutional and should be thrown out, then the threat to the law would be far more immediate because it would land at the Supreme Court just ahead of the election.
With the decision they issued, however, the whole question will just take longer to resolve, and probably won’t happen until 2021 at the earliest. This buys the Trump administration some time to avoid having to say what would come after Obamacare, particularly since Trump hasn’t released a backup plan for the law nor have Republicans in Congress united behind a replacement idea.
There’s one way we could see a decision sooner: Democratic states said they are going to appeal the 5th Circuit’s decision directly to the Supreme Court. It would be unexpected, but not impossible, for the high court to take the case before the district judge hammers out the details of his ruling.
Yet both sides face a difficult messaging hurdle on healthcare ahead of 2020: Both Trump and 2020 Democrats want to make massive changes to the status quo.
Democrats will play up that if Obamacare were to be struck down, then it would have reverberating effects across the healthcare system, most prominently by removing insurance rules that shield an estimated 133 million people with pre-existing conditions.
On the other hand, Republicans will focus on how the alternatives certain Democrats are offering, particularly “Medicare for all,” would take 180 milion off private insurance. Even “Medicare for all who want it,” as proposed by Pete Buttigieg, would bring about massive changes.
In the face of the Obamacare lawsuit, Republicans in Congress have been thrilled to run against “Medicare for all” and take the focus off the lawsuit.
“Instead of partisan impeachment theatrics or Medicare for All which cancels good healthcare plans for 180 million Americans, Congress should use this opportunity to work together to bring down the high costs of healthcare, something that Obamacare promised, but never delivered on,” GOP House leaders said.

‘NOT A HEALTHY GUY’: OBAMA FORMER DOCTOR WEIGHS IN ON BIDEN’S HEALTH: The former longtime doctor for Barack Obama said the medical records Joe Biden’s campaign disclosed this week were both concerning and incomplete. “He’s not a healthy guy,” Dr. David Scheiner, 81, concluded after reading the records. “He’s not in bad shape for his age but I wouldn't say he’s in outstanding health. Could I guarantee he won’t have issues for the next four years? He has a lot of issues that are just sort of sitting there.”
Scheiner thinks all presidential candidates should be evaluated by independent medical panels and disclose far more of their medical history than they do now. The details from the letter Biden provided made Scheiner concerned about Biden’s potential for strokes, and he said he would want to see results from an MRI or CT scan, as well as a sleep study, because Biden used to have sleep apnea before getting surgery on his sinus and nasal passages. Here’s what he had to say about Trump and the other Democratic candidates.
ACLU FIGHTS TENNESSEE’S NEW ABORTION RESTRICTIONS: The ACLU of Tennessee brought suit against the town of Mt. Juliet in federal court over a new zoning ordinance that outlaws establishing centers for surgical abortions. When the city found out that carafem, a network of women’s healthcare providers, was planning to expand the network in Mt. Julient to provide surgical abortions in addition to their usual medication abortion services, municipal officials passed a new zoning ordinance pushing new centers out of city limits, thus obstructing people’s rights to access abortions. Thomas Castelli, legal director of the ACLU of Tennessee said: “No matter how someone feels about abortion, it is not their place to judge someone else’s decision to end their pregnancy. When a person has made that decision, they should be able to get the care they need without facing unnecessary obstacles.”
DELAURO WANTS ZANTAC PULLED OFF SHELVES: Democrat Rosa DeLauro told the Food and Drug Administration to pull the antacid drug Zantac after a pharmacy in her district detected a possible carcinogen in the medication. The Connecticut lawmaker said it was “incomprehensible” that the FDA hasn’t banned the drug while “Bangladesh, Canada, Egypt, and South Korea have banned all sales.”
MARIJUANA FUROR SPARKED BY COLLEGE STUDENT’S MURDER: Advocates for marijuana policy reform say a police union leader’s allegation that a Barnard College freshman Tessa Majors was buying marijuana when she was murdered in Morningside Park illustrates the case for legalizing weed. After Majors was fatally stabbed in the upper Manhattan park, Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins said on a radio show that she was "in the park to buy marijuana" when she was killed, but the NYPD said that was not the case. Legalization advocates are using Mullins’ point, regardless of its accuracy, to demonstrate that legalizing marijuana would help reduce crime. “Even if it was the case, how is that relevant?” said Maj. Mike Hilliard, a retired Baltimore police officer and member of the criminal justice reform-focused Law Enforcement Action Group. “If she was there to buy marijuana, if we had a situation that [marijuana] was legalized, regulated and controlled, she wouldn’t be put in that situation.”
FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE-TURNED ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ BOOSTER SAYS YANG’S PLAN ISN’T ENOUGH: Former health insurance executive and “Medicare for all” advocate Wendell Potter criticized presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s healthcare plan, which he released Monday, as being “far too limited,” as reported by The Hill. “You’ve got to have someone in the White House who is really bold and will recognize what we need to do and lead the nation — not just follow the polls and say, ‘He’s what I think we might be able to pull off,” Potter said.
Yang’s plan includes lowering drug prices to match those set in foreign countries, allowing the government to negotiate prices with manufacturers, improving telehealth services, and limiting the influence of health industry lobbyists on the hill. Potter, however, said Yang’s plan to enact comprehensive reforms to the healthcare system comes up short: “The structure of the system is what needs to be changed … It’s not just tinkering around the edges, which is exactly what Yang’s plan seems to do.”

David Leonhardt: GDP is broken, but we can fix it

Texto completo: The Commerce Department will announce the latest GDP numbers Friday, and they will probably be solid. The economy seems to be growing at an annual rate of about 2%, which is not bad for the 11th year of an expansion.
After the numbers come out, something else will probably happen: Pundits will once again express bafflement about the apparent disconnect between the healthy U.S. economy and the sour national mood.
But there is really no disconnect. The fault — with apologies to Shakespeare — is in our stats, not ourselves.
Americans are dissatisfied, and have been for years, largely because the economy as most people experience it has not been booming. GDP — or gross domestic product, the economy’s total output — keeps on rising, but it no longer tracks the well-being of most Americans. Instead, an outsize share of economic growth flows to the wealthy. And yet GDP is treated as a totemic measure of the country’s prosperity.
Consider the true picture: Middle-class income growth has been sluggish for decades. The typical household is still poorer than it was before the financial crisis began in 2007. Most alarming, average life expectancy has recently been declining. No wonder polls show that a majority of Americans has been dissatisfied with the country’s direction for 15 years in a row, a period that encompasses the entirety of the current GDP expansion, the longest on record.
So it’s time to stop wondering why Americans are unhappy — and instead create a version of GDP that reflects reality. Which may finally be on the verge of happening.
A team of Commerce Department economists has been working on a new version of GDP, one that will show how much of the economy’s bounty is flowing to different income groups. The headline number would still exist, but the new data, known as “distributional accounts,” would make clear who was and wasn’t benefiting. The department expects to publish a prototype statistic next year.
Several members of Congress, meanwhile, have introduced a bill that would require the department to release this distributional data alongside the normal GDP numbers every quarter. That’s important, because it would change the national discussion that occurs whenever GDP is released.
“The government is still using a black-and-white television,” Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, told me. “We gotta catch up, so we get a more accurate picture.”
Schumer plans to reintroduce the bill in the coming days, and he said he was hoping that a Republican would co-sponsor it. The expanded version of GDP would include estimates for every decile of the income distribution — 10th percentile, 20th and so on — as well as for the top 1%.
If it happens, Heather Boushey, the author of a recent history of the U.S. economy, “Unbound,” says it could be the most significant improvement in economic statistics in decades.
It would also be part of a broader shift. The Federal Reserve created its own distributional accounts recently, to offer more detailed data on wealth. And Australia and the Netherlands have both begun releasing distributional GDP numbers.
The economist who oversaw the first version of GDP in the United States — Simon Kuznets, a future Nobel Prize winner — probably would have been in favor of these developments. Kuznets cautioned that people should not confuse the economy’s total output with economic well-being. “Economic welfare,” he wrote in 1934, “cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known.”
The failure of GDP to include distribution didn’t matter much in the decades after World War II, because economic growth was remarkably inclusive. If anything, the middle class and poor received raises that outpaced economic growth.
In the mid-1970s, and especially the 1980s, however, the situation changed. The income flowing to everyone but the affluent began to trail economic growth — by a lot.
Why? Labor unions shrank, giving workers less bargaining power. Business executives and investors decided to maximize corporate profits, regardless of the societal effects. The government became more passive about regulating big business. Government also scrimped on investments that create good-paying jobs, like education. And taxes fell much more for the rich than they did for everyone else.
Some academic economists and government agencies publish statistics that describe these trends, of course. But they don’t have the same authority — and don’t always have the same rigor — as GDP. That’s why fixing our broken GDP numbers would be a step toward creating an economy that works for most Americans.

Texto completo: A letter from three former Fox News employees is designed to pressure presidential campaigns to do away with NDAs, calling them "a driving force in silencing workers."
A new group founded by three former Fox News employees sent a letter to all presidential campaigns on Wednesday asking them to publicly condemn nondisclosure agreements that deal with workplace environment issues.
The group, called Lift Our Voices, was formed by Gretchen Carlson, Julie Roginsky and Diana Falzone. All three women a few years ago sued Fox News Channel or its chief executive at the time, Roger Ailes, and as part of their settlements were forced to sign nondisclosure agreements.
"These NDAs are a driving force in silencing workers and promulgating a culture where employers are able to cover up toxicity, including issues of sexual harassment and gender discrimination, rather than address it and end it," the letter says. "It is time for our leaders to demonstrate that they are on the side of the women and men who have been silenced for too long from discussing the hostility they have encountered by speaking out loudly and publicly against NDAs."
While the letter is asking for a public condemnation on the policy from the next or current president, it is in effect pressuring current campaigns that may be employing the practice to end it as well. It is unclear how many current presidential campaigns have forced employees to sign nondisclosure agreements as part of their employment, but the tactic has been used by campaigns in the past, including for some members of both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump's presidential campaigns in 2016.
The group is not necessarily calling for an end to all nondisclosure agreements, understanding the need on a political campaign to protect trade secrets like self-research and internal polling. Instead, it is focused on nondisclosure agreements solely dealing with workplace environment issues, like sexual harassment.
"This is incredibly important for a presidential candidate to get on board with," said Ms. Carlson in an interview, adding that her goal with the letter was to force discussion of the issue in the election, particularly in presidential debates. "Whether it's the president of the United States, or a person running a company, the buck stops with that person. And they can shift the discussion."
The letter comes as nondisclosure agreements and discussions of sexual harassment in the workplace have become points of contention in the Democratic primary campaign.
In late November, lawsuits discovered by Business Insider found that multiple women had stated in legal filings that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who announced his presidential run last month, fostered a toxic, frat-like culture at his company during the 1990s (Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly denied these allegations).
ABC News on Sunday published its own report on the lawsuits, which found that five were settled out of court, and likely included nondisclosure agreements.
A day later, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was asked whether she thought the women who had made the initial complaints should be released from NDAs. She responded, "Yes, I do."
"I think NDAs are a way for people to hide bad things they've done," she said. "And I think that women should be able to speak."
Lift Our Voices highlighted Ms. Warren's response in their letter as support for their cause.
"We hope that she speaks up about this and responds to our letter in a more holistic way," Ms. Roginsky said in an interview. "We hope that every other candidate, Democrat, Republican or independent, joins her. This is not a partisan issue, and this should not be a partisan issue. This is not a women's issue, and it should not just be female candidates who talk about it."
Last week, Alyssa Milano, the actress and activist, withdrew from a fund-raiser for the campaign of Andrew Yang, saying it was "due to repeated allegations of sexual misconduct against a campaign staffer by a campaign staffer which were not appropriately addressed."
The Yang campaign later said that it had fired a staffer before Ms. Milano had sent her tweet, though they denied the misconduct was sexual.
Reports of sexual harassment from the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont emerged earlier this year before Mr. Sanders announced his 2020 campaign. In interviews with The New York Times, staffers from the 2016 campaign discussed episodes of sexual harassment and demeaning treatment as well as pay disparity.
Mr. Sanders apologized earlier this year and ensured that three top advisers from the 2016 campaign either will not return for the 2020 effort, or would serve in different roles.
A nondisclosure incident also ensnared another candidate, though it was not the type that Lift Our Voices is focused on. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., worked for McKinsey & Co., a consulting firm, after he graduated from Harvard. When other candidates began to demand that he release his client list, Mr. Buttigieg said he was bound by a nondisclosure agreement from doing so.
Eventually, after publicly calling on McKinsey to release him from the NDA, the company complied, and Mr. Buttigieg released his clients.

Multiply 1,048,589 by 1,048,601, and you’ll get 1,099,551,473,989. Does this blow your mind? It should, maybe! That 13-digit prime number is the largest-ever prime number to be factored by a quantum computer, one of a series of quantum computing-related breakthroughs (or at least claimed breakthroughs) achieved over the last few months of the decade.
An IBM computer factored this very large prime number about two months after Google announced that it had achieved “quantum supremacy”—a clunky term for the claim, disputed by its rivals including IBM as well as others, that Google has a quantum machine that performed some math normal computers simply cannot.
SEE ALSO: 5G Coverage May Set Back Accurate Weather Forecasts By 30 Years
An arcane field still existing mostly in the theoretical, quantum computers have done enough recently and are commanding enough very real public and private resources to be deserving of your attention—not the least of which is because if and when the Chinese government becomes master of all your personal data, sometime in the next decade, it will be because a quantum computer cracked the encryption.
Building the quantum computer, it is said, breathlessly, is a race to be won, as important as being the first in space (though, ask the Soviet Union how that worked out) or fielding the first workable atomic weapon (seems to be going OK for the U.S.).
And so here is a post—written in terms as clear and simple as this human could muster—summing up these recent advances and repeating other experts’ predictions that the 2020s appear to be the decade when quantum computers begin to contribute to your life, by both making slight improvements to your map app, and powering artificial intelligence robust and savvy enough to be a real-life Skynet.
First, the requisite introduction to the concept. Normal computers, such as the device you are using to access and display this content, process information in a binary. Everything is either a one, or a zero, or a series of ones and zeroes. On, or off. But what if the zero was simultaneously also a one? (Please exit here for your requisite digression into quantum physics and mechanics.)
The idea that a value can be a zero, or a one, or “both” at the same time is the quantum principle of “superposition.” Each superposition is a quantum bit, or qubit. The ability to process qubits is what allows a quantum computer to perform functions a binary computer simply cannot, like computations involving 500-digit numbers. To do so quickly and on demand might allow for highly efficient traffic flow. It could also render current encryption keys mere speedbumps for a computer able to replicate them in an instant.
Why hasn’t this been mastered already, what’s holding quantum computers back? Particles like photons only exist in quantum states if they are either compressed very, very small or made very, very cold—with analog engineering techniques. What quantum computers do exist are thus resource-intensive. Google’s, for example, involves metals “cooled” (the verb is inadequate) to 460 degrees below zero, to a state in which particles behave in an erratic and “random” fashion akin to a quantum state.
And as Subhash Kak, the regents professor of electrical and computer engineering at Oklahoma State University and an expert in the field, recently wrote, the “power” of a quantum computer can be gauged by how many quantum “bits,” or qubits, it can process. The machines built by Google, Microsoft, Intel, IBM and possibly the Chinese all “have less than 100 qubits,” he wrote. (In Google’s case, the company claims to have created a “quantum state” of 53 qubits.)
“To achieve useful computational performance,” according to Kak, “you probably need machines with hundreds of thousands of qubits.” And what qubits a quantum computer can offer are notoriously unstable and prone to error. They need many of the hard-won fixes and advancements that saw binary computers morph from room-sized monstrosities spitting out punch cards to iPhones.
How fast will that happen—can it happen?
Skeptics, doubters, and haters might note that Google first pledged to achieve quantum supremacy (defined as the point in time at which quantum computers are outperforming binary computers) by the end of 2017—meaning its achievement was almost two full years behind schedule, and meaning other quantum claims, like Dario Gil of IBM’s pledge that quantum computers will be useful “for commercial and scientific advantage” sometime next year, may also be dismissed or at least subject to deserved skepticism.
And those of us who can think only in binary may also find confusion in the dispute between quantum rivals. The calculation performed by Google’s Sycamore quantum computer in 200 seconds, the company claimed, would take a normal binary supercomputer 10,000 years to solve. Not so, according to IBM, which asserted that the calculation could be done by a binary computer in two and a half days. Either way, as The New York Times wrote, “quantum supremacy” is still a very arcane experiment “that can’t necessarily be applied to other things.” Google’s breakthrough might be the last achievement for a while.
But everybody is trying—including the U.S. government, which is using your money to do it. Commercial spending on quantum computing research is estimated to reach hundreds of millions of dollars sometime in the next decade. A year ago, spooked and shamed by what appeared to be an unanswered flurry of quantum progress in China, Congress dedicated $1.2 billion to the “National Quantum Initiative Act,” money specifically intended to boost American-based quantum computing projects. According to Bloomberg, China may have already spent 10 times that.
If you walk away with nothing else, know that quantum computer spending is very real, even if the potential is theoretical.

We can’t let undercount happen again

Texto completo: O ne and a half billion dollars is an awful lot of money to lose.
That’s been the astounding loss to Palm Beach County over the past decade because so many people living here went uncounted in the last U.S. census.
Some 94,000 people — 7.2 percent of the county’s actual population — failed to make it onto census-takers’ rolls in 2010, according to no less an authority than the U.S. Census Bureau itself.
The omissions included immigrants, here legally and not, whose struggles with English or aversion to authorities might have kept them away. And there were others who were hard to reach or hesitant to respond: transients, elderly folks, renters, snowbirds, college students living on campuses.
Bottom line: Palm Beach County had the 16th-worst undercount of any county in the nation. Over the course of the 2010s, that failure has meant that $1.5 billion in federal money which should have come here — money that belongs to us — went to other parts of the nation instead.
Sadly, we had company; Florida as a whole had the third-worst census participation of all the states in 2010. Our state lost out on about $20 billion in federal funding because the census omitted an estimated 1.4 million residents — about 7.5 percent of the actual population.
And yet, just as sad, the state of Florida is mounting no official effort to ensure residents’ participation in the 2020 census. Florida is among 24 states that have nothing on U.S. census-related efforts and one of only five states that have failed to form a committee to raise awareness about the count, according to The New York Times.
What’s more, efforts to establish statewide census committees have thus far died in the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature, with no public input from the governor.
This is money we should have for among other vital needs, infrastructure, Medicaid, school lunches, child care, Head Start to help poor children get ready for elementary school, Pell Grants to help students afford college and agricultural loans.
These are federal dollars we gave up because residents were undercounted. Federal dollars make up one-third of Florida’s total governmental revenue.
The undercount likely even have siphoned the state’s political strength, since membership in the U.S. House of Representatives is apportioned by the census count, in which the Census Bureau, in accord with the U.S. Constitution, attempts to count the nation’s entire population as it stands on a single day — every 10 years.
The next day is coming up fast: April 1, 2020.
And this time, in the state’s absence, a group of philanthropies is banding together to make sure that the count in Florida is as full and accurate as possible.
Why? Because when federal money for social services goes away, that doesn’t mean that problems like hunger, illness and mental distress disappear. It means that help, if it comes, must come from someplace else. In many cases, private charities must strain to carry the load.
Organizations like the Community Foundation for Palm Beach and Martin Counties have figured out that, rather than spending the next 10 years coping in an underfunded environment for social services, it’s better to make sure every resident is counted in the census so that the state, and counties and municipalities get all the federal money due them.
The seven philanthropies that have banded together under the name Florida Counts Census 2020 aim to raise $2 million to secure a complete count in this state. Their plan is to leverage the trusted connections they have in underserved communities — neighborhood pastors, Head Start teachers, after-school program leaders — to encourage people to drop their apprehensions and take part in the census.
Their efforts are laudable. But these community groups shouldn’t have to shoulder all of this responsibility. Ideally, they would supplement our state government’s efforts to make sure that all Florida residents participate in the census.
It’s still not too late for DeSantis stop foot-dragging and form a statewide committee to raise awareness about the count. We strongly encourage him to do so as soon as possible.
Florida is one of the fastest-growing states in the union. If we continue to fall short in the census count, while at the same time adding new residents, the federal funding gap will just get larger.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi touted her approval numbers ahead of a House vote on impeachment.
"My numbers are better than Trump’s," the California Democrat told the New York Times on Friday. "So if I’m not doing well, he’s doing worse."
President Trump has a higher approval rating than Pelosi, according to RealClearPolitics. The speaker of the House has a 38% approval rating and a 49% disapproval rating, while Trump has a 44.5% approval rating and a 52% disapproval rating.
The House is set to impeach the president on Wednesday and send their two articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Pelosi was wearing black for the vote, telling people she wanted the day to be "somber." She also gave a speech in front of the House floor, where she recited the Pledge of Allegiance in front of a poster of the American flag.

Texto completo: If the Hallmark Channel's executives were starring in one of their own Christmas movies, the uproar over their decision to pull ads featuring lesbian couples kissing would have ended with them learning a lesson - taught by a small child or by a jovial old man with a striking resemblance to Santa Claus - and realizing, just in time for the town's holiday pageant, that love is love and in the Year of our Lord 2019, there's no place for the homophobic sniveling of a group like One Million Moms.
They would apologize for their narrow-mindedness and invite the newlyweds to pull the lever to light the Christmas tree while the townspeople - residents of a quaint village called Sugar Cookie or Noble Fir - watched and cheered, overcome with joy. The women would stand in a gazebo and kiss, and snow would fall and bells would ring, and the jovial old man (Was it really Santa? Could it be?) would turn toward the camera and wink.
Life, of course, is not a Hallmark movie. But Santa or not, the network's execs may have learned their lesson after all - just in time for the holidays. But maybe not.
Hallmark is about as likely to stop facing homophobic pressure campaigns as I am to leave behind my big-city (OK, medium-sized city) newspaper job to resuscitate a failing gift shop/antique store/holiday-themed resort because I fell in love with a man named Leo or Liam or perhaps even Nikolaus (Could he be Santa? Could he be?) who's raising his daughter on his own after his wife's tragic death.
The question, then, is what does Hallmark do when it faces the next homophobic pressure campaign? Their first move for the most recent one was beyond disappointing.
Anyone reading a column about Hallmark Christmas movies quite likely already knows what I'm referring to, but here's a quick recap: The wedding planning website Zola had placed a series of six ads on the Hallmark Channel (which is currently in the thick of its "Countdown to Christmas" programming), each featuring couples standing at the altar. In some of the ads, the couples kiss. Some of the ads feature same-sex couples; some feature heterosexual couples.
The group One Million Moms - a division of the American Family Association dedicated to fighting the "immorality, violence, vulgarity and profanity the entertainment media is throwing at your children" - launched a campaign protesting the network's move of "forcing tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality" by putting children "face-to-face with the LGBT agenda."
It worked.
Hallmark rejected the ads - but only the ones featuring a lesbian couple. A network spokesman initially told the New York Times the ads violated Hallmark's standards with its "public displays of affection" - not addressing the fact that the heterosexual couples' kisses didn't violate any network policies, or that nearly every Hallmark Christmas movie ends with a heterosexual couple engaged in the public display of affection known as kissing. Zola responded by ending its advertising relationship with the network, affirming that "all kisses, couples and marriages are equal celebrations of love."
I'm not here to say that Hallmark should be forced to air any advertising or programming that it finds objectionable or that runs counter to the brand's values. Just as Zola was free to cease advertising with the network, Hallmark was free to reject Zola's ads.
That's capitalism, folks.
What I am here to say is that the Hallmark Channel should have a good, long think about what its values are, and make them clear to those of us who have been loyal consumers for years. That way, we can make an informed choice about whether that loyalty will continue, or whether we will take our viewership elsewhere.
Both Netflix and Freeform have made their values clear.
"This is what happens when you focus all your energy on exclusion instead of clever plotlines. Call us, @Zola. We celebrate the holidays with everyone," the Freeform account tweeted Saturday
And those companies have done so as they've expanded their holiday programming to tap into the "silly Christmas rom-com" market Hallmark once cornered.
That's capitalism, folks.
I fell hard into the Hallmark Christmas universe when I needed an escape from the darkness and cynicism I saw too often in my job as a political reporter. It was a happy place, where love and kindness prevailed.
It was encouraging to see that the network had, in recent years, made efforts to feature more black characters and couples in its movies - even if those efforts haven't yet gone far enough. The effort suggested that the network saw value in telling stories that prioritized love and kindness for everyone.
And it's encouraging, now, that after facing backlash for rejecting the Zola ads, the Hallmark Channel has reversed course and apologized. Hallmark Cards president and CEO Mike Perry said in a statement Sunday night that the company made the "wrong decision," apologizing for the "hurt it has unintentionally caused."
The network plans to re-establish its relationship with Zola, and will work with the LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD to "better represent the LGBTQ community" in its products.
That's the kind of network I want to support - not the kind that bows to homophobia and delivers pusillanimous explanations for its actions.
Sunday's decision was a good first step - but I'll be watching closely for the follow-through. The hard truth is that Hallmark has spent the last few years talking a good game about its commitment to telling diverse stories, but the bulk of its catalog is still overwhelmingly straight and white. In the meantime, other networks and platforms are running laps around Hallmark in that regard.
If Hallmark can rise to the occasion, I'll be there with them. If not, I hear Netflix has some titles featuring "Lesbians Joyfully Existing And Also It's Christmas Can We Just Let People Love Who They Love."
Or maybe I'll just go find a struggling tree farm to save and marry Nikolaus, its handsome owner who is probably definitely not Santa Claus.

Texto completo: OLIVESBURG, OHIO – For Sam Donohue, philanthropy started early.
The son of Crestview graduates Sean and Molly Donohue, the 5-year-old came up with the idea to have a drive for socks for needy children.
His idea blew up more than his parents could have imagined. The drive led to the donation of 619 pairs of socks, 80 hats and 121 pairs of gloves. People also contributed three earmuffs, three headbands, a pair of shoes, a fleece jacket and a scarf.
"It kind of spread, which was really awesome," Molly Donohue said. "It got exciting for us as parents."
The idea came from the children's book "What Do You Do with an Idea," a New York Times bestseller.
"You change the world," Donohue said. "It's kind of a lot for a 5-year-old. We tried to make it make more sense to him.
"We could help other people. Socks and warm things are not something everybody has. It started very small."
It grew very big.
Donohue's mother, Joyce Brennan, shared the idea with her garden club.
"They did a huge collection," Donohue said.
A neighbor – the Donohues live in Akron – donated 200 pairs of socks. Sean Donohue mentioned the drive at his workplace.
Because of the huge haul, the Donohues divided the donations between Crestview and Akron City Schools, where Sam is in preschool.
"It was all going to be for Crestview," Molly Donohue said. "I wanted to give back. Our roots go back to Crestview."
Molly graduated in 1999, while her husband graduated in 1998.
She and Sam took the items to Crestview Elementary School early last week, coordinating with school counselor Taylor White.
"We have a lot of students that come in without gloves or hats," she said.
White gave socks to a boy whose family had recently moved. She said she was impressed with Sam's initiative.
"It was very unexpected that a 5-year-old had the idea," White said. "It was very much appreciated."
Donohue also has a niece who is in the first grade at Crestview.
One of the family's neighbors bought the book "What Do You Do with an Idea?" for Sam and asked him to pick another child he thought would have good ideas to change the world.
"Pretty cool," Donohue said.
According to amazon.com, "What Do You Do With an Idea?" is for anyone who's ever had a big idea.
It's the story of one brilliant idea and the child who helps to bring it into the world. As the child's confidence grows, so does the idea itself. And then, one day, something amazing happens.
Amazon.com says it is a story for anyone, at any age, who's ever had an idea that seemed a little too big, too odd, too difficult. It's a story to inspire you to welcome that idea, to give it some space to grow and to see what happens next. Because your idea isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's just getting started.
Donohue said she and her husband try to give back, noting the Ronald McDonald House is one of their favorite charities.
She is challenging News Journal readers to keep the idea going on their own. She wants the same for Sam.
"I'm hoping that this continues his whole life," Donohue said.

Tulsi Gabbard may urge censure of president

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is expected to call for President Donald Trump to be censured over the Ukraine scandal as the full House of Representatives readies today to vote on two articles of impeachment.
The lesser punishment is a longshot.
The House needs a simple majority to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. As of Tuesday, the House had surpassed the necessary 216 votes, according to a New York Times tally.
If the censure resolution fails, which is expected, it’s not clear how Gabbard will vote on impeachment. Her congressional office did not respond to media inquiries on Monday or Tuesday.
Gabbard’s plan to introduce a resolution censuring the president was reported Tuesday by ABC News. Gabbard’s office did not respond to a request for a copy of the resolution, but it’s expected to suggest the president put personal gain over national interest.
Gabbard, who is running for president, has courted independent and Republican voters and her move to censure the president could help her among moderate, swing-state voters.
Gabbard is not the only Democrat in the House who has supported censure. Some vulnerable Democrats who represent districts that Trump won in 2016 have also floating the idea, Politico reported last week.
Gabbard was reluctant to push for impeachment proceedings.
In September, she said that a partial transcript of Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president didn’t show a compelling case for impeachment and that such an inquiry would be too divisive for the country. However, Gabbard quickly changed her stance after reviewing a whistleblower complaint and Inspector General memo, saying that not supporting an impeachment inquiry would set a “very dangerous precedent.”
In recent days she indicated she was undecided on whether she would vote to impeach Trump.
State Sen. Kai Kahele (D-Hilo), who is running for Gabbard’s House seat, criticized the censure resolution as a “political stunt” and said Gabbard hasn’t checked in with constituents about their views on the matter.
“The bottom line is that she has been absent ever since she announced she wasn’t going to seek reelection. She just hasn’t shown up for work,” said Kahele, who said he supports impeachment.
“She hasn’t been here in the second congressional district to hear from her constituents about how they feel about impeachment. She has been absent from Washington D.C. and Congress during this entire process and the second congressional district continues to miss vital votes leaving the second congressional district voiceless,” he said.
Gabbard has missed 89% of votes in the House since October, according to GovTrack.us.
Gabbard announced in October that she would not seek reelection to her House seat next year and instead would focus on her presidential bid. Her term runs through the end of 2020.

Expelled diplomats claim they were paying visit to lighthouse Chinese officials drove onto Fort Story in Virginia Beach

Texto completo: Chinese diplomats who were expelled from the United States after coming onto a military base this fall claimed they were going to see the popular Cape Henry Lighthouse, which is open to the public on Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, according to a federal official briefed on the matter.
The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to publicly speak about the incident.
The Cape Henry Lighthouse rests at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and was the first federally funded public works project in the United States. It was built near the historic "First Landing" site where English settlers set foot in America.
The Defense Department lets visitors without military identification onto Fort Story to visit the lighthouse from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but they have to take a shuttle bus. Before 2018, visitors were permitted to drive onto the base as long as they had a valid ID, vehicle registration and proof of insurance. Virginia Beach's official tourism website has not been updated to reflect that visitors without military identification must take the shuttle.
The New York Times reported Sunday that the diplomats and their wives drove onto an unspecified military base near Norfolk, claimed they didn't understand base security's directions for them to turn around and exit, and were chased by security forces before they were stopped by fire trucks blocking their path.
The newspaper cited anonymous officials who said one of the diplomats was suspected of being a Chinese intelligence official and that the base they drove onto was a sensitive military installation home to special operations forces.
The Times on Monday, again citing anonymous sources, reported the diplomats drove onto the Dam Neck Annex of Naval Air Station Oceana, but the federal official who spoke with The Virginian-Pilot said that was incorrect. Dam Neck Annex is several miles south of Fort Story on the oceanfront in Virginia Beach and hosts several commands, including the headquarters for Naval Special Warfare Development Group, which is more commonly known as SEAL Team Six.
Fort Story is separated by a state park, private homes, an inlet and several miles of land from the other part of the joint base, Little Creek. Little Creek is home to amphibious warships, explosive ordnance disposal technicians and Navy SEALs. But SEALs and other special warfare forces also train on Fort Story.
The Navy, which oversees security at the joint base, referred all questions to the State Department. The State Department has declined to comment.
In Beijing, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry called on the United States to reverse course on the expulsion in a news conference, according to multiple media outlets.
"The relevant U.S. allegations are totally false," Geng Shuang said. "We urge the U.S. to correct its wrongdoing, cancel its decision and protect the Chinese diplomats' interests and rights under the Vienna Convention diplomatic relations."
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the United States needs to do more to safeguard against espionage, especially from China.
"While these individuals were not successful in stepping foot on the base, this incident serves to underscore that the Chinese Communist Party will continue to deploy aggressive tactics to steal U.S. military secrets," Warner said in a statement to the Pilot. "Particularly as President Xi continues to flex China's military and economic power, the U.S. needs to take increased measures to address any potential security vulnerabilities at our military installations - many of which are located in this region."
Unauthorized access to military installations is a major security threat that has had deadly consequences in the past.
In 2014, an unauthorized civilian truck driver was able to come onto Naval Station Norfolk, park his vehicle near a pier and walk onto the destroyer USS Mahan. There, he disarmed a sailor standing watch and shot and killed a master-at-arms responding to the incident during a gun battle in which the civilian also died. A Navy investigation found that the gate guard thought the civilian was going to turn around and exit after driving through it.
Last month at Fort Story, a civilian drove through the exit lane onto the base and collided with a vehicle driven by a master-at-arms who chased after him. The sailor died. The Navy has said that incident was not connected to terrorism.

Conservative group launches anti-Trump PAC

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A group of conservative critics of President Donald Trump – including the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, George Conway – have launched a political action committee aimed at stopping his reelection.
The group includes conservative attorney Conway; former adviser to Sen. John McCain Steve Schmidt; former Ohio Gov. John Kasich adviser John Weaver; former New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn; and conservative pundit Rick Wilson.
"Patriotism and the survival of our nation in the face of the crimes, corruption and corrosive nature of Donald Trump are a higher calling than mere politics," Conway, Schmidt, Weaver and Wilson wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times that ran Tuesday. "As Americans, we must stem the damage he and his followers are doing to the rule of law, the Constitution and the American character."
In the op-ed, they announced the founding of the Lincoln Project, a super PAC that "will be dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box and to elect those patriots who will hold the line.
"We do not undertake this task lightly, nor from ideological preference. We have been, and remain, broadly conservative (or classically liberal) in our politics and outlooks. Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort."
A filing with the Federal Election Commission showed the form to launch a super PAC called Rough Riders for America was filed on Nov. 5. A month later, an amendment was filed to change the group's name to the Lincoln Project.
Though many conservatives have spoken out against Trump since his 2016 victory, few have taken their opposition beyond critical editorials or social media attacks.
Political strategist Reed Galen, who is listed as the group's treasurer, told the Associated Press that the launch of the Lincoln Project represented a "shift from talk into action." He called it a "big turning point for the political season and for the president's reelection."
Weaver told AP that the group plans to focus on winning over Republicans who are wary of Trump in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina. They also plan to work against Republicans who have supported Trump, such as Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona.
The group said Trump's "actions are possible only with the craven acquiescence of congressional Republicans" who they say have "embraced and copied Mr. Trump's cruelty and defended and even adopted his corruption."
The Lincoln Project's target voters represent a relatively small segment of the electorate. Trump has enjoyed solid support from Republicans since taking office. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll published Sunday found the president had an 87% favorability rating among registered Republicans voters.
But those behind the super PAC say Trump's supporters have "abandoned conservatism and longstanding Republican principles and replaced it with Trumpism, an empty faith led by a bogus prophet."

Texto completo: A social work grad student calls for the reinstatement of a successful program for asylum seekers. Also: The Spanish government on the Catalan secession vote; too much information in friendship.
To the Editor:
Re "Migrant Children Pay Price as Trump Seeks to Extend Detention" (news article, Dec. 9):
The evidence is clear: Family detention is a harmful and costly mechanism to punish women and children whose only "crime" is fleeing persecution. That's why, as an American, I was distraught to see that the administration is planning to expand this detrimental practice.
Luckily, there is a straightforward and sensible alternative. The Family Case Management Program, part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, offered community-based case management and ensured that asylum seekers complied with immigration requirements. The Trump administration abruptly and inexplicably terminated the program in 2017.
In its nearly two years of operation, the program demonstrated that it was just as effective as detention in ensuring that asylum seekers showed up to court and adhered to our immigration requirements.
The Family Case Management Program allowed the United States to ensure that asylum seekers are complying with our laws while treating them with the dignity and respect they deserve.
The United States should restart the Family Case Management Program immediately and abandon these ill-informed plans to expand family detention.

Catalonia: The Official Spanish View
To the Editor:
Re "Outdated Borders Are Strangling Liberal Democracy," by Carles Puigdemont, a former president of Catalonia (Turning Points, Opinion, nytimes.com, Dec. 3):
Mr. Puigdemont's reflections on borders and liberal democracy are not only misleading, but also tend to forget that territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers are international-law principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, the European Union treaties, the Helsinki Final Act and, as a result, in the 1978 Spanish Constitution.
In these times, we must be careful because fake news and distorted reality can put at serious risk the fundamental rights of individuals, in this case, Spanish citizens, including the majority of Catalans.
Mr. Puigdemont wrongly characterizes the illegal vote in October 2017 as the ultimate democratic act. He chooses as examples Quebec and Scotland, conveniently avoiding mention of the differences in history, applicable law and political context that allowed for those independence referendums to take place.
Other democratic states have declared the illegality of independence votes: the German constitutional court in 2016 on a possible vote in Bavaria; the Italian one in 2015 on the Veneto region; and the Alaska Supreme Court in 2006 in the United States. Do these judicial decisions make Germany, the United States and Italy undemocratic?
Official figures, including those of the research institute of public opinion in Catalonia, funded by the regional government of this Spanish autonomous region, show that less than half of Catalan citizens favor independence. Is it more democratic to impose the will of a minority, however relevant, upon all? Of course not.
Any politician -- local, regional or national -- must be aware at all times of his or her duties to all the citizens of his constituency, not only to his voters and supporters. In the case of Catalonia, it is time for the regional government to seek to heal the divisions caused in recent years and focus on addressing the needs of all Catalans.
In doing so, we will also contribute to the greater good and prosperity of Spain and the European Union.

Oversharing in Friendship
To the Editor:
As an advice columnist, I have to disagree with a suggestion offered in "How to Have Closer Friendships" (Here to Help, Dec. 15).
While it's good to be available and responsive and to "let yourself be known," and it's O.K. to share that you "are jealous of other people's accomplishments," it's an absolutely terrible idea to admit that you "don't always brush your teeth before bed."
Sorry. No. Please keep that tidbit to yourself. And brush your teeth before bed.

Texto completo: A coalition of liberal groups that included MoveOn.org and Indivisible organized hundreds of rallies across the country.
From Boston Common to the French Quarter in New Orleans, a series of protests reverberated across the country on Tuesday evening to call for President Trump's removal from office, a prelude to momentous impeachment votes set for Wednesday in the House of Representatives.
In Center City Philadelphia, a group of demonstrators held up signs with LED lights spelling out IMPEACH at the base of a bronze statue called "Government of the People," while Times Square in New York teemed with protesters chanting, "No one's above the law."
In Marshall Park in Charlotte, N.C., about 200 pro-impeachment demonstrators recited the Pledge of Allegiance and sang "America the Beautiful." Among them were Kendrick Frazier, 49, and his husband, Vincent Archie, 59.
"I'm here because our democracy is at risk," Mr. Frazier said. "The rule of law has been thrown to the wayside. And people think that you have this personal thing against Donald Trump, and there have been lots of Republican presidents, but they acted like presidents. They didn't act like, I'm sorry, but criminals."
A coalition of liberal groups including MoveOn.org and Indivisible organized hundreds of demonstrations, which incorporated many of the same elements as the yearly women's marches that have been held since Mr. Trump's election in 2016. The hashtags #impeachmenteve and #notabovethelaw trended on Twitter.
In Tucson, Ariz., several hundred activists who support impeachment flocked to the front of the federal courthouse, where they were greeted by the sound of honking horns from rush-hour traffic.
"This is not a partisan issue," said Dr. Eve Shapiro, 67, a local pediatrician who favors impeachment. "Congress has made it one, but that's what's happening to our country. For us today, it's about a president who obstructed justice. That's not partisan."
On the other side of Congress Street, a smaller faction of Trump loyalists in their ubiquitous red caps mounted a counterprotest. There were dueling chants of "lock him up" and "four more years."
Chris King, a retired military officer and vice chairman of the Pima County Republican Party, held an American flag and spoke sarcastically about the looming impeachment vote.
"I won't let them spoil my morning coffee," he said. "I don't let their hate get to me."
Another Trump supporter, who declined to give her name, expressed her disdain for House Democrats.
"They should take away their law degrees," she said.
The rallies came on the eve of a set of votes by the full House on two articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump.
The first article charges Mr. Trump with abuse of power, stemming from the president's attempts to get Ukraine to investigate the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in return for foreign aid. The second article charges the president with obstruction of Congress for blocking testimony and refusing to provide documents to lawmakers as part of the impeachment inquiry.
In Times Square, the demonstrators unfurled a giant banner with Article II, Section 4, of the United States Constitution, which deals with impeachment, printed on it. They marched with the banner downtown toward Union Square.
Erica Bruce, an interior designer who lives in New York, held up a gavel, made of garbage and paper, with the words "Impeach Trump" on it. The impeachment proceedings, she said, should serve as a wake-up call to voters.
"I think that what happens tomorrow is going to solidify for a lot of people whether their representatives are acting on behalf of their constituents or themselves," Ms. Bruce said.
In Wisconsin, a battleground state that Mr. Trump won in 2016, backers of Mr. Trump's impeachment descended on the steps of the State Capitol in Madison. They stamped their feet to revive frozen toes in 20-degree weather while listening to the Raging Grannies, a political activist singing group. A bullhorn and a microphone didn't work, forcing speakers to shout to the crowd of about 200 people.
Bill Kilgour, 87, said it was the duty of Congress to keep Mr. Trump in check.
"If a friend was drunk and they wanted to drive, wouldn't you have a responsibility to take the keys?" he said. "That's what impeachment is doing -- taking the keys away from this guy who can do much more damage than he already has."
Chris Taylor, 51, a Democratic state legislator from Madison, acknowledged the polarized political climate.
"We're a very divided state," Ms. Taylor said. "We have such a strong tradition of clean government in our state. People don't want a president forged by the legislature, doing pay-for-play politics. And that's what this is."
The votes on impeachment are expected to play out along party lines in the House, which Democrats flipped back to their control in the 2018 midterm elections. Mr. Trump would become the third president impeached by the House, joining Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Richard M. Nixon resigned the presidency, facing an almost certain impeachment for the Watergate scandal.
No president has ever been convicted by the Senate and removed from office. It would take 67 of 100 senators to convict Mr. Trump in an impeachment trial, which is expected to take place early next year in the Republican-controlled chamber.

Texto completo: This news story has been updated with comment from a lawyer for Dmitry Firtash
NEW YORK – An indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, received $1 million from the lawyer of a wealthy Ukrainian oligarch who’s under federal indictment in an alleged bribery scheme.
Dmitry Firtash is charged with using U. S. financial institutions to bribe Indian officials for titanium mining licenses. His Swiss lawyer loaned the money to the wife of Lev Parnas in September, federal prosecutors and a defense lawyer revealed Tuesday.
Some of that money went to pay Parnas' bail, according to the businessman's defense attorney.
The disclosure raises further questions about Parnas' financial dealings as he helped Giuliani push for the ouster of the U. S. ambassador to Ukraine and seek a Ukrainian investigation into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, who's vying to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
The revelations came during a Manhattan federal court hearing where prosecutors urged a judge to revoke Parnas' $200,000 bail on grounds he hid assets and income from authorities.
Defense lawyer Joseph Bondy insisted that Parnas did not provide false information about his finances and he won't try to flee the country to avoid trial and a possible 30-year prison term.
U. S. District Court Judge Paul Oetken denied prosecutors' motion to jail Parnas, saying his misstatements didn't appear to be intentional. He also denied Bondy’s request to ease the conditions of Parnas' home detention as he awaits trial for a campaign finance conspiracy scheme.
“I feel so relieved,” Parnas said before he thanked supporters and hugged Bondy amid a cold rain outside the courthouse.
Parnas, 47, a Ukraine-born businessman, was indicted in October with Belarus-born business associate Igor Fruman on charges they schemed to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign funds to U. S. political candidates and campaign committees.
They’re also accused, with co-defendants David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, of directing foreign funds to politicians in Nevada and New York in order to win support for a retail cannabis business.
Prosecutors have signaled the likelihood of additional charges against the four men, who have pleaded not guilty.
Parnas and Fruman figure in the House impeachment proceeding against Trump.
They helped Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and federal prosecutor, seek damaging information about Biden in Ukraine, which he has said he did behalf of the president. They also reportedly aided Giuliani in seeking the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, the U. S. ambassador to Ukraine.
Giuliani gave Trump information that he said showed Yovanovitch had blocked his investigations in Ukraine on the president’s behalf, The New York Times reported on Monday.
After Trump complained about Yovanovitch, the U. S. Department of State abruptly pulled her from her post in May.
Separately, Parnas had disclosed that he worked as a translator for Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing, Washington, D. C. -based attorneys who have represented Firtash.
However, lawyers' statements in court Tuesday revealed Parnas has more extensive ties to the Ukrainian oligarch, who was a former business associate of Paul Manafort, a 2016 manager of Trump’s presidential campaign now in prison.
Firtash was indicted in 2013 in an alleged bribery scheme that involved titanium products that were to be sold to U. S. -based aerospace giant Boeing. He is currently in Austria, where he is fighting extradition to federal court in Chicago.
In a 2017 federal court filing in the bribery case, U. S. prosecutors identified Firtash as an upper-echelon associate of Russian organized crime. He denied the allegation.
During Tuesday’s hearing, Assistant U. S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski said Parnas’ wife, Svetlana, received five wire transfers of $200,000 each in September from another lawyer for Firtash.
Bondy identified the attorney as Ralph Oswald Isenegger, a Swiss national whose office is now based in Dubai. Isenegger told Reuters by email on Wednesday the loan was a personal transaction between him and the Parnases.
"The funds were entirely mine and I was not acting in this matter at the request of or on behalf of any of my clients or indeed anyone else," Isenengger told Reuters. He said he got no response to his request for repayment after Parnas was arrested.
Arguing during Tuesday's court hearing, Donaleski said it's "not credible" that the transfers were a friendly loan, without collateral, to Parnas’ unemployed wife. The prosecutor contended that money instead was earmarked for Parnas, who has been the target of unrelated lawsuits aimed at getting him to repay debts.
Bondy said most of the money from Firtash's lawyer has been spent, including $200,000 used to secure Parnas' bond. That disclosure prompted Donaleski to question where Parnas is getting the money to pay for his legal defense and support his family.
Bondy didn't respond. However, he disputed any implication that Firtash was “some kind of benefactor” for Parnas.
He added that Parnas’ recent actions, which include providing documents and other information subpoenaed by the House for the Trump impeachment proceeding, placed the two men at odds. Parnas has made those efforts since he was arrested.
Bondy said he believes Parnas “has burned that bridge to the extent that there ever was a bridge in terms of getting any money. "
Bondy argued in a court filing Monday that Parnas has been threatened in Ukraine and would not flee there to avoid a U. S. trial. Tuesday, Bondy identified the source of the threat as Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky.
Kolomoisky, the billionaire founder of Ukraine’s Privatbank, “has a reputation for some form of violence in the Ukraine,” Bondy said.
On May 18, Giuliani tweeted that Kolomoisky was under investigation by the FBI and accused him of threatening American citizens, a reference to Parnas and Fruman.
Parnas has filed a Ukraine criminal case against Kolomoisky, Bondy said.
Kolomoisky has close ties to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian TV network owned by the oligarch aired a comedy show that brought Zelensky fame.

GOP opposition PAC " the Lincoln Project " aims to oust Trump

Texto completo: Several prominent Republicans who have loudly opposed President Trump launched a major fundraising campaign Tuesday to try to help beat him in 2020, vowing that cold, hard cash will be more effective in blunting him than the public warnings from the failed 'Never Trump' movement three years ago.
In a New York Times op-ed, the group " which includes lawyer George T. Conway and former GOP strategist Steve Schmidt " announced the formation of the Lincoln Project, a super PAC aimed at persuading enough disaffected conservatives and independents in swing states to tip the vote against Trump and defeat pro-Trump congressional candidates, even at risk of losing Republican control of the Senate.
Organizers said they plan to begin purchasing television and digital ads in January.
'Our efforts will be dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box and to elect those patriots who will hold the line,' Conway and Schmidt wrote in the editorial, also signed by Republican operatives John Weaver and Rick Wilson. 'Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort.'
The tone of the op-ed, filled with grandiose appeals to the nation's values, echoed the political call-to-arms made by 'Never Trump' Republicans in 2016. The Lincoln Project organizers warned that Trump lacks the proper 'temperament' to serve and is bereft of the 'moral compass' needed to lead the country.
But Trump trounced such GOP critics in his upset victory in 2016, dismissing them as an out-of-touch and self-interested part of a Washington establishment " or 'swamp' " that was threatened by his populist rhetoric. Since taking office, the president has continued his assault, driving some of the loudest Republican critics in Congress from office and freezing out many once-influential GOP figures from his administration.
As he consolidates his grip on the GOP, the president has weaponized the 'Never Trump' label, using it in a bid to discredit those within his administration who have testified in the House Democrats' impeachment hearings.
Dan Eberhart, a major Trump donor, professed skepticism that the Lincoln Project would gain inroads with Republican donors " or among Democrats, who would presumably support their party's candidates directly.
'As an activist or donor, aligning yourself with a Never Trumper super PAC is a recipe for oblivion,' Eberhart said. 'All the action is inside the tent in the Republican Party right now, and you see that in the House and the Senate not breaking on impeachment, you see that in Trump having an extremely high rating within the party, and you see that within the current level of donors. The donors are with Trump; the base is with Trump.'
Doug Deason, another Trump backer, predicted the Lincoln group will backfire '100-percent' by rallying more Republican donors around keeping the Senate.
Schmidt " who served as campaign manager of the 2008 presidential bid of the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) before renouncing the GOP last year " acknowledged that 'the fight against Trump and Trumpism has largely been waged ineffectively' by Republicans. He pointed to a recent campaign ad from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, which argued that the world was laughing at Trump, as the most effective message so far.
But he also noted that Republicans have lost several key elections since Trump took office, losing control of the House in the 2018 midterms and losing gubernatorial elections in Kentucky and Louisiana this year. Those signals, Schmidt said, suggest Trump is not invincible.
'We don't propose to communicate through letters to the American people as we move forward in this effort,' Schmidt said, when asked how their strategy would differ from the 'Never Trump' movement in 2016, which included a pair of anti-Trump public letters from scores of GOP national security figures.
'But all elections fundamentally are about a choice,' he said. 'Our goal will be to help frame a choice and to frame a choice we hope from a unique perspective [as Republicans] that is able to penetrate parts of the tribal bubble.'
Trump has sought to accentuate the partisan divide, playing repeatedly to his conservative base and helping drive out more-moderate Republicans, including former senators Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.), who have criticized him. Two-thirds of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (67-percent) strongly approved of Trump in a Marist poll this month, while just 5-percent said they strongly disapproved.
'This is a pathetic little club of irrelevant and faux 'Republicans,' who are upset that they've lost all of their power and influence inside the Republican Party,' Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said of the Lincoln Project founders.
Trump and his aides have verbally attacked Conway, who is married to White House counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway. On Tuesday, George T. Conway wrote on Twitter that 'the Republican Party apparatus defines Republicanism and conservatism as meaning one thing " unwavering fidelity to the incompetent narcissistic sociopath in the White House.'
Lincoln Project officials said they are aiming to sway a small slice of the electorate in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that were crucial to Trump's electoral college margin.
Conway, who has more than 836,000 Twitter followers, and the other organizers have a significant social media audience " but one that includes a healthy percentage of Democrats. Weaver said the group intends to make a broad fundraising appeal to donors of all political stripes.
Before launching, the group approached right-leaning donors and garnered enough seven-figure pledges to go ahead with the official announcement, Weaver said. Publicity on Tuesday led to a flurry of online donations, Weaver added, though he declined to disclose how much the group had raised or its overall fundraising goals.
Some of the Republican Party's biggest donors, who gave large amounts of money to GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, sat out Trump's election in 2016. It is unclear whether the Lincoln Project will be successful in wooing them, especially given that a super PAC is required to reveal its donors.
The super PAC had first registered in early November under the name Rough Riders for America, according to federal filings. Organizers amended the name to the Lincoln Project in early December, a reference to polls that found many Republicans view Trump as a better leader than the 16th president, Weaver said.
Bryan McGrath, a retired naval officer who helped organize the first 'Never Trump' letter in 2016, said he was hopeful the Lincoln Project's focus on raising money would make more of an impact. He said he had informal discussions with fellow national security experts about mounting another public campaign against Trump, but those talks died as Democrats made the national security case for impeachment over the president's dealings with Ukraine.
Besides, McGrath said, 'I feel like everyone who was persuadable has been persuaded. I sometimes get a little disappointed in myself for the shrillness of the things I write " not because I don't think they're right, but I wonder how helpful they are to anything. There isn't a lot of margin of persuadable voters left.'

Texto completo: Should Rep. Justin Amash, the Republican-turned-Independent from Michigan, help make the case for impeaching the President? Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnetonka said that when the idea struck him on Friday evening, he reached out to his close confidants first, and then asked more of his colleagues.
As first reported by the Washington Post on Sunday, Phillips said he’s gathered a group of around 33 Democrats to sign on to the idea that Amash help make the case for impeachment. “He would be a terrific member of the management team if indeed articles are forwarded to the Senate for a trial,” Phillips told MinnPost.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will select members to represent House’s case for impeachment during the Senate trial, called impeachment managers, that will serve as a sort of team of prosecutors. Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Jared Nadler of New York, the two committee chairs running impeachment so far, are almost certain to be chosen. But the other three slots committee could be competitive, as several members are asking for a slot, including Rep. Stacey Plaskett, a delegate to Congress representing the U.S. Virgin Islands.
But Phillips believes someone like Amash, a Tea Party libertarian, is needed to demonstrate the case that impeachment isn’t about partisanship.
Phillips, a moderate Democrat and a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, said he has already spoken with Amash and that the Michigan congressman was “humbled and I think surprised.”
“I didn’t want to float the idea to our whole Democratic freshman class without at least that he would be interested … and that’s exactly what I did,” he said. “And we’ve been corresponding since.”
When asked which members have signed onto the idea, Phillips said he has 33 strong affirmative yes statements on the idea from members, but he’d rather not say who. “I’m not going to divulge names,” Phillips said. “I think that’s up to individuals to do so.”
At least one Democrat, Rep. Max Rose of New York, told MinnPost that he is supportive of the effort.
The idea has has been latched onto by pundits and public figures from disparate parts of the political spectrum.
“As others have suggested, Rep. Amash should be one of the impeachment managers for the Senate trial,” Kevin Kruse, a historian of American History, said on Twitter. Michelle Goldberg, a New York Times columnists that leans significantly to the left of most of her colleagues, said on Twitter: “Democrats should choose Amash as one of their impeachment managers.” And Charlie Sykes, editor of the conservative (but Never-Trump website) The Bulwark, called the suggestion a “Good idea.”
Amash told HuffPost’s Matt Fuller that he has so far not been approached by Pelosi about the idea, but “would have the conversation.”
House Democrats plan to vote on impeachment on Wednesday. If they are approved, articles of impeachment will be forwarded to the Senate for a trial, which will be presided over by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Phillips said he fully intends to vote for articles of impeachment, come tomorrow.
“In fact, you know, [I’ve been] using language similar to Rep. Amash, which is that our responsibility is not to try or convict or acquit,” Phillips said.
“Our responsibility is analogous to a grand jury to assess the evidence and determine if it warrants a trial.”

Texto completo: In the Democratic-held state of New York, illegal immigrants are now allowed to obtain driver's licenses, leading to hundreds lining up to apply.
The new law allows illegal immigrants to use foreign documentation to gain American driver's licenses. The Fiscal Policy Institute estimates that 250,000 illegal immigrants, half of those located in New York, will obtain a driver's license in the next three years.
The Green Light Law, which allows illegal immigrants the right to obtain driver's licenses, went into effect in New York on Monday. New Jersey passed similar legislation the same day, and Democratic Gov. Philip Murphy promised to sign the bill into law, which would make New Jersey the 15th state in the United States to grant licenses to illegal immigrants.
Lines snaking around DMV buildings in New York were reported by the New York Times after the state's law went into effect, and a packed room of immigrant activists celebrated in New Jersey as its legislation passed.
Tweet
Twitter users were quick to criticize the Green Light Law, sharing photos and videos of the DMV lines in New York.
TweetTweetTweetTweet
The laws come as President Trump secured $1.3 billion in funding yesterday for the continued building of his promised wall along on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump made illegal immigration a cornerstone of his 2016 campaign and has boosted arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants during his tenure in the White House.
Photo Caption:This Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2019 photo shows a rally with demonstrators calling for driver's license for immigrants, outside the the offices of New Jersey Assemblyman Vince Mazzeo and Assemblyman John Armato, in Northfield, N.J. New Jersey lawmakers are set to vote on legislation Monday, Dec. 16, 2019 to permit immigrants who cannot prove they're in the country legally to obtain drivers licenses.

‘Puzzle King’ got his start at the Sonoma Index-Tribune

Texto completo: People who love words are called many things: grammarians, vocabulists, linguists, teacher’s pet. They tend to be bookish and nearsighted.
People who love crosswords enjoy language, too, but they take it droll, with a bit of whimsy on the side.
Myles Mellor, 68, is just such a person. He makes his living writing word puzzles. For more than a decade, his crosswords have anchored page two of the Index-Tribune, since he stumbled into the gig in 2006.
“Your paper was the turning point in my career, in a way,” Mellor said. “A gentleman named Bill Lynch (former owner and editor of the Index-Tribune) called me up and said ‘I’m paying way too much for my crossword puzzles. Can you provide them to me?”
Mellor agreed, and after some trial and error, came up with a general-knowledge crossword that more than met expectations.
“Lynch was also the president of the California Newspaper Publishers Association at the time, so that was a very big deal,” Mellor said. “I suddenly felt I might be able to get into more papers. Make it pay, make it a real business.”
Today, Mellor’s puzzles are syndicated in nearly 120 newspapers, and appear in more than 600 magazines. He writes custom puzzles on a wide range of topics: sailing, engineering, even puzzles for individuals for anniversaries and whatnot. He recently mailed his 15,000th invoice, and has now published 45 word puzzle books.
Starting out, his wife begged him to hang on to his day job as a researcher for a real-estate company. Now, Mellor – known as the “Puzzle King” – riddles full-time from his home base in Carlsbad, California.
A proper newspaper crossword complies with a set of conditions, regulations cruciverbalists take very seriously. First, the puzzle must be 15 squares by 15 squares, except when it’s the New York Times Sunday puzzle, and then it’s 21 squares long and wide. Next, the puzzle must have something called “rotational symmetry,” with its black and white squares in the same place when turned upside down. Also, no word can be less than three letters long, and whole phrases are commonly used to convey theme.
Theme is foundational to every good crossword, and it’s the place where Mellor always starts. A good puzzle has three words or phrases linked to the theme, with the top and bottom solutions having an equal number of squares.
“The theme is the hardest part,” Mellor said. “They have to be clever and match together. I try to vary them topically, or have them use a funny play on words.”
Too many black squares in a puzzle is considered inelegant, and off-color words are taboo. As Will Shortz, the New York Times crossword editor and puzzle master, tells freelancers, every clue and answer must pass the “Sunday morning breakfast test.” Anything gross is a no-go.
Mellor uses a program written by an astrophysicist to write his crosswords. “It’s called ‘Crossword Compiler.’ It’s a terrific program,” he said. He has an extensive library to cull ideas from as well, on the unlikely chance he may need an assist.
Once Mellor has established the theme of the puzzle, he puts in some black squares, including a “Utah,” the large-ish cluster of black squares that resembles the state. Then Mellor begins filling in the puzzle with shorter words. Finally, when the puzzle is filled in, Mellor rewinds to begin writing the clues. The process is exactly backward from what most people think.
Wordsmithing 101
Fifty million Americans regularly do crosswords. As a type, they are called “cruciverbalists.” A puzzle’s theme is often represented by phrases, not words, and generally anchor the puzzle’s horizontal mid-section. The crossword was invented in 1913, and doctors initially feared the correlating aggravation they cause might be bad for the health. Now, physicians recommend crossword puzzles to avoid dementia, and as a treatment for early-stage Alzheimer’s patients. Crossword puzzles are said to improve memory and brain function, increase vocabulary, and develop problem solving skills.
Mellor’s various clients have individual needs, with each requiring a particular level of difficulty. “There are segments of the West Coast that are a high level of difficulty, and segments of the East Coast with very high levels. A lot of papers wouldn’t do the Sonoma puzzle, for example,” Mellor said. “A lot of papers want something easier.”
Even still, Mellor occasionally gets it wrong. “There was an outcry when one of my L.A. Times Sunday puzzles turned out to be too hard,” Mellor said. “When people can’t figure something out, they get really upset.”
Working a crossword is a pleasure for Mellor, who — naturally — works only in pen. Pencils are a crutch for the timid and meek, and Mellor is not a man prone to self-doubt. “You start from the top and just keep working down. When I know for sure that the answer is right, I put it in. See, people try and guess when they don’t know for sure, and that’s when they get into trouble,” Mellor said. “Solving a crossword requires you to move from certainty, to what is likely.”
Invented by an English journalist named Arthur Wynn in 1913, crosswords are said to be the most popular word game in the world. “Fifty million people solve crossword puzzles regularly,” Mellor said.
In 1913, physicians feared that the frustration of failing at crosswords might endanger the mental health of sensitive types. “Ha! The reverse is the case,” Mellor said. “The Alzheimer’s Society has a whole program to do puzzles. People recognize that they’re actually useful in keeping people mentally active.”
Mellor himself is Exhibit A: an articulate, self-possessed man who does not trip on his tongue. He takes pleasure in knowing countless people at any moment are grappling with his puzzles, and delights in the contentment they feel when they’re mastered. “It’s much better to start on an easier level,” Mellor advised. “People are much happier when they can say ‘it was too easy for me.’ If you’re smart, you’re going to figure the puzzles out. It’s a small thing, but finishing a good puzzle allows people to rejoice.”

Report sounds alarm on rising sea levels

Texto completo: Despite years of urgent warnings, local governments are moving too slowly to prevent the worst damage from sea-level rise caused by climate change, risking repercussions as severe as housing shortages or an injured state economy, according to a report released by the Legislative Analyst's Office.
The report suggests California would need to start building 100,000 more housing units annually in coastal cities to mitigate the problems caused by sea-level rise. Funding for public schools might be affected as well, as higher sea levels hurt property values and lower tax revenue. And it's not just beachside housing that will be impacted. Commercial property like Oakland's airport could face severe flooding in the coming years. In years with what's called a ten-year storm surge, the airport would be useless.
The report, released Thursday, maps out solutions for California's Legislature.
Key among them is money for local governments, but the analyst's office also recommends teamwork. Sea-level rise will affect coastal communities across county lines, the report says, so it recommends regional planning and adaptation projects up and down the state's coast.
"We need to expand our efforts to start preparing for those inevitable impacts and even though it's really an issue of statewide importance, most of the work needs to happen at the local level," said Rachel Ehlers, a principal fiscal and policy analyst at the analyst's office and the lead author of the report.
The report relies on scientific findings that project sea-level rise reaching half a foot in 2030 and about seven feet by 2100, although other state-commissioned projections place sea-level rise at closer to 10 feet in 2100. Ehlers acknowledged the rise could be worse than the report's projection, but analysts chose to use the estimates reported in most studies.
"Science tells us that some degree of impact from climate change is inevitable, including rising sea levels, and that has the potential to be really destructive in California, given all of our infrastructure and property and natural resources along the coast," Ehlers said.
For those with boots on the ground, finding financial support to tackle a problem whose ugly side won't show for years is a tough challenge.
"Action requires money. We spend a lot of our time applying for grants... and that may not be the most efficient way to go about planning," said Jack Liebster, the planning manager for Marin County. "When it gets down to building some solutions, 'who's going to pay' is the question."
Liebster said his department has relied heavily on grant funding to plan and act on sea-level rise.
He considers Marin to be on the "bleeding edge" of the issue, and the county is planning solutions to the forthcoming natural disasters. One such proposal includes building sand dunes near beaches in the county to fight the loss of sand and protect homes near the water. Liebster said they're examining whether the solution is feasible.
The county has also made progress on how it plans to inform citizens of rising sea levels. In March, it released "Game of Floods," a board game designed to help people understand adaptation choices and show how vulnerable the county is to sea-level rise.
Other local agencies have been monitoring sea levels as well. The Port of Oakland, which also owns Oakland International Airport, is planning ways to manage the predicted flooding. Next year, construction will begin on a dike that will protect the airport's main commercial runway from sea-level rise up until 2030. The airport also has a drainage system in place that helps alleviate flooding now.
"We're not sitting around, waiting for something bad to happen and then try and do an after-the-fact solution," said Marilyn Sandifur, a port spokesperson. "We're proactive. We've been planning for years and coordinating with others."
For instance, Sandifur said, just last week the port's officials met with colleagues from other California ports to discuss sea-level rise across the state. The conference also invited the Netherlands' Port of Rotterdam to attend and share its solutions to flooding. The Port of Rotterdam uses levees and dikes to keep the port from flooding because much of the country is located below sea level, according to The New York Times.
The organization has also been working with the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, whose mission is to protect the bay and its shoreline. The commission supports regional planning for sea-level rise, thanks to more than $3 million in state funding, and in 2012, it mapped vulnerable bay area populations and communities. The analyst's office reported that of those communities, Oakland's airport would be one of the most threatened areas.
This type of regional collaboration is one of the many recommendations outlined in the report. The recommendations range from low-cost barriers that hold the ocean back from development, to expensive options like moving buildings. In places like Marin, though, some options aren't feasible. The county is surrounded by protected agricultural lands and forests. Liebster, the county's planning manager, said it would be "controversial" to move developed areas.
"There are some difficult choices that will need to be addressed," he said.

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS – Cluck Norris, the cowboy pigeon in a tiny orange hat, has been captured.
Lofty Hopes, the Las Vegas pigeon rescue that's been tracking a pair of hat-wearing birds for more than a week, found Cluck in a trap near the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus Monday. A photo posted to Twitter showed the Wild West pigeon in a plastic kennel.
The fashionable bird's counterpart, Coolamity Jane, is still on the lam more than a week after a video showing the pigeons strutting down the street in tiny hats went viral and captured the country's attention. The second cowboy pigeon was spotted flying near the trap that landed Cluck on Monday.
"We'll have Coolamity Jane real soon," Lofty Hopes co-founder Mariah Hillman said.
Intrigue surrounding the travels of Coolamity Jane and Cluck Norris inspired a parody country song, entertaining social media commentary — and even a report in the New York Times.
Lofty Hopes, a rescue run out of a two-bedroom apartment on East Sahara Avenue, had little luck last week tracking down the pigeons – until Thursday, when Coolamity Jane showed up donning her pink hat on a roof a half mile south of UNLV.
The tiny cowboy hats appear to be glued on the pigeons, Hillman said. When the rescue first encountered Cluck Norris, there were feathers stuck to his tiny red hat.
Who made a joke at the expense of the birds' well-being remains a mystery.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Monday he looks forward to debating his Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential race – but maybe not in an event organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
In a series of tweets, Trump suggested he might want to face off with the Democratic nominee in events organized by someone else.
"There are many options, including doing them directly & avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission," Trump tweeted. "I will make a decision at an appropriate time but in the meantime, the Commission on Presidential Debates is NOT authorized to speak for me (or R's)!"
The New York Times reported that Trump talked with aides about the possibility of sitting out the debates because of mistrust of the commission.
The Commission on Presidential Debatesis a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that has organized and sponsored presidential and vice presidential debates since it was established in 1987.
In his tweet string, Trump claimed the commission "is stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers," and he accused them of creating microphone problems in one of his 2016 debates with Democrat Hillary Clinton.
He provided no evidence to back up his complaints about intentional bias by the commission.
Anti-Trump Republican media strategist Rick Wilson tweeted, "Trump was setting the stage to never debate in the 2020 election."
Trump denied that claim, tweeting that "I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line" in the Democratic primaries.

Texto completo: Xiyue Wang, released in a prisoner exchange between the United States and Iran, and his wife, Hua Qua, said they were thankful for those who had helped with the diplomacy.
WASHINGTON -- An American graduate student from Princeton University who had been imprisoned for three and a half years in Iran called on Monday for all nations to free their political prisoners.
The student, Xiyue Wang, was released by Iran on Dec. 7 in a prisoner swap in Switzerland. In exchange, the United States handed over Masoud Soleimani, an Iranian scientist. The exchange took place after weeks of negotiations involving diplomats in the United States and Iran, which do not have formal relations, and Switzerland, which regularly acts as an interlocutor between the other two powers.
In a statement, the first since that day, Mr. Wang and his wife, Hua Qu, a Chinese citizen, thanked the governments, individuals and organizations that helped in the release. The two also posted photographs showing Mr. Wang smiling with his 6-year-old son, Shaofan.
"Our family is doing well, and we are overjoyed and filled with deep gratitude for all the support we have received," they said. "That said, our joy is tempered as our thoughts turn to all those who are still unjustly imprisoned and to their loved ones, who remain without them."
They added that "Xiyue's release is a victory of humanity and diplomacy across nations and political differences."
"We urge world leaders to come together and find the compassion and common ground to free all political hostages as soon as possible," they said. "Where there is a will, there is a way."
American officials have criticized the authoritarian government of Iran for its practice of taking hostages. Iran holds at least five Americans considered by officials in Washington and human rights advocates to be hostages: Morad Tahbaz, an environmental activist; Siamak Namazi, a business consultant, and his father, Baquer Namazi, a former Unicef diplomat; Michael R. White, a Navy veteran; and Robert Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent and C.I.A. contractor.
Mr. Levinson vanished in Iran more than 12 years ago, and Iran said last month, to the surprise of many, that it had an "ongoing case" into him.
Iran has charged most of the prisoners with various crimes, though advocates for those held say they are innocent.
The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Iran after Iranian students, inspired by a successful revolution led by Muslim clerics, took diplomats and civilians hostage in 1979 in the American Embassy in Tehran. The hostages were held for 444 days.
Mr. Wang, 38, was arrested in August 2016 in Iran while doing research in archives there as a fourth-year doctoral student at Princeton. He was convicted of espionage charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. American officials said Mr. Wang was not a spy.
His wife said earlier that she was allowed to speak regularly with Mr. Wang on the phone while he was at Evin Prison, which showed that the Iranian authorities did not consider him to be a security risk.
After the United Nations General Assembly met in late September, the Iranians raised the idea of exchanging Mr. Wang for Mr. Soleimani, senior American officials said.
Mr. Soleimani was arrested at a Chicago airport last year and was convicted on charges of violating American economic sanctions on Iran. He was being held in a prison in Atlanta, and American officials said they had expected him to be released as early as next month under a plea agreement. It is unclear whether Iranian officials knew of the potentially imminent release of Mr. Soleimani.
Brian H. Hook, the State Department's special representative for Iran, flew to Zurich with Mr. Soleimani. There, Mr. Hook met with Iranian and Swiss officials, and the parties conducted the prisoner exchange. Mr. Wang hugged Mr. Hook.
Ms. Hua, who lives in graduate student housing in Princeton with their son, was not given official word of the release until the last minute.
Just two days earlier, on Dec. 5, she said in an interview with The New York Times that her greatest desire was to have her husband home with the family for the holidays. However, she described being despondent, and said she had no indication that any negotiations were progressing.
On Dec. 11, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced new sanctions on Iran's largest shipping company and a major airline, but also said he was hopeful that Mr. Wang's release would pave the way for a diplomatic dialogue on freeing the other American prisoners.
"I do hope that the exchange that took place will lead to a broader discussion on consular affairs," he said. "We still have Americans held in Iran, too many for sure."

Hackers Used Strobes to Cause Seizures, Epilepsy Group Says

Texto completo: Hackers sent images of flashing strobe lights to the foundation's thousands of Twitter followers in several attacks.
HOUSTON -- Hackers sent videos and images of flashing strobe lights to thousands of Twitter followers of the Epilepsy Foundation last month in a mass cyberattack that apparently sought to trigger seizures in those with epilepsy, the foundation said on Monday.
The series of online attacks was particularly reprehensible, it said in a statement, because it took place during National Epilepsy Awareness Month.
"These attacks are no different than a person carrying a strobe light into a convention of people with epilepsy and seizures, with the intention of inducing seizures and thereby causing significant harm to the participants," said Allison Nichol, director of legal advocacy for the nonprofit foundation, which finances epilepsy research and connects people to treatment and support.
The foundation reported 30 such attacks in the first week of November, and said it had filed complaints with law enforcement authorities, including with the United States Attorney's Office in Maryland, where the group's headquarters are. It was unclear how many people clicked on the videos and animated images known as GIFs.
Cyberattacks intended to trigger harmful seizures in those with epilepsy have become more common in recent years, particularly after a Texas author was targeted in 2016.
In that attack, John Rayne Rivello, a Marine Corps veteran from Maryland, was accused of using Twitter to send a GIF with a blinding strobe light to an epileptic author, Kurt Eichenwald, who had written critically about Donald J. Trump and his supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mr. Rivello had been scheduled to plead guilty on Monday to a charge of aggravated assault in the case, which was filed in Dallas and became a legal testing ground for the limits of free speech and criminal assault in cases of cyberattack.
The hearing, however, was postponed until January. A lawyer for Mr. Rivello, Matthew Alford, did not respond to a request for comment.
Two months before the Twitter attack, Mr. Eichenwald, who was a reporter for The New York Times from 1986 to 2006, had written an opinion piece in Newsweek headlined "How Donald Trump Supporters Attack Journalists." In the column he described death threats he had received because he had written critically about Mr. Trump.
The threats, Mr. Eichenwald wrote, were "sometimes just general invocations that I should die, sometimes more specific threats that I should be shot or 'lynched,' as one Trump fan wrote." He added, "One Trump fan mentioned he knew which schools my children attended, and correctly named them."
In December 2016, after publication of the Newsweek piece, Mr. Eichenwald told investigators that he had stepped into his home office one evening and clicked on a message from someone identified as @jew_goldstein. It contained a strobe light GIF and a declaration in capital letters: "You deserve a seizure for your posts."
Looking at the strobe caused an immediate seizure that lasted about eight minutes, court documents showed.
"He slumped over in his chair," said Steven Lieberman, Mr. Eichenwald's lawyer. "He was unresponsive and he probably would have died but for the fact that his wife heard a noise -- she's a physician -- and she pulled him away from the screen and got him onto the floor."
Mr. Eichenwald's wife, Theresa, called 911 and took a picture of the strobing light on his computer with her cellphone. "This is his wife, you caused a seizure," she replied to the Twitter account. "I have your information and have called the police to report the assault."
Investigators found several digital clues they said led them to Mr. Rivello, including a message he had sent to other Twitter users that read, "I hope this sends him into a seizure." They also found a screenshot on Mr. Rivello's iCloud account showing Mr. Eichenwald's Wikipedia page with a fake date of death as well as a screenshot of a list of epilepsy seizure triggers that had been copied from an epilepsy information website.
The faked Wikipedia page also included anti-Semitic references, according to court documents, and the Twitter handle @jew_goldstein, with the name Ari Goldstein, was traced to Mr. Rivello.
Mr. Eichenwald, 58, has written that he is Episcopalian with a Jewish father.
Mr. Rivello, 32, who lived in Salisbury, Md., was arrested in 2017 and charged in federal court with cyberstalking. Federal prosecutors dropped the charge that year, but the Dallas County District Attorney's Office proceeded with a prosecution on state charges.
Mr. Eichenwald still suffers from the seizure, both physically and emotionally, and continues to receive similar cyberattacks, his lawyer said.
"For a long time he has been unable to hold his grandchild for fear that his lack of control over his limbs will potentially cause an injury to the child," he said.
Mr. Eichenwald filed a lawsuit against Mr. Rivello in federal court in Maryland for battery and other claims. The defense moved to dismiss it, arguing in part that the battery claim could not be supported because Mr. Eichenwald did not claim that any physical contact had occurred.
But Chief Judge James K. Bredar of the United States District Court in the District of Maryland allowed the lawsuit to proceed, writing that the "novelty of the mechanism by which the harm was achieved" did not make the alleged actions any less of a wrongful act.

George Conway on Trump: 'So dumb that he doesn’t know how to spell outrageous'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Conservative attorney George Conway questioned President Donald Trump's intelligence on Sunday night in a biting tweet after the president again misspelled the word outrageous as "outrages. "
"It’s outrageous that the United States has a president who is so dumb that he doesn’t know how to spell 'outrageous," Conway tweeted. He pointed out that this "isn’t the first time he’s made this specific mistake, so you can’t chalk it up to the slip of a finger. "
Conway's tweet was in response to one from Trump in which the president quoted Fox News host Sean Hannity as saying the impeachment process against Trump "is outrages lying, corruption and propaganda. Should never be allowed to happen. "
Trump made the same misspelling in a Sept. 21 tweet referring to an unspecified New York Times article. The tweet tagged Ed Rollins, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan, and Fox Business host Lou Dobbs and included a quote that was apparently from one of those men.
"'When someone gets nominated overwhelmingly, and then wins the Election, as he did, then he gets to set the National Agenda. The press is just outrages. This @nytimes story is the most irresponsible thing I’ve ever seen. ' @EdRollins @LouDobbs I agree, They also lose too much!" Trump tweeted.
And in an Oct. 4 tweet quoting Rollins, Trump wrote, "'I think it's outrages that a Whistleblower is a CIA Agent. '"
Trump has correctly spelled "outrageous" in far more tweets, however, so it was unclear what caused the recent typos. In April, Trump railed against the "outrageous" court decisions on his immigration policies.
Conway is married to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Though he initially supported Trump, he has become one of the president's fiercest critics and has questioned Trump's mental health.
In response to another Trump tweet on Sunday denouncing the impeachment, Conway wrote, "You need to have the Secret Service take you back to the hospital, this time to the psych ward. "
On Sunday Conway also tweeted that Trump's post implying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , wore dentures was "cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. "
A prolific Twitter user, Trump has often drawn mockery for typos or misspellings in his posts. At times he has corrected them, while others – such as the "outrages" tweets – are still available, uncorrected. In the case of an inexplicable tweet about "covfefe," Trump implied the apparent error may have been intentional.

Texto completo: The Swedish teenager who inspired a global movement is returning home, as admirers and critics weigh in.
LONDON -- Greta Thunberg says she needs a break.
The seemingly tireless 16-year-old climate activist -- who has sailed across the Atlantic twice as she has become the most prominent face in the movement to fight global warming, and lectured the world's leaders that they were not doing enough to address the problem -- recently told reporters in Spain:
"I will be home for Christmas and then I will take a holiday break because you need to take rest. Otherwise you cannot do this all the time."
The activist, who last week was named by Time magazine as its person of the year, has faced attacks from the far right, as well as from the president of the United States and other adults who find her intense and her message that the world is facing a crisis unsettling. Now others have weighed in, including a German railway company.
President Trump, who was Time magazine's person of the year in 2016, called this year's choice "ridiculous" on Twitter. He urged Ms. Thunberg to "work on her anger management problem" and to "chill."
The Trump campaign also distributed a Photoshopped image of the Time cover with the president's head superimposed on the teenager's body.
Earlier in the week, Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's far-right president, referred to her as a "brat," Reuters reported.
Ms. Thunberg also came under criticism last week when she joined thousands of students in the north Italian city of Turin on Friday to pressure the government to take action on carbon emissions. She had just been in Madrid for a United Nations climate conference.
While addressing the climate protest, Ms. Thunberg called on crowds to "put leaders against the wall," according to the BBC.
Critics scolded that she was advocating violence, leading her to apologize and explain that the true meaning of her words had been lost in translation.
On Saturday, she said that she was "against any form of violence," and that her remark had been nothing more than an unfortunate translation of an expression meaning "to hold someone accountable" in her native Swedish.
Then on Sunday, she posted a photo on Twitter that showed her sitting next to her packed suitcases on the floor of a German train that she described as "overcrowded."
The German railway company appeared to take umbrage, first thanking her on Twitter "for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change!" but adding, "It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class."
In a follow-up tweet, she explained that the train she had taken from Basel, a city in northwestern Switzerland, had been "taken out of traffic."
"So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains," she said, adding that she got a seat after Göttingen, a German town. "Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!" she wrote.
Ms. Thunberg emerged on the world stage last year, when she started skipping school to protest climate change outside the Swedish Parliament in August 2018.
Refusing to fly because of the outsize greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, she traveled across the Atlantic on an emissions-free yacht to make a fiery speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York in September this year.
Then in November she set sail from Hampton, Va., to Spain for the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference.
This month, the Oscar-nominated director Darren Aronofsky called her "the icon the planet desperately needs" in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times.
After Mr. Trump's mocking tweet this week, Ms. Thunberg changed her Twitter bio to identify herself as: "A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."
Prominent figures also came to her defense.
"What kind of president bullies a teenager?" Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a Democratic presidential hopeful, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. He added that the president "could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader."
Michelle Obama, the former first lady, also weighed in, telling Ms. Thunberg to not let "anyone dim her light."
"Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on," she wrote.

Texto completo: The Xinjiang regional government in China’s far west is deleting data, destroying documents, tightening controls on information and has held high-level meetings in response to leaks of classified papers on its mass detention camps for Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities, according to four people in contact with government employees there.
Top officials deliberated how to respond to the leaks in meetings at the Chinese Communist Party’s regional headquarters in Urumqi, Xinjiang’s capital, some of the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears of retribution against themselves, family members and the government workers.
The meetings began days after The New York Times published last month a cache of internal speeches on Xinjiang by top leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping. They continued after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists worked with news organizations around the world including The Associated Press to publish secret guidelines for operating detention centers and instructions on how to use technology to target people.
The Chinese government has struggled with its 11-million-strong Uighur population, an ethnic Turkic minor- ity native to Xinjiang, and in recent years has detained 1 million or more Uighurs and other minorities in the camps.
Xinjiang officials and the Chinese foreign ministry have not directly denied the authenticity of the documents, though Urumqi Communist Party chief Xu Hairong called reports on the leaks “malicious smears and distortions.”
Xinjiang’s government had already mandated stricter controls on information in October, before the news reports, according to three of the people, all Uighurs outside Xinjiang.
They include orders for community-level officials to burn paper forms containing sensitive personal details on residents in their area such as their detention status, and for various state offices to throw away computers, tighten management of classified information, and ensure all information related to the camps is now stored on databases disconnected from the internet in special, restricted-access rooms to bar hackers, the Uighurs said.

Texto completo: This season, Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph won't match his 64 receptions and 634 receiving yards from 2018, but there is no doubt he has been as vital as anyone on the Vikings offense. His six touchdowns are tied with Adam Thielen for the team lead and tied for third among NFL tight ends.
On top of that, Rudolph, named the Vikings' nominee for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award last week, has moved into fifth place on the Vikings' career receptions list with 421, trailing Cris Carter, Randy Moss, Steve Jordan and Anthony Carter.
"That just means I have been here for a long time," said Rudolph, in his ninth season with the Vikings. "It's cool to be up there with those names and there are a lot of Vikings legends on that list, but I just try to do what I can to help our team win games."
That has meant blocking more than he has in the past -- helping the Vikings rush for 1,765 yards, their most through 13 games since 2012.
"That is something I have done a lot this year, a lot more than I have done in the past," said Rudolph, who has 35 catches for 312 yards. "It's something I have taken pride in this year, and it's something I have had to work on."
Rudolph still believes the Vikings can reach their goal of winning the NFC North. "That is our first goal at the beginning of every year, is winning a division title," he said. "When you win a division title you get a home playoff game, and we feel like we have put ourselves in a position to have meaningful games in December, and it starts this week with the Chargers in Los Angeles."
Return of Thielen?
All indications are that Thielen will be back Sunday after missing five games because of a hamstring injury, including the past four. He had never missed an NFL game before this injury.
Rudolph said he has been proud of how the offense has responded without Thielen, going 4-1 in those five games.
"We have had a lot of young receivers that have had to step up, we have had tight ends that have had to step up," Rudolph said. Tyler Conklin is a guy that didn't have a catch until a couple of weeks ago and now he's making big plays for us in the pass game, as well."
Does he feel like the offense has changed?
"It doesn't really change the offense, but the thing is, guys have to step up," he said. "When you lose a player of the caliber of Adam's, you know we have to pick up the slack elsewhere."
These Vikings are relying on a lot of rookies, such as tight end Irv Smith Jr., running back Alexander Mattison, receiver Bisi Johnson, center Garrett Bradbury and cornerback Kris Boyd.
Rudolph said a big part of his role as a veteran leader is helping those players understand how different December is in the NFL.
"I think the biggest thing in the young guys is they're used to being off or practicing for a bowl game," he said. "Once Thanksgiving hits, their season is normally done. After Thanksgiving we still have a quarter of our season left and the playoffs. Just trying to remind them that there is a lot of football left."
Cousins' trust
While Rudolph has had fewer receptions than years past, his ability to make extremely difficult catches has changed the offense.
He talked about how he makes one-handed grabs look so routine.
"Practice. You don't just make one-handed catches by accident. It is something you practice," he said. "Always catching balls, whether it's during practice, after practice, before practice, so when it comes in the game, it is something you have done a lot of times."
Does he feel like his relationship with quarterback Kirk Cousins has grown? "I think he is gaining a trust in me that even though there may be people around, traffic, that he can still throw the ball to me and I'll make a play," Rudolph said.
Along with that, Rudolph said there's no question Cousins has thrived in a leadership role this season.
"Kirk is a guy that came in here right away and led by example," Rudolph said. "He is a guy that other guys on this team will naturally follow. His play speaks for itself. He has played great football this year."
A historic record
Since the NFL moved to a 16-game season in 1978, the Vikings have won 12 or more games only three times -- 1998 (15-1), 2009 (12-4) and 2017 (13-3). They went to the NFC Championship Game in each of those seasons.
They still have a shot at 12 victories this season, but to get there they first have to go on the road to beat the Chargers, a playoff team a season ago.
"I expect a really good football team. The record is not indicative of the talent," Rudolph said of the Chargers (5-8). "They have a lot of talent on that football team and they have been stricken by injuries, but they have a lot of guys back healthy. They lost a lot of close games and so they're playing hard, and we expect a four-quarter game on Sunday."
The Vikings end with back-to-back home games against the Packers and Bears. Rudolph said that's a challenge players are really excited about.
"It's great. You have the opportunity to play two division games at home to end the year and that will allow us to control our destiny."

JOTTINGS
• The Chargers beat the Packers 26-11 and the Bears 17-16, and Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said there is no doubt they will present a big challenge, saying: "When they don't turn the ball over, they're pretty hard to beat. They've done a good job in those games, and they get some turnovers defensively."
• Pro Football Focus ranks the Vikings as the seventh-best team in the NFL, trailing the Patriots, Ravens, Saints, 49ers, Chiefs and Seahawks.
• The New York Times ran a big college bowl preview and here's what stood out: Auburn, the Gophers' opponent in the Outback Bowl, played the second-toughest schedule in the country behind only South Carolina. Of Auburn's 12 opponents this season, nine made a bowl game, and the Tigers went 6-3 in those games.
• Kenechi Udeze, the former Vikings defensive end and 2004 first-round draft pick, is an analyst on the coaching staff of LSU coach Ed Orgeron. The Tigers are the top seed in the College Football Playoff.
• Speaking of the CFP, the Fiesta Bowl will feature one of the semifinals, between Ohio State and Clemson, and the game's executive director is former Wild executive Mike Nealy, a University of Minnesota graduate who grew up in Roseville. He has held that role since 2014.
• The Gophers football team has only three commitments from Minnesota players in the class of 2020 -- Jonathan Mann of Rosemount, Danny Striggow of Orono and Cody Lindenberg of Anoka. The Gophers also have three recruits from Georgia.
• Twins President Dave St. Peter on the team targeting starting pitchers in free agency: "Clearly Madison Bumgarner is one of the guys on that board, but he's not the only one. There's a few additional guys that we think could make a difference for us, and then there's other individuals that maybe would come via trade that are certainly on our radar."

When Drug Side Effects Pose Serious Dangers

Texto completo: About a month ago, I took myself off a medication without first contacting the doctor who prescribed it, a step I have often cautioned others never to do. A neurologist had put me on the anticonvulsant drug Keppra as a preventive in case a seizure had caused an otherwise unexplained fall on my head and brief memory loss.
The neurologist was being appropriately cautious. Two years earlier, I’d had an equally mysterious accident accompanied by about a 15-minute memory gap.
A heart rhythm disorder was ruled out, and it would be weeks before I could undergo a three-day brain wave study to check for seizure activity. But after 10 days on Keppra, which the label warned could cause drowsiness, I was far worse than very sleepy. I could barely function. I was spending the day in bed, unable to work, read or even watch TV. And I was depressed, enough so that I began to list activities I could cancel, maybe even life itself.
When a friend told me she had been very fatigued and depressed while taking a different anticonvulsant, I had to know whether my symptoms were caused by the head injury or the drug, and the fastest way to find out on a Saturday night was to stop taking the drug. Within 36 hours, I was a new person, nearly back to my normal level of energy, ability to work and enthusiasm for life.
At first, I thought I would adjust to the drug’s side effects, but they had only gotten worse each day. My friend said she had stopped taking the anticonvulsant when she found herself sitting out on the ledge of an open window. On Monday I called the neurologist’s office and was appropriately chastised for stopping the drug without his OK, but at least I lived to tell the tale.
I’m sure I’m not the only one who has abandoned a medication without - or even against - a doctor’s advice. No doubt many, like me, experienced side effects that seemed to be much worse than the condition the medication was supposed to treat.
The rule of thumb in medicine - first, do no harm - has as its corollary that the expected benefits of treatment should outweigh its potential risks, which is the basis for approval of prescription drugs by the Food and Drug Administration.
Marketing approval includes review of the package insert, which is supposed to list possible side effects, from minor to serious, that showed up during pre-market tests. Consumers are urged to read these inserts before taking a new medication. But as with the now-required lists of side effects and warnings that accompany drug ads in print and on the air, these can terrify some patients, prompting them to refuse to take medications that would actually help them.
According to Timothy O’Shea, a clinical pharmacist who writes about prescription drugs, “Each year an estimated 4.5 million Americans visit a physician’s office or emergency room because of side effects related to their prescription medications.”
Among the 10 “scariest” side effects O’Shea listed in an article in Pharmacy Times are hallucinations that can result from psychiatric medications like Seroquel and Haldol; the sleep-enhancing drugs Ambien and Lunesta; and some anti-seizure drugs.
On a trip to Panama some years ago, my roommate developed psychotic hallucinations from the drug Lariam, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended at the time to prevent malaria.
Also alarming is memory loss that sometimes results from “the nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, which include Ambien, Lunesta and Sonata,” O’Shea wrote. Most worrisome, however, is an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents and young adults associated with all antidepressants.
All drugs, prescription and over-the-counter, have side effects or the potential to cause them, and the secret to safe and beneficial use lies in knowing what they might be and how they may be affected by your health, habits, diet, allergy sensitivities and other medications you take. Minor adjustments can often make a big difference in how effective and safe a medication will be for you.
For example, people on blood thinners must be cautious about taking aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can increase the risk of bleeding.
In addition to harmful drug-drug interactions, many risks linked to medication result from interactions with foods, drinks, supplements and other ailments. For example, some drugs, including most painkillers, are best taken with food to reduce gastrointestinal side effects, whereas others should be taken on an empty stomach to enhance their absorption.
The dose of the anticoagulant Coumadin has to be adjusted for consumption of certain vegetables rich in vitamin K like spinach, kale and broccoli, which can diminish the drug’s effectiveness. Grapefruit and pomegranate can limit the ability of a statin to lower cholesterol, but grapefruit can increase the effects of some drugs that treat high blood pressure. And blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors can impair excretion of potassium from foods like bananas.
Any severe drug reactions should be reported to the FDA. The agency’s MedWatch program, in effect since 1993, asks consumers as well as health professionals to report serious adverse events. A reporting form with instructions can be found at www.fda.gov/medwatch.

Breach widens in Congress ahead of impeachment

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — It was the rarest of moments in the nation's capital, a seemingly sincere attempt at persuasion across the partisan breach by the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee on the eve of the panel's vote to impeach President Trump.
“I know this moment must be difficult, but you still have a choice," Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York told his Republican colleagues at the start of more than 17 hours of debate on whether to remove Trump from office. “I hope that we are able to work together to hold this president — or any president — accountable for breaking his most basic obligations to the country and to its citizens."
A short time later, the former Republican chairman of the committee responded with a plea to Democrats to abandon impeachment: “Put aside your partisan politics," Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin implored, “because the future of our country and the viability of our Constitution as the framers decided it, are at stake."
But the appeals to rise above the tribalism of the moment from the two veteran lawmakers fell on deaf ears. They persuaded no one, and only served to contrast with the rancorous, sometimes personally vindictive debate that unfolded over the next two days in the Ways and Means Committee Room not far from the Capitol.
This was the very divisive impeachment debate that Democrats had always hoped to avoid.
In March, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her new Democratic majority that barring “something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should" try to impeach Trump. “It divides the country," she said then. “And he's just not worth it."
But now, less than three months after the allegations in a whistleblower complaint catapulted Democrats into an investigation of whether the president pressured Ukraine for political gain, the country is exactly where Pelosi worried it would be — on the brink of an intensely partisan impeachment with deep consequences for both parties and the country.
When she gave the green light for impeachment articles to be drafted this month, Pelosi said, “the president leaves us no choice but to act," arguing that to do nothing in the face of Trump's transgressions would invite lasting damage to the Constitution and the institutions of government.
But by Friday morning, as the committee formally paved the way for the House to impeach Trump next week, both sides seemed to sense that political vandalism had already taken place. Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, predicted “irreparable damage to our country" and closed his final argument with a lament: “God help us."
It wasn't just that the committee eventually voted to approve two articles of impeachment, charging Trump with abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress. Throughout the committee's debate, the lawmakers from the two parties couldn't even agree on a basic set of facts in front of them.
They called each other liars and demagogues and accused each other of being desperate and unfair. At one point, Republicans all but abandoned their pursuit of trying to persuade their Democratic colleagues, instead making a motion to strike the most critical lines out of the articles — essentially taking the “impeach" out of impeachment.
“It is silly," Nadler complained about the proposed amendment not long before his Democratic majority rejected it on a 23-17 vote, the same party-line margin that emerged throughout the day, time after time, no matter the argument or the issue.
Lawmakers of both parties appeared to feel the weight of history as they delivered impassioned arguments over and over again, in five-minute chunks, alternating between Democrats and Republicans well into the night on Wednesday, and again on Thursday.
But if the passion was similar, the substance was not. Even for members of a profession who are used to talking past each other, it was striking how unwilling both Republicans and Democrats on the committee were to concede even an inch to the other side.
“Ukraine was not aware of the aid," Johnson insisted Thursday, referring to the $391 million in security assistance that Trump had ordered withheld. If they didn't know the money had been frozen, he explained, Ukraine couldn't have been on the receiving end of a pressure campaign by the president.
When it was his turn, Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, asserted exactly the opposite, alluding to email evidence and testimony that disproved Johnson's argument. “They knew it on July the 25th," Cohen said of the Ukranians. “There were communications from the embassy that have been released that they knew the aid was being held up. They knew it was being held up."
It was an example of the different impeachment realities that the two parties are living in. But it was hardly the only one.
Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, described Trump's July 25 call with the President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine one way, saying it “shows that the president tried to get President Zelensky to interfere in the upcoming presidential election." His Republican colleague, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, saw it differently: “We saw the call transcript, and there is no conditionality."
And after Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, said it was “clear" that Trump cared about rooting out corruption in Ukraine, Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, scoffed: “The president never brings up corruption."
There's a long way to go before knowing which party benefits and which pays for impeachment in the 2020 elections, let alone which fares better in the eyes of history. But trust — by Americans toward Congress — seems to be suffering. And it's not clear the proceedings are changing minds. Recent polling shows that about half the country supports impeaching and removing Trump from office, fitting the pattern of a deeply polarized nation.
The poll also found that about 6 in 10 Americans said Democrats in Congress are more interested in bringing down Trump than pursuing the facts. Likewise, about 6 in 10 said Republicans in Congress are more interested in defending Trump than pursuing the facts.
In the House Judiciary Committee, Thursday night's lengthy session ended with predictable rancor when Nadler abruptly called a recess right before taking a final vote, saying he wanted “the members on both sides of the aisle to think about what has happened over these last two days and to search their consciences."
Instead, his decision — made without any warning and without the kind of bipartisan consultation that is common on the Judiciary Committee — added to the sense of mounting tension inside the grand room, where nerves were already frayed.
It was clear that despite Nadler's advice, nothing had changed by 10 the next morning.
Nadler moved swiftly to call for the final votes on the two articles of impeachment, and both passed with all 23 Democrats in favor of impeaching Trump and all 17 Republicans opposed.
In just 7 minutes, the work was over, and Nadler banged his gavel.
“Without objection," he said, as some Republicans in the room scowled, “this meeting is adjourned."

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Texto completo: A financially troubled Seattle research institute cut back programs, leaving researchers to find new homes for work on infectious diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy.
The future of a tuberculosis vaccine and research into other neglected diseases is in limbo after a Seattle institute abruptly laid off about one-third of its researchers, citing a financial crisis.
The sudden staff cutbacks late last month at the Infectious Disease Research Institute have baffled many of the scientists -- who were also working on a vaccine for leprosy and research into tropical diseases.
The layoffs on the day before Thanksgiving also put in jeopardy federal grants for the scientists' work. This fall, the National Institutes of Health awarded a contract of up to $ 45 million to the nonprofit and other collaborating institutions to study the body's immune response to tuberculosis over several years.
Developing an effective vaccine against tuberculosis, the world's deadliest infectious disease, has been elusive for decades. The only existing vaccine is decades old and is not effective in preventing the most common form of tuberculosis infection, in the lungs. A new vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline has proved promising in early clinical trials, but public health experts said there was a need for a healthy pipeline of additional vaccines to fight the disease, which kills about 1.5 million a year.
The 26-year-old Seattle research institute has often struggled financially. It has scrambled to close a gap between research grants from federal and private sources and its overhead costs, and has operated at a loss for years. The founder, Steven G. Reed, stepped down earlier this year from his role as chief executive after years of turmoil in which executives and board members resigned over their dissatisfaction with his leadership.
Dr. Reed has defended his work, and is now rushing to raise money to resuscitate the organization.
In an interview, the institute's acting chief executive, Dr. Corey Casper, said he inherited the crisis when he took the job in February. He said he had tried for months to save the programs, and had kept senior scientists abreast of the nonprofit's status. Thirty-three of the institute's 108 employees, who are mainly researchers, were let go.
"These were not easy decisions, but they were decisions that had to be made for the continued existence of the organization," Dr. Casper said.
Research into drugs and vaccines is notoriously risky, and biotechs often shut down when a clinical trial fails or investors do not materialize. But scientists and other experts in public health said the sudden end to the programs was unusual.
"I find it bizarre," said Dr. Mario C. Raviglione, a global health expert at the University of Milan who led the World Health Organization's global tuberculosis program from 2003 to 2017. "I've never heard about something like this."
Dr. Mel Spigelman, president and chief executive of the nonprofit TB Alliance, described the landscape for tuberculosis research as "precarious." He said that organizations face an annual shortfall of about $ 1.5 billion to finance new drugs, tests and vaccines for the disease, a bacterial infection that mainly attacks the lungs and can lie dormant for years. "New investments are urgently needed to build on the progress we've seen to date."
The potential success of the institute's TB vaccine is unknown. Early-stage clinical trials have begun, and others are planned in a number of countries.
Dr. Emily Erbelding, the director of the division of the N.I.H. that oversees the Seattle institute's tuberculosis contract, said that her office had been in "near daily" communication to sort out how the research could continue, and that it would depend on what happens to the institute in the next few weeks.
Several researchers are trying to relocate their work to new institutions. The scientists said they had not been told whether the institute, which owns the rights to the vaccines and other experimental products, would allow them to continue their work.
"We're a little bit in the dark right now as to how we are going to do this," said Tanya Parish, who oversaw the institute's research into new treatments for tuberculosis. Her research staff was laid off in November, and she said she has been told her own job will end later this month. "It sets us back at least six months," she said. "We have a lot of ongoing work that's been disrupted, and some work will have to be redone."
Dr. Casper said that the institute was also speaking to research institutions to relocate the work, and was also looking to license technology like the vaccines to ensure the research could continue elsewhere. "We've made it very, very transparent to all of our investigators in our departmental programs that we want to do everything we can to enable their work," he said.
Since its founding in 1993, the research institute has positioned itself as a nonprofit that operates like a biotech company, with a mission to bring new products to market for neglected diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy and leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease found mainly in the tropics. Early in the institute's history, Dr. Reed and Rhea Coler, the head of the tuberculosis vaccine program, played a role in the development of the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine. The institute also focuses on developing adjuvants, which are used in some vaccines to stimulate the body's immune response.
But like many nonprofits, it has struggled to stay afloat. With revenues of $ 23.6 million in 2017, it operated at a loss of about $ 4 million in 2017 and 2016, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. In 2018, its filings showed, it operated at a smaller loss -- about $ 47,000.
Former executives and board members at the institute pinned much of the blame on Dr. Reed, whom they described as a passionate scientist but expressed concerns about his financial stewardship and potential conflicts of interest, including ties to for-profit companies to which the institute had licensed some of its technology.
In the spring of 2018, the institute's chief financial officer, general counsel, board chairman and two of its other board members resigned.
"One of the concerns was that nobody really seemed to understand how the money was coming in and how it was being spent," said R. Douglas Bradley, the general counsel who stepped down. He said he did not see evidence that Dr. Reed misused funds. "There was a moment where it was just clear that his behaviors were not going to change."
Dr. Reed said he never did anything improper and acknowledged that keeping the organization going had "been a challenge for many years, but we've always met the challenges."
Staff members also pointed to the board's decision to award Dr. Casper a new contract, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. It shows that the board offered Dr. Casper a four-year deal at an annual salary of $ 405,000. The contract also included a $ 20,000 bonus for this year.
Dr. Casper said he was deferring the raise from his current pay of $ 365,000 and would not get a bonus this year. In defending the increase, however, he said: "It's very challenging to find someone who'd be willing to take the risk."
Dr. Reed received about $ 318,000 in 2018 for 32 hours a week, according to the institute's I.R.S. filings.
Some researchers questioned the reasons for ending their programs since grants covered their expenses and some administrative costs. Malcolm Duthie, a senior scientist who was told his job would end later this month, was developing a leprosy vaccine financed through grants coordinated by the American Leprosy Missions. "We have funded programs," he said. "And we've been given very short notice, which basically handcuffs us in terms of being able to take these programs somewhere else."
Dr. Casper said the grants did not cover all the overhead costs.
If the institute survives, it will focus on three main areas -- its adjuvants, its manufacturing facility and a technology known as RNA vaccines that are also being pursued by for-profit companies, Dr. Casper said.
The institute's board and leadership are vetting potential buyers or investors. Kari Stoever, who was on the board from 2016 to 2018, said she stepped down because the board did not act quickly enough to change the institute's leadership, including Dr. Reed. The institute had trouble staying competitive.
Financing tuberculosis vaccines had shrunk in recent years to better coordinate different funding groups, said Ms. Stoever, who has worked for several public health nonprofits.
Of the TB vaccine's future, she said: "Somebody will take it if the science is good. They're not going to let an innovation like a new TB vaccine disappear off the planet."

Texto completo: Douglas Miguel Rodríguez, trabajador inmigrante de Guayaquil (Ecuador) que murió en la masacre del martes en un supermercado judío en Jersey City, ha sido proclamado un “héroe” porque aún herido ayudó a una persona a escapar por la puerta trasera del establecimiento.
La Fiscalía de Nueva Jersey confirmó ayer que el tiroteo que culminó con la muerte de seis personas -4 víctimas y 2 novios pistoleros fanáticos religiosos- se investiga como “potencial acto de terrorismo doméstico”, alimentado por el antisemitismo y el odio a los agentes del orden.
Anoche se realizó una vigilia emocional en Jersey City. Parientes, amigos y completos extraños se unieron en memoria de las cuatro vidas inocentes que se perdieron en un instante, reseñó CBS2.
El rabino David Niederman dijo que Rodríguez murió como un héroe. “Después de recibir un disparo, abrió la puerta trasera para que rescataran a un cliente”, dijo a la prensa. “Desafortunadamente, murió al pisar esa puerta”.
Su esposa contuvo las lágrimas mientras agradecía al mercado que empleaba a su esposo por aceptarlo. “La comunidad judía aprendió a amar a mi esposo y estuvo allí para él y lo recibió”, dijo.
Otro doliente dijo que Rodríguez era como un hermano para él. “Lo amamos, lo extrañamos, pero sabemos que estará bien porque creía en Jesús”, dijo.
Su servicio conmemorativo se llevará a cabo de 5 a 9 p.m. mañana sábado en el Michigan Memorial en Paterson, Nueva Jersey.
Una página ha sido creada en GoFundMe en su memoria. Al momento se han donado allí más de $70 mil dólares para su esposa e hija. El Consulado de Ecuador también las está apoyando.
Rodríguez murió trabajando en “Jersey City Kosher Supermarket”, el único negocio kosher en la zona, informó The Fayetteville Observer.
También murieron la dueña del local, Leah Minda Ferencz (33), y su primo Moshe Hirsch Deutsh (24), miembros de la comunidad judía ortodoxa; el detective Joseph Seals (40), considerado un héroe local; y los atacantes, el hombre David Anderson (47) y la mujer Francine Graham (50), que se cree están vinculados al grupo religioso “Israelitas Negros” (Black Hebrew Israelites), según The New York Times.

Texto completo: A "Transformers" prequel hits Amazon and Hulu. And a documentary about Mel Brooks airs on HBO.
What's Streaming
BUMBLEBEE (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Many blockbuster prequels tell the origin story of a flesh-and-blood superhero or villain. This one tells the tale of a Volkswagen Beetle. Or, more precisely, it tells an origin story of a robot hero who can morph into a yellow car. That robot would be Bumblebee, once the metal partner of Shia LaBeouf's character in the various Michael Bay "Transformers" movies. Bumblebee is here reimagined as the sidekick of a 1980s Northern California teenager played by Hailee Steinfeld. Together, the pair defends the earth from evil robots. This movie was directed by Travis Knight, a filmmaker who built his career on stop-motion animation. He cut back on some of the profuse chaos that defined the earlier "Transformers" films, working off a screenplay by Christina Hodson. The result, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times, is "cleverly plotted, neatly allusive and has dialogue you can envision real people and, um, real Transformers speaking." It's "springy yet coherent," he added, "not, like previous films in the series, a digital-image blender set on high."
6 UNDERGROUND (2019) Stream on Netflix. "Bumblebee" was the first live-action "Transformers" movie not directed by Michael Bay. Those looking for Bay's brand of large-scale violence can instead turn to "6 Underground," his latest action movie. The film stars Ryan Reynolds as a billionaire who leads a team of vigilantes in a fight against well-financed baddies. A recent trailer includes parkour, guns, sparks and a destroyed car pirouetting through the air; it ends with Reynolds's character asking, "Sounds fun, right?" Whether or not you agree with that assessment is probably a good bellwether for whether you'd like the movie.
HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT (2015) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaking brothers Josh and Benny Safdie are in theaters this weekend with "Uncut Gems," a New York thriller with Adam Sandler that has gotten some terrific reviews. This earlier movie from the directors also tells a New York story. It centers on Harley (Arielle Holmes), a young woman who is addicted to heroin and lives on the streets of Manhattan. It's also a love story: The film is largely built around Harley's attempts to win back the affection a fellow addict, Ilya (Caleb Landry Jones). The Safdie brothers "capture a density of activity as endemic to the city as it is to Harley's daily hustle," Nicolas Rapold wrote in his review for The Times. He called the movie "a small, beautiful classic of street theater."
What's on TV
MEL BROOKS: UNWRAPPED 9 p.m. on HBO. There's a moment late in this documentary when Mel Brooks listens to tape of himself being introduced as an "American film director, producer, writer, actor and comedian" on a radio show in the late 1970s. "They left out composer," he says. Brooks's career, which included creating movies like "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frankenstein," is explored here through interviews that the British TV presenter Alan Yentob has conducted with Brooks periodically since the 1980s.

Texto completo: Also this week, the U.N. climate talks in Madrid
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
When we think about food waste, we usually think about individual households. Example: those sad looking carrots at the bottom of the fridge drawer. Your fault, your loss. Not a broader concern.
But those carrots are part of a systemic problem, one with grave implications for climate change. Project Drawdown ranked reducing food waste as the third most important step out of 80 proposed solutions.
If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In the United States alone, food waste generates the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as 37 million cars, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That accounts for both the energy used in agriculture to grow unused food, as well as the methane that's released when the food rots in landfills.
That's the bad news.
The good news is that cities are coming up with solutions. Because most municipalities run their own sanitation systems, said Yvette Cabrera, deputy food waste director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, they're "uniquely positioned to tackle the problem."
Here are three main strategies cities are using.
Target waste
Those sanitation systems give cities a lot of control over what happens to discarded food, and some are cracking down on waste.
Seoul, South Korea, for example, charges a fee for food waste. Families pay by weight. At recycling sites, the waste is processed: Part is used for biofuels, while some is turned into fertilizer to help urban farms. The city also has over 6,000 automated bins where residents can weigh their food waste and pay their fees, according to the World Economic Forum.
Seoul now recycles 95 percent of its food waste, up from less than 2 percent in 1995.
A version of that was tried in the United States in 2015, when Seattle introduced an anti-waste program that, among other things, made it illegal to toss out food. A year later, a judge tossed out the measure's enforcement provision when she ruled it was unconstitutional for trash collectors to snooping in garbage for edible morsels.
The law is still on the books, though, and it appears to have had an effect. For example, the program included an education campaign that focused on waste reduction, smarter shopping and composting. The right kind of food composting system produces lower emissions than a similar volume of food in a landfill, and you get something useful from composting: fertilizer.
Now, nearly 50 percent of food waste gets composted, according to Hans Van Dusen, the city's solid waste contracts manager. And, waste sent to landfills is at a record low of 0.81 pounds per person per day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
"We are so disconnected from where our food comes from, we don't think about the resources that take to get it to us," said Veronica Fincher, a senior waste prevention program manager in Seattle. "We want to help people understand those impacts."
For an example of what could happen if more cities tackled food waste, look to France. National law there requires large supermarkets to donate, rather than throw away, food that is still edible -- a measure that has sharply increased food donations to charities, according to the government.
Businesses are key
Cities tend to have lots of restaurants and grocery stores, and that presents a huge opportunity to reduce food waste.
One of the leaders in working with supermarkets and chefs is New York City, which runs the largest composting program in the country. It's part of a multimillion-dollar program to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions by turning food scraps and yard waste into compost and, soon, clean energy. The goal is to get the city to zero waste by 2030.
In addition to the composting program, the city runs a robust online food donation portal, food waste fairs and waste-reduction challenges that recognize successful efforts by restaurants and supermarkets.
As of now, the city wastes four million tons of food a year. Of that, 500,000 tons come from restaurants. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation estimates that cutting commercial food waste by 5 percent would save more than 120,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year.
"Baby steps so far, but we want to be sure that restaurants have the tools to do well," said the city's sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia. "There are some seriously committed chefs out there to ensuring that nothing gets wasted."
Other cities have also introduced curbside recycling and incrementally expanded their food waste regulation, like Los Angeles, Denver and Baltimore, which are all setting public goals to decrease waste, expand curbside composting and work with chefs and restaurants to raise awareness about food waste reduction.
Redistribute the surplus
So, some cities are saving a lot of food from the landfill. Some goes to the compost bin. Some, though, is still edible. What to do with it?
That's where food rescue programs come into the picture. Strictly speaking, these are not climate programs. But think of them as an added bonus: Cities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help the needy.
Milan, Italy has been a global leader in the rescue movement since 2015. That year, 15 tons of food was given to homeless people in just a few weeks when the chef Massimo Bottura helped to organize an anti-waste campaign. Since then, the city has written the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, an international food waste protocol for cities, and led a charge that helped to get Italy's national government to pass food waste legislation.
According to its organizers, the food policy pact has been signed by 207 cities from around the world with a total of around 450 million inhabitants.
It shows how a local initiative can take off, and how cities can have an impact.
"Once you tell people they can't throw food away, they start making different, creative decisions with it," said Emily Broad Leib, the director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic.
The second and final week of United Nations climate change talks in Madrid opened with a dash of optimism from the United States as a broad coalition of states, cities and businesses made a case that it could put a significant dent in planet-warming emissions without federal help.
Delivering the news was Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former mayor of New York City who is now running for president. Mr. Bloomberg co-founded the coalition, America's Pledge, along with Gov. Jerry Brown of California. Its purpose is to help the United States stick to the goals of the Paris climate agreement despite President Trump's plan to abandon the pact.
"The reason I am here in Madrid is really pretty simple," Mr. Bloomberg said. "I am here because no one from the White House is here."
A coalition report, issued this week and titled "Accelerating America's Pledge," found that, even without federal action, efforts to cut greenhouse gasses by the members of the group could have a significant impact.
Critically, the report found that there's still time for the United States to hit net-zero emissions by midcentury. A recent United Nations report said countries would need to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
The pledge authors project that with expanded local action, combined with a comprehensive national strategy that includes clean energy legislation and policies to complete the phaseout of coal, the United States could reduce its emissions 49 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
Left unsaid in the report, but explicitly noted by Mr. Bloomberg in a touch of electioneering, was that such national action would require an administration that prioritizes climate change.
"Beating climate change won't require a miracle, it won't require limitless resources," Mr. Bloomberg said. "It will require leadership and common sense."
Under the rules of the Paris Agreement, the United States will remain a party to the accord until Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the presidential election.

Texto completo: I usually do not write reviews of plays or movies while I am still trying to process them. However, in the case of "Queen & Slim," I feel compelled to put words on the page to help me process the visually stunning work of art I recently experienced.
Most people were first introduced to the film by the incredibly stunning poster for the movie. Andre Wagner shot this haunting and inviting photograph, which sets the tone and excitement for the film to come. For those of you not familiar with Wagner's work, get on it. You may recognize his iconic signature black and white photographs in The New York Times, where he captures the essence of Black life in New York City and most recently in communities across the United States. The black and white picture of the two main characters sitting on a 1970s car is just short of breathtaking. The male lead is wearing a velour track suit and the female lead is wearing a zebra style mini dress and snake skin boots. The outfits are captivating, but what is spellbinding is the chemistry-the fear, love, isolation, resilience, and courage-captured in just one shot of two people sitting on a car.
There have been several pieces written and debates waged about the relationship of the two main characters, the idea of a modern day underground railroad, the debates surrounding policing of Black communities, and whether the movie is visually stunning without substance to back it up. Without giving too much away, I will say the reintroduction of Bokeem Woodbine as Uncle Earl may have been one of my favorite aspects of the film. Woodbine's character runs a house of ill repute in Louisiana, but more importantly, Uncle Earl is a veteran. He has seen things, he has done bad things, and he continues to grapple with his demons, many of which were birthed during his time in the military, when he was property of the U.S. government.
As Queen and Slim travel throughout the U.S. south and pass fields of horses, dilapidated houses, incarcerated prisoners picking in the fields, and the overall stunning environmental beauty that comprises this nation, I found myself constantly thinking of Uncle Earl and his journey, his personal prison, his fears, his courage, and his reliance on his own underworld to survive. There are so many veterans who have returned home and are expected to forget what they have seen, possibly what they have done, and incorporate themselves seamlessly back into society. In so many ways, "Queen & Slim" was an acknowledgment of our veterans and the various ways they attempt to become whole once they return home.
This film is worth seeing for the simple fact that this vast nation, and all of the people in it, have a story to tell, we just need to listen.

Texto completo: El Comité Judicial de la Cámara de Representantes se reunió este miércoles a las siete de la tarde (hora del este) para argumentar a favor o en contra de el juicio político contra Donald Trump y proponer modificaciones a los cargos de los que se acusa al presidente. Pero el horario de este encuentro en el Congreso, que podría acabar después de media noche, tiene a muchos desconcertados.
Esta sesión nocturna forma parte de una reunión de varios días en la que los 41 miembros del Comité Judicial debaten, enmiendan y votan los cargos del juicio político que han propuesto los demócratas. En la mañana del jueves, el comité se volverá a reunir para y se espera que durante la tarde apruebe los cargos y los envíe a la Cámara de Representantes para su votación.
Los 24 demócratas y 17 republicanos que se reúnen la noche de este miércoles tendrán cinco minutos para hacer sus declaraciones de apertura, algo que les podría llevar varias horas. El plan de los demócratas para el día siguiente es, según publica The New York Times, pasar realmente al trabajo de modificación de las acusaciones con propuestas y enmiendas que pueden llevar a cambios importantes o a alteraciones menores. En principio, no se esperan grandes giros.
The Times explica que en este proceso legislativo, conocido como markup (anotaciones), los republicanos pueden quejarse incluso sin cambiar los artículos. ¿Cómo? Proponiendo gran cantidad de mociones que obliguen al comité a votar y que, por tanto, demoren los procedimientos . En cualquier caso, dichas enmiendas serán simbólicas para demostrar a los votantes de Trump que los republicanos están luchando contra el juicio político.
En estas reuniones no habrá testigos. Solo estarán presentes los miembros del comité aunque puede haber aportaciones puntuales de los abogados y de otros asistentes.

Texto completo: The stabbing death of a college student at a park just one block from Columbia University has stunned the New York institution's community.
Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old freshman at Barnard College who hailed from Virginia, was fatally stabbed at Manhattan’s Morningside Park during a Wednesday evening attack, authorities said. Barnard is a liberal arts all-women college that’s part of Columbia.
“With broken hearts, we share tragic news about the death of one of our students,” Barnard President Sian Leah Beilock said late Wednesday in a letter to the campus. “This is an unthinkable tragedy that has shaken us to our core. ”
Police said around 7 p. m. they responded to a call reporting an assault at the park and found an unconscious woman with multiple stab wounds. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.
There have been no arrests. Police Chief Rodney Harrison said Thursday two minors were questioned -- they were later released -- and a knife has been recovered, though it's not clear whether it was the one used in the killing.
The initial police report set the timeline of the call at 5:30 p. m. Harrison said it was shortly before 7 p. m.
Harrison said there were between one and three assailants involved in the attack, which he described as "a despicable crime,'' and added: "It’s all hands on deck and we’re going to do a thorough investigation and bring these people to justice. ’’
Beilock said she has notified Majors’ parents and they were heading to New York from their home in Charlottesville, Virginia. The victim's father, Inman Majors, is the author of six novels and an English professor at James Madison University.
“We lost a very special, very talented, and very well-loved young woman,” the family said in a statement. “Tess shone bright in this world, and our hearts will never be the same. ”
Several photos in Majors’ Instagram page show her playing guitar and singing in a band called Patient 0, which in September released a nine-song album called “Girl Problems. ’’ She listed Courtney Love, Courtney Barnett and Kim Gordon among her musical inspirations.
Isabel Jauregui and Aja Johnson, college students walking outside campus Wednesday night, told the New York Times they had found out about the murder from a campus news alert.
Jersey shooting: Incident follows a rise in hate crimes, frightening pattern of attacks on Jewish sites
Jauregui, who attends Barnard and works for the Columbia Spectator school newspaper, said students are nervous.
“My friend is throwing up in the bathroom,’’ she told the Times. “She’s so scared. ’’
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea acknowledged there has been a recent surge of robberies perpetrated by juveniles at Morningside Park, which has long had a reputation for danger.
Shea said police have increased deployments in the area, and said city parks are much safer now than when he was growing up in the city.
"I remember when the parks of New York City were filled with broken glass. You didn’t need to cut the lawns because there was no grass,'' Shea said. "Look where we are today. The crime statistics back it up. And then you have an incident like this and it shakes you to your core. We will do everything possible to ensure that, if anything was missed, we will correct it. ’’

Texto completo: No matter where you are in your career, giving back should be part of your life plan. Here’s why these philanthropists and advisers in The Oracles believe in the importance of sharing your resources with others — and how you can give back regardless of where you are in life.
1. Giving and uplifting others is a way to pay it forward.
I’ve always been passionate about giving back. In particular, I get energy from mentoring young adults from underserved communities and helping them navigate their careers. Because I’ve had incredible mentors throughout my career, this is my way of paying forward what I’ve been so generously given.
No matter where you are in your career, there are others coming up behind you — whether they’re in school, in their first jobs, or learning how to be managers. Uplifting the next generation increases workplace satisfaction, builds connections, and fosters a culture of giving. —Ebony Beckwith, Chief Philanthropy Officer at Salesforce, a $100 billion company.
2. Giving re-energizes you and makes you better.
Since beginning philanthropy in my own life, I’ve found that when I’m away from it for a while, and in my often superficial universe, I start to feel that life lacks meaning. Engaging in philanthropic work gives you perspective and shows you what truly matters in life.
It also, consequently, makes you a better parent and truly sets an example for your children to help others who, at that moment, can’t help themselves. It connects you with others who want to help change the world, which re-energizes you.
I’ve been intrigued by the fact that the people who work the hardest to help others are the nurses, the teachers, the yoga instructors, etc. Their giving has inspired me. I appreciate how fortunate I am. Engaging in philanthropy reveals to those more fortunate who could use a boost and how you can help change lives.
After all, isn’t the whole reason we’re here and work day in and day out to make life better for others as much as, or even more than, for ourselves? —Bethenny Frankel, entrepreneur and philanthropist; founder of the Skinnygirl lifestyle brand and the charity BStrong, New York Times bestselling author, and Shark on “Shark Tank”; follow Bethenny on Twitter and Instagram.
Play it smart: Don't count on tax refunds to pay holiday bills
3. Giving reminds you to shoot for the stars.
The desire to give back is one of the greatest gifts written into the hearts of humanity. You don’t have to look far to find someone who needs a friend, advice, or shelter. God provides each of us a generous bounty, which we can all share with the world through our time, money, love, or help.
I once met an Uber driver who was looking for advice. We talked about shooting for the stars and believing in yourself. After our discussion, I gave him my $4,000 telescope to reinforce that point and remind him where to focus.
Earlier that year, I tried desperately to help find a little girl who was abducted. And for my birthday, I sponsored three children through Food for the Hungry and raised money for children with cancer.
Opportunities to give to others are all around you; so pay attention and follow your heart. —Tom Albert, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence expert, and founder and CEO of MeasuredRisk, a leading enterprise risk management company; read how Tom and his team are changing the way the world sees risk and connect with him on LinkedIn.
4. Giving helps you accomplish your own goals.
Like many entrepreneurs, I used to prioritize long-term goals I thought would make a positive difference over small acts of charity. However, chances were good that I’d never have the world-changing impact I hoped for.
The effective altruism movement changed how I spend my time and money. I still chase long-term endeavors with potential for high impact, such as designing brain-machine interfaces to increase human agency. But I now also give back regularly to charities where I know my money can make a real difference.
For example, we donate 5% of the profits from AE Studio and encourage our community to help us select the recipients each month. This habit of giving back also prevents me from losing sight of why I do what I do and makes me more likely to accomplish my goals.
Most of us can improve others’ lives substantially at almost no cost; so, why not? —Judd Rosenblatt, founder and CEO of AE Studio, an Agile web development and data science company; realistic optimist about the future of humanity, with a mission to increase human agency with technology; vote for the charity they donate to next month.
5. Giving is vital for a happy, wealthy life.
When my daughters were born, I committed to give them the same chance at a successful career as any male. So I attended the Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association (HBA) Conference to discover ways my company could create opportunities for female leaders.
My eagerness to learn turned into anxiety and self-consciousness, as I was the only white male in the room. I gained something essential from that experience: empathy for those who are always in the minority. Whether you’re donating money or time, giving promotes happiness, draws us closer to others, and strengthens empathy. These are vital for a wealthy life, which starts from the inside.
After a certain point, more income doesn’t increase well-being — but empathetically giving to others does. That’s why I contribute to causes that will change one life somewhere, so we can change lives everywhere, which is a legacy we can all create when we give. —Michael O’Brien, executive business coach and founder of Peloton Coaching and Consulting; founder of The Pace Line Leadership Academy, and author of “Shift: Creating Better Tomorrows”; connect with Michael on Facebook and LinkedIn.
6. Giving creates a culture of collaboration.
There’s a saying I love: If you want to keep it, you have to give it away. If you’ve had success in your career, it’s your obligation to give back. Take time to coach and mentor others.
Regardless of where you are in your career, everyone has something to share. We’ve all had experiences others can learn from. It could be unrelated to work, emotional advice, or a book recommendation. There are so many ways to help others improve their lives.
Sharing my experience with our real estate agents is one of the more fulfilling things I do each day.
Plus the more you help others, the more they help you. It creates tremendous loyalty and a real culture of collaboration that will ripple throughout your organization. When leadership gives back by helping their team members grow into the best versions of themselves, everyone starts helping each other. —Peter Hernandez, president of the Western Region at Douglas Elliman; founder and president of Teles Properties.
7. Giving builds consumer trust and attracts talent.
Philanthropy must be embedded in the purpose of every business and is fundamental for tackling societal issues. This also builds consumer trust and aligns employees, which ultimately improves profitability. For decades, corporations have succeeded by focusing only on the bottom line and shareholder value.
Today, customers want to know their dollars have an impact. Millennials, in particular, prioritize buying products from and working for companies that align with their values. These trends can’t be ignored.
Be skeptical of deals this winter: Don’t get your identity hustled in the holiday bustle
We’re amidst a revolution of for-profit businesses that are inextricably linked to philanthropic initiatives, with companies like TOMS shoes, Bombas, Lululemon, and Nunbelievable — our baked goods company that provides meals to those in need.
As a result, you can see the passion in our current and prospective employees, investors, suppliers, and customers.
Talented employees can choose where they work in today’s economy, and those who choose us enjoy knowing they’re helping to end hunger. —Bryan Janeczko, co-founder and CEO of Nunbelievable, executive advisor of Loeb. nyc, and founder of the free startup idea validation tool Gro X; named one of Business Insider's most powerful LGBTQ+ people in tech; connect with Bryan on LinkedIn.

In age of Trump, informational chaos

Texto completo: I took time off last week, and one of my goals was to return with something positive to say about the state of media as we approach the end of 2019. Forget about it.
Every time I turned on cable TV it was filled with talk of the latest conspiracy theory: that it was Ukraine meddling with our 2016 election in hopes of bringing down President Donald Trump. And then there was local news showing Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. "Jack" Young warning us about a white van and girls being "snatched" off the streets of Baltimore for their organs. Both narratives - false, by the way - are being put out there by officials unfiltered and unchecked.
Never in the last 100 years, going back to the beginning of radio and mass electronic communications, have Americans been so bombarded with misinformation, lies, propaganda and conspiracy theories. And never during the last century have some segments of the media - the ones that historically have been most focused on helping citizens sort through such informational chaos - been so weakened and embattled in their own struggles for survival.
It is easy, and appropriate, to blame President Trump. But the problem is even larger than the bone-deep dishonesty of his regime. There are at least three areas of unprecedented change in media and politics coming together to create this informational crisis and a rattled, confused and angry nation. The immediate question: How much worse will things get during the impeachment proceedings and election in the coming year?
The first development is centered around the Trump administration's assault on truth. Other presidents have lied in big ways: Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam and Richard Nixon on Watergate, to name two. Americans and Vietnamese died as result of the former, while the Constitution and rule of law were seriously threatened by the latter.
But neither president lied about almost everything as Mr. Trump does, with the support of his administration. Their attack on truth and facts involves deleting information on global warming from the Environmental Protection Agency and keeping investigations secret from members of Congress and the public until a counter-narrative could be constructed, spread and allowed to set in as Attorney General William Barr did with the Mueller Report.
One of the president's most dangerous games these days is using his office to pump conspiracy theories into the mainstream media ecosystem. The latest alleges that Ukraine - not Russia - is the country that meddled in our 2016 election. This is a narrative that definitely has the feel of coming straight from Mr. Putin's mouth to Mr. Trump's ear and then into mainstream media via Fox News.
That's the second major and unprecedented development that has brought us to this sorry informational state: the rise of right wing media, like Fox News, Fox Business Network, Breitbart News, Sinclair Broadcast Group, the Daily Caller and others. Some of the outlets have gone all in with the president and his supporters in Congress to promote his lies and conspiracy theories. It's a mighty echo chamber the likes of which conservatives have never known.
One of the ugliest examples of that right-wing echo chamber could be seen on Lou Dobbs' Fox Business Network show Nov. 15 when he allowed one his recurring guests, attorney Joseph diGenova, to allege that not only was Ukraine the culprit in 2016 meddling, but American businessman and philanthropist George Soros was the mastermind. Not just wild, unsubstantiated allegations, but bald-faced anti-Semitism, too.
The third development is the rise of social media and the technological shredding of large portions of the legacy press. Most of the gatekeepers are gone, and there are only a few major platforms left - like the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN - to systematically try to sort through the lies coming from the White House, Congress and right-wing media on a daily basis. They can't keep up, which allows the lying liars who lie to have a mainly open field on which to sow their conspiracy theories, propaganda and disinformation campaigns.
This is now the story of our times: Algorithm-driven social media feeding us urban-myths (like the one last week about the white van, which came from Facebook), and our political leaders spreading them further into the mainstream media and civic conversation without fact-checking.
I can't find any good news about the media in any of that.

Texto completo: Consumer knowledge is consumer power. That is why hospitals fight tooth-and-toenail against any efforts to post turnkey prices for medical procedures.
Hospitals want to maintain price opacity. If you ask a hospital what it costs to have your appendix removed, you get one of three replies: Uproarious, table-pounding laughter, thinly veiled contempt at such an ignorant question or dead silence.
In theory, health insurance companies should be staunch allies of consumers in this fight for price transparency. Unfortunately, health insurance companies are basically utilities run by bureaucrats who move paper instead of electricity. They're content to be wards of the Obamacare state.
Fortunately, the Information Iron Curtain has been under assault by at least three local efforts.
The Dallas Morning News reports Crystal Roberts was rushed to an emergency room after a car crash. Fortunately, she was home in only three hours. Unfortunately, lacking insurance, she was billed at the "This Is Gonna Hurt" rate and charged $11,037 for procedures that didn't require hospitalization.
This exemplifies the greed that typifies hospital administrators. They attempt to charge the highest prices to people who have already demonstrated they are either broke or idiots because they don't have health insurance in the first place.
It's literally adding insult to injury.
Crystal found a personal injury lawyer working on commission and sued the hospital. The state supreme court, bless its heart, ruled if the hospital intends to prove its $11,000 walletectomy is "reasonable" it must "share ... details about the discounted rates it had with health insurers."
That's real progress, but the danger is the rats will see their hospital ship is sinking and settle out of court without releasing the prices.
The Maryland Health Care Commission is our second example. It published a limited list of turnkey prices for medical procedures. Limited because the prices cover operations on women or the elderly or elderly women. But it's a start. The numbers cover 21 different hospitals in the state and along with prices the percentages of medical errors are also posted.
Finally, the private sector has done its part. Kaiser Health News covered the North American Specialty Hospital company that offers its business clients a program where employees leave the country for less expensive surgery.
Donna Ferguson had a knee-replacement done in Mexico by a surgeon from the Mayo Clinic. You're no doubt thinking, yeah Mexico this year but it'll be Somalia in 2020 if greedy capitalists can save a dime. Our suspicion is misplaced. Donna had the option of staying in Mississippi. What made the difference was the $5,000 check she received from her employer for agreeing to the lower-priced package.
Now the Trump administration has joined the fight. If you doubt the importance of access to pricing information, the response of hospitals to the Trump administration's Hospital Price Transparency Rule makes my point eloquently. They sued to block implementation. That's because if it were up to hospital administrators, patients wouldn't be able to find out what it costs to park until they tried to exit the garage.
The New York Times explains, "The nation's hospital groups sued the Trump administration over a new federal rule that would require them to disclose the discounted prices they give insurers for all sorts of procedures." Including the cash price it will accept from individual patients.
Hospital price transparency has been one of the few sustained efforts on behalf of normal people from the Trump administration. Consumers need to be heard. Call your congressman and tell him you support the Hospital Price Transparency Rule. And send an email to the Department of Human Services in support, too.

CHEVRON MOVING ON, PLANS TO LEAVE APPALACHIA DECISION COMES 8 YEARS AFTER INITIAL VENTURE

Texto completo: California-based energy company Chevron Corp. is putting its Appalachian oil and gas business up for sale, the company reported this week.
It has about 400 employees in the unit and a regional office in Coraopolis.
Chevron controls about 890,000 acres in the Marcellus and Utica shales across Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.
The Appalachian shale operations contributed to more than half of a massive impairment charge that the company revealed for the fourth quarter. That charge, which writes down the value of assets on Chevron's books, will be between $10 billion and $11 billion, the company disclosed Tuesday.
Chevron burst onto the scene in Appalachia in 2011 with a $4.3 billion acquisition of shale gas firm Atlas Energy Inc. Two years later, it paid $17 million for a stretch of land in Moon, where the company planned to build a regional headquarters.
In 2014, those plans were put on indefinite hold and never materialized. The following year, the energy giant cut more than 150 positions from its Appalachian division as natural gas prices slumped.
Still, Chevron maintained a high profile in the region, working to weave itself into its business and cultural networks.
Some leave, others double down
In leaving the region, Chevron follows other multinationals thattried out the Marcellus and Utica shale regions but moved on in favor of other projects around the globe.
Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited bought Pennsylvania Marcellus assets in 2010 only to sell them off for a third of the price in 2017.
Noble Energy Inc., a Texas-based firm that also has projects in West Africa and Israel, made a bet on Appalachia with its $3.4 billion joint venture with CNX Resources in 2011. Six years later, it sold its stake in the venture and left this region.
Royal Dutch Shell, the Dutch giant whose chemicals subsidiary is building an ethane cracker plant in Beaver County, spent $4.7 billion for Warrendale-based East Resources in 2010. For years now, its drilling activity in Pennsylvania has been pared down significantly after underwhelming results and asset sales.
Yet smaller oil and gas firms are going all in on Appalachian shales.
Southwestern Energy Co., which began as an oil and gas driller in Arkansas, sold the last of its assets there last year to focus on its Appalachian portfolio in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
Texas-based Range Resources Corp., too, pulled back on its operations in Louisiana after its ill-fated 2016 acquisition and rededicated itself to its program in Appalachia.
As did Downtown-based EQT Corp. when its dalliance with geographic diversification resulted in a $2.3 billion impairment charge - meaning the Permian Basin assets in Texas that EQT bought in 2014 and its holdings in Kentucky's Huron Shale were actually determined to be worth that much less than what the company had on the books.
The Marcellus Shale, in particular, has taken the mantle as the most productive natural gas play in the U.S., and one of the most cost-efficient.
Oil and gas price slump
Even so, the current price slump is a result of all that productivity - there is too much supply and not enough demand to soak it up.
So, with gas coming out of the ground faster than the U.S. can use it, gas producers are rushing to export their product abroad. Those closest to export terminals - most are on the Gulf Coast - have an advantage, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Last month, Bloomberg analyst Vincent Piazza predicted that the Haynesville Shale in Oklahoma would see a resurgence because of that dynamic.
The low price of oil and gas - both global commodities at this point - means companies are looking to other aspects of their portfolios to set them apart, and those with more options can get picky.
"Good isn't good enough," Chevron's CEO Michael Wirth said in an interview on CNBC's show Squawk Box this week, explaining the massive write-down of the company's Appalachian assets.
"The assets in the Northeastern U.S. simply don't compete as well for our investment dollar as others do," he said, adding, "some of our assets may work better for others."

Texto completo: American commanders have requested guidance on dealing with an attack from those armed groups and others from Iran and the Syrian government, but officials say they have received muddled direction.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's rapidly shifting strategy in northern Syria has American commanders there scrambling to protect their forces from an expected surge in actions by military units from Turkey, Russia, Iran and the Syrian government, as well as their proxy forces, according to Defense Department officials. American commanders now see these armed groups as a greater danger than the Islamic State forces they were sent to fight.
Commanders have requested guidance outlining how American forces might deal with an attack from the assortment of armed groups, including Russian-backed Syrian government forces, that have, in the past, tried to seize territory held by the United States. But they have received muddled direction from the Pentagon, two Defense Department officials said.
For now, the American command heavily relies on the instincts of junior commanders on the ground, cautionary phone calls to officials from Russia and Turkey and overhead surveillance -- susceptible to failure in poor weather -- to help avoid close encounters with other forces in the Euphrates River Valley, where most American troops are based.
"These forces are at risk without a clear understanding of what they are expected to achieve, and without the political support of their nation, if or more likely when, one of these American adversaries decided to attack them," said Jennifer Cafarella, the research director for the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. "These guys are deployed in one of the most risky, complex and rapidly evolving environments on the planet."
These concerns are the result of President Trump's order to withdraw 1,000 American troops from the country, amid Turkey's invasion of northern Syria in October. Weeks later, Mr. Trump approved the Pentagon's plan to leave roughly 500 troops behind at several outposts around the city Deir al-Zour to go after the Islamic State, often known as ISIS.
Though Mr. Trump said the American presence there is "to protect the oil," the reality is that the Americans are continuing their earlier mission of pursuing remnants of the Islamic State, military officials say. The Americans continue to operate alongside allies in the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
As American forces pulled back in early October, an American military document circulated to forces in the region, warned of the coming difficulties. "Complexity" surrounding American forces in northern Syria "has only increased in recent weeks as multiple opposing groups and actors have gradually increased their forces in surrounding areas," said the document, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The warning was part of a flurry of situation reports, maps and communiqués outlining the movements of Russian military forces around the Syrian city of Manbij and the start of Turkey's military operation along the Syria-Turkey border.
Before Turkish-backed forces entered the area in northern Syria previously held by United States troops, the American and Russian militaries were responsible for coordinating military operations in that part of the country, and had done so for three years. Both militaries had relied on a "deconfliction" phone line and a separate planning group, using a map broken down into lettered and numbered sectors, known as a keypad, for reference. This allowed officials from both countries to determine where troops were operating.
But the introduction of hundreds of Turkish-backed forces quickly strained this longstanding system, as shown by the accidental Turkish shelling close to an American outpost near the Turkey-Syria border in early October. In one of the military documents obtained by The Times, American officials wrote after that attack that they "cannot rule out" that Turkish military forces "will miscalculate U.S. force dispositions again."
Speaking to lawmakers on the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper said that the situation in northern Syria has "generally stabilized," although he cautioned that Turkish-backed fighters remained a "wild-card."
Mr. Esper added that there currently are no plans to withdraw American troops from the country. "Right now there's no disposition plans that I'm tracking," Mr. Esper said.
Turkish-backed fighters are often poorly managed by the Turkish military, said several Defense Department officials, who added that the Russian military is far more reliable in navigating the difficulties of such a contested battlefield.
To underscore the fact that the battlefield in northern Syria is continuously changing, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, the head of the military's Central Command, said in a recent interview that protecting the oil fields might ultimately draw a larger challenge from Syrian Army troops west of the Euphrates. "I'd expect at some point the regime will come forward to that ground," General McKenzie said.
But for now, General McKenzie said, the remaining American forces in northern Syria, working alongside several thousand allied militia members from the Syrian Democratic Forces, will be able to carry out "effective" counterterrorism missions against ISIS in that part of the country. Last month, the forces restarted operations against the terrorist group, after groups of ISIS fighters began operating again in the chaos created by the Turkish incursion and American retreat.
"We have enough to very capably, with our S.D.F. partners, pursue a counterterrorism platform against ISIS," General McKenzie said.
He noted that the United States maintains a strong capability for reconnaissance and combat air power to protect American forces and to carry out strike missions when necessary. "We have everything we need," General McKenzie said in the interview.
The idea that Syrian troops could move to retake ground from the Americans is nothing new.
In February 2018, about 500 Syrian troops and dozens of vehicles, backed by Russian contractors, attacked the Conoco gas plant near Deir al-Zour. American commandos there, alongside Kurdish forces and backed by waves of American aircraft, fought back, killing hundreds of the fighters.
The hourslong battle was a clear message to other fighters in the region that the Americans would protect their partner forces.
But after months of political tumult in Washington and Mr. Trump's assent to the Turkish invasion in October, it remains unclear if American forces, even with an addition of Bradley armored fighting vehicles, would stand and fight as they have in the past, the officials said.
The Bradleys, the officials added, were sent only as a signal of resolve, not necessarily to fight the Syrian government's military.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump and Attorney General William Barr took aim at the FBI on Tuesday, reiterating attacks on former bureau officials and contradicting the agency's director, Christopher Wray, a day after an independent watchdog concluded that agents were justified in opening an investigation into Russia's possible ties with the Trump campaign.
In an early Twitter post, Trump snapped at Wray for not agreeing with his interpretation of the watchdog report's findings.
“I don't know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading, but it sure wasn't the one given to me," Trump wrote on Twitter. “With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men & women working there!"
Wray had said Monday that he concurred with the Justice Department inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who found that political bias did not influence investigative decisions, directly undercutting the president's yearslong accusations.
Barr went a step further and called the findings about the origins of the inquiry “flimsy." He also repeated a longtime refrain of Trump and his allies, saying the FBI improperly used counterintelligence tools to spy on a presidential campaign.
In an interview with NBC News, Barr said there were “gross abuses" and “inexplicable behavior that is intolerable in the FBI."
In July 2016, the FBI opened the investigation after it learned a Trump campaign aide had bragged that he was told that Russia had information that could damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy. At the same time, stolen Democratic e-mails were being released. This prompted the FBI to open the inquiry, the inspector general found, not the salacious dossier of opposition research on Trump by a former British intelligence official.
Horowitz said the bureau was right to open the inquiry, but he recommended additional supervision in the future.
While there was little expectation that the inspector general's conclusions would settle the partisan debate over the legitimacy of the Russia inquiry, the president's suggestion that he lacked confidence in Wray's ability to “fix" the bureau raised the possibility that he was considering replacing Wray, which would give him his third FBI director since he took office.
The director position has a 10-year term limit devised specifically to prevent political interference.
Trump appointed Wray after he fired the previous director, James Comey, in 2017. By the time Wray became director, a special counsel had been appointed to take over the Russia investigation, and Trump was regularly lashing out at the FBI. During his first two years in office, Trump attacked the bureau, the Justice Department, and intelligence agencies 277 times.
Trump and some of his allies saw the dense report as proof that their conspiracy theories were in fact true. The president has claimed for years that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt pursued by “deep state" bureaucrats who did not support him politically. And he has been particularly critical of the FBI, calling former bureau leaders “losers."
“I think our nation was turned on its head for three years based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by a completely irresponsible press," Barr said Tuesday.
Wray has sought to avoid confrontation with Trump as he navigates the bureau through one of its most turbulent eras. He and his aides had hoped that with the release of the inspector general report, the FBI could finally move past the toxic politics of the last three years.
Standing in disagreement with the president and the attorney general, Wray will now have to decide how to lead the agency while his bosses promulgate the unsubstantiated narrative that the FBI plotted to sabotage Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.
Barr is overseeing a separate Justice Department criminal investigation into the basis of the Russia inquiry.
A federal prosecutor, John Durham, is leading that investigation and supported the attorney general's assessment of the report.
“Last month, we advised the inspector general that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened," Durham said.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that any foreign interference in American elections is “unacceptable" and warned Russia and others that the Trump administration will protect the integrity of the vote.

Texto completo: I believe I was in college when I first learned of Rosa Parks. The story, as I recall, was that on Dec. 1, 1955, a meek middle-aged woman was just too tired after a day of work to relinquish her seat on a city bus to a white man. This was the Jim Crow South in what had been the first capital of the Confederacy: Montgomery, Alabama.
The only part of that narrative that is actually true is that she did not give up her seat. It is often said that when she sat down, black people stood up. In Montgomery, they actually walked for 361 days to protest laws that required blacks to sit in the rear half of the city buses and to begin giving them up to whites as needed.
That old story was not the story, as is apparent in a new exhibit that opened at the Library of Congress last week: "Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words." When that old story was circulated, perhaps it was a convenient history in service of somebody's notion of what would inspire - or make a good fundraising pitch. Perhaps that was all that some chronicler could imagine as the story behind the resistance.
"I think it's important that we liberate Rosa Parks and liberate ourselves from the tyranny of this superficial history," Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker, has said.
That history is made to bend to the needs of an era should come as no surprise. We see it every day. In some circles Nikki Haley became a hero in 2015 when, as governor of South Carolina, she called for a removal of the Confederate flag from the state capitol. For many South Carolinians, she said, that flag was a "deeply offensive symbol of a brutally offensive past." Then many people thought that was the right response after the massacre of nine black people in a Charleston church by a Confederate-flag loving domestic terrorist. Now it seems she had said what was politically expedient. A new calculus has her offering a different spin in 2019: The flag actually represents "service, sacrifice and heritage." Its meaning, she said in an interview on a podcast, was tragically "hijacked" four years ago by that Charleston murderer.
Perhaps it is inevitable that each generation puts a stamp on the past. The power dynamics of who disseminates a history becomes key. One version of an African proverb says, "Until the story of the hunt is told by the lion, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter." We live in a time when more lions are telling more stories - and not just about black lives, but also other people who have been ignored or misportrayed in the American story.
In a pluralistic society, filled with the tired and the poor, the rich and the wise from all points of the globe, aren't there many stories to know? And shouldn't the textbooks catch up? When I learn something new, as happens often, I am reminded of the reaction of a college student visiting the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture for the first time. Overwhelmed by the eye-opening revelations on one floor after the other, she wondered aloud: "Why am I just now learning all this?"
I began learning more about Rosa Parks in 1988 when I interviewed her after she walked off the history book pages and into a New York church to urge people to register to vote. I learned about her work in the NAACP in Alabama, beginning a decade before the 1955 bus incident, and of the leadership training workshops she had attended. Intent on assuring that a committed warrior rather than tired feet would be the theme of her eventual obituary in The New York Times, I began writing it then. She died in 2005. Like many people, I learned only a couple of years ago about her courage and fortitude as the NAACP's investigator after the 1944 rape of a young black woman, Recy Taylor, in Abbeville, Alabama.
The sanitized version of her story now gradually cast aside, we get a grown folks' version in the multimedia exhibit at the Library of Congress. We read her words written on note paper, on stationery, even on the back of a paper bag. We hear her words as Rosa Parks tells her story and continues to call us to action.
Roar, lioness, roar.

Black voters care less about race than about nominating a winner

Texto completo: After Sen. Kamala Harris abruptly dropped out of the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, the famously inclusive party wasn't looking very inclusive anymore.
Without being too cheeky, you might say that the party that highlights diversity and equality is suffering from an embarrassment of wealthy white men.
Or, as Sen. Cory Booker described the irony last week, when only six people, all white, had met the party's new threshold to qualify for next week's debate in Los Angeles, the stage on Dec. 19 is likely to have "more billionaires than black people."
"What message is that sending -- that we heralded the most diverse field in our history," Booker told a morning crowd in Des Moines last week, "and now we're seeing people like her dropping out of this campaign?"
Yes, political correctness cuts both ways. As much as the party can boast of having more women and people of color than ever in the House after last year's midterm elections, and in their lineup of presidential candidates, it's another big challenge to hold onto that diversity.
Among top-tier candidates of color, businessman Andrew Yang qualified for the debate Tuesday, just days before this week's deadline.
Booker and former HUD Secretary Julian Castro have met the party's donor threshold, but neither has scored high enough in a single qualifying poll to make the debate, according to The New York Times debate tracker.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii scored enough in polling and fundraising to be listed as "on the cusp" as of Tuesday. Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts also appears to have entered the race too late to make the stage.
But things can change. With Harris' departure, Booker's blunt blast about billionaires appears to have given a boost to his own fundraising. He raised more than $1 million within three days of Harris dropping out on Dec. 3. The day after Harris dropped out was his best online fundraising day, his campaign announced, and more than half of the surge came from first-time donors.
Of course, I already can see moans and groans in social networks about "identity politics," as if that were a new thing in politics. In fact, women and people of color have seen identity politics played against them for so long that one can hardly blame them for using it to push back, especially in a campaign to unseat President Donald Trump, who often has fashioned a tribe based on conservative grievances.
That's legitimate, in my humble opinion, but it doesn't substitute for a clear theme and purpose to one's campaign. Harris lost momentum on both counts. After her strong performance in the first debate with her takedown of front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden's early voting record, she seemed to peak quickly, unprepared for criticism of her own record as a prosecutor.
Her campaign struggled with reported fundraising and organizational problems. But mainly she lacked what the late George H.W. Bush once called, the "vision thing."
Those questions matter as Democrats try to restore the multiracial, multiethnic coalition that carried President Barack Obama to two victories. About 4.4 million voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012 stayed home in 2016, according to exit polls by Edison Media Research. More than a third were black. So, as much as candidates should never make too much of race or gender politics, which can invite a backlash, they can't take women or people of color for granted either.
The politically awkward possibility of an all-white Democratic debate stage shows, among other new realities, that symbolism isn't as powerful as it used to be with potential voters.
It annoys some liberals when "electability" questions are raised about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example. But, for all the milestones that have been made by progressives such as Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, black Democrats in particular have been showing a persistent and resilient pull toward the familiar presence of Obama's former vice president, Biden.
That's important, even as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has gained top-tier status in Iowa polling and Warren is looking strong in New Hampshire, next door to her home state of Massachusetts.
Biden continues to lead in South Carolina, where most of the Democratic primary voters are black -- and where Buttigieg recently scored a 0% of black voters. The mayor will do better, I'm sure, especially since he has nowhere to go in that poll but up.

Texto completo: Pretrial proceedings revealed the couple's $ 230,000 monthly spending, which enabled $ 12,000 splurges for cigars and $ 7,000 for fountain pens.
The acrimonious divorce case of Rudolph W. Giuliani and his estranged wife, Judith, a battle that had played out in court and across tabloid headlines for more than a year and a half, came to an abrupt -- and harmonious -- end on Tuesday evening, according to her lawyer.
The couple have resolved all their differences and financial squabbles, according to an emailed statement from Bernard E. Clair, Mrs. Giuliani's lawyer, and they "intend to remain friends in the years to come."
The Giulianis, who had been married since 2003, were to begin their divorce trial in Manhattan early next year. The details of the settlement will remain confidential, Mr. Clair added.
One of the key stumbling blocks in the public and heated divorce battle was Mrs. Giuliani's belief that her husband, the former New York City mayor who made millions of dollars a year after leaving office, owed her far more than the $ 42,000 monthly in support he was providing her during their separation.
Mrs. Giuliani asserted that Mr. Giuliani had deliberately taken on pro bono work as President Trump's personal lawyer to claim penury in an effort to reduce future alimony payments.
The often caustic proceedings divulged their lavish lifestyle, including a $ 230,000 monthly spending habit, and their six houses and 11 country club memberships. Other extravagances included Mr. Giuliani spending $ 7,131 on fountain pens and $ 12,012 on cigars.
There were the occasional courtroom outbursts; at one hearing, Mrs. Giuliani slapped her hand on a table in protest, insisting that she did not strip bare one of their homes after the divorce papers had been served.
At another hearing, Mr. Giuliani cursed aloud when Mr. Clair mentioned the name of a woman, Maria Rose Ryan, the chief executive of a small New Hampshire hospital, with whom he has traveled abroad and subsequently took as his date to a dinner at the White House for the Australian prime minister.
"Cheap shot," Mr. Giuliani exclaimed. (In court, Mrs. Giuliani had claimed that her husband spent $ 286,532 since their divorce commenced on Ms. Ryan. Mr. Giuliani denied having an affair.)
"It's hard to be a client," Mr. Giuliani told The New York Times in an interview earlier this year. "It is much easier to be a lawyer."
That seems now a more prosaic time.
Since his divorce began last spring, Mr. Giuliani was revealed to have been the president's point man in a rogue foreign policy effort designed to dig up incriminating information on Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was hired onto the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
Impeachment hearings also pointed to Mr. Giuliani's efforts to remove the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, and his bid to force Ukraine's new government to announce criminal investigations into the Biden family. Those efforts have helped usher the president to the brink of impeachment.
And two of Mr. Giuliani's emissaries in his Ukraine efforts, Soviet-born American businessmen named Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested on charges of making illegal campaign contributions.
Now Mr. Giuliani himself is under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in the same office where four decades ago he was himself a star prosecutor.
Jeffrey R. Cohen, a divorce lawyer who has represented celebrities like Lou Reed and the singer Marc Anthony, said that the settlement was "great for her, and I think it is smart for him, he has enough problems."
"If I were Judith, I certainly would take the money and run," Mr. Cohen added. "He's got plenty of it, but who knows what his future looks like."
Even the judge handling the divorce case had wondered aloud why the Giulianis had not settled.
"It is beyond me why either party in this case would have an interest in having all of this done publicly," Justice Michael Katz told the parties when they appeared last year in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
He suggested that the couple settle privately, as doing so "would treat their relationship and marriage with more respect than divulging all our dirty laundry out for public consumption."
They seem to have listened, at last.
"The parties resolved their divorce today, along with all issues concerning support, assets and any other claims," Mr. Clair wrote. "They wish each other the best of luck in the future."

Texto completo: The recipes our readers viewed most on NYT Cooking this year.
Assembling cassoulet, proofing sourdough bread or constructing a Harry Potter Sorting Hat croquembouche are all worthwhile pursuits, but, for many people, the word "cooking" means weeknight cooking: recipes that are fast and easy without sacrificing a little excitement. Those are exactly the kind of recipes NYT Cooking readers loved most this year.
The top five recipes of the year are below. Some are innovative in method or flavor, which means you get to try something new without having to dedicate the entire weekend to it; all are just plain delicious. And be sure to take a look the full list of our 50 most popular recipes of 2019, determined by how many times readers viewed them on NYT Cooking. You'll find plenty more weeknight wonders there, but also Dorie Greenspan's Lisbon chocolate cake (No. 10). Always leave room for cake.
1. Vinegar Chicken With Crushed Olive Dressing
A reader posted a note on NYT Cooking calling this saucy, tangy sheet-pan chicken "lick-your-plate good," and many others agree. The recipe, by our columnist Alison Roman, is as simple as can be: First, roast the turmeric-dusted chicken on the sheet pan. Then use a combination of fresh garlic, parsley, crushed Castelvetrano olives and a bit of water to deglaze the pan for a quick sauce that's poured over the roasted chicken. We like it served with rice.
2. Via Carota's Insalata Verde
Samin Nosrat, a columnist for The New York Times Magazine and the author of "Salt Fat Acid Heat," adapted this green salad from Via Carota, a charming Italian restaurant in the West Village of Manhattan. These aren't your typical weeknight tossed greens: The recipe calls for triple-washing five different types of lettuce. But the results are worth it. This salad is also versatile (use whatever good-quality greens you can get your hands on), and the perfectly balanced dressing keeps in the refrigerator for several days.
3. Pork Chops in Lemon-Caper Sauce
Sam Sifton, The Times's Food editor, found this 35-minute recipe for pork chops bathed in lemon juice, white wine, capers, garlic and shallots in Toni Tipton-Martin's cookbook "Jubilee: Recipes From Two Centuries of African American Cooking" (Clarkson Potter, 2019). He called it "a dish of smothered pork chops, essentially, made into something glorious and elegant." Readers went crazy for it -- especially when they discovered it works just as well with boneless chicken breasts.
4. Huli Huli Chicken
In 1955, Ernest Morgado, a Honolulu businessman, served a group of farmers grilled chicken that had been marinated in teriyaki-style sauce. It was a hit, and Mr. Morgado started selling it with the name "huli huli." (Huli means "turn" in Hawaiian, referring to how the chicken is flipped during cooking.) This recipe, adapted from "Aloha Kitchen: Recipes From Hawai'i" by Alana Kysar (Ten Speed, 2019), starts with marinating bone-in chicken in ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, garlic and ginger, then grilling. But readers found that the recipe also works well with boneless thighs, and that those without grills can roast it in the oven.
5. Creamy Chickpea Pasta With Spinach and Rosemary
Readers clamored for chickpea recipes this year, and this hearty vegetarian pasta dish by Alexa Weibel, an editor at NYT Cooking, did not disappoint. It comes together in about a half-hour with just a handful of ingredients: chickpeas, pasta, heavy cream, garlic, shallots and spinach. Browning the chickpeas first, removing half of them from the skillet, and then letting the rest break down to thicken the sauce yields a delightfully creamy-crispy dish that's very difficult to stop eating.

Texto completo: The New York State attorney general has issued a new subpoena to the National Rifle Association, deepening her eight-month investigation and providing fresh clues about where it is headed, according to people with knowledge of the document.
The subpoena, which was described to The New York Times, was issued last week and covers at least four areas, including campaign finance, payments made to board members and tax compliance. Because the N.R.A. is chartered in New York and the office of the attorney general, Letitia James, has a range of enforcement options, the investigation has alarmed N.R.A. officials already grappling with infighting and litigation. The same office brought a case last year that led to the shuttering of President Trump's foundation.
Among the documents sought by the subpoena are records related to transfers among N.R.A.-controlled entities, including the N.R.A. Foundation, an affiliated charity. Recent tax filings show that the N.R.A. diverted $ 36 million last year from the foundation in various ways, far more than ever before, raising concerns among tax experts. The transfers came as the N.R.A. experienced financial strains and challenges from gun-control groups, which outspent the organization in the 2018 midterm elections. An earlier analysis by The Times found that the foundation had transferred more than $ 200 million to the N.R.A. between 2010 and 2017.
While both the N.R.A. and its foundation are tax-exempt, only donations to the foundation are tax-deductible. Tax experts say the foundation has become a back door for tax-deductible donations to the N.R.A. itself. Karl Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, where the N.R.A. Foundation is chartered, is also investigating.
"This should raise, and should have raised, red flags," said Norman I. Silber, a law professor at Hofstra University and a senior research scholar at Yale. Last year, the N.R.A. also changed how it accounted for money flowing from the foundation, reporting that a far greater proportion than in previous years had gone toward staffing costs.
"I don't know how many more rabbits they can pull out of the hat from that foundation," said David Nelson, a retired tax partner at Ernst & Young who has specialized in charities.
Both the N.R.A. and the New York attorney general's office declined to comment.
The subpoena also seeks documents related to internal communications about the N.R.A.'s filings to the Federal Election Commission, as well as communications related to two intertwined political consulting firms, Starboard Strategic and OnMessage. A complaint filed to the F.E.C. by Giffords, a gun-control group, alleged that the N.R.A. had paid millions to Starboard as a way to direct money to Republican candidates advised by OnMessage, circumventing laws restricting how much groups like the N.R.A. can donate to political campaigns. Giffords, which subsequently sued the F.E.C. for failing to act, has alleged that Starboard and OnMessage are "functionally indistinguishable."
Allegations about Starboard and OnMessage surfaced last year in reporting by The Trace, a nonprofit website funded by Everytown for Gun Safety, a group co-founded by Michael Bloomberg, the presidential candidate who has donated tens of millions of dollars to gun-control groups.
The subpoena also seeks documents related to the N.R.A.'s filings to the Internal Revenue Service. Gun-control groups are also challenging the N.R.A.'s tax-exempt status in court; earlier this year, Everytown for Gun Safety complained to the I.R.S. about the N.R.A.
Revelations in court documents that the gun-rights group was running several million dollars' worth of expenses through its former advertising firm, Ackerman McQueen, and then reimbursing the firm, have raised questions about its compliance and reporting practices. Ackerman, which is involved in multiple lawsuits with the N.R.A., has said in court filings that Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the N.R.A., is using the firm as a scapegoat to "deflect attention from his own wrongdoing."
The N.R.A. has accused Ackerman of fraud and overbilling, and said its expenses were tied to official business. But it also began an internal audit last year aimed at shoring up its practices.
The new subpoena also seeks information related to hiring decisions and financial compensation for directors. Payments to the N.R.A.'s 76-member board have drawn scrutiny. Among the most recent: Last year, the N.R.A. paid the actor Tom Selleck, a longtime board member, $ 476,000 for collectible guns that it plans to resell or use for fund-raising efforts.

Texto completo: Monday's congressional hearing and the inspector general's report tell a similar story.
When it comes to Donald Trump and Russia, everything is connected.
That's the most important lesson from the two big events that played out Monday on Capitol Hill -- the House Judiciary Committee's hearings on President Trump's impeachment and the release of the report on the origins of the F.B.I.'s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
One of these involved the 2016 election. The other involves the 2020 election. Both tell versions of the same story: Mr. Trump depends on, and welcomes, Russian interference to help him win the presidency. That was bad enough when he did it in 2016, openly calling for Russia to hack into his opponent's emails -- which Russians tried to do that same day. But he was only a candidate then. Now that Mr. Trump is president, he is wielding the immense powers of his office to achieve the same end.
That is precisely the type of abuse of power that the founders were most concerned about when they created the impeachment power, and it's why Democratic leaders in the House are pressing ahead with such urgency on their inquiry. They are trying to ensure that the 2020 election, now less than a year away, is not corrupted by the president of the United States, acting in league with a foreign power. "The integrity of our next election is at stake," said Representative Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "Nothing could be more urgent."
On Monday morning, lawyers for the Democrats on the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees presented the clearest and most comprehensive narrative yet of President Trump's monthslong shakedown of the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for Mr. Trump's personal political benefit. They explained in methodical detail how the president withheld a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in crucial, congressionally authorized military aid to Ukraine, all in an effort to get Mr. Zelensky to announce two investigations -- one into Mr. Trump's political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, and another into Ukraine's supposed interference in the 2016 election.
Who would benefit from these announcements? Mr. Trump, who believes his re-election prospects are threatened most by Mr. Biden, and Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, who has been working for years to make Ukraine the fall guy for his own interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Putin has not fooled serious people, like those in the American intelligence community who determined that his government alone was responsible for meddling on Mr. Trump's behalf. But he has fooled Republicans in Congress, who have degraded themselves and their offices by faithfully parroting Mr. Putin's propaganda in the mainstream press.
House Republicans continued to do their best to obfuscate and misdirect, as they have done throughout the impeachment process. From the start of Monday's hearing, they yelled and objected -- an understandable strategy for people whose most honest defense of the president's actions has been: "Yeah, he did it. So what?" But this was not a performance for the history books; it was for the president himself, who registers only who is defending him and with how much fist-pounding rage.
The upshot is that Republicans, who once claimed to be the party of patriots and national security devotees, are on the record as having no problem with an American president using hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in an effort to induce foreign leaders to interfere in an election on his behalf. (Unless that president were a Democrat, of course.)
The emptiness of the Republicans' case was exemplified in an interruption by Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who stopped the morning's proceedings after Barry Berke, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic counsel, testified that President Trump had committed impeachable acts. "The witness has used language which impugns the motives of the president and suggests he's disloyal to his country, and those words should be stricken from the record and taken down," Mr. Johnson said. He was referring to a House rule that applies only to members of Congress, not witnesses. But consider the message he was sending: In the face of the most damning facts brought forward about a president in more than a generation, Mr. Johnson's instinct was to say, in effect, How dare you speak the truth about our dear leader?
Speaking the truth, or accepting it when they hear it, is a skill that has become increasingly foreign to Republicans. Which brings us to the other big news of the day: the release of the 434-page report by the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, into the basis for the F.B.I.'s investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. The evidence for these ties -- like the evidence that Mr. Trump sought a bribe from the Ukrainian president -- is indisputable. So Republicans have instead attacked the investigation itself, claiming that it was the fruit of illegal actions by Trump-hating F.B.I. agents.
Mr. Horowitz shot down that theory. The investigation was based on sufficient evidence of an ongoing national security threat, he found, and there was no evidence it was infected by anti-Trump political bias. In fact, Mr. Horowitz turned up evidence of agents who supported Mr. Trump. One wrote to another that he was "so elated with the election," later explaining to the inspector general that he had opposed Hillary Clinton and "didn't want a criminal to be in the White House."
Still, Mr. Horowitz harshly criticized the F.B.I. over what he called "many basic and fundamental errors" it made during the investigation, including mistakes or omissions in important paperwork that "made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case."
These are serious and in some cases alarming missteps and would be a concern in any case, let alone in one targeting people closely associated with a presidential campaign. But don't be lulled into thinking Republicans care about surveillance overreach -- just as they don't care about Hillary Clinton's emails or Joe Biden's son. They're simply casting about for anything that will protect their president from the scrutiny that he has invited upon himself since long before he was elected.
For his part, Mr. Trump claimed that the report was "everything that a lot of people thought it would be, except far worse."
This sort of brazen misrepresentation of facts is par for Mr. Trump's course, and while it is sadly effective, it shouldn't distract Americans from the emergency at hand: Whether Mr. Trump played footsie with Russians to win in 2016 or strong-armed a vulnerable new leader who is at war with Russia to win in 2020, he did exactly what the nation's framers feared an unprincipled, power-hungry executive might do to hold onto his office. That's why they put the impeachment power in the Constitution, and it's why lawmakers who care about the Republic and its survival must use it.

Texto completo: Two pro-choice activists object to a portrayal of the movement as fractured and complacent.
To the Editor:
Re "A Fractured Coalition Loses Ground on Abortion" (front page, Dec. 2):
When it comes to abortion rights, it is inaccurate to blame a divided left for the current status of legal abortion in this country.
The abortion rights movement -- made up of abortion providers, advocates, researchers, activists and patients -- is not fractured. Like any family, we are made up of people who see the issues through their own lenses, have their own priorities and approaches, and, of course, occasionally disagree. This is nothing to lament. To be a strong movement, we need diverse voices, and we embrace that diversity.
As a movement we are fighting against entrenched misogyny and systemic racism, which are far more to blame for abortion restrictions and assaults on access than any alleged movement division. We are fighting against a nationwide politics of hate and wanton disregard for the needs of real people facing real issues -- a politics more interested in scoring points than solving problems.
The challenges we face in this pivotal moment only strengthen our resolve and our cohesion.
Katherine Ragsdale

The writer, an Episcopal priest, is president and chief executive of the National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers.
To the Editor:
I agree that the clinics that offer abortions in embattled states are at the center of a perfect storm of opposition from the religious right. They deserve all of our support for the critical and brave care they provide. But the portrait of national abortion rights organizations as having become complacent, especially during the Obama presidency, does not at all jibe with my years of experience working for such organizations.
Under Barack Obama, these organizations were working around the clock to ensure that women's reproductive health care was included within a national insurance program, but faced Republicans in Congress who opposed us at every turn.
When abortion coverage was out of the question, we strategically worked to include contraceptive coverage in regulations implementing the law. On the state level, we were (and still are) challenging restrictive laws passed by Republican-controlled legislatures and signed by Republican governors.
The struggle to protect Roe v. Wade started the day that it was decided by the Supreme Court and has not stopped throughout many presidencies. The price of liberty is indeed eternal vigilance.
Ellen Sweet
New York
The writer is a former vice president of Physicians for Reproductive Health and a former communications director of the Center for Reproductive Rights.
To the Editor:
The polarization of views on abortion leaves pro-choice Louisiana Democrats like ourselves feeling marginalized. Derided by the religious right for being pro-choice, we (and our governor) are spurned by progressive Democrats for not passing the litmus test of absolute support of abortion.
Like all tumultuous moments in history, ours is a time in which the center has collapsed. In this heated debate, both sides have an obligation to recognize a woman's complex feelings during the trauma of an unwanted pregnancy, and respond with compassion.
Instead of posturing to their base, Democrats and Republicans should focus on supporting women's needs, both by preserving Roe v. Wade and also by aggressively legislating for sex education, contraception, prenatal and child care, paid leave, adoption and equal pay for equal work.

To acknowledge Ukraine’s 2016 interference is not to deny Russia’s

Texto completo: Democrats and most of the national media are acting in bad faith in the impeachment fix. If they were forthright, they’d be able to hear the words “Ukraine” and “2016” in the same sentence without locking up in a seizure.
Even some Republicans feel queasy addressing the subject, presumably because they’re wary of being called conspiracy theorists, despite it being a well-documented fact that Ukraine was all over 2016.
During a wide-ranging interview with the Washington Examiner on Monday, I asked GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas if he believed President Trump had a legitimate reason to ask the newly elected leader of Ukraine to investigate the extent of his country’s involvement in our election. Hurd replied by doing what Democrats and the media do: He started talking about Russia.
“The concern that I have is trying to say that Ukrainian activity and Russian activity are equal,” he said. Of course, most people who bring up Ukraine are not trying to say that.
He went on, “They are not, right? And so while there were players within the Ukrainian government [who were critics of Trump], to assume in any way that it’s on the same scale as what the Russians did on the 2016 election ...”
No one is assuming that.
To acknowledge that Ukraine did meddle in our election is not to deny that Russia did anything. We know what Russia did. That story has been told a billion times.
It’s the Ukraine story that most people still don’t know and that the national media have tried to memory hole once Trump showed interest.
Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, testified last month that in a conversation with Trump earlier this year about Ukraine, he recalled Trump saying, “They tried to take me down.”
Yes, they did.
The New York Times reported in 2016, just after Trump was officially nominated by Republicans, that Ukraine’s "newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau," which worked in conjunction with America's FBI, was in possession of a mysterious, handwritten diary. The document purported to show that Paul Manafort, who was serving as the head of Trump’s campaign at the time, was receiving millions of dollars in payments from one of the country's pro-Russian politicians. "Investigators assert," the Times reported, "that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials."
I’m sure all of that was by coincidence that Ukraine’s most consequential government agency suddenly came into possession of evidence against the head of a major-party U.S. presidential campaign. It was purely a matter of fate that that government agency then went to America’s most important paper to share the details. Surely none of that was a form of retaliation against Trump, who had been saying positive things about Russia, which remains actively engaged in a yearslong war with Ukraine.
Yeah, I don’t buy that it's a coincidence, and no one else should, either.
In the interview, Hurd suggested he wasn’t aware of any of it, saying that he couldn’t “support or dispute” the fact that a government agency in Ukraine targeted the top figure in a major presidential campaign.
To be fair, why would he be? The Times itself has tried to rewrite history to fit their new narrative that Russia and only Russia thrust itself into our last presidential election.
An article in the Times last month said that the "charges" over Ukraine's election meddling originated with — where else? Russia.
The story said that "American intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election."
But what if Moscow is responsible for Moscow's hacking, and Ukraine is responsible for Ukraine's meddling? Isn't that a possibility?
If all the business about Manafort and Ukraine is nothing more than a Russia-backed fantasy, why is Manafort in prison right now?
Ukraine did interfere in the election. It’s okay to say that without having to apologize or immediately changing the subject to Russia.

Texto completo: Before I succumb to the holiday spirit, I'm having an Ebenezer Scrooge moment.
Americans gripe about how immigrants want handouts, but the folks that I most often see panhandling appear to be native-born. They stand at intersections and hold up signs that read: "Will work for food."
I think to myself: "That's a coincidence. I do work for food."
In fact, I work 60 hours and seven days a week for food - to feed myself, my wife and our three kids.
Lately, I've been reading a lot about how America's colleges and universities are full of starving students.
Typical is an article that ran in The New York Times in May that featured college seniors who dream about being able to start their day with breakfast, or wind up so delirious from hunger that they wander aimlessly, or take "poverty naps" rather than think about how hungry they are. It's called "food insecurity."
The story cited a Temple University survey that found that 45% of students from more than 100 institutions said they had been food insecure in the past 30 days.
About this, we should be immensely concerned. And, if you are, that makes you a good person. On the other hand, if you are not, you're a heartless ogre who deserves to be hunted by villagers carrying torches and pitchforks.
Since I have, in my more than three decades in the business, known more columnists who fit into the second category than into the first, I feel confident in proceeding with a dab of skepticism.
For instance, we should note upfront that these citadels of higher learning are, by definition, places of privilege - because, while a high school diploma may not get you far in a global economy, a college degree is not what Thomas Jefferson conceived of as an unalienable right.
It does seem as if every generation feels as if it is going through something truly awful that no other generation has ever had to endure.
Right. You don't suppose the members of the World War II generation who grew up during the Great Depression knew anything about hunger pangs?
We were all starving students - from baby boomers to Generation X to millennials. We all smuggled apples, cookies and cereal boxes back to our dorm rooms from the dining hall, or lived on ramen as we plowed through unpaid summer internships that would supposedly pay off in the future.
I spent a summer in New York before my senior year, where - after paying rent - I lived on $10 a day and walked home from work 60 blocks in awful humidity rather than surrender the lone subway token in my pocket.
OK, Gen X'er. That's different. Those were rites of passage. For members of so-called "Generation Z" or "iGen," empty stomachs are suddenly a matter of life and death.
I'm reminded of a funny line from the 1990s television show "Ally McBeal," where the lead character - a narcissistic young lawyer in Boston - is asked: "What makes your problems so much bigger than everybody else's?" Ally responds matter-of-factly: "They're mine."
Nonetheless, we are told by the media that the latest batch of starving students have it worse than anyone else has ever had it in the history of higher education. Paying exorbitant tuitions, and forced to choose between buying books or food, many students may fail out because they're famished.
Many colleges and universities now have on-campus food pantries where hungry students can drop in for a snack between classes.
That's a great idea, and a much-preferred alternative to proposed federal legislation to pay off student debt or make college free for everyone.
Still, these stories about campus starvation have left me hungry for three things that they lack: context, honesty and common sense.
It seems to me that college students who feel food insecure might think about getting a part-time job like many of us had while we were in school. Maybe they could work in the dining hall or a nearby restaurant and eat for free. Or maybe they could move back home, commute to a nearby college, and let mom and dad feed them. Or maybe they could use some of their textbook money to buy food, and check out the books they need from the library.
I mean, if it's not too much of an inconvenience.
The first thing they need to do is grow up. Life is hard. But it doesn't have to be this complicated.
Bah humbug!

Texto completo: Less than a month ago, Juice Wrld stood onstage in a parking lot at Dodger Stadium and performed his song "Legends" in front of an audience numbering in the tens of thousands.
The gifted young hip-hop artist from Chicago -- a marquee act at November's annual Camp Flog Gnaw festival -- wrote the mournful yet cathartic track as a tribute to Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, a pair of contemporaries who'd tragically died not long before. But in the months after the release of "Legends" last year, two more rappers -- Mac Miller and Nipsey Hussle -- died way, way, way before their time. So as Juice Wrld did the song at Dodger Stadium, his teenage and twentysomething fans singing along with every word, black-and-white video footage of all four artists flashed across a giant screen behind him.
"Flog Gnaw, make some noise for our legends," he told the crowd, and that "our" was instructive: Although these artists may not have achieved the household-name status of a Kanye West or Kendrick Lamar, the connections they made with their followers -- through their music and through the modern confessional booth that is social media -- were uncommonly intimate. To their fans, as Juice Wrld understood, each man's passing represented a death in the family.

Now this thoughtful eulogizer is himself the subject of homage. Juice Wrld, whose real name was Jarad Higgins, died Sunday morning at age 21 after he reportedly suffered a seizure at Chicago's Midway airport. The Cook County medical examiner's office in Illinois confirmed his death but didn't specify a cause, pending an autopsy set for Monday.
Juice Wrld, who was scheduled to perform at next weekend's Rolling Loud festival in Los Angeles, was part of a wave of young singer-rappers to emerge in recent years from the do-it-yourself streaming platform SoundCloud. Working in the wake of superstars like Drake and Post Malone, whose emotional, highly melodic hip-hop has served as pop's dominant sound in the 2010s, Juice Wrld began posting songs, some of which he'd recorded on his phone, while he was still in high school. But the music industry was quick to capitalize on his grassroots success: Interscope signed the artist last year when he was 19, then gave a major-label push to "Lucid Dreams," a moody breakup song built on an unlikely yet effective sample of Sting's "Shape of My Heart" that had already racked up millions of plays online. "Lucid Dreams" went on to reach No. 2 on the Hot 100 and helped drive Juice Wrld's debut studio album, 2018's "Goodbye & Good Riddance," to platinum certification; this past March, his follow-up LP, "Death Race for Love," debuted atop Billboard's album chart.
As with Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, listeners were responding in part to Juice Wrld's frankly personal lyrics about depression and drug abuse, which went well beyond Drake's celebrity blues (to say nothing of the chest-beating of an earlier generation) at a moment when Gen Z rappers had begun making hip-hop a center of the cultural conversation regarding mental health.
"Thinking of you in my bed / You were my everything," he sang in "Lucid Dreams," his eager yelp edged with desperation, "Thoughts of a wedding ring / Now I'm just better off dead." Another song, "All Girls Are the Same," had him complaining of "demons in my brain," while in "No Bystanders," a track from Travis Scott's smash "Astroworld" album, he rhymed "the party never ends" with "laying with my sins." Then there was "Legends," in which he predicted his demise with troubling accuracy: "What's the 27 Club? / We ain't making it past 21." (His birthday was Dec. 2.)
Like other SoundCloud rappers, Juice Wrld talked openly about his struggles with addiction. Speaking to a New York magazine reporter this year, he mused about the effect of having been prescribed Ritalin as a fifth grader, though he acknowledged he used recreationally as well.
"I would like to see all the younger talent live longer and I hate waking up hearing another story filled with blessings was cut short," Drake wrote Sunday on Instagram in an apparent reference to Juice Wrld along with Lil Peep and Miller, both of whom died of overdoses, and XXXTentacion and Hussle, both of whom were victims of homicide.
In an interview with the New York Times in April, Juice Wrld said he wrote about death because most people were "too scared" to touch on the subject -- which, in spite of the adoration he clearly inspired, isn't to say that his music always had a heroic quality. As the title of "All Girls Are the Same" suggests, Juice Wrld in his songs about heartbreak could be sadly one-dimensional in his depiction of women; to watch so many young men at Camp Flog Gnaw chant along with him about being "a jealous boy" was to feel some measure of worry about tomorrow's husbands and fathers.
Yet as raw as the feelings in his music were, Juice Wrld was also a skilled record-maker, one whose clever use of that Sting sample led the veteran English rock star to call "Lucid Dreams" a "beautiful interpretation that is faithful to the original song's form." Another artist considerably older than Juice Wrld, the 36-year-old rapper Future, was sufficiently impressed by the up-and-comer that he recruited him for a joint 2018 mixtape.
His most distinctive strength was perhaps the seamlessness with which he incorporated his love of emo and pop-punk bands like Blink-182 and Panic! at the Disco -- his love of their sing-songy hooks and their proudly nasal vocal delivery -- into rap songs whose software-enabled creation shared virtually nothing with how rock groups typically work in the studio.
For artists raised like Juice Wrld in the streaming age, combining genres in that way hardly constitutes an act of rebellion. But few made it sound as natural as he did in songs that pointed to a generation's varied pleasures even as they evoked its collective pain.

Texto completo: Two survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp of Nazi-occupied Poland reconnected after 72 years apart.
According to the New York Times, David Wisnia and Helen "Zippi" Spitzer were both Jewish prisoners at the notoriously deadly Auschwitz camp that claimed the lives of over 1 million people, mostly Jews, throughout the Holocaust. Wisnia was 17 and Spitzer was 25 when they met and formed a romantic bond.
Both were fortunate prisoners in that they had special skills that spared them from the fates of many others who were murdered or died of starvation. Spitzer was a gifted graphic designer who worked out of a shared office, mixing dyes and painting stripes on women's uniforms. Wisnia, who was initially assigned to remove the bodies of prisoners who died by suicide, was found to be a talented singer and was often asked to perform for the guards and German SS officers.
In their unusual positions of privilege, the pair were able to rendezvous in secret locations and be intimate with one another, a rare situation in camps that were strictly separated by gender. Wisnia remembered that Spitzer had taught him a Hungarian song during their time together. As rumors of the Soviets closing in on the German Army began to spread, however, many were shipped out to other camps, sent on death marches, or killed.
Wisnia left the camp first and was able to escape a death march after striking an SS officer with a shovel and running away. He hid in a barn until he was discovered by the 101st Airborne of the U.S. Army. They gave him a gun and uniform and took him under their wing, employing him as a translator and civilian aide.
Spitzer was one of the last to leave the camps and also miraculously survived a death march by blending in with other locals fleeing the Red Army. Sometime later, she made her way to Feldafing, an all-Jewish displaced person's camp.
The couple had planned to meet in Warsaw after the war ended, but Wisnia had chosen to pursue his new life as an American, not a European refugee. After he received his U.S. Army uniform, he said, "I became 110 percent American."
Both married other people not long after the war and moved around to different parts of the world. Wisnia emigrated to the United States, landing in New York City, where his aunt and uncle lived in the Bronx. He had lost nearly all of his immediate family in the Holocaust. Spitzer and her husband Erwin Tichauer spent the majority of their lives working for humanitarian causes, which took them to Peru, Bolivia, Indonesia, Australia, and eventually the U.S. After some time in Austin, Texas, they settled in New York City.
Wisnia, who eventually settled with his wife and family in Pennsylvania, heard through a mutual acquaintance that Spitzer, now Tichauer, was living in New York. He attempted to arrange a meeting, but she did not show up. He later learned she felt it inappropriate since she was married.
Finally, in 2016, Wisnia made another attempt to contact his former lover and confidant. This time, he had an important question to ask her: Was she the reason that he survived his time at Auschwitz? Taking two of his grandchildren, Wisnia met "Zippi" at her New York home. She was bedridden and suffering from a variety of ailments but still recognized Wisnia despite their 72 years apart. "Her eyes went wide, almost like life came back to her,” Wisnia’s grandson Avi said. “It took us all aback."
Eventually, Wisnia asked the question that he had pondered for over 70 years. Had she interceded to spare him the fate of so many others at Auschwitz? Holding up five fingers, she said, "I saved you five times from bad shipment." She had another secret to share, however, that Wisnia was not expecting. "I was waiting for you," she said. She had been in Warsaw as they planned after the war. Wisnia had moved on to his dreams of being an American hero.
Wisnia, 93, lives in Pennsylvania with his memories of a lover and savior at Auschwitz. He published a memoir, One Voice, Two Lives: From Auschwitz Prisoner to 101st Airborne Trooper, in 2015. Zippi died last year at age 100. During their last meeting, she asked Wisnia to sing for her. He held her hand and sang her the Hungarian song she had taught him in the camp.

Texto completo: La llegada de Donald Trump a la Casa Blanca y su discurso en contra de la inmigración impulsó a quienes habían sido sus empleados a denunciar públicamente a su antiguo jefe . El mismo Trump que criticaba a los extranjeros que llegaban a Estados Unidos por supuestamente robar el trabajo a los nacionales o que generalizaba apuntándoles como criminales, se había aprovechado en sus propiedades de la inmigración indocumentada .
Durante el año pasado, el Washington Post habló con 48 personas que habían trabajado para Trump sin tener permiso de trabajo . La ahora primera familia había usado los servicios de esta gente en 11 instalaciones de Florida, Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y Virginia. Estos trabajadores habían pasado años -algunos incluso dos décadas- manteniendo limpios los resorts Trump y alimentando a sus invitados.
La mayoría de estos empleados indocumentados perdieron su trabajo o lo abandonaron después de que se hiciera público el escándalo laboral que los salpicaba . Sin embargo, la organización Trump -aún propiedad del presidente aunque dirigida por su hijo mayor-, asegura que no sabía si los inmigrantes tenían permiso para trabajar o no. Por su parte, la Casa Blanca desprestigió las investigaciones del diario llamándolas “basura de tabloide”.
Margarita Cruz, una de las limpiadoras de la familia presidencial, dijo que Trump preguntaba a cada inmigrante que trabajaba para él su nombre, cuánto tiempo llevaba en el lugar y si le gustaba. Tras la pequeña conversación, Trump les daba un billete de $50 o $100 dólares.
El miedo se extendió entre el personal de la organización Trump cuando su jefe llegó a la presidencia hasta que un día, Sandra Díaz y Victorina Morales -ambas en algún momento limpiadoras en Bedminster- decidieron hacerse visibles y hablaron con the Post, The New York Times y otras publicaciones. Lo hicieron, según ellas mismas explicaron, para sacar a la luz la hipocresía del presidente .
Un año después de estos contactos con la prensa, Díaz y Morales ya no trabajan para Trump y las denuncias no han tenido repercusión legal para organización Trump . Tampoco se conoce ningún caso de deportación derivado de lo que revelaron las mujeres pero, aún así, amigos y colegas las han tachado de traidoras por poner sobre la mesa un tema que afecta a la economía sumergida de EEUU. Aún así, ellas insisten en que valió la pena.

Texto completo: Sen. Ted Cruz joined the list of Republican lawmakers who have argued President Donald Trump had legitimate reasons to ask Ukraine to investigate the 2016 election because they believe that country meddled in the 2016 election.
Cruz said on NBC News' "Meet the Press" there was "considerable evidence" that "Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election," though he could only point to one op-ed from a former Ukrainian ambassador to the U. S. as proof of that interference.
Cruz said the news media has been "misleading" by acting as if only one country could have interfered when it could have been both Ukraine and Russia.
"Of course Russia interfered in our election. Nobody looking at the evidence disputes that," Cruz said. "But here's the game the media is playing. Because Russia interfered, the media pretends nobody else did. "

During the 2016 election, many Ukrainians and several officials expressed concern about then-candidate Trump's positive words for Russian President Vladimir and an interview in which he indicated he would consider recognizing Putin's military annexation of Crimea.
Host Chuck Todd told Cruz an op-ed and expressions of policy concerns were of an entirely different magnitude from Russia's interference, which former special counsel Robert Mueller's report called a "sweeping and systematic" effort in Trump's favor that included sophisticated cyberattacks and a massive social media campaign.
"You’re trying to make them both seem equal. I don't understand that," Todd said.
Despite Cruz's assertion that no one was disputing Putin's guilt, Trump has expressed doubt about Russian election meddling on several occasions. And Trump has continued to promote the same discredited theory he referenced in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which says Ukraine, and not Russia, stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign.
Last week, Todd had a heated exchange over the same issue with Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. , who also insisted "both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. "
Todd had asked Kennedy if he was concerned he had been duped as part of a Russian disinformation campaign because former National Security Council official Fiona Hill had warned lawmakers at an open hearing in the impeachment inquiry last month that the idea that Ukraine, and not Russia, was behind 2016 election interference was a "fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. "
'Parroting Russian propaganda': Hillary Clinton slams Sen. Kennedy for Ukraine claim
'I was wrong': Sen. Kennedy takes back claim that Ukraine may have been behind 2016 election email hack
Kennedy, who had retracted a previous claim that Ukraine and not Russia had been behind the DNC hack, said Hill was "entitled to her opinion," but he stood by his assertion that Ukraine intervened in other ways.
He listed several publications that he said printed articles backing up his claim, including Politico and CBS News. He included The Financial Times in his list, but that paper's U. S. national editor, Edward Luce, told MSNBC he could find no Financial Times article that fit Kennedy's description.
"The idea that Ukraine intervened in the U. S. election specifically is not something Sen. Kennedy can point to The Financial Times as supporting," Luce said.
The Democratically-controlled House is preparing articles of impeachment against Trump for allegations he used military aid as leverage to get Ukraine to open a probe into the 2016 election, as well as an investigation into an energy company with ties to former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter.
Democrats say both investigations were intended to help Trump politically, but Cruz, Kennedy and other Republicans argue Trump had legitimate concerns on both counts.
Trump took notice of the defense mounted by Cruz, thanking him in a tweet, and retweeting several other posts, headlines and clips referencing his "Meet the Press" performance.
On "Meet the Press," Todd asked Cruz about a New York Times report that said U. S. intelligence officials had briefed senators that Russia had engaged in a "yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election. "
"I have been in multiple briefings, year after year after year, about foreign interference in our election. Russia has tried to interfere in our elections. China's tried to interfere in our elections. North Korea's tried to interfere in our elections. Ukraine has tried to interfere in our elections. This is not new. 2016's not the first year they did it. And they're going to keep trying," Cruz said.
Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. , is another lawmaker who has said Russians and "also Ukrainians tried to interfere. "
But other Republican senators have rejected their colleagues' efforts to equate Russian and Ukrainian election interference.
"There’s a big difference between pulling for someone and hoping someone wins in the American election and interfering the way that Russia did," Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told the Times.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. , told Politico "it’s important to distinguish op-eds" from "the systemic effort to undermine our election systems. "
"There’s no way to compare any other efforts to what Russia did in 2016," Rubio said. "There’s nothing that compares, not even in the same universe. ”

Texto completo: PENSACOLA, Fla. – A Saudi pilot's deadly shooting rampage in a naval air station classroom here is being investigated as an act of terrorism, authorities said Sunday.
"We work, as we do with most active shooter investigations, with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism," Rachel Rojas, FBI special agent in charge, said at a news conference. But she added that the "investigation has not led us to any information that indicated any credible threat to our community. "
Rojas also said investigators were still trying to determine a motive for Friday's attack that left three service members dead and eight injured. The FBI identified the shooter as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force and student naval flight officer at the Naval Aviation Schools Command.
Alshamrani, armed with a legally purchased 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines, was shot to death by Escambia County sheriff’s deputies. Rojas said that Alshamrani was the sole shooter and that no arrests have been made in the case.
Investigators were interviewing the gunman's friends and colleagues, trying to determine whether he acted alone or was part of a network, she said. They also want to "discern if any possible ideology" prompted the attack, Rojas said.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the shooter's beliefs expressed on social media should've been vetted by both the American and Saudi militaries.
"This guy was somebody who just had a deep-seated hatred for the United States," DeSantis said at a press conference. "For us to be bringing in these foreign nationals, you have to take precautions to protect the country. "
Rojas declined to comment on reports that investigators were trying to determine why Alshamrani and three other students visited tourist sites in New York City days before the attack. She also would not confirm reports by multiple news outlets citing authorities briefed on the investigation that Alshamrani hosted a dinner party days before the carnage at which guests viewed videos of mass shootings.
Authorities were tracking a trip that the shooter made to New York with three other students in the days before the attack, a person familiar with the matter said. Based on interviews with those who made the trip, the person said, there is no indication so far that the travel was linked to anything sinister.
The trip lasted about four days. “They did touristy things,” said the person, who is not authorized to speak publicly.
It was after the group returned to Florida, the person said, that the shooter and others at a dinner gathering watched videos related to mass shootings.
The Associated Press, the first media outlet to report on the party, said one of the three students who attended later recorded video outside the building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, AP said, citing a U. S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities.
The New York Times, citing a person briefed on the investigation, said the student who recorded the video later told investigators he just happened to be in the area when the shooting broke out. The FBI said in a statement that it had obtained video taken a bystander from outside the building after the attack had begun and after first responders had arrived.
"We have interviewed that person and are analyzing the videos to determine if any details can further this investigation," the statement said.
The Navy identified the victims as Airman Mohammed Hathaim, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida; Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, of Coffee, Alabama; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.
Pensacola shooting by Saudi national: New questions for US-Saudi alliance
The murders in Florida come at an already tense time in U. S. -Saudi relations after the Saudi role in the 2018 slaying of Jamal Khashoggi, a U. S. resident and Washington Post journalist. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saudi Arabia's foreign minister "expressed his condolences and sadness" for the attack.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, said he spoke with Saudi Ambassador Reema Al-Saud, expressing "in the strongest possible terms" that the U. S. expected full Saudi cooperation in the investigation.
"This was a planned terrorist attack, and the shooter wasn’t alone," Gaetz said.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. , told Fox News he had heard reports that not all the Saudi airmen were speaking with the FBI.
"I mean, if the Saudi government is our ally and our partner, they will make sure that there is full cooperation," Scott said. "Not one airmen needs to leave this country" until the investigation is completed.
Alshamrani was one of 852 Saudi nationals in the United States training under a cooperation agreement. He was among 5,180 foreign students from 153 countries in the United States for military training. Many of those students operate U. S. military hardware that foreign governments buy from the United States.
Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had ordered a review of the Defense Department's security and vetting policies. Guns are not allowed on the base, said Navy Rear Admiral Gary Mayes, without prior approval.
Hours before the Pensacola shooting, tweets purportedly written by the suspect railed against the United States for its support of Israel and for stationing troops at bases in Saudi Arabia. Rojas declined to confirm that tweets came from the Saudi military trainee.
Rita Katz, director of the U. S. -based SITE intelligence group that tracks jihadist activity, said the now-deleted Twitter account was created in 2012 and amassed more than 2,700 tweets.
"What is important to emphasize is the preventability of the attack," Katz said. "Investigation into social media profiles must be a part of the vetting process. Current carte-blanche U. S. policies restricting travel from Muslim-majority countries are ineffective and create more fodder for ISIS and Al Qaeda campaigns. "

Texto completo: It’s time to deck the halls with updated kitchen gear, fresh cookbooks and new food products. The biggest food gifts this holiday season will undoubtedly be Instant Pots and air fryers, but the smaller stuff — a meat thermometer, a Microplane, matching mixing bowls — also would be appreciated by the cook in your life.
Here are some ideas to show those foodies that you love them and want them to eat well — or at least have fun while they are eating. Don’t forget that Faraday’s Kitchen Store and Sur La Table have gift certificates for both kitchen gear and cooking classes.
Meal kits seem like a dime a dozen these days, but an Austin-based meal kit called Lettuce (lettuce.fm) started in 2016 and features locally grown ingredients, including some from a network of backyard gardens around the city. Unlike those meal kit boxes that arrive by mail, these are delivered in zero-waste packaging; All the ingredients come in reusable plastic and glass containers, and the company picks up your food scraps when they deliver the next set of meals. Founder Yogesh Sharma has more than 1,000 recipes that are divided up by dietary preference, so you can order gluten-free, vegan, omnivore and more. The kits start at $49 for three two-serving meals, including delivery, which could be just the right gift for someone who is trying to get back into cooking at home.
CatSpring Yaupon is now selling a holiday-inspired tea blend made with locally harvested yaupon, America’s only native source of caffeine. The lightly spiced Deck the Hills yaupon tea ($12.95 for 2 ounces) has hints of both apple and pumpkin and is available online and at Central Market. (Founder Abianne Miller Falla has also written a children’s book about a raccoon called “Ralph’s Christmas Gift” that is available on their website, catspringtea.com.)
Srsly Chocolate, which is known for roasting and grinding its own cacao beans at its store in Taylor, has a holiday pop-up store in December at 4402 S. Congress Ave. At that location and a number of retailers across Austin, you can buy Srsly’s signature bean-to-bar chocolates, as well as a new product, a brownie mix ($15) that uses single-origin cacao and Barton Springs Mill grains. The pop-up is open from noon to 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays in December.
Joel Mitter and Abbey Ciolek are two entrepreneurs who are taking advantage of a new cottage law that went into effect this year that allows food companies to sell and market their products to customers online. Their company, Sweet Bean, makes deep-dish cookies that are both vegan and gluten-free, thanks to their creative use of chickpeas.
The square, Detroit-style treats ($2) are dense on the inside and crispy on the outside and come in five flavors: chocolate chip, lemon poppyseed, golden mylk, pumpkin chip and snickerdoodle. You can order them for delivery on sweetbeanatx.com.
For someone who really likes to cook but hates standing on their feet, a GelPro mat might be in order. The Austin-based company has a new line of comfort mats with a washable accent rug on top. (The rug stays in place with slip-resistant grippers in each corner.) The Ergo Comfort Rug ($59.95 to $119.95) is designed for the kitchen or bathroom, and you can browse rug patterns on gelpro.com, but the mats are also available at retailers, including Bed Bath and Beyond.
Whataburger has seriously upped its online store in the past few years. From funny kids’ shirts and baby onesies or a holiday sweater to an orange-and-white Yeti tumbler and a set of Whataburger table tents, if you have a Whataburger fan in your life, you’ll find something fun for them at shop.whataburger.com. They even have a Whataburger nutcracker ($39.99).
Salad-lovers will love Austinite Jill Visit’s new invention: Salad Sling, a terry cloth salad spinner that takes up much less space than a plastic spinner. After a shoutout in the New York Times, Visit’s bright green, four-handled, 30-inch towel ($19.99) is getting a lot of attention, but it’s only available online for now at saladsling.com.
For a limited time, Tiff’s Treats is selling cookie dough for delivery or pickup at more than 30 of its stores in Texas and beyond. Through Christmas Eve, you can buy Take & Bake cookie kits with dough for two dozen chocolate chip cookies ($35) through cookiedelivery.com.
Another local chocolatier is Christina Hedrick, the founder of CruBom Raw Chocolate. She sells both truffles and chocolate bars ($7 and $10, respectively) made with a simple mix of fair-trade cacao, cold-pressed coconut oil and local honey. She sells at local pop-up markets and at crubom.com.
For a kid who loves books and cookies, consider I See Me’s custom baking children’s book called “Baking Cookies Together.” Customers submit a cookie recipe and the names of the characters to be printed in the book, which comes in Hanukkah, Christmas and non-holiday versions. You can find more personalized books at iseeme.com.
We’re all food photographers these days, but if you’re really looking to improve your food styling and photo skills, check out Andrew Scrivani’s new food photography book, “That Photo Makes Me Hungry” ($24.95), a comprehensive how-to for making your food photos worthy of a cookbook (or Instagram).
For anyone in your life who is either indecisive or really into tarot cards, check out Food Fortunes, a deck of tarot-inspired food cards ($13.58) to help you figure out what to make for dinner tonight.
Austin maker Laura Lee Imhoff is selling homemade jams and embroidered kitchen towels ($25) through her website, Made by Laura Lee, madebylauralee.com. The kitchen towel with the state of Texas would make a particularly sweet gift for someone who loves Austin, and some of them come with a spice mix.
Easy Tiger sells a number of holiday breads, and I can’t think of a better host gift than a loaf of David Norman’s stollen ($14), a traditional German Christmas bread that is a cross between bread and cake. It’s not nearly as cloying as fruitcake, and the powdered sugar on the outside sweetens the yeasted dough on the inside.
Even if you don’t think you’re up for brewing beer or wine, Austin Homebrew Supply and SoCo Homebrew have so many fun kits for making yogurt, kombucha and even non-fermented projects, like infused alcohol or canning jam or pickles. Urban Cheesecraft makes a series of cheese-making kits, including a goat cheese kit ($29) and some dairy-free cheese kits, that my kids and I have enjoyed using this year.

Texto completo: In 1924, music critic Gilbert Seldes deemed Cole Porter the likely successor to Irving Berlin, "if he ever chooses to stop." Equally comfortable with blues, ragtime and operatic melodies, Seldes claimed, Porter added "astonishing," sophisticated, satirical lyrics.
Porter, of course, became one of the greatest American songwriters of the 20th-century. His boatload of iconic songs include "Night and Day," "Anything Goes," "You're the Top" and "I've Got You Under My Skin."
In "The Letters of Cole Porter," Cliff Eisen, a professor of music history at King's College London, and Dominic McHugh, a reader in musicology at the University of Sheffield, make available an extensive collection of his correspondence, much of it published for the first time. Because Porter's letters were brief (and the Cole Porter Trust held back material from the mid-1940s until his death in 1964), Mr. Eisen and Mr. McHugh have added primary sources (diaries, newspaper articles and reviews) and a narrative that fills in the gaps and sets the context.
Mr. Eisen and Mr. McHugh have given themselves a difficult task. A wealthy, well-traveled, high-liver, and a closeted homosexual, Cole Porter was not self-reflective. "I've been accused most of my life of being remote," he acknowledged in an interview with a reporter for The New York Times. The letters reveal Porter as a hard-working professional (who suffered chronic pain after he was thrown from a horse in 1937), and a charming host, eager to spend time with his many friends, to whom he always sent his love. He often seems superficial and self-absorbed, lonely when alone, and, perhaps, repressed.
Mr. Eisen and Mr. McHugh maintain, for example, that Porter was a voracious reader. Porter's letters, however, are silent about what he thinks about the books he's read. Other than a passing reference to his preference for Republicans, Porter is silent about American culture and politics. The volume documents Cole Porter's passionate affair with Boris Kochno, the lover of Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes, in 1925, but sheds no further light on his homosexuality.
According to the editors, Cole Porter's "depth of feeling" for Linda Thomas Porter, his wife, "is striking." It is difficult, however, to find it in his correspondence. "Linda has improved lately, but not in her essential illness," Porter informed Sam Stark in 1949, and then added, "I hate to think of you feeling miserable, all the time at Laguna. Why don't you make sense and move back to a desert climate?" "My Linda has been seriously ill for eight months" Porter told Ethel Merman. "But if anything can make her well again, it is your broadcast every Sunday night at 9:30."
Fortunately, "The Letters of Cole Porter" are filled with insights about the craft of songwriting and the business of show business in Hollywood and on Broadway. Mr. Eisen and Mr. McHugh list the new lyrics P.G. Wodehouse wrote for "You're the Top" for the London production of "Anything Goes." They tell the story of the "fabricated flap" over the origins of "Don't Fence Me In" and the incident that gave Porter the phrase "de-lovely." The editors include Porter's extensive (and hilarious) journal entries, documenting his "story" conferences with MGM executives about "Born to Dance." And a fascinating exchange between Porter and Abe Burrows about how his songs should "fit" into the musical "Can-Can."
As he entered a prolonged illness in the late 1950s, Porter stopped writing. Madeline Smith, his intensely loyal secretary, kept up his correspondence. An impacted hip fracture, an infection, and the amputation of his leg, Ms. Smith reported, were "the beginning of the end." Through it all, however, he remained "marvelous - very talkative." On Oct. 16, 1964, she sent telegrams to "let your good friends know" Cole Porter had died at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. The funeral was held in his hometown, Peru, Ind., attended (as his will stipulated) only by "relatives and close friends."
Ms. Smith was surely right to point out that Porter's death marked "the end of an Era." It is less clear, even to readers of this lengthy volume, whether the great songwriter would have appreciated her postscript: "Three great and good men have left the Waldorf [where they all maintained apartments] now: General MacArthur, Cole Porter, and Herbert Hoover."

Texto completo: FedEx Corp. navigates the sinews connecting every corner of the nation – roads, bridges, airfields and seaports.
The company has 85,000 trucks crisscrossing the nation’s interstates. Its fleet of 650 airplanes roll down runways from Atlanta to Anchorage, Alaska. Ports clogged with cargo ships feed its thriving freight-forwarding enterprise. Without all those federal investments in steel, concrete, stone and asphalt, the Atlanta-based shipper wouldn’t have a business.
When the time comes to pay for those public projects, however, FedEx does not deliver. Last year, the company paid nothing – zero – in federal income taxes.
A recent New York Times investigation found that President Donald Trump’s new tax law helped FedEx avoid income taxes in 2018 – a year after it paid $1.5 billion under the old law. Hiring, pension contributions and wages accelerated somewhat after FedEx eluded tax collectors. But the company’s top executive promised capital spending would rise. Instead, it fell. Far more money was showered on investors.
“Much of its savings have gone to reward shareholders: FedEx spent more than $2 billion on stock buybacks and dividend increases in the 2019 fiscal year, up from $1.6 billion in 2018, and more than double the amount the company spent on buybacks and dividends in fiscal year 2017,” the Times found.
The great escape from taxation has obvious results: The rest of us pick up the cost of keeping the economy moving. Or new roads and bridges never get built. Or projects live in limbo, delayed year after year, decade after decade.
Federal spending on infrastructure has been going nowhere for years, with inflation-adjusted spending falling by nearly $10 billion from 2007 to 2017. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the nation a “D+” for the overall condition of roads, bridges, transit, drinking water, wastewater, dams, ports, aviation and energy.
The nation has moved from build-and-expand on infrastructure to patch-and-prop-up, according to a 2019 report from the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Trump and Democratic congressional leaders agreed on a $2 trillion “infrastructure plan” in April. Like so many times the topic was raised in recent years, the agreement went nowhere.
The stumbling block always is the same: how to pay for it.
Not coincidentally, Trump’s tax cut – chiefly targeted to corporations and high-income families – is expected to cost the U.S. Treasury $1 trillion to $2 trillion through 2025. More, if some of the temporary tax rollbacks become permanent.
Unless FedEx and other companies pick up their fair share, the endless string of tax windfalls will slow the wheels of commerce – and “Infrastructure Week” will remain more of a punchline than a plan.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will host a "Merry Christmas" rally at Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek later this month.
"Michigan is booming thanks to President Trump, and jobs are coming back to the state," Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a press release. "President Trump is delivering on his promises, and he looks forward to celebrating those successes with the great men and women of Michigan this Christmas season."
Chairman of the Calhoun County Republican Committee Jeannie Burchfield said the local Republican party was beyond thrilled" to have Trump visit.
"Calhoun County is Trump country, for sure..." she said. "This will be a fantastic way for us to show support for the president."
Burchfield said the news about the rally was particularly exciting after having Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump campaign, speak at the committee's annual dinner on Tuesday and seeing Vice President Mike Pence in Portage on Wednesday.
"This has been a crazy, wonderful week," she said.
Calhoun County Commissioner Jake Smith, a Democrat, said he hoped other presidential candidates would make Battle Creek a campaign stop.
"The Cereal City is where it's at, and I hope the Democratic candidate will come on through, too," he said. "I'm glad Battle Creek is getting the attention."
Despite the Trump administration's claim that Michigan's economy is booming, job growth has slowed considerably since the state's rebound from the Great Recession and has been essentially flat this year, said Charles Ballard, a Michigan State University economics professor and an expert on the state's economy.
That's true for the Upper Midwest, as a whole, according to the latest federal data, he said.
"It doesn't sound to me that our economy is booming," Ballard said. "I don't think we're in a recession, but we're kind of on the edge of a recession. The number of jobs is still well below what it was at its peak in 2000."
Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the 4.8 million votes cast, but recent Sienna College / New York Times Upshot polls show him trailing Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders here in head-to-head matchups but ahead of Elizabeth Warren.
Trump has visited Michigan several times since the 2016 election, including a rally in December, 2016 in Walker and a visit to the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run in Ypsilanti in March of 2017. His last visit to the state was April 2018, when he held a rally in Macomb County's Washington Township.
The rally will be held at 7 p.m. on Dec. 18. Tickets are available online at www.donaldjtrump.com/events/ battle-creek-mi-dec-christmas-rally. They will be given out on a first-come, first served basis and are limited to two per mobile phone number.

Popcorn on bench? Waiters merely part of NBA passion

Texto completo: MIAMI - No, there is no popcorn-gate when it comes to Dion Waiters and the Miami Heat.
Rather, merely part of an NBA fascination with the kernels.
Amid Waiters' return to the Miami Heat bench during their just-completed three-game trip, the veteran guard was spotted eating popcorn alongside teammate Justise Winslow during the Heat's overtime victory over the Toronto Raptors.
The victory marked the first time Waiters spent an entire game on the bench alongside his teammates, having previously been away during a pair of Heat suspensions for "conduct detrimental to the team."
As has been the case this season, Waiters did not enter against the Raptors.
The footage in question that surfaced on social media, which was part of the Fox Sports Sun presentation, showed Waiters and Winslow munching on popcorn as the network displayed a promotional graphic.
NBA teams typically have a large bag or container of popcorn in the locker room, with players often scooping it with empty cups.
Such, according to someone familiar with that moment in Toronto, was the case Tuesday night, with Waiters then with the cup courtside, where he and Winslow took in the action as play resumed.
A New York Times story earlier this year chronicled the passion of Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry for popcorn, a passion shared by many in the NBA, which has the snack seemingly as ever-present in NBA locker rooms as Gatorade, fruit or energy bars.
"Get off the bus, walk into the locker room, put my stuff down, go straight to the popcorn table," Curry said in the piece, acknowledging, "If it's really good, I'm eating it before the game, at halftime and after."
Interestingly, in ranking popcorn around the NBA, Curry had Toronto at No. 6 on his list, with the Heat's AmericanAirlines Arena at No. 3 on his list, behind No. 1 Dallas and No. 2 Brooklyn.

Texto completo: If you are looking for the perfect gift for your most stylish friend, several new books are bound to please.

"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going:
The Art Scene and Downtown New York
in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95
"Hunks & Heroes:
Jim Moore Four Decades of Fashion at GQ"
By Jim Moore

It's not simply a look book of cool covers and celebrities but also includes Moore's commentary and shows the evolution of men's style through the decades. Classic covers include a 1980s "American Gigolo"-era Richard Gere and Kanye West, who does the forward for the 352-page book. $75
"Bill Cunningham: On the Street: Five Decades of Iconic Photography"
By The New York Times
From the 1970s until his death in 2016, New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham captured New York street style almost daily. A new book by the newspaper chronicles through his eyes not only how fashion changed over nearly 50 years, but also how people and culture changed. The book focuses heavily on style - it includes essays and contributions from Anna Wintour, Guy Trebay and others - but also on important moments, such as the 1980s New York transit strike, the rise of casual Fridays and President Barack Obama's inauguration. The 384-page book contains famous Cunningham photographs that ran in The New York Times and many never-seen-before images of how he captured life. $65

Justices Block Barr's Bid to Resume Federal Executions

Texto completo: The Trump administration had asked the justices to overturn a trial judge's ruling that blocked the first four federal executions scheduled in nearly two decades.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said on Friday that it would not allow the Trump administration to resume executions in federal death penalty cases after a 16-year hiatus. The move, which left in place a preliminary injunction from a federal judge in Washington, effectively stayed the executions of four men scheduled to be put to death in the coming weeks. The court's brief, unsigned order said it expected an appeals court to decide the inmates' challenges "with appropriate dispatch."
In a separate statement, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, said that the inmates "were convicted in federal court more than 15 years ago for exceptionally heinous murders" and that "the government has shown that it is very likely to prevail" when the case moves forward.
"Nevertheless," Justice Alito wrote, "in light of what is at stake, it would be preferable for the district court's decision to be reviewed on the merits by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit before the executions are carried out."
He wrote that he would have set a deadline for the appeals court to act.
"The court has expressed the hope that the court of appeals will proceed with 'appropriate dispatch,' and I see no reason why the court of appeals should not be able to decide this case, one way or the other, within the next 60 days," Justice Alito wrote. "The question, though important, is straightforward and has already been very ably briefed in considerable detail by both the solicitor general and by the prisoners' 17-attorney legal team."
"For these reasons," he wrote, "I would state expressly in the order issued today that the denial of the application to vacate is without prejudice to the filing of a renewed application if the injunction is still in place 60 days from now."
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department would continue to press for the executions.
"While we are disappointed with the ruling," she said in a statement, "we will argue the case on its merits in the D.C. Circuit and, if necessary, the Supreme Court. The Department of Justice is committed to upholding the rule of law and to carrying forward sentences imposed by our justice system."
Attorney General William P. Barr set off the court fight when he announced in July that the federal government would end what had amounted to a moratorium on capital punishment. Last month, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, of the Federal District Court in Washington, blocked the executions, saying the protocol the government planned to use did not comply with the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, which requires executions to be carried out "in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the sentence is imposed."
On Dec. 2, a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to stay Judge Chutkan's preliminary injunction. That same day, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in.
The central legal question in the case is whether the word "manner" in the 1994 law refers to the methods of execution authorized by the relevant states (like hanging, firing squad or lethal injection) or the protocols the states require (like the particular chemicals used in lethal injections or how a catheter is to be inserted).
In his July announcement, Mr. Barr said the federal government would replace the three-chemical cocktail it had used in earlier executions with a single chemical, pentobarbital.
Judge Chutkan wrote that using a uniform nationwide protocol was not authorized by the 1994 law. All of the relevant states permit or require executions by lethal injections, but the details of their protocols vary. That meant, Judge Chutkan wrote, that the federal protocol was at odds with the 1994 law.
In the administration's Supreme Court brief, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote that Judge Chutkan's ruling was at odds with common sense and could lead to absurd results. "A state could effectively veto a federal execution simply by making unavailable state officials or resources that are required by state law for the execution," he wrote. Even cooperative states with secret protocols, which are common, he wrote, could make federal executions impossible.
Requiring the federal government to use the three-drug cocktail would be particularly odd, Mr. Francisco wrote. The combination of chemicals -- sodium thiopental, a sedative; pancuronium bromide, a paralytic; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart -- has been blamed for botched executions and has given rise to lawsuits from death row inmates who said it could subject them to excruciating pain.
In a 2015 dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for four members of the Supreme Court, wrote that the cocktail "may well be the chemical equivalent of being burned at the stake."
Mr. Francisco wrote that Judge Chutkan's ruling "would have the perverse result of forcing the federal government to use state three-drug protocols" that the government had "concluded -- and death-row inmates have contended for the past decade -- are more likely to cause pain."
He urged the justices to let the executions proceed, noting that the inmates were "convicted of crimes of staggering brutality -- including, in each case, the murder of a child."
In response, lawyers for the inmates urged the court to let their case proceed.
"In the absence of an injunction," they wrote, "the imminent harm to the respondents is self-evident and incapable of remediation: They will be executed over the next six weeks pursuant to an unlawful protocol that they were deprived of a full opportunity to challenge on the merits. The respondents' executions would result in the government winning its appeal -- without a full briefing -- on mootness grounds."

Texto completo: If the fantasy that Democrats are all zealots were reality, the primary campaign would have turned out quite differently.
Democrats are too "woke" for their own good, or so goes the argument.
"Today's progressivism is more or less a secular form of religion with its own high standards," Matt Lewis, a conservative columnist, wrote this spring. "Eventually," he concluded, "the revolution devours its own." Bill Maher, host of HBO's Real Time, urged Democratic presidential candidates to "Get out of Woke-ville, for a day."
"Wokeness," in this rendering, is an overly rigid commitment to identity politics and social justice ideology. And in their zeal, these woke Democrats are pushing the Democratic Party away from the voters it needs to beat President Trump in 2020.
If this were actually true, you would expect real traction for the wokest candidates in the Democratic presidential race. But it's been just the opposite. The woke candidates have been the weakest, electorally speaking, and the defining attribute of the Democratic primary has been a preoccupation with the voters that put Trump in the White House.
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York centered her campaign on racial justice and the fight against sexual assault. During one debate, she identified herself as a "white woman of privilege" and promised to reach out to "white women in the suburbs who voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is." Fluent in wokeness, Gillibrand hoped to win the most progressive, social justice-minded Democrats. But she never broke away from the pack and dropped out at the end of the summer.
Beto O'Rourke, the former Representative of Texas's 16th congressional district, took a similar approach, barnstorming the country as the wokest of woke Democrats. In the wake of a shooting that killed 22 people in his hometown, El Paso, O'Rourke embraced mandatory buybacks for assault weapons, with fines for people who do not sell their weapons back to the federal government. Later, at a town hall on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, O'Rourke said he would end tax-exempt status for religious institutions that opposed same-sex marriage: "There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us." O'Rourke, like Gillibrand, hoped to win the most culturally liberal Democrats. Instead, his support shrank. He dropped out at the beginning of November.
Senator Kamala Harris of California was not as openly woke as some of her rivals -- although she did voice support for reparations -- but as the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, she embodied the "Great Awokening" of the Democratic electorate. If "post-Obama, the Democratic Party is increasingly the party of women and the 'woke', " as Perry Bacon Jr., a political analyst, argued in FiveThirtyEight just after she announced her campaign, then "Harris's biography and politics align well with where the party has moved." Harris made headway -- at first. But she wasn't able to capitalize on her early success. For most of the fall, she struggled to win over voters and raise money. This week, she left the race.
None of this is dispositive. The Democratic Party might still be too woke for its own good. But the evidence for that isn't in the primary campaign. A former vice president, Joe Biden, known for his centrist politics and blue-collar affect, leads the field. His nearest rivals, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, support social justice politics, but they've centered their campaigns on inequality and corruption.
Yes, the failure of explicitly woke campaigns is a function, in part, of moderate and conservative voters in the Democratic coalition, including African-Americans and Latinos. But if the Democratic Party is as woke as critics say, the race should be able to sustain one or two woke candidates. The fact that it can't should undermine, or at least temper, the idea of a "Great Awokening" transforming Democratic politics. At the very least, it shows that Democrats are far more concerned with beating Trump than elevating woke ideology.
With all of that said, I want to make a point about the term "woke" itself. These days, it's a term of abuse -- a shorthand for puritanical political correctness, a pejorative wielded against liberal elitism. But its origins are in African-American vernacular, where it referred to a broad awareness of anti-black oppression. The metaphor of being "awake," for example, drives Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1965 speech "Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution." Like so much other black slang, it's been borrowed and diluted and worn down, so that the original meaning has faded from view. That meaning, however, is still worthwhile.
Puritanism is not useful for politics or governing. But a broad awareness of oppression -- of the ways this country does not work for many of its citizens -- is vital. To the extent that Democrats have that awareness, they should not shy away from it.

Ioan Grillo: Trump labeling drug gangs as terrorists could backfire

Texto completo: Mexico City • In 1982, when gunmen attacked a police station in rural Peru, President Fernando Belaúnde Terry blamed guerrillas from the Shining Path and called the crime an act of “narco-terrorism — the union of the vice of narcotics with the violence of terrorism.” With that, he coined a term that fused two major nemeses of the United States — drugs and terrorism — into a single battle cry.
President Trump revived this idea in an interview last week with the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. “Are you going to designate those cartels in Mexico as terror groups and start hitting them with drones and things like that?” Mr. O’Reilly asked. “I don’t want to say what I’m going to do, but they will be designated,” Mr. Trump responded. “I have been working on that for the last 90 days.” He was referring to putting some of the cartels on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations.
Predictably, Mr. Trump’s comments were received with enthusiasm by hard-liners such as Representative Mark Green, who has called for the action in the past. “These cartels use barbaric ISIS and Al Qaeda tactics to murder and torture innocents, destabilize countries, and assassinate members of law enforcement,” he said in a tweet. And it sparked some protest south of the Rio Grande with the Mexican foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, declaring Mexico would not tolerate any “violation of its sovereignty” — meaning United States military strikes against cartels here.
The action fits comfortably into the president’s wider narrative of defending the southern border against dangerous foreign threats. But it could also lead to a series of far-reaching consequences, some of them dangerous.
The logic behind labeling drug cartels as terrorists is debatable but not outrageous. They do carry out widespread murder of innocent civilians. The massacre of nine dual Mexican and American citizens in Sonora on Nov. 4 inspired family members of the deceased to petition the White House calling for the terrorist designation.
United States legislation defines terrorism as being “politically motivated,” which some say should rule out drug traffickers, who care only about money. However, they do work with corrupt politicians, murder others and have a level of control over chunks of Mexico that could be considered political.
Designating a cartel as a terrorist organization could be used to beef up legal cases against them, as it was used against cocaine-trafficking guerrillas and paramilitaries in Colombia. But it could also be used to justify a military strike in foreign territory, as it has in places like Sudan and Pakistan.
Until recently, the specter of American troops firing shots in Mexico was seen as pure fantasy, the realm of films such as “Sicario.” But after the Sonora massacre, President Trump said in a tweet that the United States was willing to aid Mexico in “cleaning out these monsters.” Republican Senator Tom Cotton supported the idea, saying, “If Mexico can’t protect American citizens in Mexico, then we may have to take matters into our own hands.”
If American troops did storm the border to kill a few cartel members, it would not solve the problem here; there are thousands of gangsters with vast resources from trafficking drugs and a huge arsenal of weapons. But it would seriously inflame United States-Mexico relations and force President Andrés Manuel López Obrador into an excruciating position. This could undermine bilateral efforts to deal with the challenges of cartels, human smuggling and refugees.
On the flip side, terrorism laws could be used against those who play a part in the supply chain of American guns flowing to cartels, including “straw purchasers” and private sellers. Currently, some of those who break firearms laws to provide weapons to cartels get only lenient sentences including probation. But with the designation, they could be charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which can warrant up to two decades in prison. It would be interesting to watch how the gun lobby would respond if a gun seller were hit with such charges.
Refugees who flee Mexican cartel violence would also have their cases bolstered in American courts. It is difficult for Mexicans to win asylum, because they are not fleeing a military dictatorship or official war zone, and usually don’t come from a persecuted religious group. But a judge could look more favorably on cases of those who were running from designated terrorists.
One of the toughest challenges for officials would be figuring out exactly which cartels to label as terrorists and what to call them. The cartels constantly change their names and fragment, and there are now dozens of gangs and splinter groups scattered across Mexico. Many of the traffickers and gunmen are only loose affiliates, and it could provide more headaches for agents trying to prove they are a member of a specific terrorist organization.
The cartels have unleashed a torrent of bloodshed in Mexico, and Washington should take a responsibility in trying to stop the humanitarian catastrophe. But the solution lies in tackling the big structural problems: reducing the billions of dollars that Americans supply by buying drugs; reducing the flow of guns; supporting efforts in Mexico to uplift marginalized communities; and supporting efforts to build effective police forces. There is no magic bullet or simple solution. Combining the complexity of Mexico and the catastrophic war on drugs with the problematic war on terror may only make it worse.

Ruffalo mesmerizes as lawyer fighting DuPont 'Dark Waters' *** 1/2

Texto completo: If the story of "Dark Waters" sounds familiar, to a certain extent it is. But this film is not business as usual, with the presence of director Todd Haynes and star Mark Ruffalo the key reasons why.
On the most basic level "Dark Waters" is a whistleblower story, the latest in a genre of doing-the-right-thing scenarios that includes such popular films as "Erin Brockovich," "The Insider" and even "All the President's Men."
Inspired by an article in the New York Times Magazine, "Dark Waters" could have simply followed the template of the story's upbeat headline, "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare," telling the story of attorney Robert Bilott, who worked for more than 20 years to expose decades of heedless environmental contamination dreadful enough to cost the chemical giant $670 million in fines.
Ruffalo, an actor with an activist bent, read that story and decided to star in a movie version, becoming lead producer and hiring Haynes, a director whose 1995 "Safe" was ecologically prescient, and a filmmaker who never does anything the expected way.
Working with screenwriters Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, Haynes has constructed a dark, edgy film, disturbing and meant to be, a real-life horror show that details the impunity with which DuPont put profits above the known harm its chemicals were causing.
"Dark Waters" also focuses on the wrenching, disconcerting consequences of doing the right thing, on the number of grinding years of unrelenting, life-changing pressure - more than 20 in this case - that were needed to even begin to make a difference.
One of the many ironies in this story is that Bilott was in almost all ways the least likely guy to become the environmental hero.
Yes, Bilott (played by Ruffalo) was an attorney, but the Cincinnati firm he worked for was old-school conservative to the core. Recently made a partner, his area of specialization was defending big corporations rather than suing them.
That all began to change on a day in 1998 when gruff and furious Wilbur Tennant (a brilliant Bill Camp), a farmer from Parkersburg, West Virginia, who was acquainted with Bilott's grandmother, made the trip to Cincinnati and insisted "I want a lawyer."
Though he's a new father and his wife, Sarah (an expert Anne Hathaway), is not sure why he's even bothering, Bilott feels compelled to take the drive to Parkersburg.
Tennant has both physical evidence and videotape recordings of the horrors that have been visited on his herd of cattle, 190 of which he has buried. Tennant feels that the damage is caused by the neighboring Dry Run Landfill, where the Washington Works factory operated by DuPont deposits its chemical waste.
Before making what he views as a friendly colleague-to-colleague request to a pal at DuPont, Bilott runs his plan past his superior, the buttoned down Tom Terp (Tim Robbins, expert as well).
Neither man has any idea of what they, and their firm, are getting into, though when a DuPont functionary warns Bilott that "you're flushing your career down the toilet," he starts to get the idea.
That's because, as the lawyer finds out, a chemical variously known as PFOA or C8 and essential to the manufacture of Teflon, is being released into the Parkersburg water supply.
Ruffalo is splendid at projecting the unusual combination of bred-in-the-bone idealism with mulish stubbornness that made it impossible for Bilott to walk away.

Health Spending Grew Modestly, Study Finds

Texto completo: For the first time in many years, the government reported that spending on health care last year grew more slowly than the economy overall.
WASHINGTON -- The burdensome costs of medical care, prescription drugs and health insurance have become dominant issues in the 2020 presidential campaign. But a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the nation remains in a period of relatively slow growth in health spending.
Health spending in the United States rose by 4.6 percent to $ 3.6 trillion in 2018 -- accounting for 17.7 percent of the economy -- compared to a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. Federal officials said the slight acceleration was largely the result of reinstating a tax on health insurers that the Affordable Care Act imposed but Congress had suspended for a year in 2017. Faster growth in medical prices and prescription drug spending were also factors, they said, but comparatively minor.
For decades, national health spending galloped ahead of spending in the overall economy, lowering wages and stressing household budgets. But over the last decade, the pattern has shifted somewhat. Although the country consistently spends more on health care each year than it did the year before, the overall rate of growth has stayed below historical averages. In 2018, health spending grew more slowly than the economy overall, a rare occurrence.
The factors leading to the slowdown are not fully understood. For years, economists thought they were the result of lagging effects of the recession. But as the pattern has continued far into the economic recovery, they increasingly point to changes in the delivery of health care itself.
"Spending has to slow down when it gets so big," said Paul Hughes-Cromwick, the co-director of sustainable health spending strategies at the research group Altarum. "There's no question that there are efforts all across the environment to try to control this beast. There's no question about that, and some of them are working."
The slower growth may feel at odds with the experience of many Americans, who increasingly report financial duress from health costs. A recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health research organization, found that from 2009 through 2018 individuals who got insurance through their employers have been asked to shoulder an ever-higher share of their health bills through premium payments and rising deductibles. A typical employer plan for an individual now comes with a $ 1,400 deductible, up $ 900 from 2009.
The new report found that overall growth in household health care spending, including out-of-pocket expenses, premium payments and contributions to Medicare through payroll taxes, remained flat, at 4.4 percent.
Public opinion surveys show that health care -- particularly the cost of it -- remains a top voter concern, reflected by the Democratic presidential candidates' focus on Medicare for all and other proposals for expanding coverage to more people with a promise of lower direct costs. Congress is considering bills to help lower prescription drug costs and to eliminate the practice of surprise medical billing, though it is unclear whether either will pass this year.
The Trump administration is pursuing regulatory actions aimed at lowering health costs, including an ambitious rule that would require insurers and health care providers to disclose the prices they negotiate for a wide range of medical procedures and services. That rule, finalized last month, is being challenged in court by hospitals.
In the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, some candidates have been pushing far broader plans to tackle the issue. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have proposed establishing a single-payer health care system, where the government would provide generous taxpayer-funded insurance coverage for every American. Others, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., want to offer an optional government plan and more generous government subsidies for Americans who buy their own insurance.
However modestly it is growing, health spending in the United States is far higher than most other countries. The 2018 estimate of $ 3.6 trillion comes to more than $ 11,000 for every person in the country, with 33 percent going to hospital care, 20 percent to doctors and clinical services and 9 percent to retail prescription drugs. Measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, it is nearly double the average of health spending in other developed countries, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Most of those countries achieve lower health costs with universal coverage. In the United States, an estimated 28 million people are uninsured.
Given the public outrage over prescription drug prices, many people may be surprised to find that prices of prescription drugs bought at a pharmacy actually fell by one percent in 2018 for the first time since 1973, economists with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a telephone briefing about the new report. President Trump has seized on the slight drop, mentioning it in his rallies and speeches, although some experts warn the method the federal government uses for tracking drug price trends is imperfect.
Overall averages obscure a volatile mix of prices, with some drugs commanding escalating price tags, even as more common generic medications became less expensive.
The report also found that the share of the American population with health insurance fell for a second consecutive year in 2018, with most of the enrollment decline -- 1.3 million people -- coming in private coverage purchased directly, instead of through a job or the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The Trump administration has repeatedly highlighted this population as victims of rising premium costs under the Affordable Care Act; they generally earn too much to qualify for its premium subsidies.
There was also a slight drop in the number of people with employer-sponsored insurance and slower growth in Medicaid enrollment, although growth in Medicare enrollment remained steady.
Spending for people with private health insurance was $ 6,199 a person, an increase of 6.7 percent over 2017, the highest per-person growth rate since 2004. That number does not include out of pocket costs.

Texto completo: Steven Cohen's bid for the team may thrill fans tired of the Wilpon era, but his billions come with baggage.
New York City being New York City, and the Mets being the Mets, it was inevitable that a master of the universe would finally push the penurious Wilpon family into the mists of history.
That this master of the universe is Steven A. Cohen, a financier who is not unduly burdened by ethics and who sidestepped criminal indictment, is more or less perfect for this city, this team and this age.
Cohen commands a great pile of stones in Greenwich, Conn. -- a palazzo with more bedrooms and more bathrooms than you could count in this and another lifetime -- donates vast sums to the art world and to children's health, and is worth many billions of dollars.
Under the terms of his proposed deal for controlling interest in the Mets, he would take the helm of the team even while the Wilpons retain putative control for five years. As Cohen is a raptor's raptor, I would bet a large sum of money I don't have that the Wilpons will quickly become potted plants.
Mets fans, and I speak as a lifelong member of this sect, are likely to react to this news with glee. This week they watched Zack Wheeler, one of the better No. 3 starters in baseball, walk away to the Mets' chief competition, the Philadelphia Phillies, without his longtime team bothering to put in a bid for his services.
A new owner who will burn bonfires of his cash in pursuit of a championship is like water falling on the desert of Mets fandom.
Some might see this as myopia by fans, and maybe that's right, even though it reflects a sporting commonplace. The population of team-owning oligarchs contains its fair share of those with mysterious and unsightly fortunes. It's worth recalling that the other baseball team in town was long run by a (later pardoned) felon who obstructed justice.
He did, however, put out a fine baseball team. ¿Que será, será?
Before relativistic spin leaves me dizzy, it's worth tarrying a few minutes on the fellow who is likely to soon take control of my Mets. The process by which Cohen could ascend his throne is multifold: Major League Baseball will figuratively pat him down, and he must pass through several committees and obtain a two-thirds vote of the team owners. Nothing is certain, although my guess is that far more attention will be paid to the billions in his wallet than to the considerable taint of his business transgressions.
Cohen ran SAC Capital Advisors, which year after year produced wondrous returns. CNBC analysts felt something akin to awe and all but prostrated themselves. (It's perhaps worth reminding ourselves that the Wilpons were cast upon a reef for not dissimilar reasons, after they placed touching faith in the fantastical returns produced by their friend Bernie Madoff.)
A shrewd fellow, Cohen constructed a carefully decentralized operation with about 140 small teams. He waved his figurative garden hose and sprayed these teams with hundreds of millions of investment dollars. His rule was simple: Make money, or get lost.
As these teams enjoyed autonomy, Cohen retained two lovely words: plausible deniability.
Alas, federal regulators came knocking about seven years ago and began to indict some of his top employees. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing reported that Cohen -- surprise! -- was more attentive than he had let on. "Faced with red flags of potentially unlawful conduct by employees under his supervision, Cohen allowed his traders to execute the recommended trades and stood by," the filing stated.
Not that this fazed Cohen's investors, who continued to pour money into the many-gallon jug that was SAC.
For a while, it appeared that Cohen might face the possibility of spending a few years living rent-free in a federal facility. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, oversaw the investigation, and while he declined at that time to answer specific questions about Cohen, he characteristically thumped his chest.
"I don't see anyone that's too big to indict," the prosecutor said then. "No one is too big to jail."
As often happened with federal prosecutors, Bharara talked a better game than he prosecuted. Eight employees of SAC fell, but Cohen stepped away virtually untouched. He was, in essence, given a child's timeout, a mandatory two-year hiatus from managing money.
Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica has written much of Cohen, including for The New York Times, and he later wrote a book exploring the Justice Department's failures to prosecute executives. I called him and asked about this oligarch's decision to inhale the Mets.
"When we let rich malefactors skate free," he told me, "they take over ball clubs, are feted as philanthropists and even can ascend to the highest position in American government."
Cohen is one short of that trifecta. His friends insist he has a rich sense of humor. I don't doubt that. In fact, I would wager that when the hapless Wilpons agreed to give him control of the club if only he would let them remain in de facto control for another five years, he nodded and smiled broadly.

Texto completo: Two cheers for capitalism, now and forever.
I was a socialist in college. I read magazines like The Nation and old issues of The New Masses. I dreamed of being the next Clifford Odets, a lefty playwright who was always trying to raise proletarian class consciousness. If you go on YouTube and search "David Brooks Milton Friedman," you can see a 22-year-old socialist me debating the great economist. I'm the one with the bushy hair and the giant 1980s glasses that were apparently on loan from the Palomar lunar observatory.
The best version of socialism is defined by Michael Walzer's phrase, "what touches all should be decided by all." The great economic enterprises should be owned by all of us in common. Decisions should be based on what benefits all, not the maximization of profit.
That's not what "democratic socialists" like Bernie Sanders are talking about, but I get why some of their socialist concerns are popular. Why do we have to live with such poverty and inequality? Why can't we put people over profits? What is the best life in the most just society? Socialism is the most compelling secular religion of all time. It gives you an egalitarian ideal to sacrifice and live for.
My socialist sympathies didn't survive long once I became a journalist. I quickly noticed that the government officials I was covering were not capable of planning the society they hoped to create. It wasn't because they were bad or stupid. The world is just too complicated.
I came to realize that capitalism is really good at doing the one thing socialism is really bad at: creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out. If you want to run a rental car company, capitalism has a whole bevy of market and price signals and feedback loops that tell you what kind of cars people want to rent, where to put your locations, how many cars to order. It has a competitive profit-driven process to motivate you to learn and innovate, every single day.
Socialist planned economies -- the common ownership of the means of production -- interfere with price and other market signals in a million ways. They suppress or eliminate profit motives that drive people to learn and improve.
It doesn't matter how big your computers are, the socialist can never gather all relevant data, can never construct the right feedback loops. The state cannot even see the local, irregular, context-driven factors that can have exponential effects. The state cannot predict people's desires, which sometimes change on a whim. Capitalism creates a relentless learning system. Socialism doesn't.
The sorts of knowledge that capitalism produces are often not profound, like how to design the best headphone. But that kind of knowledge does produce enormous wealth. Human living standards were pretty much flat for all of human history until capitalism kicked in. Since then, the number of goods and services available to average people has risen by up to 10,000 percent.
If you've been around a little while, you've noticed that capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history. In 1981, 42 percent of the world lived in extreme poverty. Now, it's around 10 percent. More than a billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
You've noticed that places that instituted market reforms, like South Korea and Deng Xiaoping's China, tended to get richer and prouder. Places that moved toward socialism -- Britain in the 1970s, Venezuela more recently -- tended to get poorer and more miserable.
You've noticed that the environment is much better in capitalist nations than in planned economies. The American G.D.P. has more than doubled since 1970, but energy consumption has risen only modestly. America's per-capita carbon emissions hit a 67-year low in 2017. The greatest environmental degradations are committed by planned systems like the old Soviet Union and communist China.
The Fraser Institute is a free-market think tank that ranks nations according to things free-market think tanks like: less regulation, free trade, secure property rights. The freest economies in the world are places like Hong Kong, the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Denmark, Mauritius, Malta and Finland. Nations in the top quartile for economic freedom have an average G.D.P. per capita of $ 36,770. For those in the bottom quartile, it's $ 6,140. People in the free economies have a life expectancy of 79.4 years. Those in the planned economies have a life expectancy of 65.2 years.
Over the past century, planned economies have produced an enormous amount of poverty and scarcity. What's worse is what happens when the political elites learn what you can do with that scarcity. They turn scarcity into corruption. When things are scarce, you have to bribe government officials to get them. Soon, everybody is bribing. Citizens soon realize the whole system is a fraud. Socialism produces economic and political inequality as the rulers turn into gangsters. A system that begins in high idealism ends in corruption, dishonesty, oppression and distrust.
I learned the ills of socialism quickly ... and became a Whig slowly.
My first economic hero is Alexander Hamilton. He came to America with almost nothing and found an economy dominated by land-rich oligarchs like Thomas Jefferson. He realized that the solution was to make everyone a capitalist. He created credit markets so that capital would be fluid and more people would have access to investments.
My next hero is Abraham Lincoln. He grew up poor and launched his career as a Whig. He gave more speeches on banking and infrastructure projects than on slavery. That's because he wanted to spread capital and grease the wheels of commerce so poor boys and girls like him could rise. He helped create the land-grant colleges so that more people would have the training to compete as capitalists.
Another major American figure in the Whig tradition is Theodore Roosevelt. He loved the dynamism that capitalism arouses and knew that sometimes you have to limit giant corporations so millions of less established capitalists can compete.
All of these leaders understood that the answer to the problems of capitalism is wider and fairer capitalism.
Today, parts of our capitalist system in the United States are in good shape. Growth is remarkably steady, inflation is low, employment is high, wages for the poorest Americans are rising twice as fast as for high-wage workers.
But capitalism, like all human systems, is always unbalanced one way or another. Over the last generation, capitalism has produced the greatest reduction in global income inequality in history. The downside is that low-skill workers in the U.S. are now competing with workers in Vietnam, India and Malaysia. The reduction of inequality among nations has led to the increase of inequality within rich nations, like the United States.
Also, education levels have not kept pace with technology. More people grow up with inadequate schools, disrupted families and fragmented neighborhoods. They find it harder to acquire the skills to become good capitalists. The market is effectively closed off to them.
These problems are not signs that capitalism is broken. They are signs that we need more and better capitalism. We need a massive infusion of money and reform into our education systems, from infancy through life. Human capital-building is like nutrition: It's something you have to attend to every day. We need welfare programs that not only subsidize poor people's consumption but also subsidize their capacity to produce.
We need worker co-ops, which build skills and represent labor at the negotiating table. We need wage subsidies and mobility subsidies, so people can afford to move to opportunity. We need tax subsidies for health care, to make it easier for people to switch jobs. We need a higher earned-income tax credit, to give the working poor financial security so they don't get swept away amid the creative destruction. We need a carbon tax, to give everyone an incentive to reduce carbon emissions without pretending we know the best way to do it.
Every single idea I just mentioned comes from the American Enterprise Institute or Brookings or some other institution derided as being part of the neoliberal elite. All these ideas would make capitalism work better.
A big mistake those of us on the conservative side made was to think that anything that made the government bigger also made the market less dynamic. We failed to distinguish between the supportive state and the regulatory state. The supportive state makes better and more secure capitalists. The Scandinavian nations have very supportive welfare states. They also have very free markets. The only reason they can afford to have generous welfare states is they also have very free markets.
I don't know if the Scandinavian welfare model would work in nations as big and diverse as the U.S. But its success points to a few truths: The state nurtures prosperity when it helps people become capitalists. The state causes incredible levels of misery when it gets too far inside the decision-making processes of capitalists. It creates enormous misery when it cripples the motivational system that drives capitalism. Its causes enormous misery when it meddles with the relentless learning system that market mechanisms make possible.
Capitalism is not a religion. It won't save your soul or fulfill the yearnings of your heart. But somehow it will arouse your energies, it will lift your sights, it will put you on a lifelong learning journey to know, to improve, to dare and to dare again.
Last Sunday I attended a service with a young friend at a church that has quickly become a home for her. There were several hundred congregants. Ninety percent were under 30. Ninety percent were Latino. The service was two hours of joy and exultation -- glow sticks and song and balloons.
They weren't worshiping capitalism, but something higher. But still their work lives came into view. "Look how far we've come! Look how far we've come!" different people kept saying. I saw my own family's Jewish immigration history being re-enacted right in front of me. We, like they, started out as butchers and seamstresses and tailors, self-employed capitalists because it can be hard for immigrants to get corporate jobs. The opportunity explosion my family experienced and your family probably experienced is happening still, made possible by the ever-expanding pie that capitalism provides.
The theme that day was hope, transcendent hope and more immediate hope. "Move and miracles happen!" a young Latino woman sang. Every year, hundreds of millions of people march with their feet to capitalism.
Today, the real argument is not between capitalism and socialism. We ran that social experiment for 100 years and capitalism won. It's between a version of democratic capitalism, found in the U.S., Canada and Denmark, and forms of authoritarian capitalism, found in China and Russia. Our job is to make it the widest and fairest version of capitalism it can possibly be.

Time for a new media strategy?

Texto completo: The diplomats have been inspiring, the legal scholars knowledgeable, the politicians predictable.
After endless on-air analysis and written reporting, pundit panels and emergency podcasts, not much has changed.
If anything, weeks into the House of Representatives' public impeachment hearings, Americans' positions seem to have hardened on whether President Trump should be impeached and removed from office.
So, is the media coverage pointless? Are journalists merely shouting into the void?
Columnist Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times offered a name Wednesday for one aspect of what's happening before our eyes.
Responding to the absurd statement of Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.) " 'there are no set facts here' " she said it summed up the long-term Republican strategy: 'epistemological nihilism.'
In other words, there can be no knowledge and no meaning, so don't even bother.
It brings to mind Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway's coinage of the infamous term 'alternative facts' early in the administration. Or Trump surrogate Scottie Nell Hughes's on-air comment in 2016: 'There is no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts.'
That strategy runs in direct opposition to what journalism is supposed to be all about: establishing facts and knowledge so that citizens can make decisions, armed with what Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein calls 'the best obtainable version of the truth.'
How should journalists respond to the stalemate, other than to keep doing exactly what they've been doing?
The hint of a possible solution appears in the tracking of public opinion on impeachment at Nate Silver's fivethirtyeight.com, under the headline, 'Plenty Of People Are Persuadable On Impeachment.'
A paradox arises herein, and a weird one, at that. There's a group the trackers call 'less-certain Republicans' " about 12-percent of the sample, not huge but given the even split in support for impeachment, mighty important.
Here's the rub: This group is persuadable, but not particularly interested:
'There's one big hurdle for anyone looking to persuade this group . . . they're not following developments in the impeachment inquiry very closely,' the site reported. 'Only 34-percent of people who aren't as certain about their stance on impeachment are following the process somewhat or very closely, compared with 66-percent of respondents who are more certain.'
That much larger group, though, seems to be following the hearings and absorbing the media coverage, largely to deepen their own confirmation bias.
Rather than providing a catering service for the echo chambers, how might journalism address this important group?
(Never doubt that public opinion matters right now: In many ways, it's what the hearings are all about, as Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton both could have told you.)
Columbia University journalism professor Bill Grueskin suggests the movie-trailer approach.
In a message, he explains: 'Studios spend a $1-million or more on a trailer, because they know it's essential to boil down the essentials of the film " explaining but not giving away the plot, providing a quick but intense insight into the characters, setting the scene with vivid imagery " to entice people to come back to the theatre a month later for the full movie.'
Similarly, most people (especially the less convinced or more persuadable) will never watch seven hours in a row of congressional testimony, but, as he notes, 'many of them would be open to a targeted, well-informed 'trailer' approach that is cogently told.'
In some ways, that's what the nightly newscasts on the three major broadcast networks attempt to do: boil the complex down to a few minutes.
But that audience, although still substantial " more than 20-million people on average per night " certainly doesn't include everyone. And far too often, those broadcasts fall prey to false equivalency: This side said this, and this side said that, and we don't want to make anyone mad, so we've got to cut to a commercial now.
With that in mind, I would also very much like to see one other major change: a moratorium on the reflexive use of the word 'partisan.'
Mainstream journalists love that word, because it lets them off the hook: We aren't taking sides, not us! The country is divided, and we can't help it.
Just uttering the word 'partisan' is media Prozac: It soothes journalists' angst about not being perceived as inoffensively neutral.
It's too easy, and too often an easy coverup for, yes, epistemological nihilism: The notion that there are no facts, so let's not bother to try establishing them.
But here's the thing: There are facts. There is truth. We do live in a country that abides by laws and a Constitution, and nobody ought to be above them.
Despite the hardened positions, some members of the public are still uncertain. Some are persuadable, and yes, it matters.
Maybe, just maybe, it's the job of American journalism in this moment to get serious about trying to reach these citizens.

Texto completo: Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost has filed a brief to the Ohio Supreme Court in support of multiple media outlets suing for the right to see Connor Betts’ student records on file with Bellbrook-Sugarcreek schools.
Yost’s filing comes as the Dayton Daily News, WHIO, CNN, The New York Times and other media companies are appealing to the state’s highest court the decision by the Second District Court of Appeals in Greene County to deny making the records public.
Betts, 24, was the gunman responsible for the Aug. 4 mass shooting in the Oregon District that injured dozens and resulted in the deaths of 10 people, including Betts, who was fatally shot by Dayton police about 30 seconds after he began shooting.
Betts was a student of the Bellbrook-Sugarcreek school district, where former classmates told this news organization he had created a hit list and a rape list with other students’ names, had other incidents of violence and threats as a teenager and was suspended from Bellbrook High School for an extended period of time.
The Dayton Daily News and others are seeking Betts’ discipline, attendance and other education records to better inform the public about what may have led to the tragedy and whether something could have been done to prevent it.
The state attorney general’s office is obligated by law to “ensure transparency in all levels of government,” including providing training and guidance to public officials tasked with obeying Ohio’s Sunshine Laws, Yost’s brief reads.
“This obligation is directly implicated here, where a public office is violating the Public Records Act in contravention of all training and guidance provided by the attorney general,” Yost’s filing reads.
Yost argues that neither the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act nor the Ohio Student Privacy Act “protects the records of former students who die in adulthood.”
“This case presents the question whether FERPA continues to forbid disclosure of a former student’s school records after he dies during adulthood. The statute nowhere addresses this matter expressly. Still, FERPA is best understood not to limit disclosure of the records of deceased former students,” Yost’s brief reads.
In representing Bellbrook-Sugarcreek schools, the law firm Subashi, Wildermuth & Justice successfully argued at the appellate court level that the media companies did not establish that the district was duty-bound to release Betts’ educational records, because doing so would have created an exception to the Public Records Act.
The schools’ attorneys cite the Ohio Student Privacy Act as an exception to the Public Records Act, as it prohibits schools from releasing students’ records without written consent of parents or guardians, or that of the student once he or she is 18 years or older.
The school district’s attorney, Tabitha Justice, said in an email Thursday: “Regardless of how this case turns out, the Supreme Court’s decision should provide clear guidance for school districts that receive requests for educational records of deceased students. That is all we really want.”

Texto completo: There is a scene in "Dark Waters," an excellent thriller about industrial pollution and industrial-sized cover-up, in which Robert Bilott, an attorney played with grim determination by Mark Ruffalo, stands in a room surrounded by box after box of information related to his case.
Soon he'll be on his hands and knees sorting it all out. If it seems like it will take years, it did — Todd Haynes' film is based on a true story, in which Bilott chips away, year after year, at DuPont, the chemical giant Bilott is suing, at first for poisoning cattle with toxic runoff, then much more. (The film is based on a New York Times story by Nathaniel Rich.) It's a long and detailed movie, rich in information and damning accusations — a lot of things are going on here.
But it's this scene, in which a somewhat plodding, methodical lawyer grinds away at a seemingly impossible task, that establishes Bilott as one of the most-effective kinds of characters in movies: the unsung hero.
Characters that simply wake up every day and push the rock a little farther up the hill are always worth rooting for. And Ruffalo is good at embodying one here.
Bilott begins the film as a new partner in a prestigious Cincinnati law firm that, among other things, defends corporations like DuPont (but not DuPont itself, which remains the one big client fish that so far the firm hasn't been able to reel in, we learn at a corporate dinner).
One day a West Virginia farmer named Wilbur Tennant (the great Bill Camp) shows up in the law offices demanding to see Bilott. He knows Bilott's grandmother, so he's calling in a favor. Something is wrong with his herd of cattle; since DuPont began polluting the stream that runs through his farm his cows have gone wrong — really wrong, as Haynes shows in graphic portrayal. Proud and ornery, Tennant wants answers.
Bilott isn't thrilled about the prospect. He's tried to get away from his West Virginia roots. At one point his boss, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) tells him it's OK to be from West Virginia — he won't tell anyone. And going after a corporation like DuPont is basically the opposite of what their firm does.
But a visit with his grandmother and a visit to Tennant's farm changes his mind. Thus begins a long, largely thankless (it involves four pay cuts) obsession with ferreting out the truth. What's going on with Tennant's farm is horrific. What's going on in the bigger picture is worse. Ever used Teflon? You may want to rethink that.
It's ultimately the story of a giant corporation behaving in the best interests only of its shareholders and executives, all of whom line their pockets while their customers get sick and die. And there is seemingly little Bilott, or anyone else, can do about it, thanks to a system rigged against anyone without billions at their disposal to skirt regulation, buy up scientists and pay off complainers.
But there Bilott is, literally on his hands and knees, piecing together a case. His wife, Sarah (Anne Hathaway), a former lawyer now raising their sons basically alone while Bilott works, stands by him, but not without cost. (Hathaway's appearances are brief but occasionally crucial.)
The film isn't as stylish as what we're used to from Haynes ("Carol," "Far from Heaven"), by design. Colors are dulled into blue and gray, like it's always raining on Bilott's parade. There's nothing flashy about his work, something Haynes reminds us of in every aspect of the movie.
The acting is outstanding. Victor Garber is particularly good as an oily DuPont executive friendly with Bilott early on; that relationship will change. Camp brings a surly dignity to Tennant, beneath bug-like eyebrows and a growling West Virgina drawl. Bill Pullman is a much-welcome shot of fun as a folksy, sneaky smart lawyer who teams with Bilott.
Haynes plays up the melodrama, and the film moves along without a lot of surprises.
But that gives it a certain momentum — a momentum personified by Bilott in the storage room, sorting through boxes. It's not flashy, but it's how you get the job done.

Loren Taylor Hopes to Use Federal "Opportunity Zone" Tax Breaks to Foster Local Development

Texto completo: The Oakland City Council is seeking ways to minimize displacement of tenants and small businesses and leverage community benefits under the federal Opportunity Zone Program in the U.S. tax code created by the Trump Administration, which has so far been criticized for offering huge tax breaks to wealthy investors who open businesses or build real estate projects in low-income urban neighborhoods .
Under current tax regulations, there are no requirements for investors to consult with city governments or create jobs, build affordable housing or other projects to promote equity and programs that would benefit local communities.
Recently, there have been exposes, including in the New York Times, citing how these Opportunity Zone programs around the country have enriched billionaires. Congress woman Rashida Talib (D - Mich.), among others, is backing legislation to repeal this part of the tax code. "The American people have been scammed," she said.
Locally, District 6 Councilmember Loren Taylor has been working with the City Administration to design an Opportunity Zone program that can be leveraged to develop projects that serve Oakland neighborhoods, while avoiding some of the most damaging aspects of the Trump regulations that would displace local residents and businesses.
"There has been a very intentional focus on bringing equity and a community orientation to a program that was not designed to do so. We all acknowledge that," said Taylor, speaking at Tuesday's Community and Economic Development (CED) Committee meeting.
"We're doing a little bit of judo, using other people's momentum against them so that we can advance our own efforts. That's really what we're doing on behalf of our community," he said.
Gloria Bruce of East Bay Housing Organizations said, "This (legislation) carries a lot of urgency about displacement and how investment can happen without displacement.
"As currently framed at the federal level, (the regulations) are place-based, not people based; so, we really need to center people in this conversation," she said. "Nationally, there has been a big amount of investigative reporting, (including) in the New York times, about how this tool has mostly been used to (fund) projects that have already would have happened or things that are luxury development(s). we don't want that to happen in Oakland."
The federal government has designated 30 Oakland census tracts in East and West Oakland as Opportunity Zones. Investors who make a long-term investment or property in one of these census tracts can defer or reduce their federal capital gains taxes.
"Oakland's Opportunity Zones have more renters, higher poverty rates, and larger Black and Latinx populations than the city overall," according to the report prepared by city staff for Tuesday's Community and Economic Development (CED) committee meeting.
While the city seeks to promote equity and community benefits in local development, "federal regulations do not currently require local community benefits or investor reporting to local governments, (although) projects must still comply with local development regulation".
According to the staff report, "...local governments can influence Opportunity Zone investment by highlighting and supporting beneficial local projects." There are a number of potential local projects proposals, but the underlying obstacle, is where to find funding or investors.
"The City's Opportunity Zone goals should be to increase engagement and local awareness of the designation, help direct investment to projects that benefit Oakland's Black population, communities of color and women-owned businesses, and prevent displacement due to loss of affordable residential and commercial space," the report said.
Seeking to implement Opportunity Zones in Oakland, the city administration has already formed an Opportunity Zone Working Group that includes the Departments of Economic and Workforce Development, Planning and Building, and Housing and Community Development;
The City has also received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to create a new position, Chief Opportunity Zone Officer, (who has already been hired) to support equitable development in Opportunity Zones, whose work will be supported by two VISTA volunteers.
"The first reported investments in Oakland, as well as nationwide, have been in hotels and primarily market-rate housing located in the Uptown/Downtown area," the report said. "Funds for projects in West and East Oakland exist but are still raising capital."
Seeking to repeal the Trump Tax Code regulations, Rep. Tlaib said in a statement, "Opportunity Zones were supposed to help uplift low-income community and those living in poverty, but instead we are seeing them benefit billionaires and their luxury projects. . . .the current Opportunity Zone law fails to drive real benefits to low-income communities instead often rewarding President Trump's donors."

Chesapeake Bay Foundation joins EPA lawsuit

Texto completo: The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has joined a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency to challenge a Trump administration proposal that would pose air quality concerns for the Chesapeake Bay.
A coalition of environmental advocacy organizations filed suit Nov. 22 in Federal Circuit Court to block the EPA from withdrawing California's permission to set its own automobile emissions standards, which are stricter than federal rules.
The proposal to revoke the waiver, which was announced by the Trump Administration in September, matters because a number of Chesapeake Bay Watershed states also follow portions of the California standards, said John Surrick, a Chesapeake Bay Foundation spokesman.
Unlike under the federal Clean Water Act, which allows individual states to set their own rules as long as they are stricter than federal standards, the Clean Air Act does not allow states to supersede federal rules without a waiver, said Ariel Solaski, a staff attorney at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
The agency has granted California a waiver to adopt standards for light-duty vehicles for more than half a century, according to the EPA website.
EPA did not respond to an email requesting comment.
In total, 14 states have adopted parts of California's program, including Delaware, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia.
"Something that's really important to note is that these programs have been very effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including nitrogen oxides, and increasing the amount of zero-emission vehicles in the fleet," Solaski said. "Part of the reason California was able to adopt the standard is ... they have to show compelling and extraordinary circumstances to show why they have a different program than the federal standards. EPA has found many times that those criteria is met."
Roughly one-third of the nitrogen pollution in the bay comes from the air, and about half of that is in the form of nitrogen oxides, said Beth McGee, senior water quality scientist at CBF. Nitrogen oxides are a group of seven gases that can create environmental health hazards when they react in the presence of sunlight or chemicals to form smog or acid rain.
Nitrogen oxides are released from vehicle exhaust. It's important to have high standards for vehicles in the bay region because tailpipe pollution behaves different from other polluting sources that shoot the gases up into the atmosphere, McGee said.
Tailpipe pollution from local vehicles is especially damaging to local waterways because it stays low to the ground, not travelling far, McGee said. Tailpipe pollution from vehicles in the watershed area can go directly into the bay and its tributaries.
Maryland adopted a Clean Cars Program modeled after the program in California in 2007. The program was estimated to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions collectively by about three more tons per day than the federal standard, according to the Maryland Department of the Environment.
The program achieves these reductions by requiring that cars pass strict tailpipe emissions tests. It also includes what is known as the "ZEV mandate" — a requirement that vehicle manufacturers put up for sale an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles (which include electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids) in the state each year.
Maryland has a goal of putting 60,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2020 and 300,000 ZEVs on the road by 2025, according to MDE. Collectively, the nine states (including Maryland) involved in a cross-country ZEV task force are aiming to put at least 3.3 million ZEVs on the roadways by 2025, according to the task force website.
Efforts by Maryland and other bay states to use mechanisms like the Clean Cars Program to improve their local air quality have impact on those states' abilities to adhere to the federal and state bay cleanup programs currently in place.
Air quality is a component of the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint, which sets pollution reduction milestones and consequences for failure upon the bay watershed states. Without a Clean Cars Program, Maryland would need to find another way to clean up the air to Blueprint standards by the deadline of 2025.
Because nitrogen oxides are also emitted by coal-fired power plants and the burning of natural gas, the source of the electricity powering zero-emission vehicles matters. Therefore, CBF said they are also opposed to other rollbacks the Trump administration has made on regulations concerning air pollution.
"Conceptually, we don't really want to see any rollbacks in anything addressing greenhouse gases," McGee said.
In September, The New York Times reported that during President Trump's tenure, his administration has committed to rolling back 24 rules related to air pollution and emissions, as well as 18 rules concerning drilling and extraction. In total, the Trump administration has scheduled rollbacks for 85 environmental rules.
The rules are targeted for removal because they seen as burdensome to the fossil fuel industry and other big businesses, the Times reported.
CBF joins a coalition of NGOs in this litigation, including the Center for Biological Diversity, Communities for a Better Environment, Environment America, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.

As minor league baseball looks to cut teams, here's why Greenville Drive is here to stay

Texto completo: If Major League Baseball has its way, minor league teams in small cities across the country will face extinction — and while there is a list, at this point it doesn't appear that the Greenville Drive's name will be on it.
The $15 million in public and private money invested into renovations to Fluor Field in the past two years helped keep the Red Sox affiliate out of the cross-hairs of the contentious Professional Baseball Agreement negotiations now between MLB and Minor League Baseball.
The agreement, which expires next September, governs the association between minor league teams and their MLB affiliates — or, particularly at issue now, whether a team gets to be affiliated with the majors at all.
"The MLB's main concerns are about facility standards, and that's obviously not an issue in Greenville," Jeff Lantz, the MiLB's senior director of communications, told The Greenville News. "There shouldn't be any concern at all in Greenville."
The Drive's owner — Craig Brown, who in 2006 funded the baseball stadium's construction in the West End when the area was bereft of private investment — said that he couldn't comment on the negotiations between the MLB and MiLB, but he told The News the team is committed to staying in downtown Greenville.
"We're not going anywhere," Brown said, "and we don't anticipate anything changing in a material way."
Baseball America was the first to report on leaked plans to eliminate 42 of 160 minor league teams in what the MLB says is an effort to improve facilities, cut down on travel time with geographical restructuring and raise pay for minor league players.
Earlier this week, the New York Times shared a list of the 42 teams, which notably excluded the Drive and fellow Class A South Atlantic League members Asheville Tourists, Columbia Fireflies and Charleston RiverDogs.
GOP and Dems unite over contraction The MLB's proposal has drawn bipartisan scorn in Congress, including three whose respective districts include the Drive, Fireflies and RiverDogs.
U.S. 4th District Rep. William Timmons, a newly elected Greenville Republican, joined Democratic U.S. Reps. James Clyburn of Orangeburg and Joe Cunningham of Charleston in signing a pointed letter to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and 30 MLB teams.
"Minor league baseball is an important part of the fabric of cities and towns across the country, including Greenville," Timmons said in a statement to The News." I have serious concerns about the impact MLB's plans would have on those communities, and I hope they reconsider their proposal."
The congressional letter, signed by 104 representatives on both sides of the aisle, makes direct reference to the measures Congress has taken to preserve MLB's unique anti-trust protections instituted a century ago.
"We want you to fully understand the impact this could have not only on the communities we represent, but also on the long-term support that Congress has always afforded our national pastime on a wide variety of legislative initiatives," the letter states.
The letter was penned by Massachusetts Democrat Lori Trahan, whose district includes the Lowell Spinners, which face disassociation, and Republican David McKinley of West Virginia, which stands to lose three of its four minor league teams.
"Reducing the number of Minor League Baseball clubs and overhauling a century-old system that has been consistently safeguarded by Congress is not in the best interest of the overall game of baseball, especially when Major League Baseball's revenues are at all-time highs," the letter states.
In a four-page answer to Congress, MLB deputy commissioner Dan Halem wrote that MiLB is "framing the issue as saving baseball in communities that presently have it."
However, Halem wrote, the MLB's "very brief negotiations" with MiLB have shown that minor league owners are more concerned about the value of their franchises and that some of them are "presently attempting to relocate their affiliates to different cities or sell them outright."
Millions more in investment coming to Drive stadium The Drive wouldn't be among any teams considering a move to another locale.
Over the course of the past few years, the city of Greenville pledged $5 million in tourism-related tax money to fund improvements to Fluor Field, which included new entrance plazas, seats atop the replica Green Monster and expansion of club seats, among other improvements.
The Drive contributed $10 million.
Mayor Knox White, who before the Drive's arrival presided over the departure of the Class AA Greenville Braves to Mississippi, said public and private partners must continue to invest in ballparks to "stay fresh."
Other cities, White said, "don't invest, and the stadium shows it, and enthusiasm has waned. Obviously we're not in that category at all. We've never been in that category."
The Drive organization introduced trolleys into downtown Greenville, which evolved into the popular trolley system in operation today.
The ballpark was designed with low elevations so as not to tower over the West End community and using brick matching its surroundings.
"We've built our brand around the sense of community," Brown said, "and it's always been our desire to be a part of the fabric of the community. Hopefully our record speaks for itself."
Now, the organization is cooperating on a project to turn Field Street into a convertible entertainment area that would be renamed "Jackson Way," after Greenville baseball legend Shoeless Joe Jackson.
The project would be in conjunction with the development of the .408 Jackson apartment development — a reference to Jackson's batting average in his first season, which remains a rookie record — and would involve relocation of the Shoeless Joe Museum to the corner of Markley Street.
The transformation into Jackson Way would allow Field Street to be closed for events and then re-opened. The city has offered a preliminary cost estimate of $2.1 million.
"That's going to keep us busy in the next year or two," Brown said.
A return to Class AA? The ongoing negotiations between MLB and MiLB won't result in any sudden moves in 2020 like, Lantz said.
However, the MLB's plans to shrink the South Atlantic League from 14 teams to six could create a new Mid-Atlantic League that would better align teams geographically.
Currently, the Drive travel as far north as New Jersey.
When the Greenville Braves played in Municipal Stadium at Conestee Park until the 2004 season, the higher Class AA status of the Southern League featured more-talented future Braves, like Chipper Jones and John Smoltz, than Class A could provide.
In making the case for minor league baseball's return to Greenville, advocates at the time said that the attraction of the ballpark would outweigh the rank of the league class.
A return to Class AA isn't out of the question in any realignment, Lantz said.
"If it makes sense for that team to be in the Southern League and they've got the market size and can handle a league like that, why wouldn't we?" Lantz said.
In any case, a minor league team's association with a major league team is important, the mayor said.
"I'd love to see us move to AA," White said, "but the affiliation with Boston has been important."
The MLB's proposal would assign the affected 42 teams into an independent "Dream League," similar to the NBA's "G-League" that allows unsigned players to prove themselves.
That proposal would effectively kill the respective organizations' ability to remain legitimate franchises, Lantz said.
One team on the list of 42 — the Beloit Snappers in Wisconsin — would be removed after leadership there agreed to build a new stadium, Lantz said. In its place, he said, the Quad Cities River Bandits in Iowa would join the endangered.
As part of its negotiations, Lantz said, the MiLB wants to know how teams were selected — such as the Lexington Legends in Kentucky, which won the past two South Atlantic League championships after the Drive won in 2017 and have had strong attendance.
"That's a big part of what this first part of the discussion will be," he said.

Texto completo: Si te encantan las papas fritas, quizás deberás aguantar tu antojo en los próximos días, pues existe la posibilidad de que haya escasez de este alimento debido a que las temperaturas frías y otras malas condiciones climáticas han arruinado los cultivos de papas en Idaho, Alberta, Dakota del Norte y Minnesota , de donde sacan la mayoría de las papas, según reporta Thrillist.
El problema fue que los agricultores tuvieron que desechar muchas papas –las cuales pueden tardar hasta 100 días en crecer– debido a que se dañaron por el frío.
“La demanda de papas fritas ha sido excepcional últimamente, por lo que los suministros no pueden satisfacer la demanda”, dijo Travis Blacker, director de relaciones industriales de la Comisión de la Papa de Idaho. Debido a esto, se sospecha que el precio de las papas se disparará, especialmente para las variedades más grandes , que son las que se usan para hacer las famosas papas fritas.
Por otro lado, aunque hay muchos que piensan que podríamos estar al borde de un apocalipsis de papas fritas, hay otros expertos que aseguran que no hay nada de qué preocuparse, ya que las cadenas de restaurantes que sirven este platillo pueden encontrar otras formas de satisfacer la demanda .
“No te preocupes por las papas fritas”, dijo Frank Muir, presidente de la Comisión de Papa de Idaho, al The New York Times. “Todavía puedes salir y ordenarlas como lo haces normalmente”.
Y es que hay que recordar que los tres mayores productores de papa del mundo son China, India y Rusia, por lo que podrían surtir al mercado estadounidense en caso de que se necesitara.
Además, las compañías que ofrecen papas fritas tienen la capacidad de congelar su inventario actual por un largo período de tiempo para satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes.
Así que, aunque hay cierto peligro de que se presente una escasez de este producto, las compañías han manejado la situación bien, de manera que podemos seguir disfrutándolo… hasta el momento.

Texto completo: It’s the most wonderful time of the year — for “porch pirates,” opportunistic thieves who snatch packages off doorsteps and out of mailboxes before their owners can bring them inside.
As many as 1.7 million packages are stolen or go missing in the United States every day, according to an analysis published yesterday in the New York Times, and state and local police are aware of the problem.
Here are some tips from state police on how to keep your Cyber Monday packages out of the hands of porch pirates.
1) Send packages to your place of business.
2) Sign up to receive a notification when it’s delivered.
3) Ask a neighbor to retrieve it.
4) Track your packages online.

In many states, marriage is still a defense against rape

Texto completo: Is it worse to sexually assault a stranger than it is to sexually assault your wife?
In many states, the law says yes, imposing lesser charges or lighter sentences for violations within marriage — a disparity that women's rights activists find galling and are trying to change.
The issue has gained attention in recent weeks, as former governor Deval Patrick's entry into the Democratic presidential race revived questions about his involvement in a controversial case regarding spousal rape. Patrick's former brother-in-law was convicted of that offense in California, but after moving to Massachusetts, he was not required to register as a sex offender. A hearing officer determined California's spousal rape charge to be legally less severe and the man to be at no risk of reoffending.
Eleven years later, Massachusetts case law has evolved to erase confusion about discrepancies between states' criminal codes so that the same decision wouldn't be made today. Marriage has not been a defense against rape charges in Massachusetts courts since 1981, and marital rape has been illegal in all 50 states since 1993, at least to some degree.
But many states, including California, continue to treat sexual assault differently when it occurs within a marriage, according to AEquitas, a nonprofit training and technical assistance provider that works with prosecutors on their response to gender-based violence and human trafficking.
“I think that all California voters would be shocked if they knew that California still maintains a spousal rape law," said Michele Dauber, a Stanford University law professor and sociologist who is advocating for the change. “Obviously, it's time to remove this law from our books because rape is rape regardless of the relationship or lack of a relationship between the perpetrator and the victim."
Spousal rape in California does not carry a mandatory prison sentence. Someone convicted of spousal rape there is required to register as a sex offender only if he used force or violence — not if he violated his wife in her sleep or while she was unconscious — and if he was sentenced to prison.
That distinction is troubling to Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen, who is developing legislation to eliminate it.
“We have recently encountered a horrific spousal rape case and it was very disheartening to realize that he's not looking at mandatory state prison," said Terry Harman, an assistant district attorney who oversees the Santa Clara County sexual assault unit.
The notion that a man can't rape his wife can be traced back to Matthew Hale, father of British common law, said Raquel Kennedy Bergen, a sociology professor and a fellow in the Institute for Violence Research and Prevention at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia.
“People like Hale argued that with marriage, you are giving your consent forever and it can't be revoked," Bergen said.
In the 1970s, feminists began pushing back against that idea but discovered it was baked into law: State statutes defined rape as forcible intercourse with a woman who is not your wife.
“By virtue of the definition, you could not rape your wife," Bergen said.
In many states, though spousal rape is illegal, spousal exemptions remain — including those based on the age of the victim (when sexual conduct might otherwise be statutory rape), their custodial or supervisory relationship (when sexual conduct might otherwise be illegal), or the victim's capacity to consent, according to AEquitas.
For instance, Maryland offers a spousal defense that says a person can be prosecuted for raping a spouse only while using force or threatening to use force; or the couple is living separately for at least three months or pursuant to a written separation agreement.
In 20 states, spouses are exempt from prosecution in cases that would otherwise be considered rape because the victim was asleep, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated and unable to give consent.
“To my mind, at least, that's when you're most vulnerable — when you can't give your consent, whenever you're incapacitated," Bergen said.
Until this year, Minnesota had a “voluntary relationship" defense that would exempt a perpetrator from prosecution for sexually assaulting someone who's physically helpless if married or living together. The campaign to change that law was led by a woman who found video of her now ex-husband penetrating her with an object as she slept in their bed beside their 4-year-old son, according to The New York Times. Under the prior law, the ex-husband could only be charged with a misdemeanor, rather than a felony.
So is a perpetrator less of a public danger if the only person he assaults is his wife?
Statistically, yes. Individually, not necessarily. That's why sex offender registration should be based on individual assessments of behavior and risk, not just broad classifications, said Dr. Laurie Guidry, a member of the board of the Massachusetts Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers.
Generally speaking, she said, “The research tells us that when a person targets a stranger victim, that kind of an offender tends to be a higher risk for recidivism than the person who targets someone who is known to them or related to them."
But individual spousal offenders can sometimes be more dangerous than those who assault strangers. Some go on to commit other violent or sexual offenses, said Gina Scaramella, executive director of the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.
“I think it's incredibly important that we understand that people who are sexually violent toward people they know are not better than people who do that toward a stranger," she said.
The case of Patrick's former brother-in-law, Bernard Sigh, began with Sigh's 1993 conviction of spousal rape of Patrick's sister, his jail time, and his probation. The couple reconciled before moving to Massachusetts, where he had not registered as a sex offender, when Patrick was running for governor, the Boston Herald revealed. The Sex Offender Registry Board ordered Sigh to register, and he appealed.
A hearing officer determined that Sigh “does not present a risk to reoffend or a danger to others," noting that he had stopped drinking, accepted responsibility, and shown sincere remorse. The hearing officer was persuaded by the victim's testimony that Sigh had been a loving husband and father in the ensuing 14 years and that the rape had been an isolated incident.
But board employees continued to resist his findings, insisting that spousal rape should be treated as rape. Years later, Patrick fired the chairwoman of the board, whom he accused of inappropriately trying to change the opinion. In a suit that is still ongoing, the former chairwoman, Saundra Edwards, claims she was unjustly fired in retaliation.
When the issue came up in his new campaign for president, Patrick defended his actions, maintaining he asked Edwards to resign “in part because of her unlawful interference" in the case, which triggered a prior lawsuit and financial settlement with the hearing officer.
He also said, “Bernie Sigh's impact on my family has been complex and painful for all of us."
In 2017, Sigh was charged with raping Patrick's sister again, as well as trying to have her kidnapped. He was convicted in June and sentenced to six to eight years in prison.
Dauber, the Stanford professor, has called Patrick's involvement in the case of his former brother-in-law “disqualifying" for a presidential candidate. However, she noted that it has drawn attention to California's antiquated law.
“I think that the Deval Patrick incident is probably the first time that many Californians even knew that we had a spousal rape law, or a spousal rape exception," Dauber said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide from fossil fuels hit a record high in 2019, researchers said Tuesday, putting countries farther off course from their goal of halting global warming.
The new data contained glimmers of good news: Worldwide, industrial emissions are on track to rise 0.6 percent this year, a considerably slower pace than the 1.5 percent increase seen in 2017 and the 2.1 percent rise in 2018. The United States and the European Union both managed to cut their carbon dioxide output this year, while India's emissions grew far more slowly than expected.
And global emissions from coal, the worst-polluting of all fossil fuels, unexpectedly declined by about 0.9 percent in 2019, although that drop was more than offset by strong growth in the use of oil and natural gas around the world.
Scientists have long warned, however, that it's not enough for emissions to grow slowly or even just stay flat in the years ahead. In order to avoid many of the most severe consequences of climate change -- including deadlier heat waves, fiercer droughts, and food and water shortages -- global carbon dioxide emissions would need to steadily decline each year and reach roughly zero well before the end of the century.
For more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter .
"Every year that emissions go up, even if it's just a small amount, makes the task of bringing them back down that much harder," said Glen Peters, research director at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway, who helped compile the data.
The new emissions figures, reported by the Global Carbon Project and published simultaneously in three scientific journals, arrived as diplomats from more than 190 nations gathered in Madrid for another round of United Nations talks on how to strengthen their efforts to rein in the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.
So far, progress has been sluggish, the new reports warn. During the 2000s, global fossil-fuel emissions were rising by roughly 3 percent each year on average, driven in large part by rapid coal-fueled growth in China. Since 2010, emissions have grown more slowly, by about 0.9 percent per year on average, as China's need for new coal plants has waned and governments around the world have tried to promote cleaner technologies like electric cars, wind and solar power.
"I do think global and national policies are making a difference, particularly by driving the rapid growth in renewables, and we'd be worse off without them," said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University and an author of one of the studies published Tuesday. "But at the same time, it's clear those policies haven't been enough to stop the growth in fossil fuels."
The new data shows that natural gas, which is less polluting than coal but still a fossil fuel, has become the biggest driver of emissions growth globally in recent years. Japan, for instance, has relied on imported natural gas to replace many of the carbon-free nuclear plants that were closed down after the 2011 accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power station. And a boom in hydraulic fracturing has recently made natural gas the largest source of electricity in the United States, where it helps fill the gaps during lulls in wind and solar production.
"Natural gas may produce fewer carbon emissions than coal, but that just means you cook the planet a bit more slowly," said Dr. Peters. "And that's before even getting into the worries about methane leaks" from gas infrastructure.
A handful of countries account for the majority of the world's carbon dioxide emissions each year, with China responsible for 26 percent, the United States 14 percent, the European Union 9 percent and India 7 percent. The new reports show how each region is grappling with its own unique challenges.
China's emissions are projected to rise by about 2.6 percent this year as the government continues to invest in new infrastructure to stimulate its slowing economy. While coal emissions in China grew by just 0.8 percent, the country is quickly expanding its appetite for oil to fuel cars and trucks, and natural gas to heat homes and power factories.
In the United States, carbon dioxide emissions are on track to fall roughly 1.7 percent in 2019, thanks to a sharp decline in coal-fired electricity. Still, this year's drop in United States emissions isn't expected to be enough to offset the 2.8 percent increase in 2018, suggesting that the country is struggling to control emissions at a time when the Trump administration has moved to roll back Obama-era regulations on carbon pollution from vehicle tailpipes and power-plant smokestacks.
The European Union's emissions are also on track to fall 1.7 percent this year as the continent's emissions-trading system helped push roughly one-fifth of its coal power off the grid. At the same time, Europe also saw an increase in demand for diesel and aviation fuel, indicating that policymakers are failing to curtail emissions from cars, trucks and planes even as they lay out big plans to promote electric vehicles.
India, which is trying to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, was perhaps the biggest surprise in the new data. India's emissions are expected to rise a mere 1.8 percent this year after an 8 percent increase in 2018.
Some of that slowdown, the researchers noted, can be explained by weaker economic growth and an unexpectedly strong monsoon season that allowed the country to generate more electricity from its emissions-free hydroelectric dams and less from its coal plants. But India's government is also pursuing big plans to promote solar power and electric vehicles, and it remains to be seen whether those policies can help the country constrain future emissions.
"India is still a big wild card" for projections of future emissions, Dr. Jackson said. "So getting a handle on how much of that drop was anomalous weather and how much a change in the long-term trend is really important."

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Trump's opponents keep shifting their position on Ukraine's 2016 interference

Texto completo: It would be really helpful for Democrats and liberals in the national media to get their story straight in the debate over whether Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Right now, they have four different and contradictory stories, and that makes it all but impossible to, you know, have an actual debate.
Their initial position was to deny that any meddling by Ukraine took place at all. The problem with that is the New York Times broke the story in 2016 that an entire Ukrainian government agency was investigating Paul Manafort, who at the time was serving as Trump's campaign chairman.
Back then, the paper reported that Ukraine’s "newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau," which worked in conjunction with America's FBI, was in possession of a mysterious, handwritten diary that showed Manafort was receiving millions of dollars in payments from one of the country's pro-Russian politicians. "Investigators assert," the Times reported, "that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials."
Yes, I’m sure all of that was by coincidence, a matter of fate that Ukraine’s most consequential government agency was looking into the head of a major-party presidential campaign. It surely wasn’t a form of retaliation against Trump, who had been saying positive things about Russia.
And so, during the impeachment hearings last month, Republicans were able to finally jog the public’s memory and demonstrate that yes, there was something untoward about Joe Biden and his son’s involvement with a seedy Ukrainian gas company — and yes, government officials in Ukraine did oppose Trump.
After that, Democrats and the media admitted that Ukraine slid into 2016’s direct messages, but, they said, it wasn’t bad like the Russian meddling. They said Ukraine’s interference was essentially negligible, even though Politico in 2017 reported that “Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office” and “disseminat[ing] documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election.”
Late last month, Paul Farhi of the Washington Post looked back on that Politico report and belittled it for having “implied an equivalence with Russian efforts to undermine Clinton.” Ukraine’s interference, said Farhi, was not “the type of hacking and disinformation campaign waged by the Russians in 2016.”
So one man’s explicit, documented election interference by a foreign country is apparently another man’s “implied equivalence.” Okay.
As of Monday, we’ve discovered yet one more circle on the impeachment Twister map that Trump’s opponents can reach for. On his CNN show Monday, Chris Cuomo said Trump was “gladly giving life to conspiracy theories” and urging other Republicans to defend him, even though, Cuomo said, “Their own party debunked it in the Senate.”
The “debunked” part isn’t new. They’ve been claiming — without evidence! — that any suggestion Ukraine meddled in 2016 has been “debunked,” “discredited,” and “dismantled” throughout this entire freak show.
But the part about the GOP having “debunked it in the Senate” is based on a news report this week, purporting with a sleight of hand that Republicans know themselves that Ukraine had no substantial involvement in 2016.
That’s not true. The report by Politico said that “the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee thoroughly investigated that theory” about Ukraine and “found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016."
But who said anything about a “top-down interference campaign”? No one. What we know is that Ukrainian government officials, plus their most important government agency, used their power to influence and interfere in the 2016 election. Not a single person has suggested that the country’s leader directed any of it.
If it’s okay to just start making up what people are actually saying on the matter, let’s try it in reverse. How about we say that Democrats have investigated Russia’s interference in 2016 and found no evidence that Vladimir Putin directed agents to help Trump’s campaign by manipulating voter machines?
Was anyone saying that he did? No — but it’s been debunked by Democrats! So that means no Russian interference, right?
So, what’s their next position on Ukraine going to be?

Texto completo: A reader criticizes the president's lack of deep thinking, while another chides The Times for portraying his statement as a flip-flop. Also: Having to work on the holiday, and shopping all the time.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Remark About Taliban Stirs Confusion" (front page, Nov. 30), about the president's declaration that he had reopened peace negotiations with the Taliban:
There is nothing new about President Trump's penchant to sow confusion wherever he treads. His policies are not the result of deep or long-sustained thinking, but rather the instant reaction to a whim, or to a Sean Hannity professed desire. Often the superficial thought leads to a poor move. Consequently, he and his staff frequently walk it back and say he didn't say what everyone heard.
Unfortunately his quickness to act without listening to professionals and his lack of the intellectual patience of sustained thinking lead to uncertainty about what the United States plans to do and unsuccessful policy.
Simon Raskin
Spring Valley, N.Y.
To the Editor:
"Trump Remark About Taliban Stirs Confusion" is determined to paint a potentially constructive gesture on the part of the president as a flip-flop that has sent the diplomatic corps into a tailspin. It is hard to see pieces like this as fair and balanced.
If President Obama had reversed policy in favor of diplomacy over war, we would have all applauded. The conflict in Afghanistan has been going on for 18-plus years, America's longest war. If this president can end it, good for him. The difference between the left and the right really comes down to this: We on the left concede some points to them; they never concede points to us. If we attack on everything, we lose the high ground.

Shopping and Working on the Holiday
To the Editor:
Re "A Working Holiday" (Business, Nov. 30):
Can't Americans go even one day without shopping? Is it really necessary to have any number of retail stores open every day of the year?
Consumerism is becoming an addiction; let's restrain ourselves, folks, please.
Debby Teplin
New York
To the Editor:
I worked in broadcast news for 30 years, mostly weekends and holidays. What's the big deal? I didn't feel a sting at all, and I got overtime on holidays.
What I didn't get was an article on the front page of the business section written about me and my compadres, nor did we merit one.

Obama's White House counsel says Trump is 'worst nightmare' of Founding Fathers

Texto completo: Robert Bauer, the former White House counsel for Barack Obama, called President Trump "the demagogue" that the Founding Fathers "feared" and warned about.
"The founders feared the demagogue, who figures prominently in the Federalist Papers as the politician who, possessing 'perverted ambition,' pursues relentless self-aggrandizement 'by the confusions of their country,"' Bauer wrote in a Monday column for the New York Times titled "Trump Is the Founders’ Worst Nightmare." "The last of the papers, Federalist No. 85, linked demagogy to its threat to the constitutional order — to the 'despotism' that may be expected from the 'victorious demagogue.' This 'despotism' is achieved through systematic lying to the public, vilification of the opposition and, as James Fenimore Cooper wrote in an essay on demagogues, a claimed right to disregard 'the Constitution and the laws' in pursuing what the demagogue judges to be the 'interests of the people.'"
The former White House counsel issued his warning about Trump as House Democrats are preparing to start another round of public impeachment hearings. The 67-year-old lawyer pointed to Republican defenses of the president during the impeachment hearings as an example of Trumpian demagoguery.
"It’s all been very confusing. But the larger story — the crucial constitutional story — is not the incoherence of the president’s defense. It is more that he and his party are exposing limits of impeachment as a response to the presidency of a demagogue," he said.
Bauer compared Trump's behavior to Clinton when he was being impeached and Nixon when he was investigated over Watergate, saying both showed themselves willing to defend themselves and the constitutional order.
The White House announced Sunday that they were rejecting Chairman Jerry Nadler's invitation for them to be a part of the impeachment hearings on Wednesday in front of the House Judiciary Committee. The White House counsel called the investigation "baseless and highly partisan."
Pat Cipollone argued in his letter that Nadler "purposely" scheduled the hearings at the same time Trump was gone overseas. He added they would not participate in hearing it what "remains unclear" whether Trump will get "fair process."

White House counsel Bob Bauer, President Barack Obama's point man in the search for a new Supreme Court justice, manages to get credit both for an even temperament and his finesse with a sledge hammer.

John Kerry launches star-studded climate coalition

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Leaders of nations across the globe are failing to adequately address global warming, imperiling the future of their citizens, said former secretary of state John Kerry on Sunday in announcing his formation of a bipartisan coalition to push for immediate policy changes.
“There are great efforts out there; many environmental groups, young people, particularly, but no country is getting the job done," said the former senator from Massachusetts on NBC's “Meet the Press" with Chuck Todd. “I mean, the simple reality is that we are way behind, way behind the eight ball. Things are getting worse, not better."
The name of the coalition, World War Zero, is supposed to evoke both the national security threat posed by the Earth's warming and the type of wartime mobilization that Kerry argued would be needed to stop the rise in carbon emissions before 2050. The star-studded group is supposed to win over those skeptical of the policies that would be needed to accomplish that.
Former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are part of the effort. Moderate Republican lawmakers such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California, and John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio, are on the list. Stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sting, and Ashton Kutcher round out the roster of more than 60 founding members. Their goal is to hold more than 10 million “climate conversations" in the coming year with Americans across the political spectrum.
Schwarzenegger joined Kerry on the talk show Sunday. He cited California's growing economy even with some of the strictest environmental laws in the United States.
“It just shows to you the power that we have by going green and the kind of jobs we created," Schwarzenegger said. “And I think that's what we want to do: We want the whole United States to go in that direction, the whole world to go in that direction."
With a starting budget of $500,000, Kerry said, he and other coalition members intend to hold town meetings across the country starting in January. Members will head to battleground states key to the 2020 election but also to military bases where climate discussions are rare and to economically depressed areas that members say could benefit from clean-energy jobs.
“We're going to do the things we need to do. We're going to organize. We're going to mobilize. We're going to talk to literally millions of Americans over the course of the next months and this is going to become a primary issue," said Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president in 2004.
The launch of the new group comes as diplomats gather in Madrid on Monday for global climate negotiations aimed at strengthening the 2015 Paris Agreement, from which President Trump has vowed to withdraw next year. Earlier this week the United Nations found that the world's richest countries, responsible for emitting more than three-fourths of planet-warming pollution, are not doing enough to keep Earth's temperature from rising to dangerously high levels. Net carbon emissions from the two largest polluters, the United States and China, are expanding.
Sarah Matthews, a spokeswoman for Trump's reelection campaign, said in a statement that the administration “continues to advance realistic solutions to reduce emissions while unleashing American energy like never before." Asked to comment on the new bipartisan group, she also criticized efforts to force the United States to cut emissions, arguing “the largest emitters like China and India won't do the same."
Kerry said that although individual members might personally promote specific climate policy proposals, like a tax on carbon dioxide pollution, or the Green New Deal, the coalition is not aimed at promoting any particular plan.
“We're not going to be divided going down a rabbit hole for one plan or another," he told The New York Times.
The Green New Deal envisions addressing climate change and income inequality in tandem, with a federal job guarantee and federal mandates like ensuring the country's power and electricity systems run entirely on renewable energy by 2030. The Sunrise Movement, a climate activist group that promotes the Green New Deal, has been critical of global warming efforts that do not embrace that vision, but its leaders held their fire on Kerry's group.
Kasich said in an interview with The New York Times that he believed in finding a consensus among Americans to tackle climate change, and saw a solution in both putting a price on carbon and increasing the research, development, and deployment of renewable energy. He also said natural gas would continue to play a part, especially gas produced by hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking," which has brought jobs to his state.
“If I've got to sign up to be an anti-fracker, count me out," Kasich said.
Katie Eder, founder of The Future Coalition, a network for youth-led organizations that helped organize climate strikes around the country in September, supports the Green New Deal and is a member of Kerry's coalition. She said people who cared about climate change needed to look past their differences.
“While I may be disagreeing with some of the things that other folks involved in World War Zero believe, that doesn't mean we can't work together," she said. “Collaboration is our key to survival."

Texto completo: There is not much air on Mars - the atmospheric pressure there is less than one one-hundredth of what we breathe on Earth - but what little is there has baffled planetary scientists.
Oxygen, which makes up about 0.13% of the Martian atmosphere, is the latest puzzler.
In a paper published in November in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, scientists working with data gathered by NASA’s Curiosity rover reported that levels of oxygen unexpectedly varied with the seasons on Mars, at least in the neighborhood that Curiosity has been driving around since 2012.
That follows the rover’s reading earlier this year of a large burst of methane, another gas emitted on Earth by living things and which perplexingly disappeared almost immediately.
“It’s confusing but it’s exciting,” said Sushil Atreya, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan who works on Curiosity’s atmospheric measurements. “It keeps us on our toes. Mars is certainly not boring.”
A Mars year lasts 687 days, so the scientists studying the oxygen variations were able to examine the behavior over almost three Martian years, through December 2017.
The level of oxygen “rises relatively higher in the spring,” said Melissa Trainer, a research space scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the new paper, “and then it comes down lower, below what we would expect later in the year.”
Carbon dioxide is the main ingredient of Martian air, and scientists have understood for decades its ebb and flow. At the poles in winter, it falls out of the air and freezes to ice, then wafts back into the atmosphere as temperatures warm in the spring.
High in the Martian atmosphere, ultraviolet light breaks apart carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms, and then closer to the ground, interactions with water shepherd the oxygen atoms into molecular pairs.
Because oxygen molecules should be pretty stable, persisting about a decade, researchers expected that the amount of oxygen molecules would remain almost constant.
Curiosity’s atmospheric measurements showed exactly that pattern for nitrogen and argon, two other trace gases in the Martian atmosphere. But, for oxygen, the concentrations shot up by a third during spring.
“This was a very unexpected result, an unexpected phenomenon,” Trainer said. “There’s a lot we don’t know about the oxygen cycle on Mars. That’s become apparent.”
Adding to the mystery, the cycle was not the same each year, and the scientists could not find an obvious explanation - like temperature, dust storms or ultraviolet radiation - for what changed from year to year.
On Earth, most oxygen is generated by the photosynthesis of plants. But so far, for the Mars scientists, that is far down on the list of explanations. “You’ve got to rule out all of the other processes first before you go there,” Atreya said.
More likely sources are chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates known to exist in the Martian dirt. “It’s pretty clear you need a flux from the surface,” Atreya said. “Nothing in the atmosphere is going to create this kind of rise.”
But how these chemicals might release and absorb enough oxygen to explain the seasonal rise and fall is difficult to figure out, especially as there are only 19 oxygen measurements over 5½ years.
An intriguing possibility is that the oxygen mystery might be tied to another trace gas, methane, that is also acting strangely in the Martian atmosphere.

Texto completo: Soon after the sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein died in August, a mysterious man met with two prominent lawyers.
Towering, barrel-chested and wild-bearded, he was a prodigious drinker and often wore flip-flops. He went by a pseudonym, Patrick Kessler -- a necessity, he said, given the shadowy, dangerous world that he inhabited.
He told the lawyers he had something incendiary: a vast archive of Mr. Epstein's data, stored on encrypted servers overseas. He said he had years of the financier's communications and financial records -- as well as thousands of hours of footage from hidden cameras in the bedrooms of Mr. Epstein's properties. The videos, Kessler said, captured some of the world's richest, most powerful men in compromising sexual situations -- even in the act of rape.

A mysterious man told us he had surveillance footage from Jeffrey Epstein's properties. Then his story took a turn.

Kessler said he wanted to expose these men. If he was telling the truth, his trove could answer one of the Epstein saga's most baffling questions: How did a college dropout and high school math teacher amass a purported nine-figure fortune? One persistent but unproven theory was that he ran a sprawling blackmail operation. That would explain why moguls, scientists, political leaders and a royal stayed loyal to him, in some cases even after he first went to jail.
Kessler's tale was enough to hook the two lawyers, the famed litigator David Boies and his friend John Stanley Pottinger. If Kessler was authentic, his videos would arm them with immense leverage over some very important people.
Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger discussed a plan. They could use the supposed footage in litigation or to try to reach deals with men who appeared in it, with money flowing into a charitable foundation. In encrypted chats with Kessler, Mr. Pottinger referred to a roster of potential targets as the "hot list." He described hypothetical plans in which the lawyers would pocket up to 40 percent of the settlements and could extract money from wealthy men by flipping from representing victims to representing their alleged abusers.
The possibilities were tantalizing -- and extended beyond vindicating victims. Mr. Pottinger saw a chance to supercharge his law practice. For Mr. Boies, there was a shot at redemption, after years of criticism for his work on behalf of Theranos and Harvey Weinstein.
In the end, there would be no damning videos, no funds pouring into a new foundation. Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger would go from toasting Kessler as their "whistle-blower" and "informant" to torching him as a "fraudster" and a "spy."
Kessler was a liar, and he wouldn't expose any sexual abuse. But he would reveal something else: The extraordinary, at times deceitful measures elite lawyers deployed in an effort to get evidence that could be used to win lucrative settlements -- and keep misconduct hidden, allowing perpetrators to abuse again.
Mr. Boies has publicly decried such secret deals as "rich man's justice," a way that powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy. This is how it works.
7 men and a headless parrot
The man who called himself Kessler first contacted a Florida lawyer, Bradley J. Edwards, who was in the news for representing women with claims against Mr. Epstein. It was late August, about two weeks after the financier killed himself in a jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.
Mr. Edwards, who did not respond to interview requests, had a law firm called Edwards Pottinger, and he soon referred Kessler to his New York partner. Silver-haired and 79, Mr. Pottinger had been a senior civil-rights official in the Nixon and Ford administrations, but he also dabbled in investment banking and wrote best-selling medical thrillers. He was perhaps best known for having dated Gloria Steinem and Kathie Lee Gifford.
Mr. Pottinger recalled that Mr. Edwards warned him about Kessler, saying that he was "endearing," "spooky" and "loves to drink like a fish."
After an initial discussion with Kessler in Washington, Mr. Pottinger briefed Mr. Boies -- whose firm was also active in representing accusers in the Epstein case -- about the sensational claims. He then invited Kessler to his Manhattan apartment. Kessler admired a wall-mounted frame containing a headless stuffed parrot; on TV, the Philadelphia Eagles were mounting a comeback against the Washington Redskins. Mr. Pottinger poured Kessler a glass of WhistlePig whiskey, and the informant began to talk.
In his conversations with Mr. Pottinger and, later, Mr. Boies, Kessler said his videos featured numerous powerful men who were already linked to Mr. Epstein: Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister; Alan Dershowitz, a constitutional lawyer; Prince Andrew; three billionaires; and a prominent chief executive.
All seven men, or their representatives, told The New York Times they never engaged in sexual activity on Mr. Epstein's properties. The Times has no reason to believe Kessler's supposed video footage is real.
In his apartment, Mr. Pottinger presented Kessler with a signed copy of "The Boss," his 2005 novel. "One minute you're bending the rules," blares the cover of the paperback version. "The next minute you're breaking the law." On the title page, Mr. Pottinger wrote: "Here's to the great work you are to do. Happy to be part of it."
Mr. Pottinger also gave Kessler a draft contract to bring him on as a client, allowing him to use a fake name. "For reasons revealed to you, I prefer to proceed with this engagement under the name Patrick Kessler," the agreement said.
Despite the enormities of the Epstein scandal, few of his accusers have gotten a sense of justice or resolution. Mr. Pottinger thought Kessler's files could change everything. This strange man was theatrical and liked his alcohol, but if there was even a chance his claims were true, they were worth pursuing.
"Our clients are said to be liars and prostitutes," Mr. Pottinger later said in an interview with The Times, "and we now have someone who says, 'I can give you secret photographic proof of abuse that will completely change the entire fabric of your practice and get justice for these girls.' And you think that we wouldn't try to get that?"
A victim becomes a hacker
Mr. Pottinger and Mr. Boies have known each other for years, a friendship forged on bike trips in France and Italy. In legal circles, Mr. Boies was royalty: He was the one who fought for presidential candidate Al Gore before the Supreme Court, took on Microsoft in a landmark antitrust case, and helped obtain the right for gays and lesbians to get married in California.
But then Mr. Boies got involved with the blood-testing start-up Theranos. As the company was being revealed as a fraud, he tried to bully whistle-blowers into not speaking to a Wall Street Journal reporter, and he was criticized for possible conflicts of interest when he joined the company's board in 2015.
Two years later, Mr. Boies helped his longtime client Harvey Weinstein hire private investigators who intimidated sources and trailed reporters for The Times and The New Yorker -- even though Mr. Boies's firm had worked for The Times on other matters. (The Times fired his firm.)
By 2019, Mr. Boies, 78, was representing a number of Mr. Epstein's alleged victims. They got his services pro bono, and he got the chance to burnish his legacy. When Mr. Pottinger contacted him about Kessler, he was intrigued.
On Sept. 9, Mr. Boies greeted Kessler at the offices of his law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, in a gleaming new skyscraper at Hudson Yards on Manhattan's West Side. Kessler unfurled a fantastic story, one he would embroider and alter in later weeks, that began with him growing up somewhere within a three-hour radius of Washington. Kessler said he had been molested as a boy by a Bible school teacher and sought solace on the internet, where he fell in with a group of victims turned hackers, who used their skills to combat pedophilia.
Kessler claimed that a technology executive had introduced him to Mr. Epstein, who in 2012 hired Kessler to set up encrypted servers to preserve his extensive digital archives. With Mr. Epstein dead, Kessler boasted to the lawyers, he had unfettered access to the material. He said the volume of videos was overwhelming: more than a decade of round-the-clock footage from dozens of cameras.
Kessler displayed some pixelated video stills on his phone. In one, a bearded man with his mouth open appears to be having sex with a naked woman. Kessler said the man was Mr. Barak. In another, a man with black-framed glasses is seen shirtless with a woman on his lap, her breasts exposed. Kessler said it was Mr. Dershowitz. He also said that some of the supposed videos appeared to have been edited and cataloged for the purpose of blackmail.
"This was explosive information if true, for lots and lots of people," Mr. Boies said in an interview.
Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger had decades of legal experience and considered themselves experts at assessing witnesses' credibility. While they couldn't be sure, they thought Kessler was probably legit.
A chance to sway the Israeli election
Within hours of the Hudson Yards meeting, Mr. Pottinger sent Kessler a series of texts over the encrypted messaging app Signal.
According to excerpts viewed by The Times, Mr. Pottinger and Kessler discussed a plan to disseminate some of the informant's materials -- starting with the supposed footage of Mr. Barak. The Israeli election was barely a week away, and Mr. Barak was challenging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The purported images of Mr. Barak might be able to sway the election -- and fetch a high price. ("Total lie with no basis in reality," Mr. Barak said when asked about the existence of such videos.)
"Can you review your visual evidence to be sure some or all is indisputably him? If so, we can make it work," Mr. Pottinger wrote.
Kessler said he would do so. Mr. Pottinger sent a yellow smiley-face emoji with its tongue sticking out.
"Can you share your contact that would be purchasing," Kessler asked.
"Sheldon Adelson," Mr. Pottinger answered.
Mr. Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate in Las Vegas, had founded one of Israel's largest newspapers, and it was an enthusiastic booster of Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Pottinger wrote that he and Mr. Boies hoped to fly to Nevada to meet with Mr. Adelson to discuss the images.
"Do you believe that adelson has the pull to insure this will hurt his bid for election?" Kessler asked the next morning.
Mr. Pottinger reassured him. "There is no question that Adelson has the capacity to air the truth about EB if he wants to," he said, using Mr. Barak's initials. He said he planned to discuss the matter with Mr. Boies that evening.
Mr. Boies confirmed that they discussed sharing the photo with Mr. Adelson but said the plan was never executed. Boaz Bismuth, the editor in chief of the newspaper, Israel Hayom, said its journalists were approached by an Israeli source who pitched them supposed images of Mr. Barak, but that "we were not interested."
'These are wealthy wrongdoers'
The men whom Kessler claimed to have on tape were together worth many billions. Some of their public relations teams had spent months trying to tamp down media coverage of their connections to Mr. Epstein. Imagine how much they might pay to make incriminating videos vanish.
You might think that lawyers representing abuse victims would want to publicly expose such information to bolster their clients' claims. But that is not how the legal industry always works. Often, keeping things quiet is good business.
One of the revelations of the #MeToo era has been that victims' lawyers often brokered secret deals in which alleged abusers paid to keep their accusers quiet and the allegations out of the public sphere. Lawyers can pocket at least a third of such settlements, profiting off a system that masks misconduct and allows men to abuse again.
Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger said in interviews that they were looking into creating a charity to help victims of sexual abuse. It would be bankrolled by private legal settlements with the men on the videos.
Mr. Boies acknowledged that Kessler might get paid. "If we were able to use this to help our victims recover money, we would treat him generously," he said in September. He said that his firm would not get a cut of any settlements.
Such agreements would have made it less likely that videos involving the men became public. "Generally what settlements are about is getting peace," Mr. Boies said.
Mr. Pottinger told Kessler that the charity he was setting up would be called the Astria Foundation -- a name he later said his girlfriend came up with, in a nod to Astraea, the Greek goddess of innocence and justice. "We need to get it funded by abusers," Mr. Pottinger texted, noting in another message that "these are wealthy wrongdoers."
Mr. Pottinger asked Kessler to start compiling incriminating materials on a specific group of men.
"I'm way ahead of you," Kessler responded. He said he had asked his team of fellow hackers to search the files for the three billionaires, the C.E.O. and Prince Andrew.
"Yes, that's exactly how to do this," Mr. Pottinger said. "Videos for sure, but email traffic, too."
"I call it our hot list," he added.
A quiet table at the back of Grand Sichuan
In mid-September, Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger invited reporters from The Times to the Boies Schiller offices to meet Kessler. The threat of a major news organization writing about the videos -- and confirming the existence of an extensive surveillance apparatus -- could greatly enhance the lawyers' leverage over the wealthy men.
Before the session, Mr. Pottinger encouraged Kessler to focus on certain men, like Mr. Barak, while avoiding others. Referring to the reporters, he added, "Let them drink from a fountain instead of a water hose. They and the readers will follow that better."
The meeting took place on a cloudy Saturday morning. After agreeing to leave their phones and laptops outside, the reporters entered a 20th-floor conference room. Kessler was huge: more than 6 feet tall, pushing 300 pounds, balding, his temples speckled with gray. He told his story and presented images that he said were of Mr. Epstein, Mr. Barak and Mr. Dershowitz having sex with women.
Barely an hour after the session ended, the Times reporters received an email from Kessler: "Are you free?" He said he wanted to meet -- alone. "Tell no one else." That afternoon, they met at Grand Sichuan, an iconic Chinese restaurant in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The lunch rush was over, and the trio sat at a quiet table in the back. A small group of women huddled nearby, speaking Mandarin and snipping the ends off string beans.
Kessler complained that Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger were more interested in making money than in exposing wrongdoers. He pulled out his phone, warned the reporters not to touch it, and showed more of what he had. There was a color photo of a bare-chested, gray-haired man with a slight smile. Kessler said it was a billionaire. He also showed blurry, black-and-white images of a dark-haired man receiving oral sex. He said it was a prominent C.E.O.
Soup dumplings and Gui Zhou chicken arrived, and Kessler kept talking. He said he had found financial ledgers on Mr. Epstein's servers that showed he had vast amounts of Bitcoin and cash in the Middle East and Bangkok, and hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of gold, silver and diamonds. He presented no proof. But it is common for whistle-blowers to be erratic and slow to produce their evidence, and The Times thought it was worth investigating Kessler's claims.
The conversation continued in a conference room at a Washington hotel five days later, after a text exchange in which Kessler noted his enthusiasm for Japanese whiskey. Both parties brought bottles to the hotel, and Kessler spent nearly eight hours downing glass after glass. He veered from telling tales about the dark web to professing love for "Little House on the Prairie." He asserted that he had evidence Mr. Epstein had derived his wealth through illicit means. At one point, he showed what he said were classified C.I.A. documents.
Kessler said he had no idea who the women in the videos were or how the lawyers might go about identifying them to act on their behalf. From his perspective, he said, it seemed like Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger were plotting to use his footage to demand huge sums from billionaires. He said it looked like blackmail -- and that he could prove it.
'We keep it. We keep everything'
Was Kessler's story plausible? Did America's best-connected sexual predator accumulate incriminating videos of powerful men?
Two women who spent time in Mr. Epstein's homes said the answer was yes. In an unpublished memoir, Virginia Giuffre, who accused Mr. Epstein of making her a "sex slave," wrote that she discovered a room in his New York mansion where monitors displayed real-time surveillance footage. And Maria Farmer, an artist who accused Mr. Epstein of sexually assaulting her when she worked for him in the 1990s, said that Mr. Epstein once walked her through the mansion, pointing out pin-sized cameras that he said were in every room.
"I said, 'Are you recording all this?"' Ms. Farmer said in an interview. "He said, 'Yes. We keep it. We keep everything."'
During a 2005 search of Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach, Fla., estate, the police found two cameras hidden in clocks -- one in the garage and the other next to his desk, according to police reports. But no other cameras were found.
If such a surveillance system did exist, nothing that Kessler told or showed The Times proved that he had access to it. The photos he shared were too grainy to establish anyone's identity. And many other elements of his story failed to hold up under scrutiny.
Kessler claimed to have been an early investor in a North Carolina coffee company, whose sticker was affixed to his laptop. But its founder said no one matching Kessler's description had ever been affiliated with the company. Kessler insisted that he invested in 2009, but the company wasn't founded until 2011.
The contents of Kessler's supposed C.I.A. documents turned out to be easily findable using Google. At one point, Kessler said that one of his associates had been missing and was found dead; later, Kessler said the man was alive and in the southern United States. He said that his mother had died when he was young -- and that he had recently given her a hug. A photo he sent from what he said was a Washington-area hospital featured a distinctive blanket, but when The Times called local hospitals, they didn't recognize the pattern.
After months of effort, The Times could not learn Kessler's identity or confirm any element of his back story.
"I am very often being purposefully inconsistent," Kessler said, when pressed.
A Weinstein cameo
On the last Friday in September, Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger sat on a blue leather couch in the corner of a members-only dining room at the Harvard Club in Midtown Manhattan. Antlered animal heads and oil paintings hung from the dark wooden walls.
The lawyers were there to make a deal with The Times. Tired of waiting for Kessler's motherlode, Mr. Pottinger said they planned to send a team overseas to download the material from his servers. He said he had alerted the F.B.I. and a prosecutor in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.
Mr. Boies told an editor for The Times that they would be willing to share everything, on one condition: They would have discretion over which men could be written about, and when. He explained that if compromising videos about particular men became public, that could torpedo litigation or attempts to negotiate settlements. The Times editor didn't commit.
Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger later said those plans had hinged on verifying the videos' authenticity and on having clients with legitimate legal claims against the men. Otherwise, legal experts said, it might have crossed the line into extortion.
The meeting was briefly interrupted when Bob Weinstein, the brother of Harvey Weinstein, bounded up to the table and plopped onto the couch next to Mr. Boies. The two men spent several minutes talking, laughing and slapping each other on the back.
While Mr. Boies and Mr. Weinstein chatted, Mr. Pottinger furtively displayed the black-and-white shot of a man in glasses having sex. Both lawyers said it looked like Mr. Dershowitz.
'You don't keep your glasses on when you're doing that'
One day in late September, Mr. Dershowitz's secretary relayed a message: Someone named Patrick Kessler wanted to speak to him about Mr. Boies.
The two lawyers had a long-running feud, and Mr. Dershowitz returned the call from his apartment. He also recorded it. Kessler explained his Epstein story, and that he no longer trusted Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger.
"The problem is that they don't want to move forward with any of these people legally," Kessler said. "They're just interested in trying to settle and take a cut."
"Who are these people that you have on videotape?" Mr. Dershowitz asked.
"There's a lot of people," Kessler said, naming a few powerful men. He added, "There's a long list of people that they want me to have that I don't have."
"Who?" Mr. Dershowitz asked. "Did they ask about me?"
"Of course they asked about you. You know that, sir."
"And you don't have anything on me, right?"
"I do not, no," Kessler said.
"Because I never, I never had sex with anybody," Mr. Dershowitz said. Later in the call, he added, "I am completely clean. I was at Jeffrey's house. I stayed there. But I didn't have any sex with anybody."
What was the purpose of Kessler's phone call? Why did he tell Mr. Dershowitz that he wasn't on the supposed surveillance tapes, contradicting what he had said and showed to Mr. Boies, Mr. Pottinger and The Times? Did the call sound a little rehearsed?
Mr. Dershowitz said that he didn't know why Kessler contacted him, and that the phone call was the only time the two men ever spoke. When The Times showed him one of Kessler's photos, in which a bespectacled man resembling Mr. Dershowitz appears to be having sex, Mr. Dershowitz laughed and said the man wasn't him. His wife, Carolyn Cohen, peeked at the photo, too.
"You don't keep your glasses on when you're doing that," she said.
Data set (supposedly) to self-destruct
In early October, Kessler said he was ready to produce the Epstein files. He told The Times that he had created duplicate versions of Mr. Epstein's servers. He laid out detailed logistical plans for them to be shipped by boat to the United States and for one of his associates -- a very short Icelandic man named Steven -- to deliver them to The Times headquarters at 11 a.m. on Oct. 3.
Kessler warned that he was erecting a maze of security systems. First, a Times employee would need to use a special thumb drive to access a proprietary communications system. Then Kessler's colleague would transmit a code to decrypt the files. If his instructions weren't followed precisely, Kessler said, the information would self-destruct.
Specialists at The Times set up a number of "air-gapped" laptops -- disconnected from the internet -- in a windowless, padlocked meeting room. Reporters cleared their schedules to sift through thousands of hours of surveillance footage.
On the morning of the scheduled delivery, Kessler sent a series of frantic texts. Disaster had struck. A fire was burning. The duplicate servers were destroyed. One of his team members was missing. He was fleeing to Kyiv.
Two hours later, Kessler was in touch with Mr. Pottinger and didn't mention any emergency. Kessler said he hoped that the footage would help pry $ 1 billion in settlements out of their targets, and asked him to detail how the lawyers could extract the money. "Could you put together a hypothetical situation," Kessler wrote, not something "set in stone but close to what your thinking."
Mr. Pottinger obliged -- and walked into what looked like a trap. He described two hypotheticals, both of which were consistent with what had been discussed with The Times at the Harvard Club.
In one, which he called a "standard model" for legal settlements, Mr. Pottinger said the money would be split among his clients, the Astria Foundation, Kessler and the lawyers, who would get up to 40 percent.
In the second hypothetical, Mr. Pottinger wrote, the lawyers would approach the videotaped men. The men would then hire the lawyers, ensuring that they would not get sued, and "make a contribution to a nonprofit as part of the retainer."
"No client is actually involved in this structure," Mr. Pottinger said, noting that the arrangement would have to be "consistent with and subject to rules of ethics."
"Thank you very much," Kessler responded.
Mr. Pottinger later said that the scenario would have involved him representing a victim, settling a case and then representing the victim's alleged abuser. He said it was within legal boundaries. (He also said he had meant to type "No client lawsuit is actually involved.")
Such legal arrangements are not unheard-of. Lawyers representing a former Fox News producer who had accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment reached a settlement in which her lawyers agreed to work for Mr. O'Reilly after the dispute. But legal experts generally consider such setups to be unethical because they can create conflicts between the interests of the lawyers and their original clients.
'I just pulled it out of my behind'
The lawyers held out hope of getting Kessler's materials. But weeks passed, and nothing arrived. At one point, Mr. Pottinger volunteered to meet Kessler anywhere -- including Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia.
"I still believe he is what he purported to be," Mr. Boies wrote in an email on Nov. 7. "I have to evaluate people for my day job, and he seemed too genuine to be a fake, and I very much want him to be real." He added, "I am not unconscious of the danger of wanting to believe something too much."
Ten days later, Mr. Boies arrived at The Times for an on-camera interview. It was a bright, chilly Sunday, and Mr. Boies had just flown in from Ecuador, where he said he was doing work for the finance ministry. Reporters wanted to ask him plainly if his and Mr. Pottinger's conduct with Kessler crossed ethical lines.
Would they have brokered secret settlements that buried evidence of wrongdoing? Did the notion of extracting huge sums from men in exchange for keeping sex tapes hidden meet the definition of extortion?
Mr. Boies said the answer to both questions was no. He said he and Mr. Pottinger operated well within the law. They only intended to pursue legal action on behalf of their clients -- in other words, that they were a long way from extortion. In any case, he said, he and Mr. Pottinger had never authenticated any of the imagery or identified any of the supposed victims, much less contacted any of the men on the "hot list."
Then The Times showed Mr. Boies some of the text exchanges between Mr. Pottinger and Kessler. Mr. Boies showed a flash of anger and said it was the first time he was seeing them.
By the end of the nearly four-hour interview, Mr. Boies had concluded that Kessler was probably a con man: "I think that he was a fraudster who was just trying to set things up." And he argued that Kessler had baited Mr. Pottinger into writing things that looked more nefarious than they really were. He acknowledged that Mr. Pottinger had used "loose language" in some of his messages that risked creating the impression that the lawyers were plotting to monetize evidence of abuse.
Several days later, Mr. Boies returned for another interview and was more critical of Mr. Pottinger, especially the hypothetical plans that he had described to Kessler. "Having looked at all that stuff in context, I would not have said that," he said. How did Mr. Boies feel about Mr. Pottinger invoking his name in messages to Kessler? "I don't like it," he said.
But Mr. Boies stopped short of blaming Mr. Pottinger for the whole mess. "I'm being cautious not to throw him under the bus more than I believe is accurate," he said. His longtime P.R. adviser, Dawn Schneider, who had been pushing for a more forceful denunciation, dropped her pen, threw up her arms and buried her head in her hands.
In a separate interview, The Times asked Mr. Pottinger about his correspondence with Kessler. The lawyer said that his messages shouldn't be taken at face value because, in reality, he had been deceiving Kessler all along -- "misleading him deliberately in order to get the servers."
The draft retention agreement that Mr. Pottinger had given to Kessler in September was unsigned and never meant to be honored, Mr. Pottinger said. And he never intended to sell photos of Mr. Barak to Mr. Adelson. "I just pulled it out of my behind," he said, describing it as an act to impress Kessler.
As for the two hypotheticals about how to get money out of the men on the list, Mr. Pottinger said, he never planned to do what he carefully articulated. "I didn't owe Patrick honesty about this," he said.
Mr. Pottinger said that he had only one regret -- that "we did not get the information that this liar said he had."
He added, "I'm building legal cases here. I'm trying not to engage too much in shenanigans. I wish I didn't, but this guy was very unusual."

Texto completo: The struggle for the presidency has spawned a Florida hurricane - a storm of historic proportions that threatens our shared identity as Americans -and Americans of color find ourselves at the center of that storm.
Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has effectively ended the presidential race, there is little doubt that the enormous outpouring of African American and Hispanic American voters in Florida denied Governor Bush the kind of convincing victory that could have given reactionary policies a national mandate.
There also seems to be little doubt that Americans of color in Florida were denied their fundamental right to vote. During a recent meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno, she reaffirmed that the Justice Department is investigating alleged criminal violations. On December 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights also decided to investigate complaints that black voters' civil rights were violated.
The conduct of Florida's election is gaining national attention in publications such as the New York Times and the Washington Post because of issues far more substantive than the distinction between "hanging and dimpled chads." That is why my colleague and friend, Florida Congresswoman Conine Brown, and other civil rights leaders have filed suit in Florida courts.
They understand that fundamental questions remain unanswered by the Supreme Court's decision. "There are serious problems here in Duval County," Congresswoman Brown observed, "and we're going to get them fixed. Our deadline is four years from now."
Hers is a search for the truth in which all Americans have an interest. We intuitively understand that our freedom depends upon knowing the truth about the important issues in our lives.
That is why Americans deserved to know the truth about the thousands of Florida ballots which outdated machines failed to read.
We were heartened when we saw teams led by Leon County Circuit Court judges begin to examine the disputed Florida "undercount" ballots, just as we were surprised and appalled when five Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court stopped the Florida judges from counting those votes.
By stopping the counting even before it decided the case, the Supreme Court engaged in a blatant, premature and unwise intrusion into the political process. Appalled, millions of Americans necessarily asked what higher interest could conceivably justify denial of our constitutional right to know the full and complete truth about this election.
Justice Scalia could offer only the transparent declaration that "the counting of votes that are of questionable legality . .." would threaten irreparable harm to Governor Bush "... by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election."
Yet, as the pending civil rights investigations in Florida properly illustrate, courts in a free society usually determine the facts before applying the law to those facts.
A free society does not deprive its citizens of legally authorized review of their ballots based upon nothing more substantial than an assumption about the eventual political outcome. Justice Scalia's conclusion, however, appears to have been based upon just such an assumption - that partisan Republican actions in Florida would make George W. Bush President of the United States no matter what a fair examination of the ballots revealed.
If, as Justice Scalia asserted, the mere appearance of legitimacy is sufficiently important to overrule the sanctity of the ballot, then there truly is a clear and present danger to our most basic freedom as a people. As Justice John Paul Stevens declared, "preventing the recount from being completed will inevitably cast a cloud on the legitimacy of this election."
Cloud or not, this country must have a President. Governor Bush received nearly one-half the votes nationwide, and now the Supreme Court has broken the statistical tie. We have no choice but to work together for the people we are duty-bound to serve.
We cannot forget, however, that African Americans in large numbers were denied the power of their ballot and, as a result, that the majority of all American voters were denied their choice as President of the United States.
Thanks to people like Congresswoman Corrine Brown, the whole truth about the election in Florida will be revealed. Then, in due course, we will act on that truth, peacefully organizing to restore democracy in America.
We will know the truth, and that truth will make us free.

Jamelle Bouie: ‘Watchmen’ dares to imagine a righteous black vigilante

Texto completo: This essay includes spoilers for the sixth episode of HBO’s “Watchmen.”
You can think of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ “Watchmen” graphic novel series as an extended answer to a set of questions about the superhero as an idea and an ideal.
What kind of society produces masked, costumed vigilantes? What kind of person puts on the mask to begin with? How do people, ordinary and extraordinary, react in the face of the incomprehensible, from total annihilation to the otherworldly?
Since Moore and Gibbons’ original series was published in 12 issues from 1986 to 1987, other writers and artists have created within the universe they built. Warner Bros. released a “Watchmen” feature film in 2009, directed by Zack Snyder, and DC Comics has produced prequels and spinoffs. But all fell flat. Not because they weren’t skillfully made, but because they missed the point. “Watchmen” is a compelling story, but the essence of the series is its critical eye — Moore and Gibbons’ attempt to show us something about our world through skillful deconstruction of a fictional one.
Where past adaptations have failed, I think HBO’s “Watchmen,” currently airing in its first season, succeeds. It shares the critical eye of its predecessor and attempts to answer the same questions. But where Moore and Gibbons were writing in the context of Ronald Reagan’s America — with its greed and militarism and Cold War tensions — showrunner Damon Lindelof and his collaborators are working in today’s context of racial violence and resurgent white nationalism.
HBO’s “Watchmen,” in other words, is trying to analyze masked vigilantes through the prism of race and racial injustice. And while this has been evident from the beginning — the series opens with a harrowing dramatization of the 1921 Tulsa, Oklahoma, massacre, in which a white mob destroyed the affluent black neighborhood of Greenwood, killing hundreds and displacing thousands — it has become even more apparent with Sunday night’s episode, titled “This Extraordinary Being.”
In it, we learn the origins of Hooded Justice, the first vigilante hero in the world of Watchmen. In the original comics, the identity of Hooded Justice is a mystery that goes unsolved. In HBO’s “Watchmen,” we’re treated to speculation in the form of “American Hero Story,” a show within a show. It depicts the in-universe past as a gritty, violent action series — a callback to and satire of Snyder’s “Watchmen,” which used the thematically rich source material as fodder for high-definition brutality. The Hooded Justice of “American Hero Story” is a powerful, hyperaggressive vigilante, clad in hood and noose and clearly — underneath it all — played by a white actor (Cheyenne Jackson).
But through an extended flashback, what we learn from this latest episode is that he was in fact a black man: a young New York City police officer in the late 1930s named Will Reeves (Jovan Adepo). We’ve already been introduced to an older version of Reeves. A survivor of the Tulsa massacre, he’s the grandfather (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) of the show’s protagonist, Angela Abar (Regina King). He’s also the prime suspect in the murder of Tulsa’s chief of police — the present-day event that sets off the show’s narrative.
After arresting a white man for setting fire to a Jewish deli, the young Reeves is beaten and nearly lynched by three white officers, who are leaders of the city’s Ku Klux Klan. As he walks away from the site of the attack — bloodied and draped in a hood and a noose — he sees a mugging. He could walk away. Instead, he acts. He fights off the attackers. The next morning, the local paper notes the altercation. Hooded Justice is born.
Practically impotent as a black police officer, Reeves has power to act while under the hood. But the mask doesn’t conceal everything — the skin around his eyes still marks him as black. And so he wears makeup and gloves to conceal his racial identity, to let the public believe that their hero is a white man.
Reeves eventually joins a group of costumed vigilantes and works with them, hoping the entire time they will assist him in his fight against the Klan. But they refuse. His lover, a hero called Captain Metropolis (Jake McDorman), believes he is delusional — that there’s no threat to the city’s blacks other than themselves. Reeves takes things into his own hands. He finds the Klan hideout. He kills everyone, including his fellow cops. He burns their building down and returns home. His wife, horrified by his violence, leaves with their son. And he decides to quit. Hooded Justice disappears.
I’ve left out a lot of details, but this is the heart of the narrative. And more than anything else in the series so far, it’s an attempt to grapple with the questions Moore and Gibbons pose in the original comic. Again, what kind of society produces masked vigilantes? Who takes on the mask?
The answer? A society shaped by profound injustice, where the victims have little recourse. Reeves could have been killed as a child in Tulsa; he could have been lynched as an adult in New York. Nothing would have been done because nothing was ever done. In the show (as well as our own world) there were few consequences for racial violence and terrorism.
That society would produce someone who sought to strike back, someone who would try to deliver justice to those whose power in a racial caste system puts them beyond accountability. The people motivated to take justice into their own hands would be those for whom the law is not an option for themselves and their communities.
It’s not a plot contrivance that Hooded Justice is black — it couldn’t be any other way. A society that brims with the unresolved pain and anguish of racial trauma can’t help producing a reaction. Hooded Justice is violent and uncompromising. He beats and kills and acts in contempt of the law. But HBO’s “Watchmen” suggests his crusade is fundamentally righteous — that his brutal work is necessary.
Our society does not have masked vigilantes meting out punishment to racists. But if there were a Hooded Justice — if our history of racial violence and trauma had produced an avenger, of sorts — then “Watchmen” seems to say that whether or not it’s right, it is justified.

NC Stage's 'Handle with Care' brings romance to holidays

Texto completo: She speaks Hebrew. He doesn't — unless memorizing the haftorah for his bar mitzvah counts. Yet, somehow, due to an unexpected tragedy, these two understand one another on a deeper level.
In North Carolina Stage Company's "Handle With Care," a romantic holiday-themed comedy opening Dec. 4, circumstances both hilarious and tragic bring together a young Israeli woman and a young American man. Is their inevitable love an accident? Or is it destiny, generations in the making?
"Handle With Care" opens on a snowy Christmas Eve in Virginia, as a tense situation quickly unfolds. Delivery driver Terrence's truck, with all his cargo, has gone missing, and Ayelet, an Israeli woman visiting the U.S. for the first time, is demanding answers to its whereabouts, as it contains a very important package of hers – and time is of the essence.
Ayelet, who does not speak English, is understandably confused and frustrated with Terrence, who does not speak Hebrew, and the two are unable to communicate the basics of the difficult situation. In an attempt to circumvent the language barrier, Terrence calls Josh, an old friend, to the scene – albeit under the incorrect assumption that, because Josh is Jewish, he can speak Hebrew. As it turns out, Josh can't really speak Hebrew (aside from a few hilarious phrases), but, despite all odds, there's a spark between the two strangers.
"I would have to say, first and foremost, this is a play about love," director Patricia Snoyer Black explained. "Love for your family, love for old friends, love for your partners – and all of this love is woven into one really charming and gentle comedy. These two people from very different cultures are thrown together by circumstance – and comedy ensues from their multiple attempts at finding alternate forms of communication."
During the play's off-Broadway run in 2013, a critic from The New York Times called "Handle With Care," written by playwright Jason Odell Williams, "a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy ... which exudes gobs of comic energy and insight. Mr. Williams has achieved something special. He has written a Jewish Christmas story."
The Hebrew dialog in the script was carefully crafted for contemporary audiences by Charlotte Cohn — a special treat for those in the audience who speak both languages. "Some people consider 'Handle With Care' a fully bilingual comedy," Snoyer Black said.
But that's not to say that audiences who only speak English won't understand or enjoy the play.
"It's written with that expectation," the director explained. "A lot of the humor is that the two male characters don't understand what Ayelet is saying – and many (or most) people in the audience will take the same journey that the characters do. For anybody that doesn't speak Hebrew, that's going to be part of the delightful experience of the play. As the guys start to understand what she's saying, they repeat it back to her and pretty much translate for the audience as they figure out what's being said.
The play is mostly set in the present, late on Christmas Eve, but includes flashbacks to the near-past that give context to Ayelet's predicament: Though she had arrived in America with her beloved grandmother, circumstances require that she navigate back to Israel alone.
Of course, there is a twist – but Snoyer Black says she prefers it's left a secret.
"The reveal during the play is so good," she said. "I'd hate to spoil it."
The North Carolina Stage Company production of "Handle With Care" stars Anna Slate as Ayelet, Barbara Bloomberg as Edna (Ayelet's grandmother), Ben Mackel as Josh and Aaron Brakefield as Terrence – with direction by Snoyer Black, a veteran of North Carolina Stage Company from its early years.
"I just want to say how happy I am to be working with NC Stage again," the director added. "I was very fortunate to work with this company back in their early days, when I was a professor at the department of drama at UNCA, from which I'm now retired. ... I just moved back to town a year ago, and I feel very fortunate to be back at my home theatre. I love this company."

Texto completo: If the story of "Dark Waters" sounds familiar, to a certain extent it is. But this film is not business as usual, with the presence of director Todd Haynes and star Mark Ruffalo the key reasons why.
On the most basic level "Dark Waters" is a whistleblower story, the latest in a genre of doing-the-right-thing scenarios that includes such popular films as "Erin Brockovich," "The Insider" and even "All the President's Men."
Inspired by an article in the New York Times Magazine, "Dark Waters" could have simply followed the template of the story's upbeat headline, "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare," telling the story of attorney Robert Bilott, who worked for more than 20 years to expose decades of heedless environmental contamination dreadful enough to cost the chemical giant $670 million in fines.
Ruffalo, an actor with an activist bent, read that story and decided to star in a movie version, becoming lead producer and hiring Haynes, a director whose 1995 "Safe" was ecologically prescient, and a filmmaker who never does anything the expected way.
Working with screenwriters Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, Haynes has constructed a dark, edgy film, disturbing and meant to be, a real-life horror show that details the impunity with which DuPont put profits above the known harm its chemicals were causing.
"Dark Waters" also focuses on the wrenching, disconcerting consequences of doing the right thing, on the number of grinding years of unrelenting, life-changing pressure - more than 20 in this case - that were needed to even begin to make a difference.
One of the many ironies in this story is that Bilott was in almost all ways the least likely guy to become the environmental hero.
Yes, Bilott (played by Ruffalo) was an attorney, but the Cincinnati firm he worked for was old-school conservative to the core. Recently made a partner, his area of specialization was defending big corporations rather than suing them.
That all began to change on a day in 1998 when gruff and furious Wilbur Tennant (a brilliant Bill Camp), a farmer from Parkersburg, West Virginia, who was acquainted with Bilott's grandmother, made the trip to Cincinnati and insisted "I want a lawyer."
Though he's a new father and his wife, Sarah (an expert Anne Hathaway), is not sure why he's even bothering, Bilott feels compelled to take the drive to Parkersburg.
Tennant has both physical evidence and videotape recordings of the horrors that have been visited on his herd of cattle, 190 of which he has buried. Tennant feels that the damage is caused by the neighboring Dry Run Landfill, where the Washington Works factory operated by DuPont deposits its chemical waste.
Before making what he views as a friendly colleague-to-colleague request to a pal at DuPont, Bilott runs his plan past his superior, the buttoned down Tom Terp (Tim Robbins, expert as well).
Neither man has any idea of what they, and their firm, are getting into, though when a DuPont functionary warns Bilott that "you're flushing your career down the toilet," he starts to get the idea.
That's because, as the lawyer finds out, a chemical variously known as PFOA or C8 and essential to the manufacture of Teflon, is being released into the Parkersburg water supply.
Ruffalo is splendid at projecting the unusual combination of bred-in-the-bone idealism with mulish stubbornness that made it impossible for Bilott to walk away.

Texto completo: Nashville, Tenn. • Whenever I’m nervous, I find some sort of amulet to drop into my pocket. A buckeye. A feather molted from a blue jay’s tail. The river rock my middle son always called a “worry stone.” The spent egg sac from a praying mantis. A seashell from my mother-in-law’s grave. I hold onto what’s in my pocket the way an anxious baby clings to a beloved blanket at bedtime.
When I was about to give my first talk at a gathering of English teachers, my department head tried to reassure me. “Rule No. 1: Don’t sweat the small stuff,” she said. “Rule No. 2: It’s all small stuff.” That was more than 30 years ago, and I’ve lived long enough now, and buried enough loved ones, to know that in fact it’s not all small stuff. Yet I still find myself fixating on matters that are indeed very small: the fancy wedding for which I have no suitable clothes, the thank-you notes I should’ve written by now. And the worst, by far, is the prospect of standing in front of a microphone.
Last summer, facing the first book tour of my life, I understood that no seashell or blue feather would carry me through two dozen public events. I needed a security blanket more potent than any I’d ever before clutched in my sweaty hands. Then, for reasons that aren’t at all clear to me — reasons that in retrospect feel like an outright miracle — I thought of the family wedding rings.
Seven years ago, in the hospital where my mother was suddenly dying, I took the wedding band from her finger and slipped it on my own. At first it was simply a way to keep the ring from being lost in the shock and tumult of unplanned grief. But I’ve continued to wear it, year after year, because it means what a wedding band is supposed to mean. Like the ring my husband gave me 31 years ago, it’s a reminder of love and fidelity — of my parents’ unshakable love for each other, but also of their love for me, as reliable as any immutable force.
I’m the keeper of other family rings: my great-grandmother’s, my grandmother’s, my mother-in-law’s. From time to time I would take them out to ponder for a moment, but I never thought to wear them. Along with my mother, these women are at the very heart of the essay collection that was about to send me out on a book tour, and one day it finally dawned on me that their wedding rings would make the perfect talismans against fear. They would remind me that worry is pointless, that fretting about my own shortcomings as a public speaker would not in any way make me a better public speaker. I took out the wedding rings of all my treasured forebears and put them on.
In what might be another minor miracle, for we are clearly in the realm of magical thinking here, it worked. I stood in front of microphone after microphone, spinning the thin bands around my fingers, and I looked out upon all those strangers, and, lo, I was not afraid.
Full disclosure: It’s possible that menopause, which has fostered an “Oh, who in hell really cares?” attitude in me for some time now, may have dispensed with my lifelong stage fright, too, and I just never noticed, having been on no stages in recent years. But I prefer to think the family matriarchy saved me, that my beloved elders closed ranks around me, my mother and mother-in-law on one flank, my grandmother and great-grandmother on the other, to shore me up and give me strength.
I think of them again in this season of family gatherings, when heirloom recipes and holiday decorations are time capsules. I fiddle with their rings, which I’m still wearing, and remember the women who taught me what it means to face genuine hardship.
I give thanks for my great-grandmother, Ollie Mims, whose steadfast faith and unflinching calm got her through the Great War, the Great Depression, World War II and countless family losses, including the death of her own son. I give thanks for my grandmother, Mildred Weems, who taught in a two-room country schoolhouse because my grandfather’s farm never quite paid the bills. When the schools in Lower Alabama finally desegregated and everyone she knew, including my grandfather, urged her to retire, she ignored them all. “A child is a child,” she said and kept on teaching.
I give thanks for my funny, creative mother, Olivia Renkl, whose laugh was so infectious that friends and strangers alike would laugh out loud in response, never suspecting the depressions she endured all her adult life. I give thanks for my mother-in-law, Marie Moxley, who raised six children and still welcomed me into the family as a full daughter. For 18 years she weathered Parkinson’s disease without a word of complaint and set an example of dignity, forbearance and love that no one who knew her will ever forget.
Every family history includes such stories of survival, of prevailing against great suffering and despair. Perhaps these family histories, small as they might be and utterly invisible to the world, hold the key to facing our larger worries, too, and showing the way through.
“Your hand feels just like your mother’s hand,” my father would tell me when I was still young enough to be holding his hand but already old enough to be growing into a woman’s hands. I look at my hand now, my mother’s ring on my finger, and I know what he meant. My hand is broad now where hers was broad, wrinkled where hers was wrinkled, and the same knuckles are just beginning to swell.

Panelists Discuss Being Trans and Jewish

"HOW DO I KNOW?" Moriah Levin said on Nov. 19 during a panel about being transgender in the Jewish community. "It's because I felt a certain way from a very, very young age, and I kept waiting to grow out of it. I kept thinking it would change, and it didn't."
Levin was one of the panelists at "Transgender and Jewish: Conversations for a Changing Community." The event featured four speakers - two transgender adults and two mothers of transgender children - who shared their personal stories and discussed how the Jewish community has been supportive and where it has been lacking. It took place at the Barbara and Harvey Brodsky Enrichment Center of Jewish Family and Children's Service in Bala Cynwyd.

It began with an address by keynote speaker Laurie Frankel, a New York Times bestselling author who lives in Seattle. Her latest novel, "This Is How It Always Is," is about a family whose fifth child comes out as transgender. The book is based on Frankel's real-life experience as the mother of a transgender daughter.
"The conversation that we are having on a national level about LGBTQ issues, but particularly about trans kids, has been full of lies. ... It has also been fear-mongering," Frankel said. "It is intended to drive votes and turn out voters, and it has been dishonest, so I wanted to have a conversation about it. I did not so much want to say, T will set the record straight,' and I did not want to say, 'I'm going to educate you and tell you everything you need to know.' That was not at all my goal going in" to write the book.
Her goal was summed up in the title of the novel.
"Always, you are parenting this young person, and that person shows up and says to you this thing that you never saw coming and certainly weren't planning for and then you have to figure out what to do next," Frankel said. "Bad news: You have no idea what that is, and it's really important that you choose correctly or otherwise you're going to screw up your kid."
Much of Frankel's talk focused on the reaction she received, both to her book and to a column she wrote about her daughter for the Times' "Modern Love" column. When the latter was published, her email inbox was flooded with hate, even death threats to her and her daughter. Some of the emails carried anti-Semitic messages.
The hate was so great that there was a discussion about whether she should have security go with her on book tour. But those fears did not manifest. When she walked into book stores and other venues throughout the country to talk about her book, attendees were supportive.
After Frankel's talk, she and the other three panelists stepped onto the platform. The others included Levin, who is involved in the LGBTQ Orthodox organization Eshel; Koach Baruch Frazier, an audiologist and student at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College; and Jessica Tayler, mother of a transgender child and an LGBTQ advocate.
They covered a range of topics, includinghowtheir Jewish communities have responded to their trans identities.
Levin and Frazier, for example, recalled positive experiences. When Levin told rabbis in her Orthodox Center City community that she was going to come out and publicly transition, they were all supportive and asked when she would switch sides of the mechitza.
Frazier said that his Reform synagogue in Missouri, where he lived at the time, worked with him to create a meaningful mikvah transition ceremony at the river. He said his transition was more difficult for his work.
"When I changed my name legally, everybody thought I got married," Frazier said to laughs from the audience.
Tayler, on the other hand, shared how their family's elementary school principal in Tennessee called them into the office to tell them other families felt uncomfortable being in the same class as their older son (her transgender child was not yet in elementary school) or near their family.
The event then moved on to a Q&A. One question was about trans children and medical interventions.
Frankel emphasized that there is no medical intervention for prepubescent children, such as the use of puberty blockers to delay puberty. When it comes to young pubescent children, medical intervention is noninvasive. Levin and Frazier both said it's a private decision, and Frazier said he wished he'd had the option.
"Trust me," Levin said. "Trust trans people when we say who we are." *

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani's interest in Ukraine was about more than just dirt on Democrats.
The former New York City mayor pursued a lucrative business deal with Ukraine's shady ex-top prosecutor while pushing officials in the country to launch investigations into President Trump's political rivals, an attorney for Giuliani told the Daily News on Wednesday.
Robert Costello - who represents Giuliani on matters relating to a federal investigation in New York and the House impeachment inquiry - said his client was in talks early this year to perform legal services for former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko and the country's justice ministry.
Under the proposed deal, which was worth as much as $500,000, Giuliani would represent Lutsenko and the ministry in a U.S. civil case relating to the country's efforts to recover cash allegedly embezzled by former Kiev officials, Costello said.
However, Giuliani ultimately "turned down" the contract because of the "bad appearance," Costello said.
"Mr. Giuliani considered it but then declined to be involved because it would be interpreted as Giuliani trying to make money off his relationship with the president," Costello told The News.
Giuliani's Ukraine business pursuits were first reported by The New York Times.
The ex-Hizzoner claimed there was nothing fishy about his Ukraine business dealings because they ultimately went nowhere.
"I did NOT pursue a business opportunity in Ukraine," Giuliani tweeted. "I could have helped them recover $7B in stolen money, but I didn't. Was paid ZERO."
At the same time he was in talks to get paid by Lutsenko, Giuliani was deeply involved in dubious efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials into committing to investigate Joe Biden's family and debunked right-wing claims about the 2016 election.
Giuliani has said he undertook those dirt-digging efforts in his capacity as Trump's personal lawyer.
While he was apparently concerned about the bad optics of representing Lutsenko, Giuliani had no problem relying heavily on the Ukrainian prosecutor as part of his Trump-endorsed hunt for dirt on Democrats.
Lutsenko, for instance, helped Giuliani push for the ouster of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch after she spoke out against Trump's shadow policy in Ukraine, according to several impeachment witnesses.
Giuliani has also acknowledged Lutsenko fed him information on Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Biden's son, Hunter, once sat.
A package of documents Giuliani gave the State Department in March summarizing his self-styled Ukraine foray included notes from an interview he conducted with Lutsenko.
The reliance on Lutsenko as a source for U.S. policy outraged career officials in the State Department, according to impeachment testimony.
George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs, testified publicly earlier this month that Lutsenko was seen as corrupt and that the smear he and Giuliani perpetuated against Yovanovitch amounted to "a campaign of lies."
Ukraine's government opened a criminal investigation into Lutsenko in October over allegations that he abused his office and ignored corruption.
Giuliani's role in the Ukraine scandal has landed him in hot water with both congressional and federal investigators.
Manhattan feds are investigating Giuliani's potential role in a campaign finance scheme allegedly undertaken by two of his criminally charged Ukraine associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.
The scheme overlaps with the impeachment inquiry in that Parnas and Fruman were acting on an unnamed Ukrainian government official's behalf while donating to ex-Republican congressman Pete Sessions in a bid to get him to ask Trump to remove Yovanovitch. The unnamed Ukrainian official is believed to be Lutsenko, according to sources.
Meanwhile, Giuliani has refused to comply in the impeachment inquiry despite facing a subpoena.
Amid the multiple legal headaches, Trump tried to distance himself from Giuliani on Tuesday, telling disgraced ex-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in an interview that he "didn't direct" the ex-mayor to look for political dirt in Ukraine.
"I didn't direct him but he's a warrior," Trump said. "You have to ask that to Rudy."
Trump's comments contradict Giuliani's repeated assertions that his Ukraine work was undertaken on the president's behalf.
Moreover, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during their infamous July 25 phone call to connect with Giuliani.
"Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy," Trump told Zelensky after asking the Ukrainian leader to do "us a favor" by launching investigations. "If you could speak to him that would be great."

Texto completo: Hollywood will move toward the holidays with a feast of films based on true-life stories. You know, like "Cats" and "Jumanji."
For real, though, Hollywood does delve into the nonfiction realm with "Dark Waters" (about a lawyer going after DuPont), "Bombshell" (about a scandal at Fox News) and "Richard Jewell" (about the Atlanta security guard who uncovers a bomb threat).
There are more where those came from, but there is also escapist adventure and fun with "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" and "Playmobil: The Movie."
These are the Pittsburgh dates, subject to change.
FRIDAY
"Knives Out": Daniel Craig is a Southern investigator out to solve the murder of a wealthy crime novelist in this whodunit that combines Hitchcock and Christie.
"Queen&Slim": Daniel Kaluuya ("Get Out") and Jodie Turner-Smith star in a modern take on "Bonnie&Clyde."
DEC. 6
"Playmobil: The Movie": A young woman enters the world of the children's building toy, Playmobil, to find her lost brother. With Anya Taylor-Joy, Daniel Radcliffe, Adam Lambert and Jim Gaffigan.
"Honey Boy": Shia LaBeouf wrote this semi-autobiographical screenplay about his troubled childhood as a therapeutic exercise during a court-ordered rehab stay. Lucas Hedges and Noah Jupe play a young performer loosely based on LeBeouf, while LeBeouf plays a volatile character that's a version of his own father.
"Dark Waters": Todd Haynes directs and Mark Ruffalo stars in and produced this drama based on The New York Times Magazine story "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare." Ruffalo plays an attorney who takes on the DuPont chemical company over contaminated drinking water in West Virginia. With Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins and Bill Camp.
DEC. 13
"Bombshell": John Lithgow plays Roger Ailes and Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman play Fox anchors Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson in this drama about the sexual harassment allegations that brought down the network's former CEO and chairman. With Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and Kate McKinnon.
"Richard Jewell": Clint Eastwood directs and Paul Walter Hauser ("I, Tonya") plays the title character in this drama about the security guard who found a bomb during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. With Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates and Jon Hamm.
"Jumanji: The Next Level": Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan are back for this second sequel to the 1995 film "Jumanji." This time, the players in the world's most dangerous game encounter adventures in arid deserts and snowy mountains.
"Black Christmas": Remake of the 1974 slasher classic features Imogen Poots and Brittany O'Grady among the young ones terrorized during holiday break. With Carey Elwes.
DEC. 20
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker": The sci-fi franchise that began in 1977 with "A New Hope" wraps up 42 years later with this ninth film, directed by J.J. Abrams, that focuses on the Resistance against the First Order and the ancient conflict between the Jedi and the Sith. With Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill.
"Cats": After sparking derision with the bizarre trailer, the big-screen version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage hit makes it to the big screen with a cast that includes James Corden, Judi Dench, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellan, Taylor Swift and Rebel Wilson.
"A Hidden Life": August Diehl, who played a Gestapo officer in "Inglourious Basterds," stars as Franz Jagerstatter, an Austrian conscientious objector who refused to fight for the Nazis during World War II. Terrence Malick's film was a Palme d'Or nominee at Cannes.
"The Two Popes": Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce play Cardinal Bergoglio and Pope Benedict XVI, respectively, in this drama based on Anthony McCarten's 2017 play "The Pope," about the cardinal, wanting to retire, being summoned to the Vatican. It premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in August and will stream on Netflix on Dec. 20.
"The Aeronauts": Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, who starred in "The Theory of Everything," go on a daredevil balloon adventure in 1862.
DEC. 25
"Little Women": Director Greta Gerwig reunites with two of her "Lady Bird" stars - Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet - in this retelling of the lives, loves and losses of the March sisters. With Emma Watson and Laura Dern as Marmee.
"Uncut Gems": Adam Sandler stars in what has been described as a roller coaster of a crime thriller. He plays a New York City jeweler and compulsive gambler who goes all-in on a high-stakes bet. With Julia Fox, Kevin Garnett and Eric Bogosian.
"Spies in Disguise": Will Smith and Tom Holland lend their voices to this computer-animated comedy about a super spy who turns into a pigeon.

Secret to Bills' Playoff Hopes? A Not-So-Terrible Offense

Texto completo: With their defense looking forceful again, a modest improvement on the other side of the ball is making a huge difference.
Have you checked the N.F.L. standings lately? The Buffalo Bills are 8-3. Yes, the same Bills who were a lifeless 6-10 last year. These Bills are looking to make the playoffs for the second time since 1999. (In the 2017 season, Buffalo lost to Jacksonville in the first round.)
The New England Patriots have a lock on the A.F.C. East, as usual, but Buffalo has a two-game lead on all of its wild-card rivals with five games left to play, so the postseason seems like a sure thing.
Just how did the Bills get here? At first glance, the answer seems to be their defense. They are ranked third in the league, allowing 4.8 yards per play and 5 net yards per pass, behind only New England and San Francisco. But that's where they ranked last year, too; they gave up an average of 4.9 yards per play.
The big difference appears to be that their offensive numbers have jumped to merely below average. The Bills are ranked 20th in net yards per pass (6.0) this season, up from 31st of the 32 teams last year at 5.2. Though that does not seem impressive, it suggests that even a modest improvement can make a considerable difference in a won-lost record.
Among passers with at least 100 attempts, Josh Allen ranks 23rd of 38 in adjusted yards per pass. Not so good? Last season, he was 37th of 41. Teams can't win with a league-worst quarterback, but the outlook changes with a so-so quarterback who now has reliable targets.
The team signed speedster John Brown in the off-season, and he is on pace for the highest yardage and reception totals of his six-year career. Entering Week 13, Brown has 856 yards receiving and has caught 65 percent of targets, up from 43 percent last year. That has given him a figure of 9.6 yards per target, up from 7.4 (and 5.4 in 2017, when Tyrod Taylor was the quarterback).
Running backs Frank Gore and Devin Singletary have about 500 yards each, and Singletary ranks second in yards per rush with 5.8. But solid rushing numbers by themselves don't turn a team around in the modern N.F.L.
The New York Times playoff simulator currently gives the Bills an 82 percent chance of making the postseason, a great figure for long-suffering Buffalo fans, but a surprisingly low one considering the Bills' strong position in the standings.
The Bills occupy the first of the two A.F.C. wild-card spots. There are four teams at 6-5: the Steelers, Colts, Raiders and Titans. Two of them would have to surpass the 8-3 Bills to knock them out of the playoff picture. Could that really happen?
Indeed it could, because of the Bills' difficult schedule over their last five games.
On Thursday, the Bills travel to Dallas, which is in an N.F.C. East dogfight with the Eagles. Dallas is favored by a touchdown. Next is a home game against the 9-2 Ravens. And two weeks later, the Bills will be big underdogs at New England.
If the Bills lose those games (hardly a far-fetched scenario), a Week 15 matchup against the Steelers in Pittsburgh looms as Buffalo's most important. Win that and the season finale at home against the 4-7 Jets, and the Bills are in. Lose to Pittsburgh, and the Bills will need help.
The Steelers are in some disarray at quarterback -- Devlin Hodges has replaced Mason Rudolph for now -- but they have won five of six, and the game will be played in Pittsburgh. Sounds like a tossup.
Still, at this hour, the Bills are in the driver's seat for the postseason. In the 2017 season, the Bills returned to the playoffs after a long absence only to eke out 3 points in a loss to the Jaguars. There were four more playoff losses (technically a Super Bowl loss counts here) before that one. One of those was the Music City Miracle. The less said to Bills fans about that, the better.
The last time the Bills actually tasted postseason victory was after the 1995 season, in a wild-card game against the Dolphins, when the quarterback matchup was Jim Kelly vs. Dan Marino.
The Patriots have made a division title almost impossible, so the Bills are likely to play a playoff game on the road against a team like the Chiefs or the Titans. Not easy, but Buffalo would have a puncher's chance to break the drought.
And after that? The Bills came into the season with Super Bowl odds of 100-1 and have only dropped to 80-1. But for a franchise with a history of suffering, those are odds its fans will be undoubtedly happy to take.

I took a crash course in walking 'like a man.' Here's what I realized.

Texto completo: My editor was surprised to learn that men run into me sometimes. Several months ago, as I happened to mention to him, I'd experimented with not moving aside for other pedestrians on the sidewalk. I wasn't rude about it, and exceptions were made for octogenarians, stroller-pushing parents, etc., etc. But in the choreography of sidewalk ballet, one party generally scoots to the side while the other carries on. I'd spent my life scooting, and I wondered what would happen if for a few weeks I didn't.
What happened was that women got out of the way. What happened was that I realized something: Women had always gotten out of the way. Without even making eye contact, we'd automatically rotated around the sidewalk like two repelled magnets.
What happened was that men ran into me.
Not all of them! Not most! But in every crash, it was a gentleman charting the collision course. Suited ones, mostly. Ages 30 to 50. Sometimes they were on their phones, sometimes they weren't. Sometimes they registered my presence, sometimes not. And then " well, I can't explain it any other way. They ran into me at full speed. They'd apparently expected, via decades of experience, that I'd move, and so it never occurred to them to.
'How did they react?' my editor asked.
'They got annoyed,' I told him. The gentlemen who ran into me were flustered that I was in their way. One told me to 'watch where I was going,' though he'd veered into my path. One whispered, 'Whooooooa there,' and steadied me like a startled pony.
Only once did one apologize: 'That was so crazy,' he kept repeating sweetly, as if this was an odd fluke rather than something that might happen regularly if women weren't dodging him.
'Whoa,' said my editor, a man I cannot imagine ever mowing someone down. 'I assume you've written about this.'
No, I told him. Because it had been a private experiment born of curiosity, and it would be hard to write about without sounding sanctimonious. Like I was spoiling for the chance to call out a few inconsiderate boors.
But the whole reason we were having this conversation was that he'd forwarded an article about an orthopedic surgeon instructing female patients to 'sit more like men.' The natural structure of women's bodies, she said " wider hips and pelvis " when paired with more 'feminine' sitting styles like crossed legs, could cause joint strain. The cure was spreading out, legs planted wide.
After fleeting despair over another thing I was apparently failing at and needing to do more like a man (add it to salary negotiations, meeting behavior and assertive communication), it /ccurred .to me that a problem with the doctor's advice was that it was given in a vacuum. It was given with the expectation that everyone could always have room to spread out rather than what life actually requires: two strangers board an airplane, then silently negotiate an armrest the width of three chopsticks.
I always give up the armrest.
This was, I assumed, some kind genetic deference born more of being Midwestern than female. But a friend recently mentioned her mixed-gender yoga class, in which the instructor told everyone to make T-shapes with their arms and be mindful of each other's space. The men all stretched wide as directed. The women all bent their elbows upward, like cactuses, to make sure nobody got bonked.
No men were deliberately being rude, and no women demanded more room. But everyone locked into the pattern without thinking.
The thing is, more women sitting like men requires some men to sit more like women. It requires attention to someone else's personal space. And more deeply, it requires a perspective shift: that no person inherently deserves to have a larger psychological piece of the universe than another person. Your wingspan might be wider, for example, but your comfort shouldn't indifferently come at the expense of someone else's.
It requires the genuine belief that there is value, sometimes, in being the one to defer.
No fewer than half a dozen female friends forwarded me an essay in the New York Times about the 'Lean In' movement. The author, Ruth Whippman, criticized the presumption that workplace 'success' meant teaching women to behave more like male colleagues: Talk louder. Stop saying 'Sorry.'
We could, and should, quibble over what it means to behave 'like a man' anyhow, since men can and do behave all different ways. But when the phrase is used, it's often as a shorthand for extreme assertion and overconfidence.
The 'stop apologizing' advice is based on shorthand, too: research that women are generally more sensitive to offensive behavior and more likely to apologize if they fear they've committed it. This is seen as a professional drawback. 'But really,' Whippman wrote, 'isn't a person with a 'high threshold of what constitutes offensive behavior' just a fancy name for a jerk?' How about if everyone, men and women, said 'I'm sorry' not less but more?
The word 'microaggression,' describing subtle (and often unintentional) slights that accumulate over time, has been mocked to the point that it's lost some meaning. But it would be lovely to get behind its corollary: microkindnesses. The awareness of the space we take up and the subtle ways our actions mean other people get less or more space.
My experiment with sidewalk leaning-in was short-lived; it felt pointless and rude. And I didn't like the entitlement it created in me, the gradual sense that other people should move. I didn't like feeling that way. And I figured I did enough other annoying public things " fumbling for my Metro card at the turnstile " that I should share the sidewalk with extreme politeness.
And besides, otherwise men will sometimes run into me.

Texto completo: Puerto Rico sigue recibiendo trato de segunda clase por parte del gobierno federal.
Un informe del New York Times indica que la ayuda de la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA) para la recuperación de Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de Estados Unidos se estancó a dos años del paso de los huracanes Irma y María.
Datos de la agencia indican que en Puerto Rico apenas se han financiado 190 proyectos de recuperación de los 9,000 que fueron procesados . En las Islas Vírgenes se dio fondos a 218 de las 1,500 solicitudes.
Los números están por debajo de los 3,700 que se entregaron en Texas por el huracán Harvey, también de 2017. Una cantidad similar se financió en Florida.
Para muchos es una clara muestra de la manera de cómo el gobierno federal ve a los ciudadanos de los territorios que no son Estados.
“Odio hacer la distinción entre estadounidenses y no estadounidenses, pero al final de cuentas no estamos siendo tratados de la misma manera que otros estadounidenses están siendo tratados”, dijo al Times Dyma Williams, directora del hospital Gov. Juan F. Luis de St. Croix en las Islas Vírgenes.
FEMA se defiende con el argumento de que cada desastre natural es diferente en muchos aspectos.
“Comparar desastres engaña al pueblo estadounidense”, dijo Jeffrey Byard, administrador asociado de FEMA. “Cada evento tiene un conjunto único de circunstancias, y los números por sí solos no pueden y no proporcionan una imagen completa de lo que se necesita para ayudar a las comunidades a recuperarse”.
La explicación no es suficiente para funcionarios electos en Puerto Rico y en Estados Unidos .
“Desde el primer día, justo después de que María llegó a Puerto Rico, ha habido un estándar diferente sobre cómo respondió la administración a Harvey e Irma “, dijo la congresista de Nueva York Nydia M. Velázquez , quien denunció que su propia hermana no tuvo energía en la isla de Vieques durante 13 meses.
En tanto, la Casa Blanca, en cabeza de Donald Trump, siempre ha culpado a la corrupción en Puerto Rico por la lenta asistencia. Sin embargo, el Times hizo una comparación de casos de corrupción entre 2008 y 2017 y encontró que en Texas los números triplican a los de Puerto Rico.

What constitutes 'impeachable' conduct?

Autor: Marlantes, Liz. 

Información de publicación: The Christian Science Monitor ; Boston, Mass. [Boston, Mass]. 27 Nov 2019.

Texto completo: Dear reader:
What constitutes an impeachable offense?
In the wake of last week’s hearings, some Trump defenders have been arguing that while the president’s interactions with Ukraine may not have been “perfect,” none of it rises to the level of impeachment.
Retiring GOP Rep. Will Hurd – a moderate Texan who’s been willing to criticize the president – called Mr. Trump’s July 25th phone conversation with the president of Ukraine “inappropriate,” but said “an impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelming, clear and unambiguous.” In his view, the evidence presented so far does not meet that standard.
Likewise, “President Donald Trump has not been credibly accused of committing any crime, much less a high crime or misdemeanor,” writes The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway – implying that impeachable offenses should be above and beyond basic criminality.
Notably, Democrats have begun talking about “bribery” rather than a “quid pro quo” – bribery being “one of only two specific impeachable offenses listed in the Constitution (the other being treason),” as Jeff Greenfield points out in The Bulwark. Yet Mr. Greenfield also argues that Republicans are incorrect to insist an act must be criminal to be impeachable. He points out that it’s not hard to come up with hypothetical situations that would not be criminal yet would clearly merit impeachment, just as it’s possible to envision scenarios where a crime technically was committed that no one would see as necessitating a response. 
Ultimately, what’s impeachable is whatever a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate think is impeachable.
And often, that may have as much to do with the bigger picture as with the incident at hand. The New York Times’s Ross Douthat argues persuasively that the reason President Bill Clinton may ultimately have survived his impeachment process while President Richard Nixon did not was not simply because of different degrees of malfeasance involved – or even different degrees of partisanship. No, what may have mattered most was that President Nixon’s second term featured “a series of economic shocks” – including an oil crisis, stock market crash, stagflation, and a recession – while President Clinton’s was a “peak of American power, pride and optimism.”
If “impeachable” is in the eye of the beholder, then the strength of today’s economy may be providing a lens that is more helpful to Mr. Trump than anything else.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

Texto completo: Eleanora (Wrinn) Schurdak
Eleanora (Wrinn) Schurdak, 88, of Kirkland Village, died on November 23rd. Born in New Haven, CT, Eleanora attended the Gateway School for Girls before attending Lasell College in Newton, MA. After college, Eleanora returned to New Haven, where she met her husband, John, to whom she was married for 62 years. John predeceased her this past April.
The majority of Eleanora's married years were spent raising four children in Bedford Village, NY. She was an avid gardener, belonging to both the Bedford Village and Hopp Ground Garden Clubs. It was through her garden club memberships that Eleanora came to love the art of Japanese flower arranging, known as Ikenobo. While the Schurdak children's friends had holiday tables teeming with flowers, the Schurdak holiday table display invariably had a simple tree branch with three to five flowers. Eleanora also loved the game of tennis and, in the winter months, paddle tennis. She had a regular tennis group of friends and played tennis into her early seventies. She was a gourmet cook: Always trying new recipes and, before it gained popularity, pairing meals to fresh food that was seasonally available.
As her children grew older, Eleanora also devoted time to several organizations: As a teacher's aide, as the Executive Assistant to Bedford's Community Resource Center and to the Drug Abuse Prevention Council, and as a volunteer in the Bedford Free Library.
A lover of the arts, Eleanora was a frequent visitor to museums, concerts, and the theater. She enjoyed traveling and was a devoted reader of nonfiction, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. Her presence in the library at Kirkland Village will surely be missed.
Friends and family would describe Eleanora as a quiet, private person. However, Eleanora was also firm and principled. She quietly stood before an evergreen tree that was planted in the middle of the road that she lived on, preventing the Town of Bedford from uprooting it. This evergreen continues to thrive in its same location today. She also implemented a recycling regiment for the household in the early 1970s: Again, ahead of her time in thinking.
SURVIVORS: She leaves her children, Catherine E. Schurdak, John W. Schurdak, Ellen C. Schurdak and her husband Domenic P. Sbrocchi, Tamara Schurdak and her spouse Anne M. Gunning, and two grandchildren, Julian and Kai Schurdak.
SERVICES: A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 11 A.M. on Monday, December 2, 2019 in St. Anne's Church, 450 Washington Avenue, Bethlehem PA 18017. Cantelmi Long Funeral Home, 500 Linden Street, Bethlehem, PA 18018 has been entrusted with arrangements.
CONTRIBUTIONS: In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be sent to the Carole King-Helbling Kirkland Music Fund (make checks payable to Kirkland Village, 1 Kirkland Village Circle, Bethlehem, PA 18017, designated for the Carole King-Helbling Music Fund) or LVHN-Hospice, 2166 South 12 Street, Allentown, PA 18103.

Why her House bid began with surgery

Texto completo: Maya Rockeymoore Cummings had just announced she was running for Congress when she broached a subject that was far more personal: She was about to undergo a double mastectomy.
The former Maryland Democratic Party chairwoman joined a growing number of women having the surgery prophylactically " to dramatically reduce their chances of getting breast cancer, rather than to treat the disease after it has been diagnosed.
Some women, like actress Angelina Jolie, have the surgery after testing positive for the BRCA gene, an inherited gene mutation that indicates a high probability of developing the disease. Others, like Rockeymoore Cummings " who is seeking to succeed her husband, the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) " tested negative for the BRCA gene but have a strong family history of cancer.
Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, said more research must be done to understand the susceptibility to breast cancer for black women, who die of the disease at significantly higher rates than white women, and to develop more-accurate genetic predictors of black women's risks.
Her mother died of breast cancer in 2015, she said, and her younger sister had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year. Neither tested positive for the BRCA mutation. She also lost a close friend, Katrina Dennis, to the dise ase this year.
Rockeymoore Cummings and her husband decided this summer that she would schedule the surgery; after his death in October, she said, she was as determined as ever to go through with the procedure.
'I wanted to make sure I was taking the affirmative measures,' Rockeymoore Cummings said in an interview. 'It just seems like, what happened with my mother and my sister, I just felt like I was next. And instead of waiting around for it, I just felt like I needed to be proactive.'

Breast cancer is the second-deadliest cancer among black women, according to the American Cancer Society. And while the rate of breast cancer has dropped in the African American community, the death rate from it is 40 percent higher among black women than white women.
The reasons for the racial disparities vary , experts say. White women tend to be diagnosed at an early stage. Black women have a higher rate of obesity, tend to have other chronic illnesses and have less access to quality health care. Black women are also more likely than white women to get triple-negative breast cancer, a version of the disease that often is aggressive and comes back after treatment.
While there is no data available on the racial makeup of women undergoing prophylactic mastectomies, experts say they are seeing an overall increase in the surgery as a treatment option. The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality released a study of 13 states in 2016 that found that the rate of preventive double mastectomies doubled " from 2.1 women per 100,000 to 4.4 women per 100,000 " between 2005 and 2013.
Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the Atlanta-based American Cancer Society, said more women have gotten tested for the BRCA gene since Jolie published an essay in the New York Times about her decision to get a double mastectomy in 2013.
Lichtenfeld said Jolie's disclosure 'did a service to women by bringing [breast cancer] back in the public eye,' much in the same way first lady Betty Ford raised breast cancer awareness when she had a mastectomy in the mid-1970s.
While women of all races and ethnicities are now undergoing the BRCA test to determine if they carry the gene mutation, it is also important for people to remember that 'family history matters,' said Susan Domchek, the executive director of the Basser Center for BRCA at Penn Medicine's Abramson Cancer Center.
'What that threshold should be for when people decide on doing the procedure is very personal,' she said of mastectomies.

Cancer runs deep in the family of Courtney Glass, a 36-year-old attorney from Greenbelt. But she said going ahead with the BRCA test was difficult: 'I literally walked around with the paper in my laptop bag every day for almost a year.'
When Glass was in 10th grade, her mother successfully fought breast cancer with radiation treatment and a single mastectomy. Years later, though, Phyllis Glass developed uterine cancer.
She died in February 2011, at the age of 64, seven weeks after Courtney Glass celebrated passing the bar. Glass's father battled prostate cancer in 2003. He has since been treated for another round of prostate and bladder cancer.
Glass found out she carried the BRCA1 gene in August 2015. She said her doctor told her she had an 87 percent chance of having breast or ovarian cancer. Less than a year later, she had the double mastectomy, which her doctor said reduced her chances of developing breast cancer to 2-or 3 percent.
'I tell everyone: If you have a history of cancer, go get the test done,' she said. 'I believe that the only way we will eradicate cancer is through early detection, education and preventive measures, even if they seem extreme.'
Rockeymoore Cummings, who had the surgery Nov. 15, said Monday that the operation was successful and her recovery was going well.
Before the surgery, she said, she felt like she had 'two ticking time bombs strapped' to her chest. 'For me, it was more about removing the risk and moving forward knowing I've done everything I can to address it.'
She said she has spent the past several days in campaign mode, making fundraising calls and organizing, and plans to begin knocking on doors in the next couple of weeks. The Democratic primary is Feb. 4.
Despite advice " a lot of it from men, she said with a laugh " that she should postpone the surgery until after the campaign, Rockeymoore Cummings said she doesn't regret prioritizing her health.
'You can't run a campaign and be effective if you are sidelined or focused on health issues,' she said. 'You have to do the things you need to do to be at your best, particularly representing people. We have to be in our best form to do that.'

Netflix's The King is Shakespeare without the sass

Texto completo: Shakespeare, but make it less sassy: That's the sorely unappealing formula for Netflix's The King, a recent film that borrows clout from the Bard while aiming to be a gritty, modern-language epic.
If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if Shakespeare was a screenwriter for Game of Thrones, you're in luck.
The King was never meant to be a faithful adaptation of Shakespeare’s Henriad, but where it chooses to diverge from the Bard, The King isn't updated. It's worse. If only it had a glimmer of Shakespeare's humor.
Shakespeare enthusiasts predicted this result a few years ago when the project had recently been announced.
“We’ve written Henry IV and Henry V as a period film, but with our own dialogue,” screenwriter Joel Edgerton told IndieWire in 2016. “For lack of a better word, [it’s] Game Of Thrones meets Shakespeare only in that, you can watch Game Of Thrones and understand what’s going on.”
Edgerton's next comment did him no favors with Shakespeareans.
“I feel like, with complete deference to Shakespeare, there is something that happens when even the most intelligent people watch Shakespeare,” Edgerton said. “They feel stupid because he does the kind of roundabout version of telling you simple things. So, we just wanted to let the audience understand exactly what’s going on, and not just some people, but everybody.”
Austin Tichenor, a managing partner of the Reduced Shakespeare Company, says Edgerton's comment revealed how little he understands Shakespeare.
“What I love about Shakespeare is he was a populist,” Tichenor told the Washington Examiner. “So, I admire, on the one hand Joel Edgerton and his director wanting to create a popular film and trying to make people not scared of Shakespeare. But, that’s like saying ‘don’t think of pink elephants’ by saying Shakespeare is hard to understand. It’s self-fulfilling. He’s not hard to understand when excellent actors and good directors are interpreting the story in a clear and accessible way.”
The premise that Shakespeare is unpalatable shows through in the film, which replaces Shakespeare’s language with modern vernacular and even a few F-bombs. But Edgerton was wrong about the part of Shakespeare that needs updating.
“It sounds more like he feels stupid, and so he, therefore, thinks everybody feels stupid, and that’s not the case,” Tichenor says. “Yes, there are bad productions of Shakespeare where it’s incomprehensible because the actors aren’t clear or the direction isn’t clear, and yes, he is hard to read and understand. But when performed by actors of Joel Edgerton’s experience and quality and intelligence, and Timothée Chalamet … Shakespeare can be absolutely clear.”
Its muddled view of language isn't the film's only problem. Besides doing its best to coherently piece together parts of Shakespeare’s Henry IV and Henry V, The King drastically changes many Shakespearean trademarks, particularly the character of Sir John Falstaff. In the film, Falstaff (played by Edgerton) is a weary former fighter who helps King Henry plan the Battle of Agincourt.
In Shakespeare’s plays, Falstaff is, as Tichenor says, “a colorful, life-affirming character.” He's a cowardly knight, a drunkard, and a source of comic relief. The New York Times called him “Shakespeare’s Hot Mess.”
But Falstaff can't be funny in The King since the gritty film has no place for jokes. It is devoid of Shakespeare’s humor, cutting out moments of levity in favor of Chalamet’s brooding face.
At times, The King tries to be humorous, but instead of relying on Shakespeare, it cracks jokes at his expense. Tichenor says its attempts at meta-humor fall flat. For example, instead of delivering the famous Crispin’s Day speech — ”We few, we happy few, we band of brothers” — King Henry demands, “You expect of me a speech?” At one point, King Henry’s admission that he finds someone's monologue hard to follow seems like a reference to Shakespeare himself, Tichenor says, though “it doesn’t really land as a joke.”
Even as The King delivers a well-acted, well-staged film, it seems too long at two hours and 20 minutes, and it grows weary even of itself. Where the film tries to improve upon Shakespeare, it misses an important element of what made the Bard great.
If you're feeling Game of Thrones withdrawal, The King might be just what you need as you wait for George R.R. Martin to plot his next book. But if you're a Shakespeare fan, you'll miss his humor and his witticisms. Tichenor's advice? Watch The Hollow Crown instead. When there are other options, The King just doesn't cut it.
“Shakespeare wrote a lot of comedy and humor into his plays,” Tichenor said. “Those jokes in the tragedies and the histories land arguably even better because they’re in a slightly serious context. This movie could have used a lot of Shakespeare’s language and his wit.”

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential field has coalesced around an abortion rights agenda more far-reaching than anything past nominees have proposed, according to a New York Times survey of the campaigns. The positions reflect a hugely consequential shift on one of the country’s most politically divisive issues.
Every candidate The Times surveyed supports codifying Roe v. Wade in federal law, allowing Medicaid coverage of abortion by repealing the Hyde Amendment, and removing funding restrictions for organizations that provide abortion referrals. Almost all of them said they would nominate only judges who support abortion rights, an explicit pledge Democrats have long avoided.
Very few support restrictions on abortions late in pregnancy. Seven say abortion pills should be available over the counter. Nine want a federal approval process for state abortion laws. And Joe Biden, whose ambivalence on abortion rights has been a theme for decades, is seeking to recast himself as a full-throated champion of them.
The 2020 candidates’ responses reflect a fundamental change in the Democratic Party’s approach to reproductive issues. In other areas, from health care to taxes, there is a divide between liberal and moderate candidates. Here, it is minimal.
“What you’ve seen is that it’s no longer OK for any candidate just to say they’re pro-choice,” said Jacqueline Ayers, vice president for government relations and public policy at Planned Parenthood. “They’re being very specific on how our rights are under attack, how access to abortion is being undermined in this country, and putting forth plans to protect and expand rights.”
With several states passing near-total bans on abortion, and with the first Supreme Court majority in a generation that could overturn Roe v. Wade, the Democratic candidates are at once agreeing that abortion rights require a more forceful defense, and concluding that defense is not enough.
The ramifications are hard to predict. The public is strongly supportive of Roe v. Wade, but deeply divided on how accessible abortion should be beyond Roe’s basic protections. President Donald Trump has shown that he is willing to weaponize abortion to turn out his base, including through misleading or outright false narratives. And historically, abortion has been a bigger motivator for conservative voters than liberals.
Whether any of this changes in 2020 will depend, in part, on how the Democratic nominee talks about abortion rights, particularly in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where many swing voters are not as far to the left on abortion as the candidates.
“You can’t rule out that it could become an issue,” said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Pennsylvania, “depending on the candidate and to what degree they move it forward as an issue.”
A Basic Reframing
The most striking change, beyond individual policies, is how unapologetic candidates’ tone on abortion rights has become.
Advocates have traditionally said they support the right to choose abortion, not abortion itself, and Democrats have said it should be “safe, legal and rare.” Public debate has commonly centered on procedures after 20 weeks’ gestation, which account for less than 1.5% of abortions. The discussion has often been on opponents’ terms.
Now, almost every candidate says the next president should actively reframe the debate. Their language focuses on health care, bodily autonomy and, at times, even the idea of abortion as a positive force enabling women to control their lives and increase their economic security.
“Abortion is health care, and health care is a human right,” Elizabeth Warren wrote in her survey response. In the last debate, she argued that abortion rights were “also economic rights.”
Only Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Sestak and Marianne Williamson now say abortion should be “safe, legal and rare” — a phrase, popularized by President Bill Clinton and repeated by Hillary Clinton, that reflected a search for common ground with people not fully supportive of abortion rights.
The rest of the 2020 candidates sidestepped or rejected the “rare” part. Bernie Sanders, for instance, wrote, “Abortion should be safe, legal and accessible to every person who chooses it.”
Asked if they supported restrictions after 24 weeks — roughly when a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb, though viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy — only Sestak said yes. (Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.) Several candidates emphasized that less than 1% of abortions happen that late, often because of life-threatening conditions or severe fetal abnormalities.
Amy Klobuchar’s campaign did not fully answer the question, saying she believed “any restrictions must be consistent with Roe v. Wade.”
Roe allowed near-total bans in the third trimester as long as there was an exception for life- or health-threatening situations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey replaced the trimester framework with one based on viability, which can start in the late second trimester.
An Emboldened Defense
For years, the battle over the Supreme Court has been conducted in code. Republicans denounced “judicial activism” and Democrats called for justices who would “respect precedent” — that they were talking about one precedent in particular remaining unsaid.
Not anymore.
In May, Kirsten Gillibrand vowed to nominate only judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade. Though she is no longer in the race, her pledge is: All of the candidates who completed the survey said they would “require judicial nominees to support Roe v. Wade as settled law.”
Biden’s campaign brought up his role in blocking Robert Bork’s confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1987, which probably would have meant the end of Roe. Biden’s objections then were more about birth control than abortion — but his eagerness now to play up the latter is telling of how profoundly the Democratic terrain has shifted.
Also telling is that the candidates are not solely talking about preserving Roe: In an acknowledgment that the Supreme Court might have enough votes to dismantle it, they all support legislation to codify its protections.
Every candidate who responded wanted to ban states’ so-called TRAP laws (an acronym for targeted regulations of abortion providers). These measures — requirements that providers have hospital admitting privileges, for instance, or that hallways be a certain width — don’t technically restrict abortions but have the effect of making it harder for clinics to remain open.
And a majority endorsed a federal preclearance requirement for state abortion laws, which Kamala Harris proposed in May. Only Andrew Yang and Sestak definitively rejected it.
Preclearance, which would block the laws in question until the Justice Department approved them, could stop TRAP laws as well as waiting periods and mandatory ultrasounds. It would also preempt bans like Alabama’s and laws like Georgia’s (both blocked by courts for now) that forbid abortion after six or eight weeks, before many women know they are pregnant.
A Shift to Offense
The idea of expanding abortion rights, not just maintaining them, was in the wings of the debate until recently. Now, it is center stage.
Like every Democratic president in the past 35 years, the candidates (except Gabbard) have all pledged to repeal the Mexico City policy, or global gag rule, which blocks foreign aid to organizations that provide abortion referrals or promote abortion rights. All of them want to undo Trump’s Title X rules, which similarly restrict family planning funding for organizations within the United States.
But they have also gone further. All of them want to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which blocks Medicaid coverage for abortion in most circumstances. Twelve want to repeal the Helms Amendment, which has prevented foreign aid from being used to cover abortions since 1973. (Biden’s campaign did not answer that question.)
Nine candidates want to require private insurers to cover abortion, though Biden’s campaign again declined to answer, Klobuchar said she was unsure and Sestak said no.
And seven said the drugs misoprostol and mifepristone, which induce abortions, should be available over the counter.
This would be a major leap from current policy, which restricts the drugs’ availability even by prescription, and would require multiple legal and regulatory changes. But if enacted, it would make it much harder to effectively ban abortion.
Betting on Public Opinion
A common thread in the candidates’ answers was a firm belief that the public is on their side.
Whether that is true is a complicated question, likely to play out next year as many elections since 2016 have — in the growing chasm between rural and suburban voters.
“A lot of his white, working-class voters are not in favor of abortion,” Madonna said of the president, but “suburban voters tend to be more liberal on a whole array of cultural issues.”
On the basic tenet that Roe v. Wade should stay, Democrats are on solid ground: Polls show that anywhere from 60% to more than 75% of Americans support Roe.
But there is much less support — 20% to 30%, generally — for making abortion always legal, as the candidates advocate. That is more popular than making it always illegal, but most Americans are in between.
Even among Democrats, according to Gallup, “legal under any circumstances” is a minority position, ranging from 39% to 46% in the past couple of years. Among independents, that number is about 25%.
So it is noteworthy that, in a historically large field, there is little differentiation among the candidates on abortion rights — even among the more moderate candidates who, on other issues, have emphasized courting swing voters.
“They’re setting the tone that this is something we should own proudly,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, “and not just react to when something happens.”
The New York Times sent a survey to 16 Democratic candidates on Nov. 5. Eleven completed it. For those who did not — Steve Bullock, Julián Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard and Kamala Harris — we examined publicly available information from policy papers, debates and interviews. The survey was conducted before Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick entered the race.

New leak reveals orders for China’s Muslim internment camps

Texto completo: HONG KONG — As the government accelerated mass detentions of Muslim minorities in northwest China, a senior official issued a secret directive giving detailed orders for how the rapidly expanding indoctrination camps holding them should be managed.
Guards should impose pervasive, round-the-clock video surveillance to prevent escapes. Inmates were to be kept isolated from the outside world and held to a strict scoring system that could determine when they might be released. And the facilities were to be shrouded in secrecy, with even employees banned from bringing in mobile phones.
“It is necessary,” the directive from two years ago said, “to strengthen the staff’s awareness of staying secret, serious political discipline and secrecy discipline.”
Now that secrecy has been shattered with the publication of the directive itself. It is one of six internal documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that shed new light on China’s crackdown in the Xinjiang region, where a million or more ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others have been detained in the past three years.
The disclosure of the 24 pages of documents amounts to a second significant leak from inside China’s ruling Communist Party related to the crackdown. A member of the Chinese political establishment shared a different, 403-page set of internal papers with The New York Times earlier this year, expressing hope that it would make it more difficult for party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to escape culpability for the mass detentions.
While the source of the new documents is unknown — they were provided by Uighur overseas networks — their disclosure may amount to another sign of dissent in the party over the crackdown.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, an independent nonprofit based in Washington, led the inquiry into the documents, bringing together more than 75 journalists from the consortium and 17 partner organizations, including The Times, in 14 countries. Outside experts also reviewed the papers and concluded they were authentic.
“In terms of documentary evidence, we have reached a next level of disclosure,” said Adrian Zenz, a researcher who has studied the camps and a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a human rights group in Washington. “The evidence we have now is very comprehensive, very complete. It’s kind of game over for Beijing in terms of the cover-up, the denials and the half-truths.”
The most significant of the new documents is the secret directive on how to manage the camps, which is the only document in both sets of leaked papers to describe the inner workings of these facilities. The nine-page order was issued in November 2017 by the Communist Party committee in Xinjiang that oversees legal affairs.
The papers also include four “daily bulletins” from another regional party committee that provide information about those that have been targeted for investigation and detention in camps and a court judgment sentencing a Uighur resident to 10 years in prison on charges of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination, a vaguely defined crime.
‘Prevent Escapes’
Beijing has rejected criticism of the camps and described them as job-training centers that use humane methods to fight the spread of Islamic extremism. Internally, the government often uses language consistent with that position. The leaked directive, for example, refers to the camps as “vocational skills education and training centers” and the detainees as “students.”
But it also lays bare the punitive underpinnings of these facilities, and some of its language on guarding against escapes and other incidents is identical to that used in guidelines for prisons and other detention sites.
The orders called on guards to strictly control and monitor the activities of students. “Prevent escapes while they are at class, dining, using the toilet, washing, receiving medical care or meeting with family.”
Other instructions call for erecting guardhouses and internal partitions inside the camps to prevent inmates from moving around freely; rigorously checking any people, vehicles or goods entering, and recruiting informants to spy on other detainees.
“Evaluate and resolve students’ ideological problems and abnormal emotions at all times,” the directive said.
The document included orders for “full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots,” and prohibited detainees from having contact with the outside world, except in strictly monitored interactions.
The government says these sites help prevent Uighurs and other Muslims from being drawn to religious extremism by teaching them the Chinese language, job skills and how to be law-abiding citizens. In response to the earlier leak of documents, the government argued that its methods have effectively stifled extremist violence in Xinjiang.
Former detainees, though, have described the classes as numbing, harsh and ultimately futile attempts at brainwashing. And residents have been sent to internment camps for behavior that would be commonplace elsewhere: traveling abroad, showing signs of religious devotion, praying regularly or growing a long beard, or installing certain cellphone apps, such as encrypted messaging tools.
One of the leaked daily bulletins orders an investigation of people from Xinjiang who have obtained foreign citizenship or applied for visas or other documents at Chinese embassies abroad.
Another describes how 15,683 “suspicious persons” were sent to centers in southern Xinjiang on the week of June 19, 2017. The government has repeatedly refused to say how many people are being held in these camps.
Other bulletins reveal how the authorities settled on targets for detention by using databases that collect and collate information on Xinjiang residents, especially Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.
The daily bulletins and the document on camp operations were signed by Zhu Hailun, who was then the top security official in Xinjiang. He was assigned to another position in the regional legislature early this year.
Zhu, 61, appears to have been a key enforcer of the internment campaign, turning the orders of the regional party secretary, Chen Quanguo, into detailed plans. A party official who spent his career in Xinjiang, Zhu had previously served as the head of Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, succeeding an official who was fired in 2009 after bloody ethnic riots killed nearly 200 people, most of them Han Chinese.
‘Promote Repentance’
The directive on camp operations instructed officials to keep extensive records on detainees, and described a scoring system that measured how they behaved to determine their fate.
Inmates should be assigned to one of three zones based on how dangerous they are judged to be — general management, strict, and very strict, the document said. But detainees could be moved between the grades of control depending on their scores.
“Break down scores and manage and individually assess the students’ ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline,” the document said.
Officials were told to assign inmates to fixed positions in dormitories, classes, lineups and workshops, and to control every detail of life inside the camps, at every moment of the day, including wake-up, meals, studies and showers.
Detainees must meet “disciplinary demands” or face punishment, the directive added.
“Strengthen the management of the students’ hygiene,” it said. “Ensure that they get timely haircuts and shave, change and wash their clothes. Arrange for them to have baths once or twice a week, so that they develop good habits.”
The demands listed in the directive echoed the accounts of former detainees like Orynbek Koksebek, an ethnic Kazakh man who spent four months in an indoctrination camp in Xinjiang after being detained by the Chinese authorities in December 2017.
“There was military discipline in everything we did, how you walk, stand up straight. If you didn’t, they would slap you,” he said in an interview in the Kazakh city of Almaty earlier this year.
A key disclosure in the leaked directive is an official description of the conditions that detainees must meet to be released from the camps. Aside from achieving a good score in the point system, the document said, inmates must be categorized at the lowest threat level and have served a minimum term of one year — though interviews with former detainees indicate that camps sometimes release people sooner.
The directive also emphasized the importance of showing remorse. Discussions with detainees should “promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past behavior,” it said.
A different document, among the set shared with The Times earlier this year, described how family members outside the camps are told that their behavior can also affect when a detainee is released — a implied threat aimed at silencing complaints.
Zharqynbek Otan, who was held in a camp for seven months after his arrest in January 2017 and has since fled China, said the goal of the detention was to impose loyalty to the Chinese state.
“The main purpose is to brainwash you,” he said, “so you forget your roots and everything about Islam and ethnic identity.”

El juez Ketanji Brown Jackson, del Tribunal de Distrito Federal para el Distrito de Columbia, rechazó el bloqueo de la administración Trump al proceso de juicio político contra el presidente . El gobierno había afirmado que los principales asesores de Trump estaban exentos de hablar sobre sus deberes oficiales y que, por tanto, ni siquiera acudirían a una citación.
Sin embargo, esto no garantiza que McGahn testifique pronto ya que lo más seguro es que el Departamento de Justicia presentará una apelación para que se suspenda el fallo del juez. El afectado y su abogado, William A. Burck, defienden que la batalla se libra entre el Congreso y la administración Trump para que los abogados del gobierno sean los que manejen el caso.
“Don McGahn acatará la decisión del juez Jackson a menos que se suspenda mientras se espera apelación”, dijo Burck a The New York Times por correo electrónico. “El Departamento de Justicia está manejando este caso, por lo que deberá preguntarles si tienen la intención de solicitar una suspensión”, añadió.
Aunque el Departamento de Justicia pida la suspensión para hacer apelaciones, el fallo también alcanza a la inmunidad que la Casa Blanca ha invocado sobre otros testigos para no colaborar con la investigación de los demócratas en el Congreso . Varios de ellos ya se han acogido a la teoría de la administración para negarse a declarar por el escándalo ucraniano.
Si McGahn se niega a testificar hasta que el caso llegue a la Corte Suprema y esta emita un fallo, es posible que el asunto no se resuelva a tiempo para que la declaración del exasesor del presidente tenga un peso importante en la investigación.

Texto completo: A Times editorial

To give President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans the benefit of the doubt, the opportunity zones created in the 2017 tax-cut legislation are intended to lure private investment into urban communities that need a boost. Yet too often, it appears the benefits are flowing to well-connected wealthy investors for projects in neighborhoods that dont need the help. Better screening up front and better public reporting afterward would prevent these lucrative tax breaks from being exploited.

One prime example of abuse: The son of the Waste Management and Blockbuster video billionaire Wayne Huizenga Sr. plans to build luxury apartment towers next to a marina for superyachts in West Palm Beach  which just happens to be in an opportunity zone. And as ProPublica reported, the site just happened to be designated an opportunity zone after Huizengas son appealed to then-Gov. Rick Scott, who had not originally planned to include the site on the state list submitted to the Trump administration for rubber-stamp approval. Funny how that worked.

Opportunity zones initially received little attention in the 2017 tax-cut legislation as scrutiny was aimed at reductions in the corporate income tax rate and individual tax rate cuts that primarily benefited the wealthiest Americans. The zones offer several incentives to wealthy investors. If they invest in projects the capital gains from the sale of stocks, for example, they can defer the capital gains tax on that money for up to seven years and get a tax break. Any appreciation on the new investment in the opportunity zone is tax free after 10 years if the project is sold. The Treasury Department chose a list of census tracts eligible to become opportunity zones based on poverty measures, and governors picked one-quarter of the tracts in their states. On its face, the concept offers promise for helping communities that need it.

In practice, its too often been a different story. The New York Times reported in August that the opportunity zone tax breaks are set to be used to help finance a fancy hotel in a trendy section of New Orleans, a 46-story apartment tower in a Houston neighborhood that doesnt need help and a new office tower in Miamis trendy Design District. There is no need to subsidize private development in areas that are doing fine on their own.

Then there are the political calculations in the opportunity zone designations. In Florida, as ProPublica reported, Scotts selections benefit three other wealthy contributors to his political efforts: Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik; Jorge Perez, a South Florida condo king; and Stephen Ross, a prominent Trump fundraiser and owner of the Miami Dolphins. Scott calls the questions about the political connections ridiculous, but they are legitimate.

Of course, some of the criticism of opportunity zones is easier from the outside looking in. The opportunity zone tied to Viniks Water Street development in downtown Tampa covers blocks that were vacant for years. (Vinik is part of FBN Partners, a group of local investors who have loaned $15 million to Times Publishing Co., which owns the Tampa Bay Times.) The Ybor City zone covers land that is dominated by warehouses and could be a site for a new Tampa Bay Rays stadium. In Pinellas County, there are 16 opportunity zones  including the Tropicana Field site that is ripe for redevelopment.

As always, the details in tax policy matter. Opportunity zones are a reasonable concept. Unfortunately, there was too much room for political maneuvering at the front end and no public accountability on the back end. Congress should pass legislation that at least would require public reporting of the value of the tax breaks in each opportunity zone and the public benefit.

Real impeachment bombshell? How to pronounce 'Kyiv'

Texto completo: As the first public impeachment hearings transfixed the country with revelations on a recalled ambassador and quid pro quos, America's collective mind was blown by another bombshell.
"Wait so Kiev is pronounced KEEVE (rhymes with Steve)?!?," star political forecaster Nate Silver wondered as many others online marveled that they had been pronouncing the Ukrainian capital wrong their whole lives.
I made a 30-second video explaining the lesson in post-Soviet politics: Kiev is a transliteration from Russian, Kyiv is the preferred Ukrainian transliteration, and after simplifying Ukrainian's guttural vowels for American speakers, the proper pronunciation is "Keeve." It's now my most popular tweet ever; apparently, this is the content Impeachment Twitter craves.
Beneath this quirky language lesson, however, lies a battle over the pages of history that Ukrainians in the era after their Maidan revolution -- which began six years ago -- have been struggling to rewrite.
Throughout its existence, the Ukrainian nation had been dominated by nearby powers, including Russia, Poland and Austria-Hungary. Before 1991, when Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, it had never existed as an independent state. The lens through which the modern world saw Ukraine was undeniably Russian. The language of higher education, of government and of privilege was Russian.
Ukrainian speakers were often ridiculed as provincial, or even politically, professionally and criminally chastised for their use of their native language. Taras Shevchenko, an artist, poet and Ukrainian national hero whose statue stands near Dupont Circle in Washington and in hundreds of locations across Ukraine, was exiled and sentenced to compulsory military service for promoting Ukrainian independence and writing poetry in Ukrainian, which the authorities referred to as "little Russian."
Since 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fomented a war in the country's eastern Donbas region, authorities in Kyiv have made a concerted effort at re-Ukrainianization, even down to the name of the capital city itself. It is not just a difference of transliteration but one of history, Ukrainians argue. The legendary founder of Kyiv, from whom the city gets its name is Prince Kyi, not Prince Kie.
The name also has political implications. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the #KyivNotKiev campaign last year to gain recognition for the Ukrainian spelling of the country's cities. "Under the Russian empire and later the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)," the ministry wrote, "Russification was actively used as a tool to extinguish each constituent country's national identity, culture and language. In light of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including its illegal occupation of Crimea, we are once again experiencing Russification as a tactic that attempts to destabilize and delegitimize our country."
Kyiv has gone to great lengths to protect its information space, undertaking domestic measures that have been criticized as antidemocratic, including blocking Russian social media platforms and establishing quotas for the usage of Ukrainian in print and on the radio and television.
Ukrainians aren't exaggerating when they describe Russian language as a cudgel of Kremlin influence. Putin has claimed that his aggressive foreign policy in places such as the Baltic states, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine has been in defense of Russian speakers and their rights. The Russian government funds a Russian cultural and language organization, called "Russki Mir" or "Russian World," which acts as an arm of Russian influence and soft power around the world. Russian-language media outlets posing as local media have peddled disinformation and targeted Russian-speaking populations across the former communist space.
Despite this background, embassies, media outlets and airports worldwide have been slow to correct their style guides and flight monitors. The capital's official transliteration has been Kyiv since 1995, but mentions of "Kiev" are still common.
The very fact that so many Americans were puzzled by the official pronunciation of Kyiv shows how effective the Kremlin has been in promoting its worldview.
Though Ukrainians may not expect Americans to master the guttural first syllable, they are rightfully offended when they see a spelling of their capital that has been defunct for nearly 25 years bandied about in print and on the international stage. And as inaccuracies abound, their country is once again thrust into the limelight, perceived as a football, or worse -- a casualty in a battle between great powers. But Ukrainians have agency. The least we can do is refer to their capital by its official name.
Since the quid pro quo drama began, at least, both The Washington Post and The New York Times finally announced they would use the Ukrainian spelling. For Kyiv, perhaps there is a silver lining, however thin, in the impeachment cloud.

WHY WE ARE LOSING FAITH ROGER STONE, JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND THE CRACKUP OF AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP

Texto completo: Roger Stone was recently convicted in federal court on seven felony charges, stemming from the since-closed Russian collusion investigation. Stone's main crime was lying to Congress about who he had, or had not, spoken to about Russia. By the time Stone's trial began in Washington, nobody was talking about WikiLeaks anymore. Nobody cared.
Yet prosecutors continued as if it were 2017. For lying about something now irrelevant, they argued that Roger Stone should spend up to 50 years in prison, the rest of his life.
Stone was convicted. Official Washington cheered. "Rot in hell!" they screamed on Twitter. What's interesting about the response to Stone's case - both from federal prosecutors and the conventional media - is how much harsher it was than anything that greeted convicted child molester Jeffrey Epstein. When Epstein was released from his first prison term, he hosted a dinner at his home with ABC News host George Stephanopoulos, former NBC host Katie Couric, Chelsea Handler, Woody Allen, Charlie Rose, British Prince Andrew and many others.
Do you think Mr. Stephanopoulos would consider having dinner at Stone's house? Of course not. That would be immoral. FBI officials, apparently, agree.
You'll remember what happened when Stone was arrested. Dozens of federal agents with automatic weapons, armored vehicles and a helicopter descended on his home in a middle-class part of Fort Lauderdale and rousted the 66-year-old and his wife from bed at rifle point. Just to make sure the event inflicted maximum humiliation, the feds tipped off CNN, which was there to capture the whole thing live. That's how our government treated a man facing perjury charges.
Epstein, by contrast, was accused of molesting at least 34 separate underage girls. How was he arrested? He wasn't. According to The New York Times account, prosecutors called Epstein's lawyers and asked him to turn himself in, which Epstein politely did. Nobody tipped off CNN. Just the opposite. Authorities tried to keep the whole thing secret, to preserve Epstein's dignity. One prosecutor wrote to Epstein's longtime attorney, former Bush administration senior official Jay Lefkowitz, assuring him that to "avoid the press," she could, "file the charge in district court in Miami, which will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly."
Pretty thoughtful treatment for a child molester. Ultimately, Epstein got a plea deal and all federal charges against him were dropped. The arrangement was kept secret even from Epstein's victims, so they wouldn't be able to complain or contest the agreement in court. Epstein received just 18 months. But instead of being sent to state prison, like most sex offenders in Florida, he served his term in a private wing of the Palm Beach County Stockade.
But even that wasn't lenient enough. After just three and a half months in custody, Epstein was freed on "work release," meaning that he was able to leave the grounds for 12 hours a day, six days a week. Sex offenders aren't supposed to be eligible for work release, but authorities gave it to Epstein anyway.
Apparently, Stone did something worse than molesting children. He mocked the people in charge and then helped Donald Trump get elected president. For that, he is likely to die in prison.
We have now heard credible allegations that NBC News covered for politically connected rapist Harvey Weinstein and ABC News covered for politically connected pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roger Stone, meanwhile, is headed to prison for something nobody even understands.
Prosecutors have a great deal of discretion in our legal system. The media has, rightfully, near-total freedom under our constitution. But our whole system collapses once the public loses faith in its basic fairness. A huge driver behind Mr. Trump's election was the American people's loss of faith in our leaders and our top legal, political, financial, educational and media institutions.
When rapists and pedophiles are protected as political disputes are criminalized, it's not hard to see why people are questioning the leadership of our country.

Texto completo: In emails uncovered during an internal review, the acting White House chief of staff also asked budget officials how long the aid could be withheld.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review.
The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $ 391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said.
The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel's Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats' impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.
An administration official on Sunday played down the significance of Mr. Mulvaney's inquiry, saying that anytime the budget office holds money, it produces a legal justification document. Mr. Mulvaney, the official said, was simply asking to review that document.
The person also hinted at growing tension between the budget office and the White House Counsel's Office, which the person said had never raised questions about the legality of the hold in real time.
"To be clear," said Rachel Semmel, a budget office spokeswoman, "there was a legal consensus at every step of the way that the money could be withheld in order to conduct the policy review. O.M.B. works closely with agencies on executing the budget. Routine practices and procedures were followed."
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
The overarching purpose of the review by the counsel's office was to clarify the actions of White House officials involved in the call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and it has helped officials establish a timeline around the withholding of the aid and the call. It originally centered on why John A. Eisenberg, a deputy White House counsel, decided to place a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for higher-level secret documents.
On the call, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to "do us a favor" and investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election. The White House has released a rough transcript of the call.
So far, the review has included interviews with a number of White House aides and officials on the National Security Council. The White House Counsel's Office has also reviewed the system that carries official emails to look for information related to the withheld aid.
Mr. Mulvaney has previously told associates that the aid was released after budget officials raised alarms that the deadline for doing so was approaching.
Officials close to both Mr. Mulvaney and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone -- who have been at odds since the beginning of 2019 -- expressed frustration that some of the details of the review had leaked.

Texto completo: A TV critic offers a suggestion, as well as answers to other questions from readers.
I've binged "Fleabag" and am all caught up with "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," so the real problem in our household hit recently when the reality of a Sunday minus "Succession" was upon us! What to do? -- Paula
To everyone who misses "Succession": Watch "BoJack Horseman." Really!
"BoJack" is a cartoon on Netflix, and it's about depression, addiction, show business and disappointment. BoJack is haunted by the hole in his life where his parents' love was supposed to be, and he deflects this pain with glibness. You want stories of mergers? There are stories of mergers! You want rich people being petulant but also underneath it all to be truly suffering? And how. You want season-long B-stories that add up to shocking results? Unusual sexual mores? Silly names? Criticism of the media? Skepticism toward anyone who seems happy or fulfilled? Slick, quick dialogue from characters who are being funny on purpose? I swear that even the opening title music sounds similar.
I get that "BoJack" might be a tough sell for people who typically avoid animation, and I'll also tell you that the first several episodes might seem like just a smart, punny spin on an antihero comedy. But the show is laying groundwork, and the seeming superficiality is part of a bigger plan.
If you're on the fence right now and don't mind spoilers, I'm going to be sacrilegious and tell you to watch Season 5, Episode 6, "Free Churro," in which BoJack delivers a eulogy lasting the show's entire 26 minutes. It's the most dramatic episode, and among the most impressive, and if that doesn't sell you on it, maybe nothing will.
I still love the beautiful feedback on "The Great British Baking Show," and, of course, the baked goods, but there's something we feel we are missing in the weekly format. Are there other nice cooking shows out there? The American "Master Chef" - and "Cake Boss"-style meanness isn't really our jam. -- Denise
The loveliest, most earnest and arguably best food show is "Salt Fat Acid Heat," on Netflix. Samin Nosrat is a chef and author (and a New York Times contributor) who travels the world to teach viewers about flavors and techniques. Unlike most other food and travel shows, though, this isn't aggro or show-offy, nor is it exoticizing. It's thoughtful, it's educational, it's beautifully shot -- and, most important, it's fun. Nosrat's expertise and enthusiasm make the show feel like the best class you've ever taken. There's less fretting than you'd get on "Baking Show," but that might be a good thing.
If you require a contest format, though, and "Top Chef" is too mean -- which it often is -- you might like "Food Network Star" (originally "Next Food Network Star"), in which contestants compete not just on cooking skills but on telegenic skills, too. There's also "Zumbo's Just Desserts," another dessert-contest show, which has a slightly zany spin but is still good-natured and supportive.
I'm trying to figure out how to persuade myself and my girlfriend to try "Friday Night Lights." ( Fun fact: We actually live in Tim Riggins's house from the show ... and yes, we still get a handful of people every week who stop to take pictures of the house .) Yes, yes, I know if that isn't enough to get me to watch the show, nothing probably will. But I've tried watching the first few episodes, and it's just hard not to roll my eyes. It probably doesn't help that I grew up in a small Texas town and lived firsthand a lot of the stereotypes in the show. But humor me: Does it get better and it is worth my time? -- Shawn
While I'm astounded to hear that you did not like the pilot of "Friday Night Lights" -- one of my favorite pilots ever -- I can at least give you this: Set yourself free. If you don't like the first few episodes, you're not going to like the rest of it.
I won't even guilt you to give it another try; it sounds as if you really gave it a shot, and you just didn't like it. Maybe it was overhyped, or maybe it was too close to (literal) home. We can't care about everything! If you want something mega-earnest that's a little further afield, try "Parenthood."
I was one of the few who had never watched an episode of " Downton Abbey " and was able to binge-watch the entire series. I absolutely loved every character, and the setting was delicious. But where to now?! I could go back to reading novels, but I'd miss the eye candy. -- Cathy
Go seek Spanish historical dramas. (These are all on Netflix, and they're all in Spanish with subtitles, or dubbed.) Start with "Cable Girls," which kicks off in Madrid in 1928. Everyone wants to work at the telephone company, and our four heroines are among the lucky few; one also commits crimes. Then there's the slightly more sophisticated "The Time in Between," which starts in the 1930s and follows a seamstress who falls into a life of adventure and espionage. The costumes are great, and the romances are a blast. Finally, try "Velvet," set in a department store in the 1950s, when cross-class romances are verboten and thus flourish. It's quite glam and total catnip to those of us who wanted Rachel Menken to have a "Mad Men" spinoff.

Texto completo: I wanted to take the first flight to Tehran, but I am unable to travel to Iran.
One evening in May I got a call from my 83-year-old father in Iran. He was suffering from delirium and being treated at an excellent hospital in Lavasan, an upscale suburb in northern Tehran.
"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has infiltrated the I.C.U. -- they're going to execute me!" he said. "Call your congressman! You are my last hope."
I fought my shock and tears. "I will, Baba," I said. "I will."
I wanted to leave my home in Washington, take the first flight to Tehran and bring him back with me. But I am unable to travel to Iran. I worked for nine years as a television journalist at Voice of America's Persian Service, most of it on camera. The Iranian government views journalists who work for the Persian Service as traitors. Going back -- especially during a period of intensified hostility between the United States and Iran -- carried the risk of being imprisoned. I felt small, frustrated and helpless.
After my father called that May evening, I attended my daughter's final high school concert. She had won a prestigious college scholarship. I tried hard to focus on her as she played her violin, but my mind returned to my father far away in Tehran.
A few weeks earlier, he had been operated on for gallstones. Because he was a cancer survivor, the doctors moved him into an intensive care unit after the surgery. For some reason, he succumbed to delirium and was reliving a period of imprisonment after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
I last saw him in 2007, when he was still able to visit us in the United States. He began to teach my daughter, 5 years old at the time, how to swim, ride a bike, and even read and write in Persian. He made several American friends, with whom I'm still friends. A charming man, he loved Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra, ballroom dancing, backgammon, crossword puzzles and Johnnie Walker Scotch. But his heart belonged to poetry. He knew thousands of verses by heart and would recite appropriate ones for every occasion.
Before the revolution, my father was a diplomat. He earned a Ph.D. in the mid-1960s and was Iran's last representative in Tel Aviv. We lived there for a few months, when I was 6 years old. I still remember how ours was the only house on our street with the lights on and bustling with activity while our neighbors observed the Sabbath.
After the revolution, he was jailed several times. Even after he was freed, the Iranian regime treated us like second-class citizens. He was not allowed to work, was denied a pension and health insurance. His passport was confiscated. The rest of our family was also denied health insurance and passports. I was forbidden to speak about his posting in Israel because my parents feared I might be expelled from school and lose my friends.
Twenty-five years after the revolution, in 2004, during the last term of President Mohammad Khatami, we were finally given passports. I applied for a job in the United States. I took numerous tests, sat through several interviews at the American Embassy in the United Arab Emirates and underwent a detailed background investigation. I was selected from among 1,267 applicants. I moved to Washington with my daughter in the summer of 2005.
Many of my co-workers at the Persian Service distrusted me as a new arrival from Iran. Supporters of the deposed monarchy thought I was an agent of the Islamic Republic, ex-Communists suspected I was a monarchist, and others disliked me simply because I got my job on merit and not through diaspora connections. I hid my initial struggles from my father, who had invested heavily in getting me the right education.
After my father's phone call and my daughter's concert that May evening, I called the hospital in Tehran and spoke to its director, Dr. Reza Fattahi. "We love your father. We are even more concerned about his well-being than you are," he assured me. I couldn't stop worrying.
I had tried to bring my father to the United States in the winter of 2017. Applicants who are 80 and older do not need to be interviewed in person. Yet he was instructed to go to Ankara, Turkey, for an interview in March 2018, where he was told he would get a tourist visa in a few weeks. Six months later, I got an email saying his visa application was denied because of the Trump travel ban.
On an early June morning, the day of my daughter's high school graduation ceremony, my father was released from the hospital. Once he was home, we connected via FaceTime every day. He walked, talked and ate by himself. But I sensed something was off. My sister and her husband, who live in Tehran, got a doctor to check on him. Blood tests revealed he had an infection. His blood pressure was low and he was not alert. My sister and her husband moved him to another hospital.
On June 22, I was traveling with my daughter for her college orientation. We checked into a hotel and settled in to prepare for her big day. I kept telling myself to focus on my daughter and not be distracted by my worries about my father.
But I continued messaging my brother-in-law in Tehran for updates: Baba had developed a septic infection and was not doing well. I drifted off to sleep around 1 a.m. At 1:42 a.m. my phone rang.
My brother-in-law was crying, barely able to talk: "Baba's gone."
"What do you mean?" I stubbornly replied. "Tell them to revive him!"
"He's gone, Mehrnaz! They revived him twice. He didn't come back."
During college orientation sessions, I could not sit still. I could not listen to parents asking why they could not have access to their 18-year-olds' grades and not be alerted if their child drank excessively. I paced the hallways, thinking, "Septic shock? My baba? My strong dad?"
I was numb and angry with my father's doctors at Mehraeen Hospital for missing the sepsis diagnosis and releasing him early.
I emailed a supervisor at work to get leave for a few weeks. We had lived in the same neighborhood in Tehran as children. He wrote back saying that my father had taught him to swim, and he would never forget that.
In the days that followed, I heard numerous stories of my father's generosity. Yet the politics, the unending conflict between the United States and Iran, came between us. I couldn't take the flight to see him one last time or bring him to Washington for medical treatment.
I dream of my father at night. I see him having trouble breathing. I see him in jail. I hear his voice asking me to call my congressman. I remain caught between the land of my birth and my adopted country, feeling helpless, a bit like a lost animal caught in the headlights on the highway.

Texto completo: NEW YORK
From the mountains of shoes that were worn by Jews when they were packed into railroad freight cars bound for Auschwitz, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust displays one: a woman's red dress pump with a three-inch heel. It prompts viewers to wonder: Where did she think she was going?
Perhaps she did not have time to think when she was swept into the vortex of one of Europe's innumerable roundups. She was destined for the unimaginable, where she probably vanished quickly: Nine hundred thousand of the 1.3 million people sent there were murdered shortly after their arrival.
The New York Times of Jan. 28, 1945, reported on its front page the Red Army's arrival the day before at Auschwitz, which the story described, in its 16th-paragraph, as a place where more than 1 million 'persons' were murdered. Persons. Of them, 1 million were Jews.
A yellowed Times edition from that date is displayed today in the museum, which is located on Manhattan's southern tip, near the spot where, in 1654, 23-Jews who had come from Spain and Portugal, via Brazil, became the first Jews in what was then New Amsterdam. The museum's six-sided Core building evokes the six-pointed Star of David, and the 6-million Jews killed in the Holocaust, which is the subject of a shattering exhibit, 'Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away.' The eloquence of the artifacts, which were first seen when the exhibit opened in Madrid and will be seen elsewhere in North America, is welcome testimony, in an age obsessed with new media, to the power of an old medium: the museum.
The exhibit includes Reinhard Heydrich's gift for Hermann Göring on his 47th birthday. Before Heydrich was assassinated by Czech partisans in 1942, he was the 'architect of the Final Solution.' His gift was a piece of parchment: the original 1551 proclamation, signed by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, requiring Jews to attach to their garments a yellow circle. The seeds of the Holocaust germinated for centuries in Europe's social soil. They did not, however, have to come to their cataclysmic fruition.
Other artifacts include Heinrich Himmler's handwriting in his annotated first edition of 'Mein Kampf.' And a photo of Anne Frank's parents' wedding. And a child's shoe with a sock carefully tucked into it, waiting for the child to put it back on after the 'shower' to which he had been directed, from which he did not return.
Did you know that eight of the 15-participants in the Jan. 20, 1942, Wannsee Conference, which finalized plans for the industrialization of murder, had doctoral degrees? Education is not necessarily an inoculation against evil. Only two participants were older than 50: Genocide was a project for up-and- comers, idealists who acquired the ideals from socialization under totalitarianism.
The exhibit includes grainy, black-and-white film of a passing freight train shedding notes the way a tree shed leaves in autumn, notes tossed from between the freight cars' slats by the human cargo who were desperate to scatter random traces of themselves before the final darkness. One was tossed from a train leaving Holland by 17-year-old Hertha Aussen: 'Most likely this will be the last card you will receive from me.' Three days later, she was murdered on arrival at Auschwitz.
What also died at Auschwitz is " was " what is known as the Whig theory of history, which holds, or held, that there is an inevitable unfolding of history in the direction of expanding liberty under law. Just as the Holocaust was not inevitable, neither is the triumph of enlightenment: History is not a ratchet that clicks only one way. Today, in several parts of the world, including on the dark, churned and bloody ground of Central Europe, there are various forms of political regression. These are marked by a recrudescence of the blood-and-soil tribalism of degenerate nationalism, accompanied by thinly veiled, or not at all veiled, anti-Semitism.
Visitors entering 'Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away' immediately walk past these words of Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor: 'It happened, therefore it can happen again.' Today, in China's far west, concentration camps hold more than 1 million people who Beijing says show 'symptoms' of being 'infected' with the 'virus' of 'unhealthy thoughts.' Similar medical terminology presented the Holocaust as social hygiene.
Polls indicate that a majority of millennials do not know what Auschwitz was. The future might teach them by analogies.

House Democratic infighting subsides as caucus focuses on impeaching Trump

Texto completo: For almost four months, House Democrats have enjoyed something that once seemed unattainable: relative calm inside their caucus.
Democrats have tamped down the internal friction that dominated the spring and summer, creating divisions along ideological and generational lines, as they instead focus on the far more consequential battle of trying to impeach President Trump.
The self-proclaimed 'Squad' " the four young, first-term liberal congresswomen who clashed earlier in the year with fellow freshmen from swing districts " has drifted into the background with so much attention now focused on the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry.
None of the more than 60 freshman Democrats sits on that key panel, which has given the newcomers a chance to learn the ropes without the kleig lights of cable news chasing them every which way.
In recent weeks, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has walked the Capitol halls alone, no staffers at her side monitoring the media questions she has faced, because very few members of the media have been hounding the highest-profile Squad member.
On Thursday, just off the House floor, she fielded a few questions about her policy positions on social media, not any dispute with fellow Democrats.
'It's been a relief,' she acknowledged afterward.
Democrats across the spectrum have noticed the detente.
'Have you heard much from them recently? Not really,' said Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), a senior member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition.
Impeachment is always mentioned first as a reason that the typical Democratic infighting has subsided, according to Schrader, Ocasio-Cortez and a handful of senior aides.
Ironically, it previously divided the caucus, as liberals believed the special counsel report on Russian interference in the 2016 election provided enough ammunition to impeach Trump. But dozens of Democrats from swing districts found that their constituents were confused by the complicated case, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sided with the swing-district representatives.
Then the Ukraine issue broke open and, rather than holding back, those swing-district freshmen led the push to start the inquiry. And under the watch of Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) the past two months went better than any Democrat expected.
Schrader, who never shies from a battle with the liberal flank, praised Schiff's handling of the probe and brushed aside GOP complaints about the process.
Ocasio-Cortez said polling has shifted enough in the Democratic direction on impeachment that the issue no longer splits the caucus. 'Frankly, I think that a lot more people are on the same page about the president's misconduct, even in the country, now than before,' she said.
But Democrats say tensions also eased within the caucus because so many freshmen are finally learning the rhythm of Congress. In the earliest days of the new majority, basic procedural votes created pitched battles over how many Democrats sided with Republicans, including a few dozen endangered freshmen worried that even a single obscure vote could be used against them in next year's elections.
'When we first get here, all of us are freshmen. Every vote seems make-or-break,' Ocasio-Cortez explained.
Over time, those procedural votes have lost their potency, with less acrimony directed at the few Democrats who vote with Republicans.
Schrader, now in his sixth term, said that every member of the House eventually learns that their agenda needs a coalition to pass, and coalitions require building relationships and allies.
'One thing you learn serving in a legislative body, you don't have any friends, you don't have any enemies. You have got allies and adversaries, and they change at any given moment on any given bill,' he said.
Ocasio-Cortez received an education in this during the July debate on the Pentagon policy bill. She pushed a pair of amendments to bar the Defense Department from deploying troops to the southern border and to restrict funds from being spent on holding undocumented immigrants at military facilities.
More than 50 fellow Democrats opposed her amendments, which received fewer than 180 votes, well short of the majority.
Insiders think her poor vote total can be attributed to the policy and personality clashes that came just a few weeks before. Democrats pushed a bill to ease the crisis of undocumented immigrants at the border, including mandates over the conditions and treatment of those in detention centers.
Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) voted against the original bill, and after Pelosi relented to pressure from moderates and put the Senate bill on the floor, they led the fight against that bill.
Democratic staffers spent the next weekend in a public war of words on Twitter, a clash compounded by Pelosi's interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd in which the speaker demeaned the Squad as just 'four people' with four votes.
Finally, at the end of July, Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez held an hour-long meeting behind closed doors. A week later, the rising liberal star shook up her senior staff amid a more-than six-week break, something that served as a relief for freshmen who would spend time with their families, campaign and go on official trips abroad.
Many returned with a new outlook. Among them was Ocasio-Cortez, who described her conversations with fellow Democrats as much more productive now.
'I know you feel this way about this, but what about we work together on that?' Ocasio-Cortez said.
Schrader praises Pelosi's touch, a remarkable sentiment considering how bitter the Blue Dogs felt toward leadership during Pelosi's first reign as speaker. That ended with many of those moderate-to-conservative Democrats wiped out in the 2010 midterm elections.
Now, Schrader said, the Blue Dogs have the 'ear of leadership,' including weekly meetings with other ideological caucuses. 'It's night-and-day difference. You can't even compare. Oh yeah, it's night-and-day difference. Yeah, we were dead to them 10 years ago.'
How long will this detente last? Probably not long, these being Democrats.
Ocasio-Cortez noted that the caucus has benefited from not having any immigration and border legislation to consider in the past four months, something that is coming in a few weeks when Congress must pass spending bills that will lead to another clash with Trump over his demands for funding of a border wall.
A new North American trade deal could hit the floor next month or in early January.
And Schrader actually thinks impeachment is causing its own problems, distracting lawmakers from other agenda items.
'I'd argue the tension is high now, not against one another but just the whole impeachment thing. It's tough to break through that,' he said.

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

Texto completo: Election Day, 2020. The polls have just closed. All indications point to a resounding verdict. Historians, loath to make narrative sense of an age without waiting for the vapors of passion to pass, agree on one thing.
It was, they say, Nov. 20, 2019, that ensured the outcome — a day and a night that crystallized the choice for the majority of Americans ready to toss Donald Trump from office.
The impeachment hearings had been bumping along, the main story clear: a parade of impeccable public servants trying to uphold the values of their country against a gangster White House. A candidate who had gloated over chants of “lock her up” for an opponent who had used unsecured emails had, once elected, conducted foreign policy by extortion, on open cellphone lines penetrated by the Russians.
Most Americans felt that Trump had committed an impeachable offense, but barely half favored removing him by the constitutional equivalent of the death penalty.
Then came the bullet-headed Republican, Gordon Sondland, an oddball hotelier whose ambassadorship to the European Union was a million-dollar quid pro quo. Some predicted he would take the Fifth.
Instead, he said that the unusual diplomatic dance in Ukraine was not part of a rogue operation holding up American tax dollars as part of a scheme to take down a political opponent. It was White House policy, the government of the people in service of one person.
“We followed the president’s orders,” he said. “Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.”
This was not a Democrat or a “deep state” operative, but someone with a character reference from Trump himself — “a really good man and a great American.” And after wincing at the shrapnel of this testimony, Trump reverted to form, the default mode of presidential mendacity: “I barely know the man.”
It was now clear beyond doubt; there were more smoking guns than you would find after a hunting trip with Dick Cheney. The corrupt president had become the corrupt policy. He’d run a fraudulent university, a dubious charity and bragged of cheating on prior wives; no surprise that he directed a foreign policy obsessed with a scheme to extort a fragile ally. As any novelist could have predicted, character was destiny.
Republicans had chased phantoms, political ephemera. Like Trump, they listened to propagandists in the right-wing press and fell into a hole of irrelevance. What about the whistleblower? Unmask him! He’s a deep-stater, a never-Trumper!
But the whistleblower was only a bit player, another in a long line of public servants whose vaccine of duty was strong enough to resist the contagion of Trump. The whistleblower’s motive was, perhaps, stated best by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the Purple Heart on his dress uniform speaking loudly, who said simply, “Here, right matters.”
A month or so into 2020, Trump would be impeached. Sondland’s testimony could not get the Cult of Trump, and those cowards in office who fear that mob, to budge. But those who voted for removal put a tattoo on the 45th president that can never be erased: He violated the sacred oath. The record was there for all time.
It remained for the Democrats to do their part. At a crucial debate on the evening of the most consequential day of the Trump presidency, the opposition party needed to show that they were not the crazy Marxists of an election some had framed as socialists vs. the sociopath.
They had no clear front-runner. But they had an elder statesman, revered the world over, the two-term former president. When Barack Obama urged moderation, saying, “The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,” the Democrat who will win on this election night of 2020 heeded his advice.
That crucial debate came while the race was still in flux. But a trio of elections the same month had given Democrats a road map. They could win in deeply red Kentucky and Louisiana, and complete the political transition in Virginia, if they backed popular plans to elevate average Americans. That, and Trump’s policies of trying to deny health care to the poor, of running up a trillion-dollar deficit to enrich a handful at the very top, of turning a blind eye to mass shootings of schoolchildren, would take down Republicans.
Sanity prevailed. Most Democrats came to see that it would do nothing for their cause to gain another million progressives on the coasts if they still lost 80,000 people in the old industrial heartland. The key, as extolled by the eventual winner, was to rebuild the Obama coalition.
At the center of that legion of decency were women, wondering aloud why the United States was one of the few nations on earth without paid family leave for new mothers. They led by example. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar said on that debate night: “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.”
Because the winner took these lessons to heart, because there was no denying the facts of Trump’s deep corruption and dereliction of duty, because every midnight of the American soul has been followed by a dawn, the outcome on this election night was never in doubt.

Texto completo: His tie is too long: Impeach him!
My articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump:
1. The president has flagrantly, repeatedly conducted foreign policy.
2. By his disparaging public calls to "drain the swamp" in Washington, D.C., he has made great numbers of lifelong bureaucrats and previous political appointees feel swampy.
3. The president and his associates have deliberately refused to provide evidence for the impeachment inquiry, pressuring honorable members of Congress to uncomfortably revise investigated grounds of impeachment from "quid pro quo" to "extortion" to "bribery." Such continued presidential noncooperation could compel even more far-reaching and laborious searches for impeachment grounds.
4. Failing to first consult with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, The New York Times or MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, the president underwent a medical checkup ahead of schedule.
5. His tie is too long.
6. This president is uncouth. Whereas it is agreed upon by most sophisticates in our most important urban centers of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as by the emerging consensus of prosperous suburbanites who have fled those cities: A president must be couth.
7. By winning crucial support from many voters in the Upper Midwest who had voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, the improperly elected president deeply disappointed President Obama in 2016.
8. The president's bleached-blond hair manifestly mocked his opponent in the 2016 election.
9. The president's incorrect language and policies have put the respected journalists of "The View" at risk of laryngitis and exploding heads.
10. He has tweeted often and verbosely for that medium, and is inferentially responsible for Twitter's limit of 140 characters per tweet being raised to 280. And he refuses to shut up.
11. The president eats McDonald's food but doesn't drink alcohol, sending mixed signals and causing confusion among millions of Americans with bad habits.
12. He is president.
-- David Bittinger, Brookfield, Wisconsin

Editorial board, take a stand
The headline for the Tribune editorial on Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testimony ("Sondland further damaged Trump. Will more Americans call for impeachment?," Nov. 21) acknowledged that it was damaging to the president, and then asked if more Americans would call for impeachment. I would ask: When will the Tribune Editorial Board call for impeachment instead of sidestepping the issue? The facts have not been disputed; there was a quid pro quo. Yet the Republicans ignore the truth and spin conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elections.
To make matters worse, the editorial ends with a Republican talking point: that an impeachment will overturn an election, and the will of the people. By definition, impeachment overturns an election, and the Founders certainly knew that. I don't see that as a valid defense. Likewise, the idea that we are so close to an election should also bear on the impeachment decision is equally bogus. If we defer impeachment because the election is 12 months away, why not then 18 or 24 months away? It is an arbitrary condition with no constitutional support, similar to what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did with President Barack Obama's Merrick Garland nomination to the Supreme Court.
This is not the time for Chicago's, and the Midwest's, paper of record to not take a stand on impeachment. Your readers deserve as much.
-- Richard Keslinke, Algonquin

Dems are rooting for failure
When Donald Trump was elected, I wanted him to do well so the country would do well. But it seems the people who control the news media and the Democratic Party would rather see the country fail than have President Trump succeed.
If it is Donald Trump versus a socialist Democrat in 2020, I would have to vote for Trump.
How sad.
-- Terry Shanahan, Bloomington

Trump's divisiveness is apparent
I am a well-educated Republican, and I can tell that our president is a divisive individual, although he does not know he is. Can't other Republicans not act from fear but instead see the person for who he is? How can they live with their consciences? Must they wait until elections to know that the majority of voters do not see their way?
-- Carol Spale, North Riverside

Members of Congress, do your job
Now is the perfect time to move on. We have had enough of endless investigations and inquiries. Both sides of the aisle should get on with what they have been elected to do -- solve the problems of the country. It is a win-win situation. The Democrats can be the "bigger person" and agree to disagree. The Republicans can finish out the rest of the term accomplishing the agenda they were elected to do.
I am very tired of this constant bickering and partisanship. It has gone on long enough. Our debates no longer center on how to solve problems but on where to place the blame, and that is getting us absolutely nowhere. We are so much better than this constant fighting. We are now at the point that opinions count more than solutions. I would respect our members of Congress more if they worked together for the American people. Now is the perfect time.
-- Sue Atkenson, Palos Park

Burlington police train using de-escalation techniques

Texto completo: A Burlington police officer and a distraught man came to blows outside the University of Vermont Medical Center earlier this year when the man was blocking an ambulance bay and arguing with security.
Several days later, that man, Douglas Kilburn, was found dead in his home. His death certificate showed the officer's punches were a contributing factor in Kilburn's death.
Over the past several years, Burlington police leaders have touted their commitment to training officers to peacefully resolve incidents without resorting to physical force.
However, a member of a committee reviewing the department's policies said he is worried that officers are straying from what they are being taught — inadvertently escalating some situations.
A use-of-force expert asked to review the case by Vermont's attorney general said Officer Cory Campbell's tone of voice and profane language while dealing with Kilburn helped escalate the situation to the point where Campbell needed physical force to subdue Kilburn.
While Campbell broke no law in his dealings with Kilburn, he failed to follow contemporary training for de-escalating the situation, consultant Steve Ijames determined.
The leader of a national police policy organization and the city's police chief said Burlington is one of the leaders in a national transition toward rethinking how police interact with the community, which can come with growing pains.
What do police statistics show? Between 2012 and 2018, Burlington police used force in less than 1% of all calls, according a use of force report published by the department this month.
Both the number of total calls and the number of use-of-force incidents have also decreased overall in those seven years — the latter by 40%.
When officers did use force, one in five incidents resulted in injury to people encountering police. The statistics do not specify whether the person was harmed by the officer or in some other way. Officers were injured in 12% of the calls.
The report also shows that the number of use-of-force incidents spiked during the late night hours in downtown Burlington. In general, 30% of all Burlington police incidents occur in the downtown area.
The types of force used most often by Burlington police were physical force and pepper spray.
Halfway through 2019, there were 90 incidents in which police used physical force on a person.
Ensuring the sanctity of life In 2016, the Police Executive Research Forum chose Burlington police as one of seven departments to participate in a pilot program to teach officers how to avoid having to use lethal force.
The program was geared toward safely resolving calls involving mentally ill or emotionally distressed people who are either unarmed or armed with a weapon other than a gun.
The training that came out of this project was called ICAT, or "Integrating Communication, Assessment and Tactics." Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo said almost 100% of Burlington's officers have been exposed to the ICAT principles through routine training since 2016.
The training emphasizes critical decision-making and providing officers with more options before using physical or lethal force. It teaches officers how to recognize a crisis situation, tactics for slowing down that situation and communicating with a person in crisis.
"The goal is to help officers avoid reaching the point where their lives or the lives of others become endangered and the officers have no choice but to use lethal force," according to an online ICAT training guide.
'This is not an officer who is spoiling for a fight' This training has becomes even more important as the number of people struggling with mental illness with whom police interact has increased over time.
According to the department's use-of-force report, 43% of the people on which force was used were perceived to be either mentally or emotionally disturbed.
Burlington police are still reviewing Campbell's encounter with Kilburn, but del Pozo said that Campbell had, at the very least, been trained in the types of scenarios where ICAT concepts are "baked in."
He employed some of these tactics, such as showing empathy and using a calm voice, in an initial interaction with Kilburn.
Campbell again encountered an upset Kilburn after the man had been asked to leave the hospital a second time. This time, he was blocking an ambulance bay with his car.
"Clearly Officer Campbell spoke in a way and used a vocabulary that caused Douglas Kilburn to attack him," del Pozo said, referring to the second encounter. However, he added that officers are allowed to use firm commands — but not profanity — to try to gain control of a situation, which is what Campbell appeared to be attempting.
Campbell's actions before punches were exchanged — trying to keep Kilburn's car door closed, trying to prevent Kilburn from punching him — showed the officer's intentions, del Pozo added.
"This is not an officer who is spoiling for a fight," del Pozo said. "This is an officer who is physically trying to stop a fight."
Policy vs. practice: Is there a disconnect in Burlington? The Kilburn case and several others that involved questions of excessive force this year have some concerned that police are inadvertently causing situations to escalate.
One of those people is Dr. Kevin Rodgers, who works in the University of Vermont Medical Center and teaches psychopharmacology at the UVM medical school and at Northern Vermont University.
Rodgers is the representative appointed from the mental health community who serves on a new committee that is reviewing Burlington Police Department policy and community policing practices. The committee will eventually bring recommendations for policy and policing practice improvements to the City Council.
"There's a lot of emphasis on de-escalation, and I don't think there's enough attention being paid to potentially how police officers are inadvertently escalating situations," Rodgers said, speaking about his own observations and not on behalf of the committee.
However, he added, "There are a lot of things that the Burlington Police Department are doing well, I think. They have really excellent policy and they're really thoughtful in terms of how they're dealing with people in the community who may be challenged by mental health disorders."
Rodgers said he hopes that the Burlington police will continue to implement ICAT training. He also emphasized the importance of proactive rather than reactive policing.
This would include ensuring officers aren't overworked or overly stressed and have proper wellness resources in addition to determining the causes of situations that most often require use of force to look for solutions.
On a larger scale, Rodgers hoped that training at the Vermont Police Academy — where law enforcement across the state are certified — will eventually include ICAT principles. That way, officers coming to Burlington won't receive training at the outset that conflicts with later training.
"I think there is a sense that the current training the officers are receiving is not in line with what current Burlington Police Department leadership would like," Rodgers said. "As a community member, I could also say I don't know that the training they're receiving is in line with what our community would expect and would like to see."
Challenging conventional police training In a recent op-ed in the New York Times, del Pozo made the case for training officers to use their guns as a means to stay safe only if a calm and reassuring approach fails.
"Every American will be made safer by police officers whose first instinct is to communicate with the people they encounter and whose success lies in getting the psychology of persuasion right," del Pozo wrote.
Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said the department's use-of-force report makes clear that Burlington is implementing ICAT principles and is committed to transparency.
But, he said, it's both a policy and culture change, and those take time as well as buy-in from both leaders and those they lead.
"In these situations, it shouldn't be the most important thing is a cop can go home safe at night," Wexler said. "The most important thing should be for everybody to go home safe at night."

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was confronted Thursday in Atlanta by a mostly black crowd of pro-school choice demonstrators who oppose her anti-charter and anti-voucher platform on schools.
The tenor, volume, and unrelenting nature of the demonstration got to the point where Warren stepped back from her podium and called on Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts to deal with the protesters.
“What do we do with this?" the senator asked the black congresswoman of the activists, who were being shouted down at the time by Warren’s mostly white supporters.
Pressley then took the microphone and admonished the demonstrators, promising them that Warren would talk about “the contributions fighters like you have made to history," adding further that they should not “dishonor” that history.
Unsurprisingly, neither the Washington Post nor MSNBC, both of which have dedicated an enormous amount of time and energy to promoting Warren’s 2020 Democratic primary campaign, have made any effort to cover the incident, despite its inherent newsworthiness. Then again, what else would you expect from the same newsrooms that act as the Massachusetts senator’s official hagiographers?
EW
MSNBC, the news coverage of which used the term “ultimate clapback" to describe Warren’s unrealistic plan to fund her even more unrealistic $34 trillion “Medicare for all” proposal, has yet to publish a report detailing Thursday’s pro-school choice protests of the senator’s campaign event.

One of the cable news network's hosts did, however, mention the Atlanta incident Friday at about noon during a broadcast of Andrea Mitchell Reports. But the demonstrations came up only so that the show’s host, Mitchell, could ask the New York Times’ s Jeremy Peters whether South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s campaign can overcome its struggle to attract black voters.

You cannot make this stuff up.
AM
The Washington Post, which published a glowing profile of Warren in October that reads like it was written by an adolescent fan, has not reported a single detail of Thursday’s pro-school choice protests.
The “Democracy Dies in Darkness” newspaper did, however, publish a lengthy defense on Friday of Warren’s pre-K-12 school reform plan. The Washington Post also published a report early Friday morning titled, “How women candidates are making girls feel better about politics.” News you can use.
It boggles the mind that neither MSNBC nor the Washington Post believes it is newsworthy that one of the top-tier 2020 Democratic candidates was met Thursday with protests at her own campaign event. It is even crazier that these newsrooms skipped the story when one takes into consideration both its racial undertones and the fact that organizations such as MSNBC usually jump at the chance to talk about the intersection of race and politics. Some of us still remember the cable network’s 2012 presidential election programming, which included discussions about whether the words “Chicago,” “golf,” and “angry” were racist dog whistles.
A white senator who used to claim minority status calling on a black congresswoman to quiet down a crowd of mostly black demonstrators? Yeah, that seems at least a little newsworthy. It is extremely telling that MSNBC and the Washington Post believe otherwise.

ANALYSIS: Biden all-in on Iowa ahead of eight-day bus trip

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa — Joe Biden's campaign has suggested he could win the 2020 Democratic nomination even if he loses in the two most prominent primary season states, Iowa and New Hampshire.
The former vice president's campaign schedule suggests that calculus has changed.
Biden, 77, will embark on an eight-day bus trip starting on Dec. 1. Biden to date has campaigned regularly, if not frequently, in the state, which holds its caucuses Feb. 3, in what is the nation's first nomination contest. Biden will also visit the state this weekend, beginning with stops in the Des Moines area on Friday with two others scheduled nearby on Saturday.
But his more intense focus on Iowa comes amid increasingly intense challenges from 2020 Democratic primary rivals, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, along with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The bus trip, which includes visits to towns and cities in 18 counties featuring town halls and other events, upends the campaign's willingness to forsake Iowa and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary, if necessary. The old plan envisioned Biden looking past those states and winning big in the Feb. 29 South Carolina primary. Over more than three decades of campaigning in South Carolina in his three presidential runs, Biden has built up strong relationships with the state's black community, which is expected to comprise up to 60% of the primary vote. The RealClearPolitics average has Biden leading in South Carolina with 35.3%, more than double Warren's 16.3% backing.
The latest Iowa trips come as Biden has seen his position in the state fall to fourth place, according to the latest poll from Iowa State University. That survey found Biden's support at 12%, trailing Sanders by six points, seven behind Warren, and 14 points behind Buttigieg. A Siena College/New York Times poll released Nov. 1 found his Iowa support at 17%, placing him in fourth as well.
A RealClearPolitics average of November's Iowa polls has Biden currently tied with Sanders for third place at 17%, with Warren in second at 17.8%, and Buttigieg at 23.5%.
Although Biden's campaign has long told reporters and donors that it doesn't believe a win in Iowa or New Hampshire is necessary to secure the party's presidential nomination, sources close those to the campaign say he wants to avoid an embarrassing fourth-place finish.
Placing fourth would be an ominous sign for Biden, who, in his 2008 campaign, won 0.9% of the vote in Iowa. Biden dropped out of the race shortly after.
During his first White House run, in 1987, Iowa was also the state where Biden's presidential ambitions began to crumble. At a campaign visit in the state, Biden mimicked the language of a British politician that brought accusations of plagiarism, which snowballed into a wave of stories about his poor academic record in law school and other issues.
As a caucus state, Iowa's system of choosing a candidate may favor the likes of Warren, running as a left-wing populist, or Sanders, a socialist, who have legions of enthusiastic followers — rather than a moderately liberal candidate like Biden.
A large ground operation in the state, which Buttigieg has invested millions into, is also necessary. Biden's campaign, which is currently strapped for cash and already spending far more than it's bringing in. So, it doesn't have the same resources as his rivals for advertising and organizers.
Instead, Democrats in the state, who spoke with the Washington Examiner, say Biden must have maximum face time with voters and rely on supporters to spread his message.
Biden is projecting an air of confidence about his standing in Iowa and beyond.
"I am the clear front-runner. I'm ahead in the national average of all the polls by 70%," he said Thursday in Atlanta. "I'm not counting on the polls, but the fact is I'm ahead in almost every one of the toss-up states by a substantial margin."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Un exfuncionario de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA) que pudo haber devastado la recopilación de inteligencia de Estados Unidos en China al entregar a su red de informantes a Pekín fue sentenciado el viernes a 19 años de prisión.
Jerry Chun Shing Lee, un ciudadano estadounidense naturalizado que trabajó para la de 1994 a 2007, fue arrestado en enero de 2018 por poseer ilegalmente información clasificada de defensa estadounidense, que según los fiscales, entregó a los agentes de inteligencia chinos.
“Lee traicionó a su propio país por codicia y puso en riesgo a sus antiguos colegas”, dijo Timothy Slater, subdirector de la oficina de campo del FBI en Washington. “La seriedad de su traición y crimen se demuestra con la sentencia de hoy”, indicó.
La acusación asegura que Lee se mudó a Hong Kong en 2010 y comenzó a aceptar pagos de agentes chinos que le pidieron información confidencial sobre la CIA.
Pero en mayo pasado, Lee, de 55 años, se declaró culpable de un cargo de conspiración por entregar información de defensa nacional para ayudar a un gobierno extranjero, al tiempo que insistió en que el gobierno nunca probó que dio información a los chinos ni que haya aceptado $840,000 dólares de Pekín, como se alega.
El caso ha generado mucha especulación sobre lo que realmente hay debajo, porque le tomó al gobierno seis años desde la primera investigación de Lee hasta su arresto.
Informes de medios de prensa lo vincularon con la destrucción catastrófica de la red de informantes de la CIA en China entre 2010 y 2012.
El New York Times informó en 2017 que los chinos mataron a “al menos una docena” de fuentes que la CIA tenía dentro de China y encarcelaron al menos a otras seis.

BUSINESS BEAT; Obama warns of tech's ill effects; He says technology is dividing societies and fueling inequality.

Texto completo: Former U.S. President Obama warned that technology is creating a more splintered world, fueling the economic disparities among nations, and among people within countries.
"The rise of extreme inequality both within nations and between nations that is being turbocharged by globalization and technology" is one of the biggest risks for young people, Obama said Thursday at Salesforce.com Inc.'s annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. "New technologies have allowed us reach. We have a global market. I can project my voice and you can take your technology to new markets. It has also amplified inequalities."
Though his successor Donald Trump has taken presidential use of Twitter to new heights, Obama has long been associated with the tech industry. His 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns were known for their use of the internet and social media to galvanize supporters. Some of Obama's staffers came from Silicon Valley companies, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and there's a diaspora of former Obama administration officials who have worked in the tech industry since leaving the White House, including David Plouffe, formerly with Uber Technologies Inc., and Amazon.com Inc.'s top spokesman, Jay Carney.

Still, the 44th president talked about how the internet has helped divide American politics and society.
"People remark on the polarization of our politics and rightfully so," Obama said.
"People rightfully see challenges like climate change and mass refugees and feel like things are spinning out of control. Behind that, what I see is a sense of anxiety, rootlessness and uncertainty in so many people. Some of that is fed by technology and there's an anger formed by those technologies."
Social media services including Facebook Inc. and Google's YouTube have been accused of fueling polarization with algorithms that show people news and other content that match their preconceived thinking and viewpoints.
"If you watch Fox News, you live in a different reality than if you read the New York Times. If you follow one rabbit hole on YouTube or the internet, then suddenly things look completely different," Obama said during his conversation with Salesforce co-Chief Executive Marc Benioff. "We are siloing ourselves off in ways that are dangerous. I believed, and I still believe, the internet can be a powerful tool for us to finally see each other and unify us, but right now it's disappointing."
Since leaving the White House in January 2017, Obama has become a fixture on the paid-speaker circuit. Thursday's appearance at Dreamforce is at least Obama's second appearance at a tech event in San Francisco in the last two months. He also spoke at a Splunk Inc. conference in September.

Texto completo: Would MSNBC ever dare favor the Democratic Party establishment? Of course not!
Just kidding. But I at least thought that the de facto media arm of the Democratic National Committee might be a little bit more discreet. Wednesday night’s debate in Atlanta, moderated by MSNBC, was openly skewed toward Warren and tried to all-but ignore outsiders such as Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang.
This was evident from the debate’s very first half hour. Warren got at least three questions before Yang or Gabbard were even acknowledged. In fact, it took approximately 32 minutes for moderators to ask Yang a question. Tweet
Meanwhile, Warren and Biden got almost all the speaking time. Notably, Warren also got several softball questions, like the one about “should more people be in the military” rather than any serious scrutiny of her foreign policy. TweetIt’s very clear what’s happening here. Gabbard and Yang are outsider candidates, who frequently criticize the Democratic Party establishment and reach out to disaffected voters from diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and political persuasions. MSNBC wants to shut anti-establishment candidates up, and prop up Warren, or maybe someone else in her lane.
Some might point out that Yang and Gabbard poll at just a few percentage points, while Warren and Biden top the polls. This is true, to some extent, but it clearly doesn’t explain the discrepancy. Amy Klobuchar polls below Yang and Gabbard, but received substantially more speaking time, according to the New York Times’ running tally. So, too, a similarly low-polling candidate, Cory Booker, received way more speaking time than Yang and Gabbard, despite only polling marginally better.
Additionally, it's ridiculous to suggest that only the higher-polling candidates should dominate the speaking time. The whole point of debates is to expose voters to all of the candidates and their contrasting ideas. Reinforcing the name recognition of the two most popular candidates does not further that goal, but equal opportunity for all qualifying candidates would.
Ultimately, it’s up to debate moderators to ensure that a debate is actually what happens — not just a town hall with their favorite two or three candidates. And in that, they failed.

Daniel McCarthy: Trump is doing exactly what he was elected to do

Texto completo: The impeachment effort against President Trump hinges on his motives. Presidents have wide discretion when dealing with foreign governments, and Mr. Trump’s actions have all been within the scope of his office’s power. But has he used that power for personal gain?
Ukrainian prosecutors took an interest in possible corruption involving Burisma Holdings, the company that paid Hunter Biden tens of thousands of dollars per month to serve on its board, long before Mr. Trump became president. And the Obama administration, including Vice President Joseph Biden, used America’s clout to influence Ukraine’s government. The questions about these relationships that Mr. Trump has pressed Ukraine to answer were matters of established public concern. A president has a right to seek answers about them, whether or not doing so has collateral implications for an election.
And for this president, the personal is political. What that means to him and his supporters is very different from what it means to his opponents. As his statements going back decades show, Mr. Trump believes that America’s leadership class has harmed the country even as it has enriched itself and entrenched its power through the federal bureaucracy and a self-protecting consensus among top politicians.
The very “norms” by which Washington operates, covering everything from America’s objectives in foreign policy to the imperative of multilateral trade deals to the legal ways in which career politicians and their families can make millions off their connections, are seen by Mr. Trump and his voters as the source of the country’s ills — from endless wars to declining manufacturing employment to the unresponsiveness of politicians in both parties to the country’s pain.
These norms, and the corruption inherent in “business as usual,” are not just abstractions but find embodiment in politicians like Mr. Biden and Hillary Clinton, as well as John McCain and the Bush family. They are personified as well in much of the permanent bureaucracy — the “deep state.”
Mr. Trump, as crude as he may be and as blind to the defects of his own associates as he is, was nonetheless elected as a force for change. (Note that Mr. Trump, unlike many of the politicians he denounces, made his fortune before entering politics.)
Those marked for overthrow by Mr. Trump do not see things his way. To them, this president is attacking what is most sacred in America’s traditions of government. But the means Mr. Trump has employed, in the matter for which he is now being impeached, are among his office’s well-established powers.
Those powers include the ability to delay supplying congressionally authorized aid. Even using a delay to get foreign leaders to cooperate with an administration’s demands is not itself an offense of the kind that the Constitution demands for impeachment. In 2015, Vice President Biden employed the threat of withholding aid to pressure the president of Ukraine at that time, Petro Poroshenko, to dismiss the country’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.
Mr. Shokin was widely perceived as corrupt by United States and international officials. Mr. Biden potentially stood to gain something himself from the prosecutor’s firing, though Ukrainian officials say no Burisma case was active at the time Mr. Biden called for Mr. Shokin’s firing.
Republicans, including President Trump, see corruption in the Biden family’s mix of business and politics in Ukraine. But in May this year, the last prosecutor general to serve under President Poroshenko, Yuriy Lutsenko, declared that Hunter Biden had violated no Ukrainian laws. That might have been the end of the matter, except that Mr. Poroshenko’s presidency came to an end that same month. He had been defeated by a challenger, Volodymyr Zelinsky, who had painted the incumbent as corrupt.
So what can be proved about the motives of an American president who tries to get Ukraine’s new leader to look into Burisma, the Bidens and Mr. Shokin’s dismissal? Democrats are in the habit of assuming Mr. Trump’s guilt. They assumed he was Vladimir Putin’s puppet, and many still do so even after the yearslong F.B.I. investigation that culminated in the Mueller report, which found nothing to substantiate the claim.
So, unsurprisingly, when his foes look at President Trump’s behavior toward Ukraine, they see only an obvious case for impeachment. Of course Mr. Trump acted in bad faith, withholding aid to extort Ukraine into opening an unjustified investigation into the son of a potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. What else could he have been doing?
The thinking continues, he could not have been acting in good faith, the way Mr. Biden was when he strong-armed Mr. Poroshenko, because Mr. Biden had the support of career diplomats, while President Trump did not — in fact, the president used his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, as an envoy to the Ukrainians. This maverick diplomacy is a prima facie indication of bad motives.
In all this, Mr. Trump’s opponents treat norms as if they were laws. But Mr. Trump openly campaigned in 2016 as someone who would rescind the nonlegal norms of American politics. He said he would “drain the swamp.” Washington’s traditional way of doing business, the legal but corrupt trade in money and influence, was something he was elected to attack. He has only contributed to the problem in the eyes of his critics, but for supporters the goal remains the same.
Mr. Trump was also elected to transform America’s foreign relations. The nation’s leadership in both parties and the Civil Service had embroiled the country in endless wars and a string of humiliations. That Mr. Trump considers officials serving in places like Ukraine to be part of the problem he was elected to solve is no secret. The testimony such officials have so far offered during impeachment hearings bears him out: Their view of American objectives is different from his. Such differences are supposed to be decided publicly, through elections. Mr. Trump happened to win the last one.
President Trump was doing exactly what voters elected him to do when he asked President Zelensky to account for Ukraine’s dealings with the Bidens. It’s a question related to the overall system linking American politicians with Ukrainian interests. No doubt Mr. Trump sees that system as reflecting more poorly on Democrats than on his own party or himself. But exposing that system, whatever its partisan overtones, is both a legitimate interest of the United States and something that Mr. Trump’s voters expect of him in light of his 2016 campaign.
Are motives like these grounds for impeachment? Democrats might still think so. Unelected officials might think so, too — but officials who believe that they, and not the elected president, are the guardians of America’s foreign relations.
But at core the questions here are political ones, involving not crimes but deep disagreements about America’s role in the world and the role of the world’s interested parties — including Ukraine — in influencing American policies and the politicians who make them. The price of being a world power is that “the swamp” extends beyond our own borders. Mr. Trump wants to change that, hence he thinks it’s proper to demand a public Ukrainian commitment for investigations.
Testimony at this week’s impeachment hearings from Gordon Sondland and other witnesses only underscores the point: President Trump believed it was right to call for Ukraine’s new president, elected on an anti-corruption agenda, to dig into and make public the links between his country, its government, its oligarchs and oil companies, and American political figures like the Bidens. The questions he was pursuing were bigger than the 2020 election.

Bret Stephens: Israeli settlement policy is one thing Trump gets right

Texto completo: In this week’s Mideast news, the Iranian regime has reportedly killed more than 100 of its own people as it attempts to suppress another wave of nationwide demonstrations. The Islamic State is taking advantage of Turkey’s invasion of northern Syria to regroup. Governments in Lebanon and Iraq remain paralyzed by popular discontent. And Israel has struck dozens of targets near Damascus after intercepting Iranian rockets fired from Syria.
Into this thicket of trouble, Mike Pompeo announced on Monday that the State Department would reverse a 41-year-old legal opinion claiming that Israeli settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law. The decision has garnered outsized attention, as if it’s another gratuitous Trumpian obstacle on the road to peace.
It’s not. To paraphrase Ariana Grande, we have one less problem without it.
I rarely have anything positive to say about Donald Trump’s foreign policy, and his overall approach to the Middle East is damaging and potentially disastrous for the United States and Israel alike. America cannot turn its back on the region, as Trump would like to do, and imagine the Middle East will return the favor. And Israel will not be safe in an America First world in which allies like the Kurds are cavalierly betrayed and enemies like Iran are only haphazardly confronted.
But let me give the administration some credit: When it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, at least it isn’t stuck in a time warp, hanging on to hoary shibboleths.
Among those shibboleths: That the conflict can be solved by returning to the status quo ante 1967, or at least an approximation of it. That peace between Israel and the Arab states hinges on delivering a Palestinian state. And that settlement construction is the principal obstacle to peace.
This is all nonsense. The pan-Arab campaign to “liberate” Palestine began two decades before Israel controlled an inch of Gaza or the West Bank. Resolving the territorial dispute arising from the 1967 war does nothing to solve the existential issues arising from Israel’s creation in 1948. Relations with much of the Arab world have flourished in recent years, not on account of any progress on the Palestinian front, but because Arab states see Israel as a capable ally against an imperialist Iran.
As for settlements, Israel withdrew all of its settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip in 2005. The result was more war, not less. What began as a moment of hope rapidly descended into a Palestinian civil war. That was followed by a Hamas victory, three major wars, and innumerable bloody skirmishes. Now we have an endless limbo in which Israelis live under constant threat, Gazans chafe under a remorseless tyranny, and groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad somehow have the means to acquire and fire hundreds of rockets at Israeli civilian targets.
Whatever else one might say about the administration, at least it understands that it would be worse than useless to demand that Israelis repeat the experiment on a much larger scale. Reversing a legally shaky opinion that does little more than drive American policy down a familiar cul-de-sac advances nobody’s interests, including those of the Palestinians.
I say “legally shaky” because it was never clear just whose territory Israel supposedly occupied when it wrested the West Bank from Jordanian control in a defensive war: Jordan’s claims to the area weren’t internationally recognized, either.
The more important point is that no progress can be made by repeatedly exhuming an increasingly distant past. As a matter of principle, Israel needs a two-state solution because it should not indefinitely rule (even indirectly) people who do not wish to be ruled by Israel. As a matter of survival, Israel also requires that a Palestinian state have neither the ambition nor the means to devote itself to Israel’s ultimate destruction.
The core problem with the past half-century of failed peacemaking efforts has been the facile assumption that meeting the need for two states would ultimately fulfill the requirement for security. The lesson of experience has been the opposite. The failure of Palestinians and their international enablers to satisfy that requirement — or even feign concern for it — has only made the need seem like little more than a remote abstraction to most Israelis.
This presents its own dangers. Having a right to build settlements is one thing. Having the right and exercising it wisely are separate things. A wise Israel needs to understand that it will have to compromise with the Palestinians at some point, in conditions that make compromise possible.
Opposition leader Benny Gantz, who on Wednesday failed to assemble a ruling coalition, gets this. Benjamin Netanyahu, who lately has promised to annex parts of the West Bank, does not. We’re a long way from knowing which of them will become prime minister.
In the meantime, the administration’s ruling on settlements cleans out some of the cobwebs under which thinking about the conflict has moldered. Good. Peace, if it comes, will not be the result of a diplomatic solution, much less as part of a legal argument over the Geneva Convention. It will happen as a cultural evolution, in which a new generation of Palestinian leaders dedicate themselves to building up the institutions of a decent state rather than attacking those of their neighbor; and in which Israelis have the wisdom to wait for those leaders, if necessary for decades.

Texto completo: Over the first three days of testimony in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, Republicans have tried out a number of defenses. After the Wednesday testimony of Gordon Sondland, Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, almost all of them have been incinerated.
Throughout the proceedings, Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has glowered, sneered and repeated some of the same conspiracy theories that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, wanted Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to substantiate.
Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican recently added to the Intelligence Committee because he’s seen as an effective advocate for Trump, has argued that Trump was genuinely concerned about corruption in Ukraine, and was induced to release frozen aid after Ukraine’s Parliament passed reform measures.
Others have repeated the refrain of “no quid pro quo.” Some have tried to dismiss the claims against Trump as mere hearsay. A few have suggested that Sondland and Giuliani were working on their own.
Nunes’ already phantasmagorical case was further undermined Tuesday, when Republicans called Kurt Volker, Trump’s former special envoy for Ukraine, to testify. Volker called allegations that as vice president Joe Biden pressured Ukraine for personal reasons “self-serving and not credible” and accused Giuliani of spreading a “conspiracy theory.”
Most other defenses of Trump were demolished by Sondland’s explosive testimony Wednesday. In recent days, there have been signs that Sondland was being set up as a fall guy in the Ukraine scandal. Testifying Tuesday, another Republican witness, Tim Morrison, until recently the top Russia expert on the National Security Council, referred to the “Gordon problem,” suggesting he was an oft-ignored nuisance. But Sondland seems to have decided that he would not go easily under the proverbial bus.
In his opening statement, Sondland described how Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to investigate an imagined Ukrainian role in hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016, and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Biden’s son served. “Mr. Giuliani’s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelenskiy,” he said. “Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the president.” With that, Sondland confirmed the heart of the Democrats’ case for impeachment.
Sondland said he communicated to a leading Ukrainian official that “the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.” He testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence that he believed the aid was being held up pending investigations, and Pence just nodded. (Pence’s chief of staff denied this.) Sondland didn’t substantially dispute the closed-door testimony of David Holmes, a senior U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine, who said he overheard a call to Trump that Sondland made on his cellphone. According to Holmes, on the call, made the day after the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for a “favor,” Trump asked Sondland if the Ukrainians were in fact going to pursue investigations. Sondland replied that they’d do whatever the president wanted.
After the call, Holmes testified, Sondland told him that Trump “did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine,” and cared only about what Sondland called “big stuff” that benefits the president. About that call, Sondland testified, “I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani.”
Further, Sondland testified that Trump didn’t necessarily care about investigations per se, only the public announcement of investigations. Zelenskiy “had to announce the investigations, he didn’t actually have to do them,” he said. The public announcement, of course, would be sufficient to give Trump material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia’s help in getting Trump elected in the first place.
Speaking of Russia’s role in 2016: A few Republicans have tried to massage Trump’s claims of Ukrainian election interference to make them sound marginally less insane. At Wednesday’s hearing, Nunes accused Ukraine of meddling in America’s election largely through public statements by Ukrainian officials. Among these statements was a 2016 op-ed essay by Valeriy Chaly, then the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, objecting to Trump’s statement that as president he’d consider recognizing Russian-occupied Crimea as Russian, rather than Ukrainian, territory.
Leave aside that there is nothing illicit about public officials expressing their opinions about matters of urgent concern to their own countries. Sondland’s testimony made it plain that such public comments are not what Trump had in mind in calling for investigations into what Ukraine did in 2016. Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC, which is why Sondland repeatedly spoke about proposed investigations involving the “DNC server.” He wanted Ukraine’s help exonerating Russia for its attack on America.
Sondland is not a wholly reliable witness; his insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens when he pressed Ukraine for investigations is hardly credible. (Volker made the same preposterous claim on Tuesday — both men were likely trying to distance themselves from one of the ugliest aspects of Trump’s shakedown.) Republicans will likely cling to the fact that Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between security aid to Ukraine and investigations; Sondland said he put it together because, as he repeated several times, “two plus two equals four.”
Unfortunately for Republicans, Mick Mulvaney, who was reportedly directed by Trump to put the hold on Ukraine aid, has already said, on television, that the aid was frozen as part of a quid pro quo for investigations. (Mulvaney, the White House’s acting chief of staff and head of the Office of Management and Budget, later denied that he said this, despite the clear public record.) Much of the Republican case, going forward, is likely to depend on pretending that this confession doesn’t exist.
“This obviously has been one of those bombshell days,” Ken Starr, the former special prosecutor who investigated Bill Clinton, said on Fox News after Sondland’s morning testimony. I suspect that by the time anyone reads this, Republicans will have cooked up talking points pretending that nothing Sondland said actually matters.
But at this point, all they can do is obfuscate. About the push for investigations, Sondland said, “Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.” This administration is rotten to the core and fundamentally disloyal to the country it purports to serve. So is every politician who still tries to explain its corruption away.

Texto completo: Don Juan, un inmigrante de la Ciudad de México que ha vivido en Compton, California, por más de dos décadas, tiene miedo de participar en el Censo 2020 porque piensa que su información puede ser compartida con inmigración (ICE) y eso, lo paraliza.
“Cómo el gobierno nos pide que confiemos en él y que compartamos nuestra información y de toda nuestra familia cuando ellos mismos nos han demostrado que no se puede confiar”, expresó un domingo cualquiera en La Plaza México, un lugar donde muchos inmigrantes de habla hispana, con y sin documentos, asisten cada semana para ir de compras, a la Iglesia o simplemente a dar la vuelta.
Don Juan (nombre ficticio), quien es trabajador de la construcción y en dos décadas ha formado una familia con tres hijos, todos menores de edad, forma parte de esas innumerables familias mixtas, como se les conoce, por tener en el hogar, hijos estadounidenses de padres sin documentos.
El miedo de Juan viene de cuando el New York Times publicó el 7 de julio la noticia de que agencias del Departamento de Motores y Vehículos (DMV) en tres estados (Utah, Vermont y Washington) habían permitido a las autoridades de inmigración consultar su base de datos.
Dicha noticia fue retomada por las agencias de información y los titulares estuvieron en todo el país.
Fue en ese momento cuando se le vino a la cabeza la deportación de su sobrino, quien llevaba unos 10 años viviendo en el país, pero que fue regresado a México por las autoridades de inmigración. Juan piensa que como el joven de 27 años ya tenía su licencia de manejar de California, gracias a la medida AB60 que permite a las personas sin documentos obtener un permiso de manejar, esa pudo haber sido la razón.
¿Cómo llegaron a la casa? Si no nos llevaron a mi esposa y a mí fue de milagro, expresa el inmigrante.
Juan enfatiza que su sobrino no tenía récord criminal o era un vago, simplemente se dedicaba a trabajar y a mandar dinero a México, pero ahora ya se lo han llevado, “sabrá Dios si fue por haber dado todos sus datos al DMV”, expresa.
Obviamente Juan está hablando del gobierno estatal y ahora quien realizará el Censo 2020 será el gobierno federal, pero para el inmigrante no hay distinción y hasta principios del mes de noviembre no sabía si participará en el proceso decenal.
Para el gobierno federal el reto de la seguridad de la información podría resultar el más grande entre las personas sin documentos, después de todo, para ellos poco valen los beneficios que pueda traer el Censo 2020 a la comunidad si ellos piensan que su permanencia en el país se está poniendo en riesgo.

The Racket Serena Williams Smashed During the 2018 US Open Will Go Up for Auction

Texto completo: It makes perfect sense that for a long time, sports memorabilia has commanded some of the most significant princes at auctions. Famous sports figures transcend their category, which is another way of saying that they are never just athletes, but also emotional barometers for their time period and place. In the 2018 United States Open tennis final between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, Williams’s fury in response to an umpire who repeatedly penalized her led her to smash her racket on the ground in defiance. Now, beginning on Monday, Goldin Auctions is offering up the broken racket for auction at a starting price of $2,000, but the auction house believes that it will eventually be sold for somewhere within five figures.
SEE ALSO: KAWS Shells Out $17 Million to Enlarge His Williamsburg Studio
According to the New York Times , the racket made its way to the auction circuit after Williams gave it to a ball boy who was on the court that day named Justin Arrington-Holmes. He apparently didn’t realize the extent of the equipment’s significance and sold it to Brigandi Coins and Collectibles in Manhattan for only $500 (rough luck, Justin).
From there, the store then sold the racket, and subsequently told the Times that they were not the party that was putting it up for auction. Sports artifacts and memorabilia have almost always been present at auctions, and the more recent explosion in popularity of streetwear and branded merchandise has further served to affirm the significant resale value of sports-related goods (think Supreme skateboards). Indeed, Williams’ bent and twisted racket is only one of 1,600 sports-related items that are going to be included in the Goldin auction, including Olympic gold medals earned by Jesse Owens.
Plus, as perhaps the greatest living athlete in the world, anything Serena Williams has touched is bound to do sterling numbers. The meaning imbued in this particular racket seems certain to stand the test of time. The glaringly unfair treatment that Williams received during that match, and Osaka’s striking mix of joy and agony at having defeated her, are factors that are impossible to forget.

A Boston shipwreck. A 'cursed' figurehead. And a monument miles from the sea

Texto completo: Have you seen something out there that you'd like answers to? A giant door? Or perhaps a graveyard of rocking horses, a strange stone marker on an island, or old trophies under a bridge. Let us know by filling out this form. If your suggestion is picked, we'll check it out for you.
DEDHAM — The Maritana neared Boston Harbor after its long journey from Liverpool, England, laden with a rich cargo of coal, wool, potash, iron, and steel, and more than two dozen passengers and crew.
It was well past midnight on Nov. 3, 1861, and Captain G.W. Williams was in command. The weather was thick and the tide was high as they entered the bay. The ship had been navigating a disastrous southeasterly gale. From on board, a man on the lookout caught a glimpse of Boston Light through the storm, a sign of welcome and voyage's end.
But as soon as the light came into view ahead, so too did something else: the froth of waves lashing nearby rocks.
All hands were already on deck at the time. Orders came from the revered captain to tack ship. Before the vessel could change course, it crashed onto the jagged rocks about a mile from the lighthouse.
For hours, the Maritana was pummeled by the unforgiving sea. The waves churned up by the storm were relentless, delivering incessant jabs as it sat stuck amidships. Eventually, the sturdy wooden vessel could no longer endure, according to books about the shipwreck and several varying newspaper accounts from the time.
A gap opened beneath Williams's feet, as the ship split in half later in the morning. “Look out for yourselves!" he shouted to those on board.
***
The demise of the Maritana in 1861 has been called one of the region's “most violent shipwrecks," a catastrophic event that reportedly claimed the lives of 13 passengers and 11 members of the crew. But the area's towering monument to the tragedy was erected some 16 miles inland, near the back of a sleepy historic burial ground in Dedham.
“What is it doing there?" reader Brian Keaney wondered. The town's Old Village Cemetery, where the marker bearing Williams's name can be found, certainly doesn't offer sweeping views of the Atlantic or the distant harbor islands. The closest water is the tendrils of the Charles River.
Our journey to connect the dots between a suburban town and a deadly shipwreck meant navigating through folklore about a cursed artifact, and wading into New England's rich maritime history.
First, the Maritana.
It was “a fine vessel," reported a Nov. 9, 1861, issue of The Boston Pilot, which recounted the shipwreck six days after the storm, “991 tons, built at Quincy, Mass., and owned in Providence."
Every great ship needs a figurehead, the decoration placed at its bow, and the Maritana was no exception. When it was built in 1857, the ship's owner, Suchet Mauran II, took interest in an intricate carving of a woman, maritime historian and Massachusetts native Edward Rowe Snow wrote in his book, “Storms and Shipwrecks of New England."
While noted by some for its beauty, the figurehead had a checkered past. The carving had been salvaged first from a commandeered French warship, and then, later, a ship built in Maine that wrecked off New England.
But the figurehead's time on the Maritana was largely uneventful, Snow said — until the ship set sail from Liverpool in September 1861.
***
In the stormy early morning hours of Nov. 3, the ship — stocked with its precious bounty of goods and passengers — finally made its approach to Boston Harbor.
Around 12:45 a.m., the homeward journey began to unravel, however, when the breakers were spotted around the same time as the lighthouse. The Maritana was “soon to become the prey of the angry elements," the Boston Evening Transcript reported.
“Captain Williams ordered the helm hard up," according to the account, “and a minute later the ship struck, head on," at Egg Rock, also known as Shag Rocks, not far from Boston Light.
Things only worsened as the hours ticked on. The sea broke constantly over the stuck vessel, “which lifted and hung among the rocks amidships."
The masts were cut away at 3 a.m., reports said. Boats on the davits were “crushed to atoms," The Boston Pilot recalled. The crew's many attempts to reach safety were futile.
“Capt. Williams maintained the utmost self-possession, and endeavored to make all as comfortable as possible under the circumstances," The Boston Pilot wrote. “The ship, being a very strong one, held together until morning."
Then, around 7 or 8 a.m. — accounts vary — it finally began to break in two, right where Williams stood.
“At the moment the vessel parted, Capt. Williams was standing on the quarterdeck," the Transcript reported. “He went down between the broken fragments, which closing suddenly caught the Captain by the head and crushed it in a frightful manner."
Another publication, the New England Farmer, reported he was struck in the head by a falling beam as the ship went to pieces.
“The affrighted passengers and crew had lost the guiding spirit of the vessel," The Boston Pilot wrote, “and amid intense excitement and confusion they struggled against the fearful death that stared them in the face."
***
In all, about two dozen people died. Some were lost to the ocean's gaping maw, while others, including Williams, washed ashore, their bodies returned to land along with some of the vessel's cargo.
About a dozen people survived the ordeal. When the weather cleared by late afternoon, they were found, clinging to the rocks, by a rescue operation launched from Hull, according to “Storms and Shipwrecks in Boston Bay, and The Record of Life Savers of Hull," published in 1918.
But the Maritana was lost: The New York Times reported at the time that “not a vestige of the ship remained."
That is, except for its carved figurehead, which was later recovered by fishermen unscathed, the Globe reported in 1899. Alleged to be cursed, the artifact passed from owner to owner until it eventually found a permanent home.
“She was now deemed unlucky and no ship's captain wanted her aboard," according to a blog post by the Bostonian Society, a nonprofit and primary steward of the Old State House and its collections. “She was sold and placed in a shop on Lincoln's Wharf in Boston and became a curious attraction. The wharf promptly caught on fire and burned!"
In 1908, the figurehead was gifted to the Bostonian Society, which “put the unlucky lass on display inside the galleries of the Old State House." It's said that a fire that broke out in the building in 1921 started near the carving. Again, it survived.
The figurehead is no longer on display at the museum, a spokesman for the Bostonian Society said, but it remains in their collections. (If it were out in the open, we're not entirely sure you'd want to get near it.)
***
So what's left of the memory of the Maritana, then, beyond tales of the sea? There is the one link that can still be seen, bearing us back to the past: the lichen-encrusted monument shaped like a ship's broken mast.
Some of the archives following the crash listed Williams as “of Providence." But a small blurb buried in a Nov. 8, 1861, edition of the Boston Post told a different story. It contained just 12 lines of text — a somber announcement about funeral services.
“The obsequies of the late Capt. G. W. Williams of the ill-fated ship Maritana . . . took place from the residence of his family," it said, “in Dedham."
The funeral was attended by a large crowd, the Boston Post reported, including 10 surviving officers and crew of the shipwreck. The services were “solemn and impressive" and “the remains were interred in the cemetery in that town."
To glean a bit more about Williams's grave marker, we contacted Joan Pagliuca, a Dedham Historical Society board member and tour guide. We met inside the Old Village Cemetery, where the four-sided marker sits beneath a large oak tree, guarded by a shin-high border.
“It's fascinating to find it here," Pagliuca said. “To find the story of his ship is just an incredible story. Especially the headlines — 'The worst shipwreck ever in Boston Harbor.' And here he is; he's here in our little town cemetery. Our Old Village."
The intricately designed monument has a nautical theme and resembles a shattered beam wrapped by a piece of torn rope at its base. On the side of its plinth is a description of its purpose.
“In Memory of Capt. George W. Williams of Ship Maritana, Who Perished In Boston Harbor Nov. 3, 1861, On The Homeward Passage. Aged 47 Years."
On the front of the monument is a small replica of the Maritana, carved into the stone. The image shows the ship approaching what's probably Boston Light. If you get close enough, you can see the details of its sails and masts, waves rippling beneath it with the gusts from the wind.
Now get down on the ground, on this patch of earth 16 miles from the harbor where the Maritana split and sank.
There, on the bow, is the faintest silhouette of a figurehead of a woman, staring blankly toward the shoreline.

Texto completo: Rep. Lee Zeldin accused the New York Times of spreading misinformation during its live coverage of congressional impeachment hearings.
"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman became so concerned during a July 25 phone call in which President Trump asked Ukraine’s president for help with political investigations that he reported his alarm to a superior," a Tuesday tweet from the Times read.
"This Tweet from @nytpolitics is just not accurate," Zeldin responded. "Actually LTC Vindman didn’t state his concerns about the 7/25 call to his superior Tim Morrison or anyone up the Vindman/Morrison Chain of Command."
Tweet
Vindman testified twice during closed-door testimony that he reported his concern to his superior, though he did not name who that was.
Morrison testified that Vindman never notified him of any concerns "open source and first-hand knowledge" of the call.
During public testimony, Vindman, a National Security Council official and decorated war veteran, said he was deeply troubled after learning that Trump had pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden and the business dealings of his son, Hunter.
"It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent," Vindman said.
Zeldin, who has been one of Trump's most vocal defenders in Congress, pointed to contradictions between various career diplomats who have been called as witnesses by Democrats as part of the proceedings.

Alexander Vindman’s advice for Ukraine to ‘stay out of US politics’ came too late

Texto completo: Democrats are making a big fuss about the allegation that President Trump invited foreign interference into the 2020 election. But don't they know that other countries never seem to need the invite?
National Security Council official Alexander Vindman testified Tuesday before Congress that, in a meeting earlier this year with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he advised him that in conversations with Trump, he should "stay out of U.S. politics."
That's a nice idea, but it came a little too late.
Before the national media started lying about Ukraine's interference in 2016, they initially reported on it. Ukraine's government ran to the New York Times with interviews and materials that year, and the result was an article that eventually led to the resignation of Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Thanks to Ukrainian interference in the election (and the fact that his own offenses were real, of course), he's now in prison.
And then there's this, from a lengthy Politico report published in January 2017:
Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found.
All of us, including Trump, are supposed to have forgotten about this. For refusing to forget, Trump is now about to be impeached.
Yes, it would have been nice for Ukraine to "stay out of U.S. politics." But it's too late for that.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Trump announced plans to restart talks over potential bans or restrictions on vaping Wednesday after the American Medical Association and the state of New York put vaping companies on notice that they would push ahead on Tuesday.
More than two months after saying he would ban flavored vaping products other than menthol and tobacco and facing heavy opposition, the White House announced a meeting would be held with industry and advocacy groups Friday.
White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump would meet with people representing advocacy, industry, nonprofits, medical associations and state officials.
"As the President has said, there is a serious problem among our youth and their growing addiction to e-cigarettes," Deere said. "The policymaking process is not stalled – it continues to move forward. "
The meeting will give the administration a chance to hear from "a large group, representing all sides as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people," he added.
'From Big Tobacco's playbook': New York sues Juul Labs, claims e-cigarette company marketed vaping products to teens
Meanwhile, the American Medical Association called for a total ban of all e-cigarette and vaping products on Tuesday.
“It’s simple – we must keep nicotine products out of the hands of young people," AMA President Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement.
Also Tuesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a lawsuit against Juul Labs, claiming the company illegally marketed flavored e-cigarettes to teenagers.
Congressional lawmakers are also addressing the issue, pushing for outright bans on vaping or limits on flavored products.
The House Energy and Commerce approved legislation Tuesday that would ban flavors and online sales of all tobacco products, and also raise the age to purchase vape products to 21.
Myers, who is among those who still hope the administration will act, praised the legislative effort. He said it's "not beyond question" the bill could pass the House by the end of the year. While he said the Senate is harder to predict, "given the President’s initial support, it would be a mistake to say it has no support in the Senate. "
Dangerous toxin: Nicotine vaping age to go up as CDC calls discovery of THC additive in lungs a 'breakthrough'
"The bill’s prohibition on flavored tobacco products, including flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes, is especially critical to stop tobacco companies from continuing to target and addict kids with enticing flavors," Myers said.
At the state level, Michigan and Massachusetts are among those that have temporarily banned flavored vaping products. The Massachusetts statehouse passed a permanent flavor ban last week and its senate may vote Wednesday. New York City may vote on a citywide ban next week.
While those who favor vaping bans say Trump is bowing in the face of political pressure, administration officials said they are still working on the issue.
"President Trump and this administration are committed to responsibly protecting the health of children," said White House spokesman Judd Deere. "At this time, we are in an ongoing rule-making process, and I will not speculate on the final outcome. "
Paul Blair, director of strategic initiatives with Americans for Tax Reform, said he provided the White House and Trump's campaign with data behind an editorial he wrote contending that "banning flavored e-cigarettes might cost Trump re-election. "
Blair said Trump and his aides "weren't prepared for the political blow back" of a proposed ban, and are reassessing as the nation continues to grapple with an outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses. First reported in the spring, the number of cases and deaths have climbed each week.
'Something has changed': People have been vaping for years but now they're dying. Could it be the devices?
As of Nov. 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2,172 people injured and 42 dead. The CDC has linked the injuries to vitamin E acetate, used as a thickening agent or to dilute THC oil in vape cartridges to make it go further. Tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, is the ingredient in cannabis that creates the "high. "
Most of the people with vaping illness also used nicotine-based electronic cigarettes. New federal numbers showing a big uptick in middle and high school vaping also has added new pressure for regulations.
In the past two months, the White House has been bombarded by vaping supporters who said a ban would be a mistake.
Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said Trump's lack of action is “at least a temporary victory. "
On Sept. 11 at the White House, Trump said first lady Melania Trump had pushed him to do something about children who vape.
"It's causing a lot of problems, and we're going to have to do something about it," the president said after meeting with health policy advisers. "There have been deaths, and there have been a lot of other problems. "
Two months later, on Nov. 11, Trump acknowledged the delay by tweeting that he wanted to hold a meeting with interested parties.
"Will be meeting with representatives of the Vaping industry, together with medical professionals and individual state representatives, to come up with an acceptable solution to the Vaping and E-cigarette dilemma," Trump said. "Children’s health & safety, together with jobs, will be a focus!"
As of Tuesday, that meeting had not been scheduled.

Texto completo: The Batavia Muckdogs, Auburn Doubledays and more than three dozen other minor league baseball teams in the nation could have their ties to a parent club eliminated through a Major League Baseball proposal, according to The New York Times.
The newspaper reports that Major League Baseball says the reorganization is needed to make the minor leagues more efficient and to improve conditions and facilities. Major and Minor League Baseball's current Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire after the 2020 season.
Among the proposed changes are to sever ties with 42 minor league teams, which is approximately a quarter of the minor league teams under the current contract; and to shift the baseball draft from June to August and limit the number of rounds.
Under the plan, a new "Dream League" would be operated by MLB at minimal cost and provide undrafted players an opportunity to break into professional baseball.
The New York Times reported that such a league could be a "death sentence" as a loss of major-league affiliation would significantly diminish a team's value in the community and could alter interest among prospective employees.
Sen. Charles Schumer on Monday implored MLB to reconsider.
"America's favorite pastime should not become part of Upstate New York's past," he said in a statement to the USA TODAY Network New York.
"It's no secret that New York's minor league teams are institutions within their communities, which is why I implore MLB to reconsider any such plans and will be reaching out to them directly to advocate for our New York teams."
Speaking in Rochester on Monday morning, Schumer said he plans to call baseball commissioner Rob Manfred and "make a strong push" on behalf of the minor league teams that would by affected by this proposal.
Baseball's long history in upstate New York Both the Auburn and Batavia teams are part of MLB's New York-Penn League, which has been operating since 1939. The team in Batavia — then known as the Clippers — was one of the league's six inaugural teams and was the only one still operating in 2019.
For most of its history, the league was largely comprised of teams in small upstate communities, which at various times also included Binghamton, Corning, Elmira, Geneva, Hornell, Jamestown, Lockport, Newark, Olean, Oneonta, Utica, and Watertown.
Last season, just six of the league's 14 teams were based in New York state, and two of them are slated for elimination.
The Batavia Muckdogs, in Genesee County, are a feeder team for the Miami Marlins.
The Auburn Doubledays, in Cayuga County, are a feeder team for the Washington Nationals, which won the 2019 World Series.
Other New York teams on the elimination list include the Binghamton Rumble Ponies and the Staten Island Yankees.
Some New York teams appeared safe, including the Hudson Valley Renegades in Wappingers Falls and the Tri-City ValleyCats in the Albany area. They both also play in the New York–Penn League.
"These teams are not only regional economic and tourism engines, they are also part of the DNA of these communities — and we are more than willing to work with them and Major League baseball to stop this from happening," said Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Binghamton Mayor Richard David said he has spoken with state and local leaders about the news reports and vowed "to fight tooth and nail" to keep the Rumble Ponies.
He said the city-owned stadium is well positioned to fight any efforts by MLB, saying state and local governments have recently invested more than $8 million to upgrade the facility and meet team requirements.
"We were very proactive several years ago where there were deficiencies to put us in a strong position" going forward, he said, adding, "It's something we are concerned about. We are organizing and mobilizing very quickly."
But David warned that these stances often come up when there are contract negotiations coming.
"I would just reiterate that this is a proposal by Major League Baseball, and historically we have seen this every decade or so when contract negotiations come up between minor league baseball and Major League Baseball," David said in Albany as he attended a meeting of the New York Conference of Mayors.
"I don't think that proposal will be adopted in that form."
Auburn City Clerk Chuck Mason offered similar concern, saying losing the Doubledays would be a major blow to the community that has supported a baseball team for more than a century.
"It's a big economic driver," he said. "We're doing everything we can to communicate with our state and federal officials to try to get support for maintaining the New York-Penn League."
Why is MLB proposing to eliminate minor league teams? The proposed changes were first reported by Baseball America's J.J. Cooper in August, which came as part of the negotiation to renew an operating agreement between the minor and major leagues that expires at the end of the 2020 season.
On Saturday, Dan Barry of the New York Times revealed the names of the 42 teams who would be impacted by the plan.
For more than 100 years, minor league teams have negotiated affiliation agreements with big-league teams. The parent club provides funding and players to the minor league teams, which help train and develop young players who aspire to a major league career.
Cooper reported that MLB owners and team officials have long expressed concerns about the quality of playing facilities where many of the affiliates operate. They'd also like minor league teams to contribute more to player salaries.
But perhaps the biggest reason behind the proposed reductions is a shift in the way teams are thinking about player development, driven by the emergence of technology and data analytics.
As teams have adopted these tools, they've concluded that their current system is woefully inefficient. Travis Sawchik, a sports reporter for FiveThirtyEight, wrote in September about why the Houston Astros were among the teams who have reduced the number of minor league affiliates in recent years.
Team officials concluded that they need less time and fewer games to understand the potential of their young prospects, and it is better served by consolidating resources around their most promising players.
Teams have also shifted their development efforts off the field, using video analysis and other high-tech tools to help players improve their skills at their training facilities rather than by playing in regulation games. Many players have embraced these efforts on their own, turning to independent coaches and unaffiliated training facilities.
Sawchik and co-author Ben Lindbergh explored these changes in their best-selling book, "The MVP Machine: How Baseball's New Nonconformists Are Using Data to Build Better Players."
They describe a system where teams have traditionally poured in hundreds of players and millions of dollars each year in the hopes that a handful of those prospects will eventually emerge on the other end to help the big league team. The process seems mysterious from the outside, and in truth, the effort has often been more art than science.
"As far as many fans are concerned, players disappear after draft day," Sawchick and Lindbergh wrote, "encased in cocoons from which some emerge as beautiful baseball butterfiles, while most wither away, forever forgotten or, if they're particularly talented, lamenting for failing to molt."
Sawchik and Lindbergh said that the adoption of these new technologies has helped teams to realize they can get a competitive advantage by upending the way they develop players and shifting away from the minor league model they've relied on for the last century.
Jeff Lantz, Senior Director of Communications for Minor League Baseball said the sides will meet in upcoming weeks to negotiate a plan that would "save as many teams" as possible.
"From what we gathered from the MLB, they did a poll of which ballparks were better, which needed a lot of work and came up with a mass list," he said.
Lantz said an estimated 1,200 players would also lose their jobs should the proposal be approved.
"A lot would be released and have their dreams of being big-league players crushed," Lantz said. "We'll see how things shake out. Both sides want to get a deal done that benefits baseball."
However, the 2020 season is not in jeopardy and is scheduled to be played uninterrupted, he said.
"This is where people gather in the summertime, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities," Lantz said. "Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."
Fans cry 'foul'
While these changes might represent an improvement for major league operations, the proposed restructuring could have a devastating effect on long-standing minor league teams and the communities they serve.
Brett Mandel, who wrote a book about his experiences playing minor league baseball, says baseball risks further alienating its fans.
"Minor league baseball may not be the most cost-effective way to cultivate MLB talent," Mandel said, "but I would argue that it is an incredibly efficient way to connect millions of fans to baseball and its players in an intimate and personal way that is impossible in Major-League markets.
Some fans of teams that are on the cutting block have taken to social media to express their displeasure with the plan.
"I think it is profoundly stupid to deny people in smaller communities the opportunity to see live professional baseball at an affordable price," said Ed Wright of Hamburg. "As though baseball isn't losing its popularity fast enough already. This will exacerbate that trend."
Mike Armstrong, now a Connecticut resident, once worked for the team in Auburn.
"I spent the best summer of my life working for the Doubledays," he tweeted. "Would be devastating to see the loss of small-town minor league baseball under this proposal."
Hilton resident Jason Rhodes said he loves going to games in Batavia because it makes him feel closer to the sport he grew up loving.
"These teams play such an important role in the life of these small towns, and they make the game approachable for fans," he said. "If you got to a big-league game you'll spend 50 bucks and your seat will be far removed from the playing field. Sitting in the bleachers at Dwyer (Stadium in Batavia) makes me feel reconnected to the game in a way that isn't possible anywhere else."

DEVAL PATRICK FOR PRESIDENT? THE FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR COULD CONTINUE THE PROGRESS OF OBAMA'S ELECTION

Texto completo: The highest profile African Americans in politics these days are Kamala Harris, Cory Booker ... and Deval Patrick, as of Nov. 14.
The first two, senators from California and New Jersey respectively, leapt into the Democratic presidential nomination race earlier than Mr. Patrick but neither has been able to snatch the top spot in any poll. And former Vice President Joe Biden has captured the favor of blacks in all polls. Of course, Michele and Barack Obama, the top Democrats-in-chief, have endorsed none of them, for now keeping their powder dry.
Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker are newcomers to national politics, previously untested in the nation's political/cultural wars. Mr. Biden, on the other hand, was lifted to popularity among black voters by the "Obama effect," a consequence of the Delaware Democrat having served two terms as the first black president's vice president. (Mr. Patrick was a campaign surrogate for Mr. Obama's 2012 campaign.)
But the election of Mr. Obama, while a step in the right direction, left some frustrated. That the first black president was the son of a Caucasian mother was the source of mild consternation in some middle-class African American circles. Mr. Obama was the son of a Kenyan immigrant and a white woman, not a direct descendant of American slavery. This reality played into his reception among some black Americans. Often more understood than stated, color issues within African America are perceived from within to inform opportunities in social, business and family formation matters. The lighter you are, this thinking reasons, the more success in life you are likely afforded.
But should he be elected, Mr. Patrick, who is descended from slaves on both sides of his family, would represent another step forward for black America, which could secure him important votes in the presidential election.
Living in Chicago poverty in public housing with his mother, middle-schooler Deval Patrick was identified as the smartest student in his grade at school. He was selected for A Better Chance, a program that placed gifted black youngsters in toney Ivy League-feeder prep schools that educated the children of America's ruling class.
At the Milton Academy, while classmates spent holidays skiing in Gstaad, he spent them throwing newspapers onto elegant Milton, Mass., yards. His hard work paid off; he graduated from Harvard University with honors in 1979.
Foreshadowing the compassion in life that would later characterize his professional leadership, Mr. Patrick headed off to Darfur to aid the famine-relief effort. An epiphany came to him while in Africa. If he was to fulfill his destiny to be of profound service to others, he must be an attorney.
Back to Harvard he went, this time to law school. After graduating cum laude in 1982, he practiced law professionally, becoming a government, law firm and corporate lawyer.
He was brought in to divvy up the $176 million won by a successful 1996 discrimination lawsuit after executives at the oil company Texaco were caught making racist remarks. Pleased by Mr. Patrick's work on the case, Texaco hired him as general counsel.
After working with Texaco and later with Coca-Cola, becoming modestly wealthy in the process, Mr. Patrick retired from the corporate world. He returned to the Massachusetts that nurtured him, purchasing a residence in the place where he was once a newspaper boy. After Republican Mitt Romney's term as Massachusetts governor ended, Mr. Patrick ran for his job in 2006 as a Democrat. He won and ultimately served two terms in the position.
But by 2008, Mr. Patrick was already weighing the possibility of running for president, to the delight of the black professional class and much of America. Upscale black folks loved his personal journey, which was not unlike their own path to that status but on steroids. Working class and poor blacks loved his work on education, equal employment and relief for the dispossessed. White Democrats embraced his moderation on health care issues.
Ultimately, Mr. Patrick did not run in 2008 - his wife's ill health may have been a factor. Mr. Obama went on to win the nomination and the presidency, but color remained an unspoken issue within African America. Black Harvard professors Henry Louis Gates and Lani Guinier had lead conversations and scholarship noting the prevalence of students of color at elite schools that were either half-white, African or Caribbean immigrants, or were their children. Too few, in fact, were African American.
In the case of Mr. Obama, he not only was the child of a white woman (though Ancestry.com reported in 2012 that his mother likely had African slave heritage), but his father was an immigrant Kenyan student. In other words, Mr. Obama, while representing important progress, was not as representative of black America as civil rights advocates had once dreamed when imagining the first African American president. All the same, black Americans overwhelmingly delivered the vote for Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012, enabling his two terms as commander in chief.
In 2020, Deval Patrick could continue that progress, emulating the success of Mr. Obama, his fellow Harvard Law alumnus, by carrying the black vote in a nation of increasingly beige Americans, however they became so.

Sen. Charles Schumer
D-N.Y.
The Batavia Muckdogs, Auburn Doubledays and more than three dozen other minor league baseball teams in the nation could have their ties to a parent club eliminated through a Major League Baseball proposal, according to The New York Times.
The newspaper reports that Major League Baseball says the reorganization is needed to make the minor leagues more efficient and to improve conditions and facilities. Major and Minor League Baseball's current Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire after the 2020 season.
Among the proposed changes are to sever ties with 42 minor league teams, which is approximately a quarter of the minor league teams under the current contract; and to shift the baseball draft from June to August and limit the number of rounds.
Under the plan, a new "Dream League" would be operated by MLB at minimal cost and provide undrafted players an opportunity to break into professional baseball.
The New York Times reported that such a league could be a "death sentence" as a loss of major-league affiliation would significantly diminish a team's value in the community and could alter interest among prospective employees.
Sen. Charles Schumer on Monday implored MLB to reconsider.
"America's favorite pastime should not become part of Upstate New York's past," he said in a statement to the USA TODAY Network New York.
"It's no secret that New York's minor league teams are institutions within their communities, which is why I implore MLB to reconsider any such plans and will be reaching out to them directly to advocate for our New York teams."
Speaking in Rochester on Monday morning, Schumer said he plans to call baseball commissioner Rob Manfred and "make a strong push" on behalf of the minor league teams that would by affected by this proposal.
Baseball's long history in upstate New York Both the Auburn and Batavia teams are part of MLB's New York-Penn League, which has been operating since 1939. The team in Batavia — then known as the Clippers — was one of the league's six inaugural teams and was the only one still operating in 2019.
For most of its history, the league was largely comprised of teams in small upstate communities, which at various times also included Binghamton, Corning, Elmira, Geneva, Hornell, Jamestown, Lockport, Newark, Olean, Oneonta, Utica, and Watertown.
Last season, just six of the league's 14 teams were based in New York state, and two of them are slated for elimination.
The Batavia Muckdogs, in Genesee County, are a feeder team for the Miami Marlins.
The Auburn Doubledays, in Cayuga County, are a feeder team for the Washington Nationals, which won the 2019 World Series.
Other New York teams on the elimination list include the Binghamton Rumble Ponies and the Staten Island Yankees.
Some New York teams appeared safe, including the Hudson Valley Renegades in Wappingers Falls and the Tri-City ValleyCats in the Albany area. They both also play in the New York–Penn League.
"These teams are not only regional economic and tourism engines, they are also part of the DNA of these communities — and we are more than willing to work with them and Major League baseball to stop this from happening," said Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Binghamton Mayor Richard David said he has spoken with state and local leaders about the news reports and vowed "to fight tooth and nail" to keep the Rumble Ponies.
He said the city-owned stadium is well positioned to fight any efforts by MLB, saying state and local governments have recently invested more than $8 million to upgrade the facility and meet team requirements.
"We were very proactive several years ago where there were deficiencies to put us in a strong position" going forward, he said, adding, "It's something we are concerned about. We are organizing and mobilizing very quickly."
But David warned that these stances often come up when there are contract negotiations coming.
"I would just reiterate that this is a proposal by Major League Baseball, and historically we have seen this every decade or so when contract negotiations come up between minor league baseball and Major League Baseball," David said in Albany as he attended a meeting of the New York Conference of Mayors.
"I don't think that proposal will be adopted in that form."
Auburn City Clerk Chuck Mason offered similar concern, saying losing the Doubledays would be a major blow to the community that has supported a baseball team for more than a century.
"It's a big economic driver," he said. "We're doing everything we can to communicate with our state and federal officials to try to get support for maintaining the New York-Penn League."
Why is MLB proposing to eliminate minor league teams? The proposed changes were first reported by Baseball America's J.J. Cooper in August, which came as part of the negotiation to renew an operating agreement between the minor and major leagues that expires at the end of the 2020 season.
On Saturday, Dan Barry of the New York Times revealed the names of the 42 teams who would be impacted by the plan.
For more than 100 years, minor league teams have negotiated affiliation agreements with big-league teams. The parent club provides funding and players to the minor league teams, which help train and develop young players who aspire to a major league career.
Cooper reported that MLB owners and team officials have long expressed concerns about the quality of playing facilities where many of the affiliates operate. They'd also like minor league teams to contribute more to player salaries.
But perhaps the biggest reason behind the proposed reductions is a shift in the way teams are thinking about player development, driven by the emergence of technology and data analytics.
As teams have adopted these tools, they've concluded that their current system is woefully inefficient. Travis Sawchik, a sports reporter for FiveThirtyEight, wrote in September about why the Houston Astros were among the teams who have reduced the number of minor league affiliates in recent years.
Team officials concluded that they need less time and fewer games to understand the potential of their young prospects, and it is better served by consolidating resources around their most promising players.
Teams have also shifted their development efforts off the field, using video analysis and other high-tech tools to help players improve their skills at their training facilities rather than by playing in regulation games. Many players have embraced these efforts on their own, turning to independent coaches and unaffiliated training facilities.
Sawchik and co-author Ben Lindbergh explored these changes in their best-selling book, "The MVP Machine: How Baseball's New Nonconformists Are Using Data to Build Better Players."
They describe a system where teams have traditionally poured in hundreds of players and millions of dollars each year in the hopes that a handful of those prospects will eventually emerge on the other end to help the big league team. The process seems mysterious from the outside, and in truth, the effort has often been more art than science.
"As far as many fans are concerned, players disappear after draft day," Sawchick and Lindbergh wrote, "encased in cocoons from which some emerge as beautiful baseball butterfiles, while most wither away, forever forgotten or, if they're particularly talented, lamenting for failing to molt."
Sawchik and Lindbergh said that the adoption of these new technologies has helped teams to realize they can get a competitive advantage by upending the way they develop players and shifting away from the minor league model they've relied on for the last century.
Jeff Lantz, Senior Director of Communications for Minor League Baseball said the sides will meet in upcoming weeks to negotiate a plan that would "save as many teams" as possible.
"From what we gathered from the MLB, they did a poll of which ballparks were better, which needed a lot of work and came up with a mass list," he said.
Lantz said an estimated 1,200 players would also lose their jobs should the proposal be approved.
"A lot would be released and have their dreams of being big-league players crushed," Lantz said. "We'll see how things shake out. Both sides want to get a deal done that benefits baseball."
However, the 2020 season is not in jeopardy and is scheduled to be played uninterrupted, he said.
"This is where people gather in the summertime, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities," Lantz said. "Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."
Fans cry 'foul'
While these changes might represent an improvement for major league operations, the proposed restructuring could have a devastating effect on long-standing minor league teams and the communities they serve.
Brett Mandel, who wrote a book about his experiences playing minor league baseball, says baseball risks further alienating its fans.
"Minor league baseball may not be the most cost-effective way to cultivate MLB talent," Mandel said, "but I would argue that it is an incredibly efficient way to connect millions of fans to baseball and its players in an intimate and personal way that is impossible in Major-League markets.
Some fans of teams that are on the cutting block have taken to social media to express their displeasure with the plan.
"I think it is profoundly stupid to deny people in smaller communities the opportunity to see live professional baseball at an affordable price," said Ed Wright of Hamburg. "As though baseball isn't losing its popularity fast enough already. This will exacerbate that trend."
Mike Armstrong, now a Connecticut resident, once worked for the team in Auburn.
"I spent the best summer of my life working for the Doubledays," he tweeted. "Would be devastating to see the loss of small-town minor league baseball under this proposal."
Hilton resident Jason Rhodes said he loves going to games in Batavia because it makes him feel closer to the sport he grew up loving.
"These teams play such an important role in the life of these small towns, and they make the game approachable for fans," he said. "If you got to a big-league game you'll spend 50 bucks and your seat will be far removed from the playing field. Sitting in the bleachers at Dwyer (Stadium in Batavia) makes me feel reconnected to the game in a way that isn't possible anywhere else."

Texto completo: BEIJING -- The Chinese government on Monday portrayed the country's crackdown in the western region of Xinjiang as a great success against terrorism, trying to counter renewed international criticism prompted by a New York Times article detailing the internal deliberations that led to the mass detention of Muslims in re-education camps and prisons.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, criticized the newspaper's report, published on Sunday, saying the article smeared China's efforts against extremism. But he did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked internal documents that confirmed the coercive nature of the measures used against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in western China over the past three years.
A statement from the Xinjiang regional government of China was far more strident, saying the Times article had been "completely fabricated by hostile forces at home and abroad" and calling it "total nonsense and a pack of lies, with sinister motives behind it."
The regional government's statement did not specifically deny the authenticity of the documents on which the article was based, but repeatedly attacked what it described as fictitious reporting by The Times.
"Concocting fake news to attract eyeballs is a habitual trick of America's New York Times, and this newspaper suffered a crisis of credibility for its fakery," the statement said. "This time, America's New York Times has again fabricated and concocted fake news about Xinjiang. This is nothing more than getting up to its old tricks, and is completely unworthy of refutation. This despicable conduct will surely be met with the contempt of wiser minds in the international community."
In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said: "Our story is based on more than 400 pages of leaked internal Chinese documents that provide an unprecedented inside look at the crackdown on ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region. This type of journalism is core to our mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world."
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, spoke on the floor of the Senate on Monday about the threat to Muslim ethnic minority groups in the Xinjiang region of northwest China, pointing to the Times report.
Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said the documents were "a handbook for this Orwellian campaign to effectively erase a religious and ethnic minority in a region that is supposed to be legally distinct from the rest of China." He added the campaign was "chilling" and "systematic."
On Monday, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, wrote in a twitter message that "the documents obtained by the @NYTimes show top officials in the Chinese Communist Party directed a brutal & repressive campaign against the Uighurs and religious minorities. While this should surprise no one, it exposes the Chinese Communist Party's lies."
The documents, provided by a member of the political establishment in China who is concerned about the crackdown, showed the direct involvement of senior officials in conceiving and ordering it. The papers included internal speeches by China's leader, Xi Jinping, that laid the philosophical groundwork for the policy.
Mr. Geng, the foreign ministry spokesman, was asked about the article at a regularly scheduled briefing.
"It is precisely because of a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been deeply plagued by terrorism, has not had a violent terrorist incident for three years," he said.
The Communist government once flatly dismissed reports on the mass detentions of as many as one million Muslims as fabrications, but since evidence of the camps has become irrefutable, it has stepped up attempts to defend its actions as justifiable steps to stamp out a national security threat.
Xinjiang has experienced violent attacks, but their extent remains unclear, in part because the authorities censored reports on them at the time and continues to restrict independent reporting.
After The Times published its report, China's state media tried to rebuff criticism from ethnic Uighurs in the United States, whose criticism has been highlighted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, reported that its own reporters had visited the relatives of those Mr. Pompeo cited and found them living happily in Xinjiang.
"They are ashamed of the scum among their families," the report said, referring to the Uighurs now living abroad.
The Chinese efforts have not tempered international criticism.
A group of 12 United Nations human rights experts has presented the Chinese government with a scathing critique of its counterterrorism laws and de-radicalization regulations, warning that they flout binding obligations under international law and risk stoking the extremism they are said to be intended to prevent.
In a 21-page letter addressed to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the experts said that laws and regulations that provide the legal framework for China's mass incarceration of Uighurs and other Muslims are "neither necessary nor proportionate."
"While cognizant of the security situation that China may face," they said, "we are deeply concerned that the approaches taken in the counterterrorism law not only violate fundamental rights but also may contribute to further radicalization of persons belonging to the targeted minorities, creating major and growing pockets of fear, resentment and alienation."
The letter added that "multiple laws, decrees and policies, in particular those concerning national security and terrorism, deeply erode the foundations for the viable social, economic and political development of society as a whole."
The chilling details contained in the documents obtained by The Times -- such as Mr. Xi's description of Islamist radicalism as a virus or a drug addiction that required "a period of painful, interventionary treatment" -- prompted new condemnations from Western politicians.
Australia's foreign minister, Marise Payne, called the disclosures disturbing, as did several American politicians, including Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, and Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, two leading candidates in the Democratic presidential race. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the treatment of the Uighurs was "among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today."
Given the sensitive nature of the subject -- and the source -- China's state media made little other mention of the issue. The Times's website is blocked in China, but there were signs that the disclosures had filtered through the country's so-called Great Firewall, as they received unexpected expressions of support.
One user on Weibo, one of China's most prominent social media platforms, singled out an official cited in the documents, Wang Yongzhi, who had been assigned to oversee the city of Yarkand, a cultural capital of the Uighurs. Mr. Wang, part of the Han ethnic majority in China, initially put in place many harsh measures, but became increasingly concerned about their effectiveness. When he quietly ordered the release of more than 7,000 camp inmates, he was arrested.
"History will not forget this person and this page of paper," wrote the user, identifying himself as Still Your Old Yang. Others expressed support for the official who leaked the documents.
But Mr. Geng, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that Xinjiang had become a model for counterterrorism efforts.
"The New York Times not only shut its eyes and ears to the above-mentioned facts," he said, "but even use the clumsy tricks of grafting flowers and twigs to taking out of context and hyping the so-called internal documents to smear and discredit China's antiterrorism and de-extremism capabilities in Xinjiang."

FedEx CEO blasts New York Times report on tax bill, challenges editors to debate

Texto completo: The top executive of shipping giant FedEx denounced a scathing New York Times report about the company's tax status published over the weekend.
“FedEx invested billions in capital items eligible for accelerated depreciation and made large contributions to our employee pension plans,” FedEx CEO Frederick Smith said. “These factors have temporarily lowered our federal income tax, which was the law’s intention to help grow GDP, create jobs, and increase wages.”
The New York Times report, published Sunday, relayed how the company had reduced its yearly tax bill from more than $1 billion in 2017 to $0 the next year, in part largely to the newly-passed Republican tax code.
Smith dismissed the report and pointed instead to the New York Times Company's own financial status.

"The New York Times paid zero federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of $111 million, and only $30 million in 2018 — 18% of their pretax book income," he said. "Also in 2018, the New York Times cut their capital investments nearly in half to $57 million, which equates to a rounding error when compared to the $6 billion of capital that FedEx invested in the U.S. economy during that same year."
Smith called the comparison "pertinent" and challenged the journalists responsible for the publishing of the story to a debate, the topic of which he did not mention.
"I hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, D.C., with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax," the CEO said.

Michael Bloomberg’s Hillary Clinton-esque ‘stop and frisk’ flip-flop

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg is (probably) running for president as a Democrat. Apparently, he has decided to take the Hillary Clinton approach — that is, hold your finger in the air and flip-flop your previously deeply-held positions whichever way the political winds are blowing.
At issue is the former New York City mayor’s weekend apology for his decades-long support for "stop and frisk" policing policy. On Sunday, Bloomberg decided to blatantly pander to black voters and declare that he was “wrong” and “sorry” for ever supporting the policy that has formed an enormous part of his mayoral legacy.
I’m not buying it. At all.
Stop and frisk was always a reprehensible, authoritarian policy (which is unfortunately quite on-brand for Bloomberg). Just think about it: Bloomberg and his acolytes actually allowed police to stop, detain, question, and search anyone they came across who “looked dangerous” (or something). That’s a dystopian policy straight out of a police state, and it’s hard to imagine a law enforcement practice more ripe for abuse.
And abuse it, the police did indeed. This paragraph from the New York Times pretty much sums up the racist effects that stop and frisk had on New Yorkers:
At the program’s peak, the racial disparities in its enforcement were jarring. Of 575,000 stops conducted in 2009, black and Latino people were nine times as likely as white people to be targeted by the police (even though, once stopped, they were no more likely to actually be arrested). In 2011, police officers made about 685,000 stops; 87% of those stopped were black or Latino.
As far as proponents, such as Bloomberg until literally yesterday, love to point out, the practice did coincide with a decrease in crime in the city. However, there’s no clear causal link here.
As the Times noted, “even when stops were phased out toward the end of [Bloomberg’s] administration, and then decreased sharply under his successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, crime rates continued to plunge to new lows unseen since the 1950s.”
So, Bloomberg’s mea culpa for stop and frisk is certainly warranted by the drawbacks of the policy. But given that he’s spent over a decade defending it — including as recently as this year — the candidate’s conveniently-timed change of heart reeks of political calculation, rather than any genuine evolution or reconsideration.
NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams expressed skepticism to the Times. “Forgive many of us for questioning apologies a decade late and on the eve of a presidential run,” he said. “It is not nearly enough to erase the legacy of the systemic abuses of stop and frisk on the people whose lives were harmed by over-policing, nor the communities criminalized by it.”
Even many supporters of stop and frisk, such as The Federalist’s David Marcus, know the mayor’s flip-flop is disingenuous. Marcus writes that “Bloomberg’s change of heart is not the result of any new information, its pure politics, plain and simple.” He is right.
The mayor’s calculation is certainly correct that stop and frisk has fallen out of fashion. But all the woke evolution in the world won’t do Bloomberg any good if voters view him as an unprincipled fraud. Just ask Clinton how that worked out for her.

Texto completo: Michelle Malkin isn't melting down. Rather, her recent embrace of the dregs of humanity — bitter little boys screaming Holocaust denials in front of a green screen in their mother's basement — is a calculated choice in her mission to navigate what comes after President Trump's tenure comes to an end. And it's a very bad choice.
Malkin has been a power player in conservative media since before Trump starred on reality television. She spent a decade churning out New York Times bestsellers and reinventing the conservative blogosphere. All throughout, she sustained the hallmarks of the establishment, a nationally-syndicated newspaper column, and regular prime-time cable appearances. Given that radical immigration restrictionism has been her main cause throughout, one might have expected her to become an even more important player in the era of Trump.
Instead, she quietly departed from Blaze Media a year ago. Now she has been fired by the Young Americas Foundation and is hobnobbing with alt-right white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes.
Malkin's ouster from YAF comes after she celebrated Fuentes — most famous for denying the Holocaust by equating victims to cookies in an oven — as "one of the New Right leaders." She also smeared Ben Shapiro for disavowing Fuentes and his ilk. (That Shapiro did this should not be shocking, considering that he's an Orthodox Jew and an actually decent human being.)
Malkin hasn't made any attempt to cushion the blow with walk-backs or equivocations. Instead, she's railed against the "Keepers of the Gate" — in this case, a modestly successful nonprofit that spent years paying her to speak at events — and "Conservative, Inc.," whatever that means.
Tweet
It would be easy to mistake Malkin's pivot for a meltdown. After all, she has peddled the lethal pseudoscience of anti-vaxxing amid a global health crisis spurred by that very movement. But Malkin knows exactly what she's doing. She's a single-issue pundit, willing to get in the mud with "race-realists," even if they deny the Holocaust and support segregation because she sees them as the most potent allies available to back a militantly xenophobic agenda.
It's not racist or anti-American to question our ability to assimilate legal immigrants at their current rate of influx. Nor is it racist to admit that immigration, legal and illegal, strains our welfare system and ability to artificially maintain wages for people already here. These are policy questions that we can debate without mentioning for one moment the race of the people involved. But getting in bed with folks such as Faith Goldy, the anti-Semite caught smirking in Charlottesville a second before one of her basement-dwelling buddies murdered a peaceful protester, Fuentes isn't putting America First. It's throwing every principle of liberty and equality that made this nation great in the first place in the trash to advance white nationalism.
By her own standards, Malkin is unworthy of America. She's spent years railing against employer-sponsored visas, yet without an employer-sponsored visa bringing her parents here and the Fourteenth Amendment, she wouldn't even be American. Moreover, I'm guessing that the Hitlerian hierarchy of white supremacists holds Filipinos in low regard.
Malkin must know this, yet she apparently believes that a white supremacist constituency secretly comprises a significant portion of the American Right. And yes, given the recent spate of right-wingers colluding with racists or embracing their ideology outright, her bet ought to scare the rest of us into cleaning house and purging conservatism.
In the coming weeks, see who calls things for what they are and who refuses to disavow Holocaust denialism and white supremacy. The latter are the ones who will, if allowed to hang around, kill off whatever future conservatism has in this country.

Local Elections May Shade 2020 Presidential Race

Texto completo: Elections always have consequences, as President Barack Obama once said, but not always the ones people expect.
For now, statewide trends seem to favor the still-unknown Democratic presidential nominee beating Republican President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania next year and reversing his shocking Keystone State win three years ago.
But G. Terry Madonna, the longtime Franklin & Marshall College political analyst and pollster, doesn’t see the trends as surefire forecasts.
“Midterms are not predictive of general elections that follow,” he said. “Ask Barack Obama.”
Republicans, aided by the tea party movement, won control of the U.S. House in 2010, only two years after Obama’s election, but Obama won re-election in 2012 anyway.
Trump’s win here hinged heavily on an almost 20-percentage-point win in Luzerne County and cutting Obama’s 27-point 2012 win in Lackawanna County to less than 4 points for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Clinton still won Lackawanna, but county Republican Chairman Lance Stange Jr. thinks the county is within Trump’s reach next year.
Nonetheless, Democrats have plenty of reasons for optimism.
For starters, Trump’s polling numbers in Pennsylvania remain mixed at best. A recent Franklin & Marshall poll showed more than half of voters with a strongly unfavorable view of him and believing he’s doing a poor job.
Voting trends seem to reflect that.
Last year, Democrats picked up 11 seats in the state House, netted five seats in the Senate and added three U.S. House members.
Two weeks ago, Democrats shockingly won control of governments in the important four counties outside Philadelphia. A third of the state’s voters live in Philadelphia and Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties, which represent only five of the state’s 67 counties.
“The Republicans do have to be concerned about what’s going on in the Philly suburbs,” Madonna said. “What went on in 2018 and again in 2019 in the municipal and county elections was a stunning victory by the Democrats.”
Democrats swept Republicans off the Delaware County Council and gained control of county government for the first time since at least the Civil War, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. They won a majority in the Chester commissioners office for the first time and control of the Bucks commissioners office. That means Democratic control of Philadelphia and all four Philadelphia suburban counties. Democrats flipped Montgomery years ago.
Almost two-thirds of southeastern voters support the impeachment inquiry into the president, according to the Franklin & Marshall poll.
“It bodes well for Democrats,” Democratic strategist Mike Mikus said.
As concerned as they are, Republicans downplay the Democrats’ southeastern Pennsylvania gains. They point out Trump lost the southeast in 2016 and still won the state by 44,000 votes.
“The Republican Party has been bleeding votes in the southeast for many years,” Republican strategist Vince Galko said. “I think the national atmosphere expedited it this time around.”
Republicans point to gains of their own in Pittsburgh’s suburban counties. They flipped control of commissioners offices in Washington, Greene and Westmoreland counties, three row offices in Cambria County and two row offices in Beaver County. They also kept control of commissioners offices in Beaver, Lawrence and Fayette counties.
“However, it’s going to come down more to who’s the president running against, what is the atmosphere at that time?” Galko said. “Is it Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren or someone else? Certainly, that’s going to be a larger factor than just the outcome in southeast PA in this past election.”
In 2016, Galko said, voters went for Trump “because they were just sick of the system, sick of the status quo.”
“They may have been unsure about President Trump, but they wanted somebody to go down to D.C. and knock some tables over. They gave him the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “Will he earn that this time around again? I’m not sure, but I do think the economy is really helping him with those voters. ... We are living through the greatest economy of our lifetime right now.”
Mikus said Republican gains in suburban Pittsburgh matter less.
The southeastern counties where Democrats gained ground have three times as many voters as the southwestern counties where Republicans did.
“The southwestern counties got redder, but they weren’t by big margins,” Mikus said. “They were fairly close races. ... I take heart with that. I don’t think Republicans have much room to grow.”
A Trump victory would give Republicans back-to back wins here for the first time since 1988 when Vice President George H.W. Bush followed up President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 victory. A recent New York Times/Siena University poll had Trump trailing Biden in Pennsylvania by only 3 points, tied with Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, and a point behind Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
“The real question is will the enthusiasm level of Trump’s core support, at least where you are (in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre) and out in the southwest be sufficient to get him over the finish line in 2020, and we just don’t know that yet,” Madonna said.
Too much remains unknown, he said.
“Remember, we don’t know what’s going to happen with the economy, whether it’s strong or what happens if we slide into a recession. We don’t know if there will be a foreign policy crisis of some kind. And thirdly, we have to see how all this impeachment plays out,” Madonna said. “I won’t rule out that Trump can carry our state again. I won’t rule it out.”

Barriers zigzag across America

Texto completo: A few words about walls.
Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border - the one he swore Mexico would pay for - has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as 8.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to the Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books - and bodies - into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual - and emotional - separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom - for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from the New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Texto completo: Kylie Jenner sold a $600 million stake in her cosmetic company to Coty Inc, a beauty company that owns CoverGirl, Tiffany & Co. and Balenciaga among other notable beauty and fashion brands, according a press release from Coty on the matter.
In this new partnership, Coty will own 51 percent of Kylie Cosmetics.
Per the Wall Street Journal and Fox Business, Jenner will remain the public face of the brand, and it will be renamed Kylie Beauty.
The deal $600 million deal values Kylie's beauty company at $1. 2 billion, the outlets report.
“I’m excited to partner with Coty to continue to reach even more fans of Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin around the world," Jenner said in the press release. "I look forward to continuing the creativity and ingenuity for each collection that consumers have come to expect and engaging with my fans across social media. This partnership will allow me and my team to stay focused on the creation and development of each product while building the brand into an international beauty powerhouse. ”
Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Kylie Cosmetics to be worth over $900 million which propelled her to Forbes' "youngest self-made billionaire" status.
"I see (Kylie Cosmetics) going very far,” Jenner told Forbes. “I work really hard. "
While the Forbes title earned backlash, with many arguing due to her family's wealth she is not "self-made," the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan defended the idea that she was a "self-made billionaire" and called it "the truth. "
During an interview with The New York Times shortly after, Jenner changed her tune and admitted that she "can’t say I’ve done it by myself. "
"If they’re just talking finances, technically, yes, I don’t have any inherited money," she said. "But I have had a lot of help and a huge platform. "
Jenner has more than 150 million followers on Instagram, which allows her to advertise her lip kits and products directly to her devoted fan base with virtually no marketing expenses.
USA TODAY has reached out to Kylie Jenner's rep for comment.

Trump plugs Joe Ricketts' book on Twitter

Texto completo: Since its release Nov. 5, there hadn't been much buzz about Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts' new book, "The Harder You Work, the Luckier You Get: An Entrepreneur's Memoir."
Enter President Donald Trump, who took the opportunity to cheerlead for the book Sunday -- on social media, of course.
Trump, who previously took to Twitter to tout the success of a book written by his son Donald Trump Jr., "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us," again used his favorite presidential platform to plug the memoir by Ricketts, the conservative patriarch of the Cubs-owning family. (It later emerged many bulk purchases of Trump Jr.'s book were at least partially responsible for it surging to No. 1 on The New York Times best-sellers list.)
Trump wrote: "Joe Ricketts, one of our Country's most successful businessmen, including being the owner of the Chicago Cubs, has just written a great new book. ... Much can be learned from Joe. Go get the book!"
Joe Ricketts' book "shares the epic inside story of how a working-class kid from the Nebraska prairie took on Wall Street's clubby brokerage business, busted it open, and walked away a billionaire," according to the Amazon.com description.
Portions of the book's first chapter also are printed on Amazon.com, including this excerpt:
"For me, it's the getting there. It's the competition, the problem-solving. It's being right when no one thought you were right and winning when the stakes are high. Even after I had more money than I could spend, I went on working forty to sixty hours a week. I still wanted to succeed at business, not for the increased buying power that success would earn me, but for the pleasure of making a business succeed."
Joe Ricketts is the father of Todd Ricketts, a Wilmette resident who is one of the sibling owners of the Cubs and finance chair of the Trump Victory Committee, a joint fundraising venture of the president's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.
Todd Ricketts co-chaired a Trump fundraiser with other RNC officials last month, which reportedly brought in millions for Trump Victory and notably brought the president to Chicago for the first time since his inauguration. The visit, predictably, wasn't without controversy. Trump blasted Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for not attending a meeting of police chiefs where Trump spoke.
The elder Ricketts made headlines after racist and bigoted emails surfaced in February. At the time, both he and Tom Ricketts issued separate statements, essentially condemning "bigoted ideas" contained in emails he mostly received and a few that he sent.
At the time, Tom Ricketts emphasized that his father isn't involved in the operations of the Cubs, although Joe Ricketts sold 34 million shares of the TD Ameritrade company he founded for about $403 million to cover the equity needed to purchase the Cubs in 2009. (That point is hammered home in the memoir, according to the Amazon.com description.)
"We are aware of the racially insensitive emails in my father's account that were published by an online media outlet," Tom Ricketts wrote in his statement.
Trump didn't always have the love affair he has now with the Cubs-owning Ricketts family.
Months before his election, then-candidate Trump, upset that matriarch Marlene Ricketts had contributed to a political PAC opposing his candidacy, took to Twitter and blasted the family: "I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!"
Trump never explained that, and Cubs Chair Tom Ricketts at the time told reporters: "It's a little surreal when Donald Trump threatens your mom. The fact is whether it's my mom or my dad on his Ending Spending (PAC) or my sister (Laura) on (supporting) marriage equality, or my brothers on what they do, or what we do with the team, we're pretty much an open book."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump told the U. S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, in a July 26 phone call that Ukrainian officials needed to move forward with “investigations,” presumably against former Vice President Joe Biden. We know about this because Sondland made the call at a crowded restaurant in Kiev on his personal cellphone, according to the sworn testimony of David Holmes, a U. S. Embassy staffer who was at Sondland's table and overheard the whole conversation, including Trump's end of it. And Holmes was not the only staffer at the table during the call, according to The Associated Press.
Beyond that, it's also very likely Russian intelligence officers and other foreign intelligence services and diplomats were listening in to that call. Even if Moscow or others did not intercept the Sondland-Trump phone call electronically, where senior U. S. diplomats go — particularly ones known to speak loudly in public places, are part of Trump’s inner circle and disregard operational security practices — foreign intelligence officers will physically follow.
Security blunders and poor operational security have become synonymous with this administration. Here are the top eight security lapses:
1. Using personal cellphones to conduct government business.
From the start, Trump has used his own unsecure personal cellphones to conduct government business, including with foreign leaders. Doing so avoids the White House switchboard, which logs all presidential phone calls. We also know it has likely allowed foreign intelligence services, including Russia and China, to intercept his calls and exploit the information they have gathered from those calls. Despite warnings from national security officials, Trump continues to prioritize his personal preference over security.
2. Confiding in foreign “strong men” leaders.
Trump has not tried to hide that he prefers the company of ruthless dictators with atrocious human rights records, such as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissii. These personal relationships and his own foreign policy naiveté have led to a number of security blunders.
In 2017, he jeopardized a human intelligence source by passing highly classified intelligence to Russian officials, according to news reports. That same year, Trump announced the formation of a joint U. S. -Russian cybersecurity unit after a private meeting with Putin, even though we are one of Russia’s primary cyber targets. This June, Trump said he would not let U. S. agencies collect intelligence on North Korea because of his personal relationship with Kim, and he has repeatedly downplayed advances in North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.
3. Wielding security clearances as a gift and punishment.
Last year, according to The New York Times, Trump used his presidential authority to grant his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a top secret security clearance even though multiple members of the White House’s personal security office and then-White House counsel Don McGahn recommended that he should not receive one because of concerns about his background investigation. Trump has also wielded security clearances as a cudgel to punish his critics, such as removing the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan.
4. Politicizing declassification.
In September 2018, Trump suddenly ordered the immediate declassification of documents from the FBI’s then-ongoing investigation into his own campaign’s ties with Russia. The documents would have included interviews with sources and even the text messages of those he views as his personal enemies: former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI investigators Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and Justice Department official Bruce Ohr.

5. Rudy Giuliani’s tech follies.
Trump’s personal lawyer and former cybersecurity adviser Rudy Giuliani’s missteps with his iPhone are infamous. While acting as a personal envoy, adviser, henchman and lawyer for Trump, he has more than once butt-dialed reporters and left lengthy and revealing voice messages. Less than a month after Trump named him a cybersecurity adviser in 2017, he had to seek help in an Apple store to unlock his iPhone. This month, journalist Roger Sollenberger wrote in Salon that Giuliani accidentally texted him a password to an unknown account. These incidents do not instill much confidence.
6. Declassification by tweet.
Trump has a habit of declassifying sensitive maps and images on the spot rather than for actual national security needs — which is the reason the president is the ultimate declassification authority. In August, he tweeted high-resolution imagery of the aftermath of an accident at an Iranian space facility, coupled with the taunting message, “Best wishes and good luck in determining what happened. ” Experts said the image revealed sensitive information about the particular collection platform that captured the image and U. S. capabilities in general. In March, Trump erroneously claimed that the Islamic State terrorist organization would be “gone” by that evening and showed reporters a map created by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the classification banner crossed out seemingly with a black pen. He then later tweeted the same maps.
7. Using private email accounts and encrypted messaging apps to conduct official business.
At this point, it has been well-documented that Kushner, Ivanka Trump and other administration figures have routinely used their own personal email accounts and messaging apps to communicate with other government officials and foreign officials, likely breaking federal records laws. This coming from the administration that ran a whole campaign against Hillary Clinton’s use of her personal email server when she was secretary of State.
8. Looking to Fox News for intelligence analysis.
Finally, it is hard to find a bigger security blunder than Trump ignoring the advice and analysis of the government’s top experts in the intelligence community, while paying close attention to information and guidance from biased sources such as Fox News media personalities.

The implications of these security lapses are significant. First, in terms of intelligence collection, it has probably never been easier for foreign services to scoop up information about what is happening in Washington, given the administration's widespread use of personal cellphones and personal emails.
Second, the careless attitude about security and sensitive information makes it harder for U. S. intelligence services to persuade potential human sources of information to work for us, or to feel confident that we will safeguard the intelligence we receive from foreign partners. They have no guarantee that the president of the United States will not expose them or the intelligence at any time.

Texto completo: Do articles help expose conflicts or fan flames of a conspiracy theory?
New York Times reporter Kenneth P. Vogel was on the Ukraine conspiracy theory story early and in depth. The question is, did his articles leave the wrong impression?
Vogel was the co-author of a disputed Times story in May that suggested that Joe Biden intervened in Ukraine in 2016 to help a company that employed the former vice president's son, Hunter. As a staff writer at Politico in early 2017, he co-authored another piece that suggested that the Democratic National Committee had cooperated with Ukrainian efforts to thwart Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign.
Both articles have been cited by President Trump's allies as support for a broader conspiracy theory: that Ukrainian sources sought to influence the 2016 election in Democrat Hillary Clinton's favor and that Biden acted corruptly as vice president, thus justifying an investigation.
These unproven claims are a crucial part of Trump's defense in the House impeachment inquiry. In fact, American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia's intelligence services, not Ukraine, worked to sway the election toward Trump. There is also no credible evidence that Biden intervened with Ukrainian officials to remove the country's top prosecutor to help his son, who sat on the board of a company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.
Vogel's articles have been called into question " the Times story most prominently by Biden's presidential campaign, and the Politico story by Politico's own recent reporting.
Both Politico and the Times defended the reporter's work, and Vogel told The Washington Post on Friday: 'Not a single fact in either story has been successfully challenged. Both stories were prescient, revealing information that has come to play a central role in the impeachment saga.'
He added, 'The Politico story revealed the genesis of Trump's grudge against Ukraine, and the Times story exposed the Trump team's pressure campaign against Ukraine.'
Vogel's January 2017 Politico article (co-written with David L. Stern, now a freelance contributor to The Washington Post) extensively detailed Ukrainian efforts to undermine Trump in 2016, such as publicly questioning his fitness for office, disseminating documents implicating Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman at the time, in corruption and helping a Clinton ally research damaging information about him.
The lead of the story implied an equivalence with Russian efforts to undermine Clinton: 'Donald Trump wasn't the only presidential candidate whose campaign was boosted by officials of a former Soviet bloc country,' Vogel and Stern wrote, although the story later states that there is 'little evidence' of the type of hacking and disinformation campaign waged by the Russians in 2016.
The story came up repeatedly during Wednesday's impeachment hearing. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Republican counsel Stephen R. Castor cited it several times in questioning diplomat William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine. Both Nunes and Castor strongly suggested that the story validated Trump's theory about Ukrainian officials during 2016.
The story 'gives rise to some concern that there are elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were out to get the president,' Castor said during the hearing. 'That's a very reasonable belief of [Trump's], correct?'
Taylor said he didn't know and was unfamiliar with the story until recently.
Castor again brought up Vogel's articles in Friday's hearing to suggest that 'influential elements of the Ukrainian establishment' were out to get Trump.
But in testimony by Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, she dismissed these as 'isolated incidents,' not a government-orchestrated initiative. She replied, 'I would remind you again that our intelligence community has determined that those who interfered in the [U.S.] election' were Russians.
Top officials from Trump's National Security Council have dismissed the notion of Ukrainian interference. In depositions given to congressional investigators earlier this month, former National Security Council staffers Fiona Hill and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified that they saw no evidence of Ukrainian meddling in 2016. Hill called such a notion 'a fiction.'
Politico implicitly contradicted its own 2017 story by reporting last week that 'no evidence has emerged to support' the idea of a Ukrainian campaign.
Vogel's New York Times story, published May 1, was among the earliest to raise questions about Biden's role in Ukraine during his time as vice president.
The Times story recounted Biden's threat in March 2016 to withhold $1-billion in American loan guarantees if Ukraine's leaders didn't fire the country's top prosecutor, who was long suspected of ignoring corruption in the country. It juxtaposed Biden's advocacy with Hunter Biden's role as a board member of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company headed by a Ukrainian oligarch 'who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.' The article noted that the conflict-of-interest claim was being fanned by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and allies in the conservative media.
The suggestion that Joe Biden had acted improperly was driven home by the Web headline on the story: 'Biden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions That Are Being Promoted by Trump and Allies.' The print headline on the front-page story raised an eyebrow, too: 'For Biden, a Ukraine Matter That Won't Go Away.'
It wasn't until the 19th paragraph, however, that the story noted that the conflict-of-interest angle was dubious. 'No evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general's dismissal,' it said.
In the months since the Vogel story's publication, critics have slammed it, saying it advanced Trump and Giuliani's smear campaign against Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate in 2020.
In a letter last month to Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, Kate Bedingfield, Biden's campaign manager, compared Vogel's May-1 piece to fringe conspiracy theory stories. She called it an 'egregious act of journalistic malpractice.' (The story generated a secondary controversy when Vogel's co-author, freelancer Iuliia Mendel, announced soon after publication that she would become the chief spokeswoman for Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's newly elected president.)
A Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said Vogel's May 1 story is 'accurate and consistent with our mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world.'
Politico spokesman Brad Dayspring also defended Vogel's reporting. He said the 2017 article detailed instances in which Ukrainian officials 'sought to raise questions' about Trump and his campaign, and detailed cooperation by Ukrainian officials with a Democratic National Committee consultant, Alexandra Chalupa, who was researching Manafort's activities in Ukraine.
But Dayspring stressed that the article was limited in its assertions. It didn't say these acts were comparable to Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, nor did it assert a broader conspiracy, he said. It 'did not state that the Ukrainian government conspired with the Clinton campaign or the DNC,' he said.
Murphy also noted what the Times story didn't say " that Biden's actions were intended to help his son. Instead, she said, it raised questions for the first time about whether Trump was behind an effort to push a foreign government to investigate a political opponent and exposed other ways in which Giuliani and Trump were seeking to 'weaponize' allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden.
Baquet, in a brief email, said, 'My only addition is that I believe Ken has done amazing work on this story.'

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
"A season in the life of a ballclub" books are staples on publishers' (and often bestseller) lists. Professional sports teams, college teams, even the Brave Dragons of the China Basketball Association have had moments in the book biz sun.
Michael Powell's "Canyon Dreams" is different. Yes, there are basketball games and practices described on its pages. But it's less a basketball book than a Native American "Fiddler on the Roof," a book about young people caught between tradition and bilag¡anas, the world outside.
Problems on the Navajo Nation reservation in northern Arizona abound. Prejudice, alcohol and a lack of opportunity are the Navajos' Cossacks. Powell estimates one-third of the families living there don't have running water and electricity; there is a 45% unemployment rate.
Yet the Navajo find comfort in the community and the old ways, in a life surrounded by sacred mountains and stories of the different clans repeated for generations. Even those who leave are often pulled back by the ancient ways -- which is kind of how this book began, 27 years ago.
Powell's wife, Evelyn, served two months as a midwife for Navajo Health Services. Michael spent the time wandering the reservation and finding comfort "in this achingly beautiful land and its people."
When they returned to the real world -- or at least New York City -- "Evelyn and I resisted surrendering our loose-jawed state of grace. We balked at returning to what was."
He called editors in the Southwest to see about jobs, not worried about pay as he once might have. "To accept and explore a nonmaterial word seemed a fine life's journey."
As it often does, though, materialism triumphed; the desire to return to Arizona faded. But a quarter of a century later, after surviving cancer, the reservation pulled him back, too. And this book was his return ticket.
Powell found his Tevye in Raul Mendoza, 70 years old, 40 years a coach, holder of a state championship ring, hired to lead the once hapless Chinle Wildcats, to provide control over a team used to playing undisciplined fast-paced Rez ball.
It is grueling trying to coach a squad whose players pay as much attention to bahadzidii or the taboos as they do to practice. One, a shooting guard, wrapped corn pollen in his socks before a game. Another puts a pouch of protective bitterroot in his shorts. Parents pay medicine men to sing protective songs.
But these same youngsters rap and play video games and practice handshakes like the stars they see on TV. Ultimately, Mendoza -- acting as much as mentor as coach -- succeeds, mostly, in earning their respect.
Powell, a sports columnist for the New York Times, has a fine reporter's eye and sensibility. He talks to aunties and uncles and makes you understand why despite it all -- the broken homes, the poverty, the lack of opportunity -- the reservation is home. "Canyon Dreams" is a sports book, but one unlike any you've read before, and one that will stay with you long after the final horn has sounded.

Texto completo: My mind is made up; don’t confuse me with the facts. That phrase has been around since at least the mid-1940s and has spawned many variations, such as “Never let the facts get in the way of a good story.” We do like facts and truth, but we often like what we already believe even more.
In an op-ed published in The New York Times on April 29, Paul Krugman, referring to Republican arguments, wrote: “On issue after issue, what you see are multiple levels of denial combined with a refusal ever to give up an argument no matter how completely it has been discredited.” Talk about frustrating.
Scientists have long recognized that theories do not readily surrender to new facts, but yield the field only when a better theory comes along. Whatever may happen, events, like nature, abhor an explanatory vacuum. We prefer an inadequate theory to none at all. Even when better theories come along, we hold onto the old theory with devastating tenacity. Just ask Galileo about the reception of his finding that the Earth was not the center of the universe. Much theological thinking of the time was based on a geocentric universe, so the loss of that distinction had grave religious consequences. We do not give up cherished beliefs without a fight.
The more we have invested in a belief of any sort — the more we rely on the truth of any position — the harder we find it to incorporate inconvenient findings. Better to discount the new and hold on tightly to the cherished belief. Explanatory gymnastics take on the complexity of an Olympic routine. We keep acting on the old truth, wondering why it does not pay off, and follow the truism of try, try again.
Surely that tax cut for the wealthy will pay huge economic benefits this time.
Surely the next blizzard will convince us that global warming is a political myth.
Surely the old ideas are better than the new.
And those old ideas are better for attracting campaign donations from those who benefited most handsomely by the old ideas. Just maybe the way that political campaigns are financed is in need of revision. That, though, will be like attacking a well-defended fortress on a hill from a valley deep below. It can be done, but usually with great sacrifice. Politics is, indeed, a blood sport.
In an op-ed published in the Nov. 10 Sunday LNP (“Spreading disinformation within US is dangerous”), Bryan Stinchfield quotes from a recent book, “The New Rules of War” by Sean McFate: “The best weapons do not fire bullets,” referring instead to propaganda and disinformation efforts.
Perhaps we could say that the best weapons do not fire bullets but BS.
The concept of propaganda and disinformation appeals more to those supporting a position if it attacks other positions. Eager to go on the attack, the propaganda and disinformation, masquerading as legitimate information, is pointed toward opponents or toward those who have not formed a position. If the recipients do not check the veracity of the material, it becomes like an infectious germ, causing disease in the unsuspecting hosts.
Of course, if the initial recipient believes the propaganda and disinformation as well, that person’s position is strengthened without benefit of truth. Too many people believing what is not true is a recipe for disaster. Welcome to bulletless warfare. Fact checking is a good defense, but often it is difficult, tedious and discouraging. It becomes all too easy to avoid it, and then we are in deep trouble.
Holding on to the customary makes a certain amount of sense. It is familiar and, thus, more comfortable. The more familiar something is, the more predictable it seems to be, and in predictability there is a greater sense of safety.
Things that are predictable take on an aura of “the way it should be,” and philosophical/religious meanings may get attached.
We do not give up old comforts without a fight. The fight can last for centuries.
A characteristic of human nature — and of many animals too, for that matter — is the tendency to hold on tightly to what represents a substantial investment of time, money, blood, sweat and tears. It is hard to accept that the investment was not “worth it.” We hold on, unable and unwilling to admit defeat, failure or any number of other pejoratives. Just try harder, your luck will turn, whistle past the graveyard.
One of the many ways in which people are different is in willingness to accept change. Some are always ready to try new things; others are dragged kicking and screaming from change to change, year to year, century to century. It can make the process of governing difficult, challenging and verging on the impossible. Where, oh where, is the Goldilocks point — the porridge is just the right temperature. As Abraham Lincoln observed, adapting a line from poet John Lydgate, “You can’t please all of the people all of the time.”
Democracy is messy business, though most would say it is better than autocracy.
Unless … is there a philosopher-reagent handy? Probably not.

Texto completo: Democratic candidates for president don’t get enough sleep. Here’s why that’s terrifying.
“How many hours of sleep do you get a night?” This was the anodyne question 21 Democratic candidates for president were asked to answer by The New York Times in June.
Many candidates met the question with a sheepish smile.
“Not enough,” said progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, implying that he joins the growing echelon of sleep-deprived Americans — more than 60% of the population — who fail to get the eight hours of nightly sleep recommended by the World Health Organization.
Sanders’ answer, albeit alarming, was among the least concerning. He was joined Sen. Kamala Harris and former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, both of whom happily confessed to being bereft of sleep by responding with the same ambiguous answer of “not enough.”
But others, including former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, were more explicit, offering genuinely perturbing answers. “If I get more than five hours of sleep a night, I’m doing well,” Castro said, appearing to take peculiar pride in his less-than-spectacular sleep regimen.
So what’s the big deal? These candidates align with many Americans who find eight hours of nightly sleep to be an unattainable goal. Even when falling well below the recommended hours of nightly sleep, Americans around the country find a way to vitalize their nebulous, sleep-deprived brains and function when life demands it. One pronounced difference exists, however: Those people aren’t running for president.
Sleep has invariably been an enigmatic aspect of human existence. It is compulsory for all of us (yes, sleep deprivation can kill you), yet ascertaining why this is true has confounded humans since time immemorial. It has stumped even the most vaunted of analysts, including Sigmund Freud, whose seminal treatise, “The Interpretation of Dreams,” attempted to unravel and elucidate the complexities of sleep.
But research spanning the last two decades has helped to explain the mysteries of sleep, allowing humans to unlock the benefits associated with a good night of it — and understand how they might fall victim to the deleterious consequences of trudging onward without it.
Sleep deprivation, or failing to attain a sufficient amount of sleep, has a plethora of adverse effects on humans. Along with increasing the risk of cancer, sleep deprivation precludes the immune system from augmenting its cache of cytokines, a class of proteins that are called upon as combatants when an infection is detected inside the body. Thus, a sleep-deprived body’s immune system may succumb to an infection, whereas a well-rested one may be able to fend it off. Other well-known effects of sleep deprivation include a disequilibration of blood sugar levels, an increased likelihood of coronary arteries being blocked, and a host of short-term deficiencies like imprudent decision-making and difficulty grasping (and subsequently remembering) new concepts.
Unfortunately, many individuals either choose to ignore or aren’t cognizant of the array of adverse effects that sleep deprivation will engender. Thus, when we hear presidential hopefuls acknowledge their insufficient sleep regimens, it should create some genuine concern. That it does not may be a result of America’s indefatigable work ethic: Those who sleep less are busy getting more done, we assume.
Often, however, this is not the case. Even if forgoing sleep means getting more done, those additional accomplishments are not executed as efficiently or as skillfully as possible, and the debilitating costs inflicted on the sleep-renouncer far outweigh any reward.
Candidates such as Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren should be especially wary of abrogating their sleep-related responsibilities, given that, as septuagenarians, they are more susceptible to ailments such as sleep apnea that hinder one’s ability to sleep soundly. For her part, Warren stated that she achieves about eight hours of sleep per night, which certainly redounds to her benefit — and maybe even partly accounts for her healthy poll numbers.
Sleep is vital for everyone, yet especially essential to those who aspire to assume the office of the U.S. presidency. The profound weight of presidential duties necessitates an ability to function at optimum levels, both physically and cognitively. Sleep cannot be sacrificed, and this is why, when candidates for president blithely inform you that they are sleep-deprived, you should blanket them with admonishment.

Texto completo: In the football team pictures taken more than a century ago, it's easy to spot Henry McDonald. He's the only black player pictured.
And, indeed, Henry McDonald was one of a kind. In Rochester from 1911 to 1917, he was the first, and only, black player on the Jeffersons professional football team that went on to play in the NFL. Later, in Buffalo, he integrated the All-Americans.
As a sports pioneer, McDonald was named to the National Black Sports Hall of Fame in 1973, along with Wilt Chamberlin, Henry Aaron, Jesse Owens, Arthur Ashe and other athletes.
It's telling that in its list of the athletes who were inducted, McDonald's first name was given as "Herb" instead of "Henry" by the New York Times. While his achievements were significant, they (and he) were not well known.
Nonetheless, McDonald's time in professional football, and later professional baseball, says much about his ability and his character, as does his life after his playing days.
His story is an immigrant's story, one of settling in a new land, of making his way, and of leaving a legacy, not just in Rochester but also in Geneva, where he was revered by generations of young people.
McDonald was born in Haiti in 1890. He came to this country when he was 5, having been adopted by his father's boss, an American.
"My natural parents realized it was a great opportunity for me to go to America," McDonald told the Democrat and Chronicle in 1972. "I didn't see my mother again for over 55 years."
McDonald was raised in Canandaigua, where he became a football star at halfback for Canandaigua Academy. Not big at 140 pounds, he was fast, and his speed gave him a clear advantage.
After Canandaigua, McDonald played for East High School in Rochester. A picture in the East High yearbook for 1910 shows McDonald in the third row, the only black player on the team.
McDonald continued to play football in Rochester, first for the Oxfords Pros. Then, in 1911, he was spotted and signed by Leo Lyons, the Jeffersons' manager (and later owner).
The pay at that time was low — $15 total, McDonald sometimes said, for two games in one day, sometimes supplemented by passing the hat after the game.
It is often reported that, in playing for the Jeffersons, McDonald was the first black professional football player. However, records indicate that it's more likely he was the third, after Charles Follis, an African-American who joined the Shelby (Ohio) Blues in 1904 and Doc Baker, who signed on with Akron in 1906.
McDonald played for the Jeffersons at least through the 1917 season, during which the team traveled to Canton, Ohio, to take on the Bulldogs led by the famed Jim Thorpe.
The Jeffersons lost 49-0, and McDonald later told the Democrat and Chronicle that the game featured the only racial incident he encountered in football. A Bulldogs player, Greasy Neale, shoved McDonald and said, "Black is black and white is white, and where I come from they don't mix." Thorpe jumped between Neale and McDonald, saying, "We're here to play football," and the game went on.
"Thorpe was the greatest football player ever," McDonald also recalled. "He scared you with his stare and he rattled your back teeth with his tackles. He was like a runaway horse. I was fast, but he was faster."
McDonald seems to have left the Jeffersons by 1918 — one story says he was available to play, but it's not clear that he did.
By 1920, when the Jeffersons joined the American Professional Football Association (the precursor to the National Football League), McDonald was playing for the Buffalo All-Americans, that city's entry in the new league.
This made McDonald one of the first black players in the NFL's earliest days. And, sadly, he was one of just a handful of black athletes who played in the league before 1934. After that, there were no black players until 1946.
It doesn't appear that McDonald played long (or often) in Buffalo. He soon switched to another sport, baseball, playing several years in the Negro leagues with the Cuban Giants and then the Pittsburgh Colored Stars.
By this time, he was married and living in Geneva, where he and his wife, Laura, had two daughters and two sons. In Geneva, McDonald worked for the American Can Co. for years, and he also spent time as the head football coach for DeSales High School and as an athletic trainer at Hobart College.
He may have been best known in the community for his work as a baseball umpire with style to spare.
Chris Lavin, the executive director of the Boys & Girls Club of Geneva, and a former journalist in Rochester and other places, grew up in Geneva and played Little League baseball when McDonald was umpiring.
"He had a running gag the entire youth population of the city knew," Lavin wrote in an email. "If the count was 1 and 1, the next pitch would come, and Henry would declare loudly '2!' Everyone would yell, 'Two what, Henry?' 'Too close to call,' he'd call back before making the actual call."
Gags aside, McDonald ran a tight ship. "He was a stickler for behavior and respect," Lavin wrote. "No bat-throwing or emoting. And swinging a bat in a dugout or in any place but the on-deck circle could result in outs being declared."
McDonald died in 1976, at age 85. In his honor, Geneva's Little League is now at the Henry C. McDonald Memorial Park, at the end of Henry C. McDonald Drive — a fitting tribute to a sports pioneer who was one of a kind.

Texto completo: When Destin Daniel Cretton begins filming Marvel's highly anticipated "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" in the new year, he'll consider it the second superhero movie he will have made.
The first is "Just Mercy" starring Michael B. Jordan as civil rights defense lawyer Bryan Stevenson, whose careerlong crusade to save individuals from the death penalty and effect criminal justice reform is about to get its own origin story onscreen.
After an awards-qualifying run in limited release beginning Christmas Day, the film will open nationwide on Jan. 10. But the attorney and activist at the center of "Just Mercy" entered the Hollywood spotlight in August after a special screening of the film in Los Angeles, when Cretton and actors Jordan, Brie Larson and Jamie Foxx - all of whom have Marvel movies on their resumes - assembled for an emotional Q&A. They were joined by Stevenson, who drew the biggest applause.
Based on the 2014 New York Times bestselling memoir "Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption," the film stars Jordan as the Delaware-born Stevenson, an eager young attorney whose compassion is awakened while working with clients on death row in the Deep South.
Foxx co-stars as Walter McMillian, an African American pulpwood worker sent to Alabama's death row in 1988 for the murder of a white woman, who maintains his innocence as his clock ticks down and his tenuous hopes for exoneration fade.
Directing a script he wrote with Andrew Lanham, Cretton tracks Stevenson's fight to overturn McMillian's death sentence and those of other inmates sentenced to die in Alabama, the only U.S. state that does not provide postconviction legal aid to the condemned.
It charts the early work with advocate Eva Ansley (Larson) that led to the 1989 founding of the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to battling racial and economic injustice, mass incarceration and excessive punishment.
Oscar-nominated producer Gil Netter ("The Blind Side," "Life of Pi") optioned "Just Mercy" and approached Cretton to direct. Cretton read the book and found himself crying - and, to his surprise, laughing - in coffee shops as he pored over Stevenson's elegantly pointed and poignant writing.
"These characters are so human, and I just felt like I knew them," Cretton remembered. "I felt like they were my friends. By the end of this book, where you're confronted with so many harsh truths, you expect to be depressed. But I somehow felt really hopeful and inspired."
Now based in Los Angeles and father to a toddler, Cretton admits he didn't always feel that way. "To me it's really hard to be both informed and yet hopeful ... and that, to me, is the power of Bryan Stevenson and his work."

Some new books on language to spread some holiday cheer

Texto completo: Put some words in your wassail and some punctuation in your punch this holiday season with one of these new books about language.
Speaking of punctuation, the poor semicolon, long derided as a squishy, half-way compromise between the comma and the period, finally gets its due in Cecelia Watson's "Semicolon: The Past, Present and Future of a Misunderstood Mark" (Ecco/Harper/Collins, $19.99). Citing authors ranging from Herman Melville to Raymond Chandler, Watson shows how the versatile semicolon can sometimes launch a sentence forward "like a stone skipping across water." Eloquent and slyly irreverent, Watson makes a case for the graceful and creative use of all forms of punctuation.
On the Internet, a semicolon denotes a wink (;), and that's the realm Gretchen McCulloch explores in "Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language" (Riverhead Books, $26). The "because noun" construction of the title is a trendy Internet trope, and a tip off to the book's savvy, incisive style. Internet-ese can seem chaotic, so McCulloch helpfully points out some of its conventions and devices: a keysmash (asdfjkl) signals exasperation; using ALL CAPS indicates shouting; a "tilde" conveys sarcasm ("isn't she ~adorable"); and "expressive lengthening" boosts intensity ("yesssss," "sweeeeet").
For those of us still trying to choose between "affect" and "effect," Sean Williams serves up a handy helper: "English Grammar: 100 Tragically Common Grammar Mistakes* (*And How To Correct Them)" (Zephyros Press, $10.99). Her nifty advice deftly dispatches many of our perennial demons: "who/whom" (If you can replace the word with "he" or "she," use "who"); "farther/further" (Use "farther" for physical distance). I especially enjoyed her suggested substitutions for long-winded phrases, e.g., "in view of the fact that" ("because"), "make a determination" ("decide").
Banishing gobbledygook is also on the mind of Trish Hall in "Writing To Persuade: How To Bring People Over to Your Side" (Liveright, $26.95). Hall, a former editor of the New York Times op-ed page, shows that clear, crisp writing can win over even the crustiest skeptic. Her advice: Abandon jargon. Prune ruthlessly. Be specific. As an editor, she once had to ask Mark Zuckerberg and the rock singer Bono to trim down and revise an op-ed piece about Africa they'd co-written. Even these celebrities, she notes, had to meet her strict standards of concision and clarity.
And that goes for U-2!

Texto completo: That didn't take long.
"OK, Boomer" went from a fun, harmless-even-though-it-stings-a-bit phrase to an overthought, hyperanalyzed, "declaration of intergenerational war" (Maureen Dowd's words, not mine) in a week flat.
The saying started out as a clever, if biting, retort delivered by Generation Z in response to the lame directives/opinions/hand wringings of pretty much anyone over 30.
Then the New York Times wrote about it. And NBC News covered it. And Deseret News got defensive about it. ("Generation Z is embracing this new phrase called 'OK, Boomer.' But baby boomers have something to say about that phrase. They don't like it!")
And just like that, the air started leaking out of "OK, Boomer" like a day-old helium balloon.
"Boomers hate it, gen x will mock it, millennials will enthusiastically use it to the point of exhausting it without actually inventing it," New York-based writer Rachel Syme tweeted, "and gen z has already moved on and thinks we are all nobs."
We killed "OK, Boomer."
Killing stuff is supposed to be a millennial thing, but I actually think my generation - the one actively raising kids right now - is pretty adept at it too. In our quest to stay connected and close to our kids, we sometimes forget that they need and deserve space to live their childhoods without us taking every one of their triumphs and travails and quips so personally.
I probably unwittingly contributed to "OK, Boomer's" early demise. Last week I wrote about how I came face-to-face with the saying when my kids and their friends were home during the Chicago Public Schools teacher strike. I thought the phrase was pretty clever - a sign that kids are simultaneously bemused by us and eager to reject our old ways of thinking, confident they'll create a better, healthier, more equitable world than we have. And I believe they will.
But I think something a little bigger is at play here as well.
I think a lot of us, well-intentioned though we may be, fail to keep our own egos in check when we're observing and participating in our kids' childhoods.
Their grades become a measure of our parenting, rather than a measure of how well they grasped the academic material in front of them.
Their colleges become the grand finale of our 18 years of work - the ultimate return on investment - rather than a place for them to build on their 18 years of life so far - and a place from which to launch into the rest of their decades.
Their sports? Oh, man. Their sports. I have watched grown-ups take a child's game and turn it into a high-stakes pressure cooker more times than I care to count. Grown-ups yelling at 15-year-old umpires. Grown-ups yelling at their kids' opponents, who also happen to be kids, of course. Grown-ups yelling at other grown-ups about who was out, what was foul, whether that kid was offside, whether that judge is biased. So very much yelling.
I have watched my son come home from various games and turn to the cold comfort of his Xbox, where he can control the wins and losses on Madden NFL 20 and no one's screaming at his teammates from the sidelines or the bleachers. I have watched, on some days, a video game become more fun than a real game played with real humans.
Are these the same forces that killed "OK, Boomer"? It all sounds a little overwrought, I realize.
But I do think it's worth asking ourselves, in any situation, but particularly in parenting: Is this really about me?
Haven't younger generations always been skeptical of older generations? Isn't "OK, Boomer" just the latest version of the '60s mantra, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Couldn't we have shrugged this one off?
It's too late for "OK, Boomer," which has officially jumped the shark.
The other stuff though - the bigger stuff, the stuff that takes up more time and space in our kids' hearts and schedules and futures - I think that stuff is worth pausing and thinking hard about.
It's their childhood. We had ours. We can and should be there for as much of it as we possibly can. That's a gift and an honor. But we should also resist the urge to hold up their childhood as some kind of mirror to check our own reflections or boost our own egos.
I'm speaking to myself as much as anyone. It's tricky to find that sweet spot just before becoming overinvested, especially when you love these people more than life itself.
Maybe "OK, Boomer" can be our canary in the coal mine. Maybe "OK, Boomer" can remind us, when all else fails, to be a little better at laughing stuff off.

Texto completo: Chazz Palminteri has lived and relived his boyhood over and over again, first in his own one-man autobiographical show and then as a movie. Now his tale that is a little bit "Jersey Boys," a little bit "West Side Story" and "85-90% me" is coming to Pittsburgh.
So far, it's "A Bronx Tale" he hasn't tired of telling.
The Oscar-nominated actor and writer was reliving it again in October, when he came to Pittsburgh to promote the national tour of the hit Broadway musical.
Over dinner at the Fairmont's fl. 2 restaurant, the conversation ranged from his life story, to the "anguish" he felt when the Pirates beat his Yankees, to his visits to Pittsburgh, past and recent - past, to film the movie "Diabolique" with Sharon Stone; recent, as his college-bound daughter checks out a local university.
In case you missed the nuts and bolts of his personal tale, it follows Calogero - Chazz's given name - from pre-tween through his teen years, when he falls for a black classmate and their forbidden romance puts him at odds with his tough-guy, racist friends and a brewing turf war between bordering black and Italian neighborhoods. This comes as he is caught in a tug-of-war between his honorable bus-driver father (Robert De Niro in the movie version) and the flashy gangster, Sonny (played by Palminteri in the film), who recruits "C," as he calls Calogero, into his business.
What does Palminteri, 67, look for when casting the part of, well, himself - besides youngsters who can sing and dance?
"I was a street guy, but I had an artist's soul. I wanted to be a writer, and I wanted to act. But I couldn't really talk about that to my friends," said the actor, who trained with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York.
He switches from himself to the character, adding, "But he's not a wimp; he's a tough kid. So you have to have that sensitivity, and you have to have an edge, too."
"A Bronx Tale" began as a one-man show that the actor performed in Los Angeles, before it became a hot Hollywood property to bring to the screen. He turned down offers because, like Sylvester Stallone and "Rocky," Palminteri wanted to write the screenplay himself and play the role of Sonny, the local mob boss who takes young Calorgero under his wing.
Palminteri brought the solo show to New York, after De Niro became a fan. He also finished the screenplay and went on to star in the 1993 movie opposite De Niro, who chose the script for his directorial debut.
Palminteri said he "always" thought it could be a musical, because it was a love story with the rich themes that have inspired so many of the classics.
After some starts and stops, music executive Tommy Mottola, said Palminteri, "is the one who really put it on his back. ... I always say, Bob De Niro made the movie happen. Tommy Mottola made the musical happen."
The team that came together is a who's who of musical theater: De Niro co-directing with four-time Tony winner Jerry Zaks, songs by Oscar winner Alan Menken and Glenn Sater, and choreography by Tony winner Sergio Trujillo.
Menken is best-known for his Disney scores, but he also wrote the '60s-inspired pop score for "Little Shop of Horrors." The music in "A Bronx Tale," which takes place in the 1960s, samples sounds of the decade and opens with street-corner doo-wop.
Palminteri, who has an Oscar nomination as a supporting actor for "Bullets Over Broadway," remembered working on the 2004 movie "Noel," his directorial debut, with Menken and Stephen Schwartz. "And I felt like I had grown up on Alan Menken's music because my kids would watch 'Little Mermaid' and 'Aladdin.' And I said, 'Those are fables. "A Bronx Tale" is a fable. He's right for it.'"
Working with Menken and Slater, "every day was just magic," Palminteri said. The show went from in-development to Broadway in less than four years.
"A Bronx Tale" on Broadway was a New York Times Editor's Pick. It didn't get any Tonys love, but audiences kept coming. The familiar title and word of mouth carried the show through 700 performances over two years, starting in December 2016. Nick Cordero was the breakout star as Sonny - a role that Palminteri also played when Cordero left for a screen role.
Palminteri wasn't surprised at the musical's success. It's a story that attracts loyal fans and repeat business, "the same as the one-man show, the same as the movie.
"It resonates," he continued, "because the characters are archetypes, and it's about their choices, about not wasting their lives. It's just honest, you know?"
And how's this for honesty: When he realized that Pittsburgh audiences are likely to cheer the moment in the show when young Calogero is inconsolable over the Yankees' 1960 loss to the Pirates, he turns from his meal and gets visibly excited. The idea that he could meet Bill Mazeroski, whose walk-off homer beat his Yankees, brings out both his sensitivity and his edge.
"Is Bill Mazeroski still in Pittsburgh?" (He lives in Florida.) "He has to come to the show!" Palminteri said. "I have to look the man in the eye who caused me so much anguish!"
He pauses. "So people in Pittsburgh will cheer at that," he says finally. Even after reliving that moment again and again onstage, he realizes, "I never thought of that."

Texto completo: Under a new proposal, 42 minor league teams would have their affiliations with major league clubs severed. Here is a list of the teams that would be affected.
A Major League Baseball proposal would drastically alter the landscape of minor league baseball, severing the major-league affiliations of 42 teams in the lower levels of the minors. Some of those teams have been part of their communities for generations, like the Chattanooga Lookouts, whose roots date to 1885; some are playing in stadiums built as recently as 2008, when the Billings Mustangs' Dehler Park opened.
M.L.B. contends that the reorganization is necessary to make the minor leagues more efficient and to improve conditions and facilities, but many officials associated with the teams see it as an existential crisis for their organizations.

Save Earth’s little things and you save us all, including the Joshua tree

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

Texto completo: An associate of Rudy Giuliani reportedly bragged about being on a "secret mission" to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
During the White House's annual Hanukkah party last year, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman slipped out of a large reception room full of hundreds of Trump donors to have a private meeting with the president and Giuliani, his personal attorney, according to CNN. After the meeting, Parnas told two confidants that "the big guy," meaning Trump, tasked him with running a "secret mission" to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
According to the confidants, Parnas bragged that he was on a "James Bond mission," believing he had been given a special assignment from Trump. The mission included Giuliani issuing the president's directives while Parnas worked as an investigator with Fruman.
"Parnas viewed the assignment as a great crusade," one of the people in whom he confided said. "He believed he was doing the right thing for Trump."
The White House has not yet commented on the report, but Giuliani's lawyer denied allegations of both the private meeting and the special assignment, saying Parnas is "no Sean Connery" and that he suffers from "delusions of grandeur."
A lawyer for Parnas, however, told CNN, "Mr. Parnas at all times believed that he was acting only on behalf of the president, as directed by his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and never on behalf of any Ukrainian officials."
The report comes after Parnas's lawyer told the New York Times on Sunday that his client met with a representative of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government in May and warned the country that the White House would freeze military aid unless it announced an investigation into 2020 Democratic front-runner Biden. Giuliani, however, disputed that claim as well.
Parnas, who was arrested with Fruman on campaign finance-related charges last month, has signaled that he is ready to cooperate with the impeachment proceedings into the president. The pair also reportedly pressured the previous president of Ukraine to investigate Biden.
House Democrats launched an impeachment process last month over Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky, during which he urged the foreign leader to investigate the Bidens for corruption, as well as debunked allegations that the country interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Lawmakers are attempting to determine if the military aid or state meetings were conditioned on the investigations.

Texto completo: James F. "Ace" Adams IV, a three time All-American Johns Hopkins University lacrosse player who later coached the sport at St. Paul's School, West Point, Penn and Virginia, died Monday from pancreatic cancer at his Charlottesville, Virginia, home. He was 91.
"During the 1940s, he was a lacrosse star at St. Paul's and they never lost a game during his four years on the team, and then he went to Hopkins and they never lost a game. So that's eight years of never losing a game," said Bill Tanton, former longtime Evening Sun sports editor.
"Jim was one of the great players of that long ago-era," said Mr. Tanton, a Tuscany-Canterbury resident. "He was always known as a gentleman who never chastised the referees and was really a genuinely nice person and an amazing coach."
James Frederick Adams IV, the son of James F. Adams III, a businessman, and Helen Monmonier Rianhard, a homemaker, was born in Baltimore and raised in Catonsville.
Mr. Adams entered St. Paul's School in the second grade as a boarder, and lived there until graduating in 1946. During his years at St. Paul's, he blossomed as an athlete in middle school, and by the time he completed the upper school, was a star varsity athlete who earned three letters in football and basketball, and four in lacrosse where he was an outstanding midfielder.
In 1976, Del Langdon, in an "I Remember" feature for the old Sunday Sun Magazine, recalled Mr. Adams' performance as a member of those memorable St. Paul's lacrosse teams for which he played from 1943 to 1946.
"How about Jim 'Ace' Adams looking taller, leaner and far more serious than anyone else, executing a perfect cut to convert one of [attackman Billy] Hooper's feeds into a score," wrote Mr. Langdon.
Mr. Adams entered the Johns Hopkins University in 1946, where he was an end and quarterback on the varsity football team and forward on the basketball team. He brought his skills as a midfielder to the Blue Jays' national championship teams in 1947, 1948 and 1950, when he was team co-captain.
In 1948, the U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association named him an honorable mention All-American midfielder. The next year, the association named him to its first team, and in 1950, to its third team. He also played in the North/South Collegiate All-Star games both in 1949 and 1950.
After graduating from Hopkins in 1950, he returned to St. Paul's, where he taught five classes a day and was head coach of the lacrosse and football teams. From 1952 to 1953, he was the school's athletic director.
"During his three-year coaching stint at his alma mater, St. Paul's School of Baltimore, the prep school won the Maryland scholastic championship each year," reported The New York Times in 1958.
Mr. Adams left St. Paul's in 1953 when he became an insurance salesman, but continued playing lacrosse from 1951 to 1956 for the Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, and served as the team's head coach in 1957.
Mr. Adams was named head lacrosse coach at Army in 1958, succeeding F. Morris Touchstone, a Baltimore native who had played for the Mount Washington Lacrosse Club and coached at West Point for 29 years, before his death in 1957 from a heart attack.
During his 12 years at West Point, Mr. Adams led Army to four national titles. In his first season, 1958, he led the Black Knights to a perfect record and being named national champions.
"Against Duke, Adams played 33 different players in a failed attempt to hold down the score. Army won, 21-2," according to a National Intercollegiate Lacrosse Officials Association profile of Mr. Adams.
"In 1961, the first nationally televised lacrosse game, Army upset Navy, 10-8, to capture a share of the national championship alongside the Midshipmen. That season, Adams was awarded the F. Morris Touchstone Award as USILA Coach of the Year," according to the profile.
It was his final game as Army coach against Navy in Annapolis in 1969, and Mr. Adams had not forgotten the 18-7 drubbing Navy delivered against his team four years earlier.
"The Middies' first string poured it on for almost the full 60 minutes and then walked away laughing," reported Sports Illustrated at the time.
"It was the most humiliating moment of my life," Mr. Adams told the magazine.
On a June day in 1969, Mr. Adams' team delivered what has been called a 14-4 "rout" before more than 16,000 spectators at Navy-Marine Corps Stadium.
In 1970, Mr. Adams was appointed lacrosse coach at the University of Pennsylvania, where he coached for eight years.
Because of Mr. Adams' excellent recruitment skills, he was able by midway through his tenure at Penn, to raise player quality. In 1977, he had three first team All-Americans on the team, and had managed to lead the Quakers to several top-10 rankings, including the No. 4 position in his final year.
He coached Penn to its first two NCAA Championship appearances in 1975 and 1977, and during his time there coached 17 All-Americans.
Mr. Adams was hired in 1978 to be the head lacrosse coach at the University of Virginia, and until retiring in 1992, complied a record of leading the Cavaliers to 12 NCAA tournament appearances and to four semifinals, finishing twice as runners-up, but won no national titles. His record at Virginia was 136-60.
"After 35 years of college coaching, I feel it is time to turn the reins over to a younger coach," he told The Sun at the time of his retirement.
At the time of his retirement, he had the most wins of any active Division 1 lacrosse coach with a lifetime record of 286-122-1.
In 2012, Penn named its new lacrosse field at its 24-acre Penn Park location the James F. "Ace" Adams Field, making it the first field named for a former Penn coach.
"Coach Adams taught his student-athletes not only to excel on the field and in the classroom, but also to have a positive impact on the world at large," said Penn athletic director Steve Bilsky, at its dedication.
Mr. Adams was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1975. He was president of the USILA from 1963 to 1964 and served on numerous NCAA, USILA and Lacrosse Foundation committees.
In his retirement, Mr. Adams followed lacrosse, football and basketball at Virginia. He enjoyed playing golf and was a member of the Boar's Head Sports Club.
He was a member and a former elder of the the First Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville.
A private interment service will be held Friday at the University of Virginia Cemetery and Columbarium.
Mr. Adams is survived by his wife of 69 years, the former Betty Jane Sparks; five daughters, Linda A. Martin of Cheshire, Connecticut, Sally C. Saxton of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Helen Elizabeth "Beth" McGrath of Charlottesville, Dr. Mary Jo Hill of Williamsnurg, Virginia, and Margaret Ann "Meg" Torres of Vancouver, British Columbia; 18 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.

Texto completo: Trump wants Supreme Court to block subpoena for his taxes
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his tax returns, in a test of the president's ability to defy investigations.
The filing Thursday sets the stage for a high court showdown over the tax returns Trump has refused to release, unlike every other modern president. The justices also could weigh in more broadly on Trump's claim that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted or investigated for crimes.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump's tax returns back to 2011 from his accounting firm as part of a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers say a criminal probe of the president at the state or local level is unconstitutional and unprecedented in American history.
Lower courts have rejected Trump's claims of immunity.
The Supreme Court justices may not decide whether to hear the case for at least another month.
A second, similar case is headed to the court over a House committee subpoena demanding Trump's financial records from the same accounting firm. The president has lost both cases at each step of the judicial system so far. The Mazars USA firm has said it will comply with the subpoenas, if courts agree.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is seeking the records in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the claims.

Brexit Party fails to clinch voting pact with Conservatives
LONDON - Britain's Brexit Party has failed to reach a tactical voting pact with the ruling Conservatives, saying Thursday that it will field 300 candidates in next month's election to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his promise of a clean break with the European Union.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the party had to contest the seats in Britain's Dec. 12 election to keep the pressure on Johnson, rebuffing Conservative arguments that doing so risks splitting the pro-Brexit vote and boosts parties that want to remain in the EU.
Britain is holding a national election on Dec. 12 because Johnson wants to secure a majority so he can take the U.K. out of the bloc.
Johnson reached a Brexit deal with the EU but has not persuaded enough British lawmakers to pass it.

Pastor: Jimmy Carter 'up and walking' post brain surgery
ATLANTA - Former President Jimmy Carter was already "up and walking" just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls, his pastor said.
The Rev. Tony Lowden visited Carter, 95, in an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday.
"His spirits are good and he is up and walking," Lowden told reporters.
Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during Carter's Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain's surface.
The center said the bleeding was connected to Carter's recent falls. A Spring fall required Carter to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.

Trump Jr.'s book is a No. 1 bestseller, but with an edge
NEW YORK - Donald Trump Jr.'s "Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Times on Nov. 24.
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were "bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said the RNC has been offering "Triggered" as a fundraising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."

North Korea: US offers to restart nuclear talks
SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea on Thursday said the United States has proposed a resumption of stalled nuclear negotiations in December as they approach an end-of-year deadline set by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer an acceptable deal to salvage the talks.
In a statement released by state media, North Korean negotiator Kim Myong Gil didn't clearly say whether the North would accept the supposed U.S. offer.
He said North Korea has no interest in talks aimed at buying time without discussing solutions. He said the North isn't willing to make a deal over "matters of secondary importance," such as possible U.S. offers to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, or establish a liaison office between the nations.

US implores EU nations to retake fighters from IS group
WASHINGTON - European and other members of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group must take back and prosecute their nationals detained in Iraq and Syria to help keep IS from regaining territory, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday.
Pompeo told foreign ministers and senior officials from about 30 coalition members that it's imperative that they hold thousands of detained foreign fighters accountable for atrocities committed while IS held swathes of territory in the two countries.
Many of the detained foreign fighters are from Europe, but countries have been reluctant to take them back and officials acknowledged there are still differences of opinion among coalition partners about how best to deal with them.

In South Carolina: A school shooter who was 14 when he killed a first grader on a school playground in South Carolina after killing his father in their home was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.
Jesse Osborne, now 17, crashed his father's pickup truck into the fence on Sept. 28, 2016 and fired on first graders at Townville Elementary School celebrating a classmate's birthday.
But Osborne's lawyers noted he never tried to get inside the school, even though police took 12 minutes to arrive.
Osborne, who was tried as an adult, had left a video chat open on his cellphone and witnesses said he was pacing outside, crying and saying he was sorry. Jacob Hill, 6, was killed.

Texto completo: Movie REview
★★
THE REPORT
Written and directed by Scott Z. Burns. Starring Adam Driver, Annette Bening, Jon Hamm, Tim Blake Nelson. At Boston theaters, Coolidge Corner, suburbs. 119 minutes. R (some scenes of inhumane treatment and torture, and language).
It's never a good sign when the most dramatic scene in a movie owes its power to C-SPAN footage. That's the case with “The Report." It's a based-on-fact story about the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence investigating the CIA's use of torture (excuse me, “enhanced interrogation techniques") during the George W. Bush administration. More specifically, it focuses on the all-consuming efforts of staffer Dan Jones (Adam Driver) to reveal both the illegality and ineffectiveness of the CIA program.
Part of the lack of drama is intentional. Much of “The Report" belongs to what one might call the DC-procedural tradition. The tone is consciously chilly, the acting underplayed. People sit in windowless or underlit rooms. They shuffle paper, write on white boards, click keyboards, stare at computer screens. Sometimes, as a change of pace, they debate policy or attend PowerPoint presentations. The menacingly blank facade of CIA headquarters at Langley, Va., is played for all its worth.
Stylistically, the founding film in this tradition is “All the President's Men" (1976). So it will come as no surprise — though perhaps as a disappointment — that, yes, “The Report" includes a semi-clandestine meeting in a parking garage. This one's between Jones and an unidentified New York Times national-security reporter (Matthew Rhys) who sure has a lot in common with James Risen (who's thanked in the closing credits).
A sizable chunk of “The Report" does not belong to this tradition. It goes to the other extreme: torture scenes in Afghanistan and other black-ops sites. The camerawork is handheld-jittery; and the tone intense and overheated, as it should be.
There are two problems here. Instead of complementing each other — each strain serving as moral, visual, and emotional counterpoint to the other — they're more like cognitive dissonance. That's not good. The other problem is worse. What both strands of “The Report" share is phoniness. Neither offers a sense of this-is-really-how-it-was persuasiveness.
This isn't necessarily a question of factuality (though it is odd that we're told that before being hired by the Senate committee, Jones worked for the CIA — whereas in real life it was the FBI). CIA director George Tenet (Dominic Fumusa) screwed up, big time, but was he really that sweaty and furtive in private? Yes, the enhanced-interrogation program was demonstrably a failure. But were the two psychologist contractors who designed it, James Mitchell (Douglas Hodge) and Bruce Jessen (T. Ryder Smith) such patently self-aggrandizing chuckleheads? They're presented as a very sinister version of Abbott and Costello.
This is Scott Z. Burns's debut as a feature director. He's primarily been a screenwriter, often for Steven Soderbergh: “Contagion" (2011), “Side Effects" (2013), earlier this fall “The Laundromat." That background may account for what's most impressive about “The Report." The movie is flashback-heavy, jumping around from 2001 to 2014, and plenty of points in between. It's also at times policy-wonk obscure, throwing out all sorts of names from deep inside old news stories (hello, Senators Saxby Chambliss and Mark Udall). But Burns's narrative remains consistently clear. That is no small achievement.
If Burns's screenwriting background may account for “The Report" moving along smoothly, it makes more puzzling how maladroit the dialogue is. That maladroitness has a lot to do with the lack of plausibility. “It throws the whole program under the goddam bus," one Bush aide grumbles to another. This is not how bureaucrats and policymakers talk. It is, though, how screenwriters think they talk. Nor is it likely that lawmakers and people who work for lawmakers would fail to know the difference between going to jail (which is bad) and going to prison (which is very, very bad). And surely Jones doesn't need to be told by his boss, “Senate staff don't have to run for reelection. She does."
The she in question is Dianne Feinstein. Annette Bening plays California's senior senator with a fine blend of acuity and steeliness. At first glance, you're tempted to think, “Hey, why is Annette Bening wearing that terrible wig?" Soon enough, you realize how persuasively she inhabits the role. As Obama White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, Jon Hamm does his suave, detached Jon Hamm thing. Tim Blake Nelson, as a CIA whistleblower, has just one scene — and electrifies it. He is the Jane Alexander equivalent here (to return to “All the President's Men"), and that is very high praise.
Adam Driver is staking a claim to 2019. He was very funny hunting zombies in “The Dead Don't Die." He's getting excellent reviews for “Marriage Story," which opens here Nov. 22. He returns next month as Kylo Ren — boo, hiss — in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker." Driver is a naturally recessive actor. That served him well last year, amid all the hugger-mugger of “BlacKkKlansman." Here the recessiveness means he blends in all too well with that Langley facade.
The C-SPAN footage mentioned above shows Senator John McCain's Dec. 9, 2014, speech on torture and the committee report. “This question isn't about our enemies," McCain says. “It's about us." In revisiting that question and putting it in human terms, “The Report" does a signal service. In muddling and reducing that question, it loses the signal for the noise.

Texto completo: Roughly one in four newspapers in the United States has closed since 2004, and many that managed to survive have been cut to the bone. Now, more than 260 dailies will be controlled by the same company.
Shareholders voted on Thursday to approve a deal that would join the two largest newspaper chains in the United States, all but guaranteeing the creation of a newspaper colossus that is likely to result in thousands of layoffs.
The combination of GateHouse Media and Gannett -- already the two largest newspaper owners in the country, by both number of papers and print circulation, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina -- means that more than 550 newspapers, 300 of them weeklies, will have the same owner.
The merger is expected to reach formal completion on Tuesday, the companies said in a statement on Thursday. Shareholders with stakes in both companies voted in favor.
Under the terms of the deal, New Media Investment Group, the parent of GateHouse Media, will acquire its smaller rival, Gannett. The new company will go by the name Gannett and include longtime Gannett papers like USA Today, The Arizona Republic and The Detroit Free Press along with GateHouse publications like The Palm Beach Post, The Austin American-Statesman and The Akron Beacon Journal. Their combined print circulation will exceed eight million, according to the University of North Carolina researchers.
The deal will also lead to annual cost savings of up to $ 300 million a year, the companies said upon announcing the deal in August. Executives have not specified how the savings would come about while insisting that the deal would "enhance quality journalism." Job cuts, in newsrooms and other areas, are likely.
Michael Reed, the chief executive of New Media Investment Group, was named the head of the new Gannett. "Together, we will be stronger with a more viable path to growth for our shareholders and employees, while sustaining journalism in hundreds of markets across the country," Mr. Reed said in a statement.
The president of a union that represents newsroom employees around the country (including at The New York Times) condemned the merger. "The deal is bad for journalists, it's bad for readers, and it's bad for the future of local journalism," the News Guild-CWA president, Bernie Lunzer, said in a statement Thursday. "Local papers will likely vanish, jobs will be slashed, and reporting will suffer."
The transaction was valued at $ 1.4 billion in August, but a recent decline in GateHouse stock will make it worth closer to $ 1.2 billion.
Private equity firms, flush with capital and able to profit off the steady cash flow produced by legacy dailies, have come to dominate the newspaper industry, which has been in general decline for more than a decade as readers increasingly get their news on laptops, tablets and smartphones. Digital advertising revenue has not made up for the decline in the money once brought in by the print ads that used to fatten newspapers.
Gannett's business has always been journalism, ever since its founder, Frank E. Gannett, became a newspaper baron roughly a century ago. In contrast, the money that has allowed GateHouse Media to go on a buying spree in recent years derives from Fortress Investment Group, a New York financial firm that is owned by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.

Texto completo: Washington’s Republican power center was at the Top of the Hay Wednesday evening to celebrate Donald Trump Jr.’s just-announced New York Times No. 1 book that brother-in-law Jared Kushner said is “driving people crazy, which is Don’s specialty.”
In what several of the 100-plus guests called the hottest ticket of the year, Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump hosted the two-hour event on the top of the Hay Adams Hotel to cheer Trump Jr. on and thank the GOP influentials, lawmakers, Cabinet members, staff, and friends that have backed President Trump.Don Trump Jr book release WEX.jpg“For Ivanka and myself, coming down to Washington, it's definitely been a unique experience. We joke that we don’t get paid for this job, but having the friendship of all of you and getting the opportunity to meet all of you makes it an incredibly worthwhile experience,” said Kushner standing in front of windows that overlook the North Portico of the White House.
“Don’s been an incredible brother to me. One thing about the Trump kids that nobody really gets to see is that they are very hard to pull apart, they really stick together, they all support each other, they are amazing, and they are all each other’s best friends,” said Kushner.41o5Q0r8uZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpgTurning to Trump’s book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, Kushner, a senior White House adviser, said to his guests, “Thank you for celebrating this book which is driving people crazy, which is Don’s specialty. As of a couple of hours ago, it was just announced that it was No. 1 on the New York Times list.”
Trump joked about topping the nonfiction list and beating, for example, Elton John. “I take great solace in the fact that they are in there right now crying about the fact that I am No. 1,” he said.
He applauded the work of Kushner and his sister Ivanka, making note of her “grace” in the face of constant attacks. He said that Ivanka is “the counterpart to what I am good for, wrecking ball.”
Ivanka Trump kidded, “I’ve got to say, that’s the nicest thing he’s ever said.”
She said that they are a “good team,” and Trump Jr. responded, “It’s a great ham and egg.”
Most of those in the crowd that included acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, several Cabinet secretaries, and the leading anti-impeachment voices in the House, were focused on the impeachment hearings earlier in the day. And all said that they believed the Democrats didn’t land a killer blow.
Citing those, including Reps. Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Lee Zeldin, Matt Gaetz, and Sens. Rand Paul and John Cornyn, Trump Jr. said, “It is great to see this solidarity especially when you see the nonsense that’s really been going on for three years but has come to a climax today” with the hearings.
On his book tour, he said that supporters have urged a fighting stance with Democrats. “That’s what they want to see. That’s what they want to see from the Republicans. That’s what’s been missing for so long in so many cases.”
Others in the crowd sipping Budweisers, wine, and bourbon included the president’s pastor, Paula White-Cain and her husband, Journey member Jonathan Cain; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar; Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue; Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross; Lara Trump; Trump Jr.’s girlfriend and 2020 campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle; the ambassadors from Qatar, Bahrain, and Jordan; Sean Spicer, fresh from Dancing with the Stars; Trump Jr. advisers Sergio Gor, Arthur Schwartz, and Andrew Surabian; Rep. Andy Biggs; Katrina Pierson; incoming impeachment war room chiefs Pam Bondi and Tony Sayegh; Kellyanne Conway; Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith, Tim Scott, and Ted Cruz; pollster Frank Luntz; White House aides Avi Berkowitz, Cassidy Dumbauld, and Jessica Ditto; White House legal counsel Pat Cipollone; and the media’s Joe Kernan, Boris Epshteyn, and Sebastian Gorka.

Noah Bookbinder: The evidence of wrongdoing by Trump is overwhelming

Texto completo: Impeachment is a constitutional procedure that should be reserved only for extraordinary times with the most extreme examples of abuse of power by a president. That is why, in our country’s history, only two presidents have been impeached.
But this is one of those times.
The evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is overwhelming. The impeachment inquiry has been conducted so far in a sober, responsible way. As Wednesday’s hearing made clear, the witnesses are credible and clear, and the story they tell is alarming. All members of Congress are now compelled to listen to the witnesses and independently determine whether the president’s conduct warrants impeachment.
Mr. Trump used the immense powers of the American presidency to pressure an ally to open investigations that would help him personally. That much is clear just from the call memo of the July 25 conversation between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Any American who has not read the call memo should do so, because it is as shocking today to realize that Mr. Trump said the jaw-dropping phrase, “I would like you to do us a favor,” as it was the day it was released. He followed that by expressing his desire for Ukraine to investigate the 2016 election and the Bidens. That is sufficient in itself to prove unacceptable wrongdoing by the president.
But the Nov. 13 testimony made clear that it goes much further. Two respected public servants — Ambassador William Taylor, an experienced diplomat and a decorated Vietnam War veteran, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department official overseeing European and Eurasian affairs — testified that the president and his personal attorney sought politically motivated investigations by the Ukrainian government into former Vice President Joseph Biden and allegations concerning the 2016 election (the latter references an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukrainians, not Russians, were behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, and the Ukrainians framed the Russian government to make it look like that country was working with Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign).
Mr. Kent testified that the undercutting of dedicated career foreign service officers in Ukraine did great damage to our national security. Mr. Taylor testified that, from his experiences over several months, he developed a clear understanding that, at the direction of the president, nearly $400 million in taxpayer funded military aid and the powerful optics of a White House meeting were conditioned on a public announcement of investigations personally helpful to Mr. Trump’s re-election efforts.
Like Mr. Kent, Mr. Taylor also said that the president’s interference in our support of Ukraine for political purposes was deeply damaging to national security. Furthermore, he emphasized the potentially deadly costs of the delay in military support: Ukraine’s conflict with Russia has resulted in 14,000 casualties, and “more die each week” in fighting in the eastern part of the country.
Pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political rival is, alone, a potentially impeachable offense. But Mr. Trump’s effort to condition needed military and diplomatic aid on investigations helpful to his personal political interests may also constitute bribery as contemplated by the Constitution for the purpose of impeachment. It also likely violates criminal laws, including the federal bribery statute.
The president’s allies in the House tried to distract from the devastating facts against him, but they do not hold up to even the briefest scrutiny.
The claim that there could not have been serious wrongdoing because military aid to Ukraine was ultimately released and Ukraine did not begin the requested investigations is laughable. The aid was released only after Congress discovered it had been held up and began angrily asking about it and as the scandal was emerging. The reported statements of senior Ukrainian officials also indicate that Ukraine’s government had reluctantly decided to publicly announce these political investigations and was rescued only by this scandal’s public emergence.
As important, today Mr. Taylor revealed stunning new information. He said that a staff member of his witnessed Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, call Mr. Trump the day after his call with Mr. Zelensky and that the staff member heard Mr. Trump ask Mr. Sondland about the status of “the investigations” — which witnesses have testified was shorthand for inquiries into the Bidens and the origins of the investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Taylor testified that his staff member heard Mr. Sondland say Ukraine was moving forward on those investigations and that Mr. Sondland said that the president “cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.”
Similarly, President Zelensky’s statement that he did not feel pressured by Mr. Trump is hardly a silver bullet, given that he made it while seated next to the president at the United Nations. In fact, the evidence as a whole showed that the pressure worked and that Ukraine’s efforts to avoid getting embroiled in politicized investigations pushed by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were unsuccessful, and that Russia stands to potentially benefit from the interruption of United States-Ukraine relations (through, for example, a break in security support). Critically, Mr. Zelensky still has not received a White House meeting.
Finally, efforts to dismiss or smear witnesses testifying at the hearings ring hollow. Some of these witnesses’ testimony is firsthand, others is secondhand, as you would expect from anyone with knowledge of a piece of a multipart story. But their motivations are unimpeachable, their statements are clear, and when taken together, the account they have provided is devastating.
Members of Congress must listen closely to what these witnesses are saying: President Trump used the power of his office to pressure a struggling ally to conduct investigations for his own personal, political benefit.
They will face a vote as consequential to American democracy as any they have taken. The testimony spoken in these hearings, and the facts outlined by these witnesses, must be their only guide when they take that vote.
Not to do so is to allow the president to succeed in damaging our democracy.

Twitter bots spread fake news about Ky. election

Texto completo: As the final votes trickled in during last week's Kentucky gubernatorial election, a network of automated Twitter accounts suddenly sprang into action.
They spread misinformation about the election being rigged, according to the CEO of a company that tracks political misinformation on social media.
Gideon Blocq, the founder and CEO of VineSight, told The Courier Journal his company witnessed thousands of accounts with "bot-like" automated behavior spreading misinformation about the race, including a screenshot of a tweet by one account claiming to have destroyed ballots with votes for incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.
"Immediately at the end of the counting of the votes, these stories started popping up in parallel, all about the election being rigged," Block said.
One of the tweets spreading the furthest came from user @Overlordkraken1, which tweeted at 8:39 p.m. he had "just shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots," adding "Bye bye Bevin." The tweet listed the user's location as Louisville, though it misspelled the word.
Bevin would end up losing to Democrat Andy Beshear by 5,189 votes, though the governor told supporters at 10 p.m. Tuesday that he would not concede the race, citing unspecified voting "irregularities."
The next day, Bevin requested an official recanvass of the vote, alleging widespread fraud and "thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted."
In a Courier Journal fact check of Bevin's claims, local elections officials refer to the allegations as "ridiculous" and "flatly not true."
The governor has not provided any proof for such claims, and spokespersons for his office and campaign have not responded to questions asking if this tweet plays into Bevin's allegations.
After being retweeted at least 91 times, the account was suspended — though Blocq said a screenshot of the tweet was then posted Tuesday night and "we saw huge bot networks just pushing it around."
While the suspended account was likely a real person just "trolling" with the shredding tweet, Blocq said "thousands" of bot accounts spread the screenshot in parallel with other tweets alleging that the election was rigged, showing "this is not a small operation ... it is not just one person doing this."
By early Wednesday, someone created a meme suggesting thousands of votes for Bevin were not counted because every other Republican candidate on the ballot did so well. That also spread rapidly among social media. For example, one Twitter account with more than 117,000 followers tweeted the meme along with the word "rigged!" which was retweeted more than 1,000 times over the next day, mostly by bot accounts.
Blocq said by Thursday evening, a simple search for the Kentucky election on Twitter would turn up tweets including the screenshot, meme and other claims about the election being rigged in its top results.
While the influence of Kremlin-backed groups to spread misinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign is well documented, Blocq said he could not determine the origin of the bot network pushing tweets about the Kentucky race, as he can only see publicly available data. However, he said that those working at Twitter would have more answers about the location of the bots.
Twitter told The New York Times this weekend that the spread of misinformation regarding the Kentucky race for governor largely appeared to originate in the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security tracks foreign interference in U.S. elections that exploits divisions through the spread of misinformation on social networks.
Bevin's requested recanvass will take place on Thursday, with voting officials in each county checking to make sure they transmitted the correct numbers to the secretary of state.
Republican state legislators have expressed skepticism that the recanvass will significantly change the official vote totals and warned against Bevin creating a "fishing expedition" by contesting the election in the legislature if that is the case.
Some legislators have also urged the governor to present evidence of fraud or voting irregularities to the public if he has any, saying making such claims without any proof undermines faith in the democratic system.
"Any attempt by Gov. Bevin to undermine these results in the legislature is wrong and should be viewed as a direct attack on the democratic process." state Sen. Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, said. "Once the recanvass is complete, the General Assembly must accept the outcome of this election and help Gov.-elect Beshear prepare for the 2020 budget."

Two patients in China treated for plague

Texto completo: Two patients in China were diagnosed with plague, the deadly and infectious disease tied to historic pandemics, local media reported.
The two people, from Inner Mongolia, were treated for pneumonic plague in Beijing's Chaoyang district, local health officials said Tuesday, according to Caixin and state-media Xinhua.
The news outlets reported the patients received "proper treatment," and disease control measures and prevention methods have been taken.
According to Caixin, the patients were treated at Chaoyang Hospital, which has since replaced all chairs in its emergency room.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the patients were quickly isolated and health officials investigated everyone who could have been exposed to them, The New York Times reported.
Chinese health officials also called the risk for further infections "extremely low."
Pneumonic plague is one of three forms of the infectious disease and the only one that can be transmitted from person to person by inhaling infected droplets – for example, spread when someone breathes in cough droplets from an infected person.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls pneumonic plague the "most serious form of the disease." All three forms are caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium.
Earlier this year, a Mongolian couple died from the bubonic plague after eating raw marmot meat. The case sparked a quarantine in the area for days, but no additional cases appeared to have been reported.
A person is infected with bubonic or septicemic plague usually via infected flea bite or handling infected meat. Either form of plague can develop into pneumonic plague if they go untreated and spread to the lungs, the CDC says.
Fever, headache, weakness and rapidly developing pneumonia are all symptoms of pneumonic plague, the CDC says.

Report: DeSantis and Parnas had scheduled meeting

Texto completo: Indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas had a meeting scheduled with Gov. Ron DeSantis in January after he was sworn in, Politico reported.
DeSantis spokesman Helen Ferre said the meeting was "political" and put on the calendar by former GOP consultant Susie Wiles, Politico reported, but WIles said she had nothing to do with it. Ferre also told Politico that although a meeting was scheduled, "no substantive meeting occurred."
The report is the latest revelation about DeSantis's connections with the Soviet-born businessman, who himself is now caught up in the Ukraine scandal enveloping Washington.
Parnas and his associate Igor Fruman were arrested in October on charges of funneling foreign cash into U.S. elections.
They donated $50,000 to DeSantis's political committee, which DeSantis ordered to be given to the U.S. Treasury. When first asked about the men, Ferre had said DeSantis had never met "one-on-one" with the two.
But pictures and videos of Parnas and Fruman with DeSantis at his election night celebration party in Orlando soon surfaced, including one where he hugs Fruman. That was soon followed by photos of Parnas with DeSantis at campaign rallies in Boca Raton and South Daytona the weekend before the election.
Ferre later said DeSantis at least never met with Parnas or Fruman while in office as governor. But additional photos showed Parnas and Fruman in a VIP area at DeSantis's inauguration, and on Tuesday came the revelation that a meeting was at least scheduled while DeSantis was in office.
The Washington Post reported Parnas is telling associates he discussed Ukraine at a donor's meeting with President Trump in 2018, in which they suggested the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine was "unfriendly to the president and his interests."
"Trump immediately suggested that then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who had been in the Foreign Service for 32 years and served under Democratic and Republican presidents, should be fired," the Post reported.
Parnas also reportedly went to the Ukraine to deliver the president's demand of an inquiry into former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, the New York Times reports, the very issue that led to Democrats launching an impeachment inquiry.

Texto completo: When and where: Wednesday night at the Duquesne Club, Downtown.
What do you do when acclaimed chef and restaurateur Daniel Boulud, best known for Daniel, his two-Michelin-star restaurant in New York City, comes for dinner? Well, if you are the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden, you roll out the red carpet and set up a French-inspired feast (complete with baguettes in their own little paper sleeves).
"He was very happy when we asked him to be a part of this," said garden executive director Keith Kaiser. "He said all of his friends had been invited to this event, so he was glad to be a part of it, as well." The event, brainchild of planner Nancy Byrnes, arose out of the desire to connect people to the plants around them through food. "It started from thinking of the poetry of garden to table. We aimed high and it worked," she said. The event, which in past years has welcomed six world-renowned chefs, including Ina Garten and Thomas Keller, attracts people from all walks of life to participate.
"I'm from Paris, and I've always wanted to meet him," said Frederic Rongier, owner of Paris 66 and Gaby et Jules. "To meet someone who has a Michelin Star is like meeting a pilot who has been to the moon. I just love his work." Guests mingled with Mr. Boulud and checked out the silent auction before dispersing into various rooms inside the Club for a decadent three-course meal, featuring lamb from local Elysian Farms and rainbow trout expertly crafted by the talented staff at the Duquesne Club and Andrew Garbarino of the Twisted Frenchmen. Afterward, a decadent dessert buffet was waiting for guests, including Grand Marnier souffles, A519 Chocolates, macarons, dark chocolate mousse cups and artisanal cheeses. It was hedonistic in the best possible way and oh-so-French.
And now a moment with . chef Daniel Boulud: I heard that you had hoped to cook for tonight's event. What would you have made? Of course, lamb from Pennsylvania. Quail, trout . something seasonal that would resonate with the location and the people. Does having a Michelin star affect you and your cooking?I'm blessed to be a chef and blessed that people like my cooking.We all work so hard so that our customer has the very best experience. I always keep my customer in mind. It's rewarding and a compliment to have the star, but it is more important that the people who work with me feel that commitment to excellence. That star motivates us forward. Food is about connection. How do you connect to the world around you through the cuisine that you create? It is all about my home, my travels. Who I am cooking for and what they love. It's all about the wine we drink with the meal. How does this all interplay and how can we have the very best experience? That is what connects me.

Also at the party was former New York Times food critic, author, and judge of "Top Chef Masters" Ruth Reichl, who flew in from New York City to surprise her friend, Mr. Boulud. "I'm extremely proud to know him," she said. "Daniel has always shown up for others so the least I could do was show up for him."

Texto completo: James Holzhauer, the professional sports gambler who took the "Jeopardy!" world by storm this year, is gearing up to compete Thursday night in the game show's "Tournament of Champions" finals.
So is Emma Boettcher, the user-experience librarian who beat Holzhauer in June.
What is: the rematch of the century?
Returning for "Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions," Holzhauer secured a spot in the finals after winning his semi-final round Tuesday night, and Boettcher did the same Monday night. The third finalist will be decided Wednesday night.
"Jeopardy!" audiences first met Holzhauer this spring, when his 32-game winning streak captivated the country before Boettcher bested him on the June 3 episode.
James Holzhauer is (finally) unseatedas 'Jeopardy!' champion: how did it all come down?
The final clue that day: "The line, 'A great reckoning in a little room' in 'As You Like It' is usually taken to refer to this author's premature death. (For those non-English majors, "Who is Kit Marlowe?" was the correct response. )
Boettcher went into the final question $3,200 ahead of Holzhauer. He bet only $1,399, bringing his total for the day to $24,799. She bet $20,201. Her scoreboard flashed a total of $46,801 as Holzhauer walked over to high five his successor.
Over the course of his long run, Holzhauer took home a total of $2,464,216, including $2,000 for his second-place finish to new champ Boettcher. He came up just $56,484 shy of besting the all-time record set by Ken Jennings for non-tournament play.
“Nobody likes to lose,” Holzhauer said in an interview with the New York Times published Monday. “But I’m very proud of how I did, and I really exceeded my own expectations for the show. So I don’t feel bad about it. ”
Who is Emma Boettcher, the 'Jeopardy!' contestant who dethroned James Holzhauer?
Since Boettcher's victory, Holzhauer has also been vocal against those critical of her, who speculated her win was just luck or a result of Holzhauer throwing the game.
In a statement released in June by Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, Holzhauer credited Boettcher, who "dominated her warmup games that day. "

Texto completo: Nikki Haley used to be known as the other member of President Trump's Cabinet who left with an intact reputation (in addition to former Defense Secretary James Mattis). In an administration more influenced by Recep Tayyip Erdogan than Ronald Reagan, the United Nations ambassador often provided a more traditional rhetorical take on American foreign policy. She seemed genuinely to care about human rights and democracy, and to somehow get away with displaying such caring in public. Her confidence in national principles marked her as such a freakish exception that some speculated she might be the rogue, anti-Trump Trump official who wrote an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times.
But Trump's corruption still pulls at a distance. Clearly convinced that Trumpism is here to stay, Haley has publicly turned against other officials in the administration who saw the president as a dangerous fool. She recounts an hourlong meeting with then-chief of staff John Kelly and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who "confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country." The conspirators (in Haley's telling) considered it a life-and-death matter. "This was how high the stakes were, he and Kelly told me. We are doing the best we can do to save the country, they said. We need you to work with us and help us do it."
Haley, by her own account, refused to help. "Instead of saying that to me, they should've been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan," she now explains. "It should've been, 'Go tell the president what your differences are, and quit if you don't like what he's doing.' But to undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing."
Here Haley is confusing two categories. If a Cabinet member has a policy objection of sufficient seriousness, he or she should take that concern to the president. If the president then chooses against their position - and if implementing the decision would amount to a violation of conscience - an official should resign. Staying in office to undermine, say, a law or war you disapprove of would be a disturbing arrogation of presidential authority.
But there is an equally important moral priority to consider: If you are a national security official working for a malignant, infantile, impulsive, authoritarian wannabe, you need to stay in your job as long as you can to mitigate whatever damage you can, before the mad king tires of your sanity and fires you.
This paradox is one tragic outcome of Trumpism. It is generally a bad and dangerous idea for appointed officials to put their judgment above an elected official's. And yet it would have been irresponsible for Mattis, Kelly, Tillerson and others not to follow their own judgments in cases where an incompetent, delusional or corrupt president was threatening the national interest.
Consider the case of former White House counsel Don McGahn. According to the Mueller report, McGahn complained to then-chief of staff Reince Priebus that Trump was trying to get him to "do crazy s--t." McGahn (thankfully) told investigators he ignored presidential orders he took to be illegal.
Or consider a negative illustration. When it came to pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the only morally mature adults in the room (and on the phone) were quite junior in rank. They expressed their concerns upward. But those above them - Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney - had learned the lesson about officials fired for an excess of conscience. They apparently looked the other way as a friendly country was squeezed for political reasons.
On the whole, I'm glad that responsible officials such as Kelly and Mattis stayed as long as they did to prevent damage to the country. But I also think they have a moral obligation to come out before the 2020 election and say what they know about Trump's unfitness. If Biden is the nominee, they might even get together and endorse him. But, in any case, if they believe Trump is a danger to the national interest, they eventually have a duty to say something. Saving the country requires no less.
As for Haley, she has now signaled to Trump Republicans that she was not a part of the deep state, thus clearing away a barrier to ambition. All she had to do was to ignore her conscience, betray her colleagues and injure her country. A small price to pay for such a brilliant political future.

Texto completo: The only catch? You have to leave tomorrow. What would you say?
For 28-year-old Austin resident Alex Leonard, the answer was easy.
“I’d go to Stockholm. Wait, why would anyone not do it?”
That answer and all the adventures that came after are captured in a viral YouTube video, titled “2 Strangers Swap Lives Across the World for 72hrs!!” It has been viewed more than 1.6 million times since it was uploaded in September.
Those two strangers in Zilker Park were Matt Dajer and Ammar Kandil, co-founders of Yes Theory, a YouTube channel with more than 4.4 million subscribers that encourages people to break out of their day-to-day routines and “seek discomfort,” the team’s official tagline.
A lot of Yes Theory’s videos are travel challenges with titles like “I Took My Pizza Delivery Guy Around the World” and “I Spent 24 Hours in Korea with No Money.” Their most high-profile escapades include persuading Will Smith to bungee jump out of a helicopter and pranking the internet with a fake photo of Justin Bieber eating a burrito the wrong way.
As you might have guessed by now, Leonard wasn’t just getting a free trip to Sweden. He was swapping lives with a stranger he’d never met — one who would hanging out with his friends for the rest of the weekend in Austin.
Like most YouTube creators, Dajer, Kandil and their third partner, Thomas Brag, live in Los Angeles. Brag, who was born in France to Swedish parents, thought it would be fun to show a stranger around his ancestors’ homeland. The group chose Austin for the video’s sister city mostly because they weren’t familiar with the Texas capital.
“We wanted a city where we could really take someone into the ‘real America,’ not the one that many tourists see on the coasts,” Brag said in an email to the American-Statesman. “So it was both an opportunity for us to learn about a new part of the country we live in, while also bringing a Swede to a place very foreign to him or her.”
The main goal of the project — like many of Yes Theory’s filmed escapades — was to quash stereotypes about different cultures.
“By being able to experience a totally different culture from our own, we come back to where we came from with a newfound perspective of the world, an open heart and mind and a whole bunch of new friends,” Brag said.
Brag warns at the very beginning of the video (and later reiterated by email) that he sees Swedes as culturally introverted. He assumed he’d have trouble finding a volunteer in Stockholm to take on their challenge. Yet the very first person he approached, 28-year-old motivational speaker and “professional dreamer” Staffan Taylor, said yes immediately.
Meanwhile, it took Dajer and Kandil almost eight hours in Austin to find a willing participant, though they had assumed they’d find a stereotypically outgoing American volunteer.
Right away, Leonard and Taylor stepped into each other’s shoes.
For Leonard, that meant heading straight from a 17-hour travel day to his new quarters at K9, a glitzy co-living and co-working space that was the subject of a New York Times profile this year, where he was expected to deliver a speech to his housemates. About 50 residents live in the downtown Stockholm building, which features communal lounge and work space, as well as tiny dorm rooms with pod-like beds. Every Sunday, the community gathers, and anyone can take the microphone to speak on a subject of their choice. Taylor, a public speaker by trade, had signed up, and so Leonard filled his spot.
“I’ve spoken in front of maybe 20 people or so, and it’s usually a disaster,” Leonard said. “I just don’t deal well with that. But for some reason, as soon as we got onstage, everyone was so receptive to us being there that it made me feel super, super welcomed, super comfortable.”
With limited time for preparation, Leonard told the audience about his career as a physical therapist in Austin, his preparation for a 24-hour rock climbing competition and why he said “yes” to this spur-of-the-moment adventure.
“I think the reason why maybe I said ‘yes,’ is because I’m very international as it is,” he said. “I’m half French, half Venezuelan, as well. I’ve lived in both countries before moving to Texas, so right away people got excited about that because we had South Americans in the room and we had French people in the room.”
After the speech, Leonard mingled with his new housemates, then went to what Brag described to him as the ultimate Swedish tradition: a so-called “crayfish party.”
“They eat crawfish and sing songs and drink a lot of schnapps,” Leonard said. “They’re all super excited to show me crawfish and teach me how to crack the crawfish, because they didn’t know anyone else really ate crawfish (outside
of Sweden). I felt terribly guilty because I’m allergic to shellfish, I couldn’t eat any of it.”
Leonard is vegan but gave himself a pass for the trip so he could enjoy his hosts’ delicacies: Swedish meatballs, a potato dish with steak, a quiche-like cheese dish. And the drink of choice, “schnapps” (sometimes spelled “snaps” or “schapps”), isn’t quite the same as what Americans might know by that name.
“It’s not like peppermint schnapps,” Leonard said. “What it is, or what they told me at least, is like a vodka, with spice or different herbs.”
They kept drinking schnapps throughout the night, as they attended a professional soccer game between the Swedish national team and their biggest rival, Norway. Exhausted and jetlagged, Leonard slept easily in his pod bed that night.
Back in Austin, Taylor had to step into Leonard’s active, on-the-go lifestyle, despite a recent knee injury. He spent Saturday at the Texas-LSU football game and tailgate — probably the most American and Texan thing one could do — and then it was an early wake-up to meet members of RAW Running, Leonard’s running group, for a long run on Sunday morning.
The knee injury prevented Taylor from running a full 10-mile loop around the Butler Hike and Bike Trail, but his new teammates were game for a slow mile jog before literally picking him up and carrying him to the finish — which made for a fun outtake in the video.
The group gave Taylor a quintessential outdoors experience by hanging out at Barton Springs Pool, grabbing lunch at vegan hotspot Casa de Luz and canoeing around Lady Bird Lake.
“He was the perfect Alex replacement,” said David Roses, one of Leonard’s running friends. “Staffan is a freakin’ bundle of positivity, and it was a blast hanging out with him. We talk all the time — I just Snapchatted him earlier.”
There was just one more surprise planned for Taylor before he headed home. The Yes Theory crew arranged for him to give a speech to a group of entrepreneurial students at the University of Texas, fulfilling the Swede’s dream to speak to a group of Americans.
“I always wanted to get my words out there, and here I am, able to send out my positivity and the kindness,” Taylor said in the video, wiping tears of joy from his eyes. “I am super happy.”
Leonard’s trip to Sweden ended with a walking tour of Stockholm and a sunset pontoon ride, complete with “Texas-style” burgers on the grill.
The Austinite never actually got to meet the man who lived his life for two days, but they’ve chatted back and forth on Instagram. He thinks they’d get along just fine.
“I would take him out to face his fears through some type of physical activity — maybe climbing or skating — and I’m pretty sure he would want to do something social to push my boundaries. High-fiving strangers, speaking in public,” Leonard said of his Yes Theory counterpart. “I think we’d push each other out of our comfort zones.”
Taylor has parlayed his Yes Theory experience into several TV appearances in Sweden and more public speaking gigs. Leonard says his trip has had a positive impact on his physical therapy clients, and — he hopes — on himself.
“Over there, I just felt a lot more outgoing and more open to meeting people and just being spontaneous,” he said. “Keeping that positive, open mentality going is the challenge that I’ve set for myself. I have to keep that ball rolling.”

Texto completo: Bill Gates, one of the world's richest people, has given away $ 50 billion of his fortune. He talked with Andrew Ross Sorkin about politics, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , family and his friendship with Warren Buffett in a wide-ranging conversation. This report has been edited and condensed. There has been a question about the idea that vast fortunes in this country are able to be moved from the private sector into a foundation without paying tax. So the shares of Microsoft that you were able to generate, the shares that Warren Buffett was able to generate, there's no capital gains on that, there's no step-up on that. And so the U.S. taxpayer -- the U.S. citizen -- it's not clear that they are beneficiaries of your success, to the extent you believe that they should be. What do you think of that? Would you ever be in favor of taxing philanthropy in that way of some sort?
We can raise taxes in a lot of ways, including, you know, making some gifts to foundations more taxed. We have a lot of room. The current thinking is not either in terms of encouraging philanthropy or discouraging and forming new business. We're not close to the limit ... And it is important to separate out the question of should rich people pay more in taxes. The answer is yes.
For whatever remainder of money they have left over, I do think philanthropy is a good thing. I think it plays -- that 2 percent of the economy -- plays a role that neither the private sector nor the government are able to do in terms of various innovative approaches to, say, malaria, or nutrition, or trying out new models of education through things like charter schools. But what do you think of this larger idea that underneath all of this you hear people who say, "There shouldn't be billionaires in society," that if you really understand what this wealth tax is about ... In fact, one of our authors at The New York Times describes it almost as a cigarette tax, with the ultimate goal of there being less of it.
Maybe I'm just too biased to think that if you create a company that's super valuable, that at least some part of that you should be able to have a little bit for consumption, and hopefully the balance to do philanthropic things. Now there are people who think that politically those fortunes being used for things like lobbying or giving to candidates, that that's tilting the playing field.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The last election was not, or at least the presidential piece was not, a money-driven phenomenon. The candidate who spent more did not win in that case. But I agree, the First Amendment wasn't designed at a time when rich people could essentially buy this big megaphone. I choose not to participate in large political donations. There are times it might feel tempting to do so, and there are other people who choose to do so, but I just don't want to grab that gigantic megaphone. Let me ask you a personal question. I just wonder, on a very personal level, when you think about your own life, how you can be Bill Gates out there in the world, and then how you can be the Bill Gates that you are in private, and how you think about that, and how you maybe even can find some space between the two.
Well, part of it is that you limit the amount of time you go out into the world, because it's a little distortive. And you have people around you, like Warren Buffett or my wife, Melinda, who, you know, if I come back and I look like I'm all puffed up, they cut me down to size a little bit. And I do the dishes ... Do you?
Absolutely. You do the dishes?
I drive kids to school. I have kids that think I don't see the world in a modern-enough way, including even some technology things they use that they find it amazing.
Like what?
Oh, I'm not as phone-centric as they are. I mean, I have to tell myself, oh, I've got to check Instagram because my youngest daughter likes to communicate there. Or I have to check WhatsApp because another child likes to communicate through that. It's, like, oh my God, I have to do all this. But, you know, if I forget to do it, then it's, like, "Wow, you're not paying attention to my life." I like to read email, and it bugs them that I'm so email-centric, and that I'm very large-screen oriented.
So just take today. Today I got to meet a top scientist working on solving malnutrition. So I get a huge benefit when I go out in public of these interactions, of how can we drive things forward.
So the idea that, O.K., I give up some privacy in certain settings -- as long as it's not when I'm with my kids, it's fine; it's part of the deal.
What's the coolest technology or thing that makes you the most optimistic?
The thing that is the most amazing is that part of the reason poor countries have such a tight time is that over 40 percent of the kids there never develop either their physical body or their brain. Because of malnourishment from an early age, they have very low I.Q., very low physical capacity. And so in Africa that's over 40 percent of the kids. And it's never been understood why.
It's not like starvation -- they are getting enough food. Their twin brother is on their growth path and they're not. We've discovered -- the foundation's researchers we fund -- that you get inflammation in your stomach that relates to the bacterial species, the so-called microbiome. And so we are in trials right now with very low-cost things that can get rid of that inflammation and allow the kid to get back on their growth path.
And so not only will less kids die -- because kids on their growth path are a third as likely to die from pneumonia or diarrhea or malaria -- but also as the kids survive, their ability to learn and do work. Every society has benefited from food input -- you got more and more protein, and so less kids had malnourishment. Here we can short-circuit that, and even in very poor countries we can essentially get rid of malnutrition. That -- I mean, I get to work on a lot of cool things -- that is the most cool thing I'm working on. Can you just tell us about this friendship with Warren Buffett? And I've gotten to see you guys together, but the reason I ask is it's kind of a coincidence of sorts that two of the wealthiest people in the world become best friends. And I'm not sure it has anything to do with the money, but maybe I'm wrong.
No, certainly not. And I didn't even want to meet Warren because I thought, hey, this guy buys himself things, and so he found imperfections in terms of markets. That's not value-added to society; that's a zero-sum game that is almost parasitic. That was my view before I met him.
And, no, he wasn't going to tell me about inventing something. But then I meet him, and I realize that everything he does is based on a framework of the world where he's judging -- judging markets, judging people, judging how things work, in a very deep way. And so he asks me questions about Microsoft, like, "Why can't IBM crush you in a second?" That is the world's most obvious question, and nobody had ever asked me before.
And so I got to ask him about newspapers, and retailers, and good investments, bad investments, and how he figured all that out. And I realized we both -- although we come from different places -- we're both trying to model the world and what goes on. And the world, I have to say, has been even more fascinating in some unexpected ways than when we first became friends.
A number of things Warren and I call each other up and go, "Oh my God, can you believe what's going on? This is so interesting. Unexpected. What the hell's going to happen?" We can talk forever because we're both trying to figure it out.

Texto completo: The document on Moscow's meddling in British politics prepared by Parliament last year is becoming a hot issue as bits and pieces begin to leak out.
LONDON -- Russia's influence in British politics has resurfaced as a potentially explosive issue in the country's general election, with Hillary Clinton joining a parade of critics in castigating Prime Minister Boris Johnson for withholding a secret parliamentary report on Russia until after Britain goes to the polls.
Mr. Johnson's decision to delay the politically sensitive report until after the Dec. 12 election has not prevented the leak of unsavory details, which, if confirmed, would paint a damning portrait of Russian oligarchs funneling money to Conservative Party politicians.
By adding her voice, Mrs. Clinton, whose presidential bid in 2016 was undermined by systematic Russian interference, could thrust the dispute over Russia to the center of the campaign.
"Who do they think they are that they would keep information like that from the public, especially before an election?" Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper. "Well, I'll tell you who they think they are. They think that they are the all-powerful, strong men who should be ruling."
Based on the details that have emerged so far, the report could end up being less damaging than Downing Street's refusal to release it. The veil of secrecy has spawned conspiracy theories, as well as criticism that it deprives British voters of vital information about Russian meddling before another election.
"It's certainly pertinent to an election," Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general who was chairman of the parliamentary committee that compiled the report, said last week on Sky News. "There has been a lot of disquiet about the possibility of Russian interference, and part of our report looks at that."
It is not clear that Russia is planning to meddle in the Dec. 12 election as it did in 2016 in the United States or the 2016 referendum on Brexit. The short-fuse nature of the vote -- Mr. Johnson won Parliament's approval to hold it only in late October -- would make it difficult for Russia to mount a full-scale social-media campaign, election experts said.
Still, the lack of evidence of an election operation does not mean Britain is not still vulnerable to Russian interference. Delaying the report, critics say, leaves British voters in the dark about the nature and gravity of the threat.
"We don't know how serious it is," said Bronwen Maddox, the director of the Institute for Government, a think tank in London. "That's the value of the report -- it would tell us. They should have published it."
In the United States, the report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provided a vivid road map of how Russia mounted a sophisticated operation to flood Facebook and other social-media outlets with messages in favor of the Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, and against Mrs. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton, who was in London on a book tour with her daughter, Chelsea, said she planned to keep highlighting the issue.
"Someone said to me, 'Quit with the Russians,"' she said to The Guardian. "I said, 'I'll quit with the Russians when the Russians quit with us.' That's how I feel."
In Britain, the secret report has become fodder on the campaign trail. Mr. Grieve, who was purged from the Conservative Party after clashing over Brexit with Mr. Johnson, said the government had no valid reasons for delaying its release. He said it fit into a pattern of spreading "propaganda and disinformation."
Mr. Johnson's ministers attributed the delay to the need for normal vetting and other procedures, not to any political motives. They also denied that Russian money was backing the Conservative Party's campaign, which is built around securing a swift exit from the European Union.
"No Russian money is pulling the strings of this election," the chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, said in an interview with the BBC. "I'm very confident about how we're funded and we're very transparent about that."
Still, new questions about the party's funding sources bubbled up after The Sunday Times reported on Nov. 10 that the parliamentary report named nine wealthy Russians who gave money to the Conservatives. It was not clear, the paper said, whether the Russians were listed in the public section of the report or a classified annex, which is not scheduled to be released at any time.
It is illegal in Britain for campaigns to accept money from abroad, but there is no law against taking funds from wealthy Russians who have established residency in the country.
Some links between Russians and Conservative Party figures are well established. In April 2018, Mr. Johnson, who was then Britain's foreign secretary, was photographed at an airport in Italy after traveling to a weekend party at a converted castle owned by a Russian-British press baron, Evgeny Lebedev.
Mr. Johnson traveled without the security detail normally assigned to the foreign secretary, and fellow passengers told The Guardian that Mr. Johnson looked as though "he had slept in his clothes." He did not comment on the purpose of the trip. Mr. Lebedev, the son of Alexander Lebedev, a one-time KGB intelligence officer, is a majority owner of The Evening Standard and The Independent.
Among those who testified before Parliament's Intelligence and Security committee was William F. Browder, a London-based, American-born financier who fell afoul of the Russian government and has campaigned against its corruption of foreign officials. He painted a picture of Russian influence that goes beyond any single party to permeate the entire British establishment.
Mr. Browder cited the case of Peter Goldsmith, a lawyer who served as attorney general in the Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr. Goldsmith, Mr. Browder said, was retained by the lawyer for a Russian oligarch who was trying to avoid being sanctioned by the European Parliament.
President Vladimir V. Putin "has deployed vast resources from criminal proceeds, as well as misappropriation of assets from the regime's opponents and random victims, to fund and develop a non-Russian, Western 'buffer network' which has enabled the Russian state to infiltrate UK society and to conceal the underlying Russian controllers and their agendas," he said in written testimony, which was first reported by CNN and obtained by The New York Times.
In an interview, Mr. Browder said the government's decision was self-defeating. "From a P.R. strategy, it's pretty dumb," he said. "If they release it, they would get a day's worth of bad headlines. Now, there are these conspiracy theories running around in London."
In 2016, there was evidence that Russia tried to tip the referendum in favor of Britain leaving the European Union. More than 150,000 Russian-language Twitter accounts posted tens of thousands of messages in English urging people to vote "leave." In an echo of the Russian campaign in the United States, many of those messages stoked fears about Muslims and other immigrants.
There was already some evidence of troubling activity in this election, said Martin Innes, the director of the crime and security research institute at Cardiff University. But he said it was difficult to determine who was behind it.
"Given the current political situation in the U.K., there is a clear opportunity for a disinformation actor to further their geopolitical interests by destabilizing the European Union or destabilizing NATO," Mr. Innes said.
The political dynamics this time are somewhat different. Mr. Johnson has promised a swift Brexit, which would appeal to Russia, given its desire to weaken the European Union. But Mr. Johnson also favors close ties to the United States. His opponent, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, might delay or even reverse Brexit. But he, too, is a euroskeptic and would be likely to keep Washington at arm's length.
"The unanswered question is whether in the Russian calculation, Britain is worth running an interference operation for," said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a form that specializes in mapping social media.
Given that the referendum has already happened, he said, "you could envisage a scenario where the conclusion is 'Let them get on with it."'

Texto completo: Readers react to columns by Charles M. Blow and Bret Stephens about the former New York City mayor's possible entry into the race.
To the Editor:
Re "You Must Never Vote for Bloomberg" (column, Nov. 11):
Charles M. Blow's diatribe against Michael R. Bloomberg is a perfect example of why American progressives almost never succeed in electing anybody.
At the end of three terms of Mr. Bloomberg's mayoralty in New York City, The New York Times said: "The crime rate is down, the transportation system is more efficient, the environment is cleaner." All good reasons for people of any color to consider his candidacy for president.
And I largely agree with Mr. Blow's opposition to stop-and-frisk, but it was not a "terror campaign" against young black and Hispanic men; it was an overreaction to gun violence, which, like mandatory sentencing for drug offenses, had racist consequences that were not anticipated when the program was begun.
Please, progressives, do the electoral math: If you take all those who wouldn't vote for Elizabeth Warren because of "Medicare for all," and all those who wouldn't vote for Pete Buttigieg because he's gay, and add those who wouldn't vote for Mr. Bloomberg because of stop-and-frisk, your sum is likely a Trump victory.
David Berman
New York
To the Editor:
Charles M. Blow says "never vote for Bloomberg" because of a complete and nonnegotiable deal breaker, his expansion of stop-and-frisk. That's foolish. Everyone has done something we can hate.
If we eliminate all candidates we believe to have committed a nonnegotiable deal breaker, we will re-elect a man who has committed a thousand nonnegotiable deal breakers. This election is not a process of elimination.
Ted Tsomides
Raleigh, N.C.
To the Editor:
I recognize the pain and suffering caused by Michael Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk policy as mayor of New York. If he runs for president, he will have to address this legacy directly. I would, however, challenge Charles M. Blow's assertion that no black or brown people should ever vote for him.
Mr. Bloomberg's legacy includes many extraordinary efforts that have revolutionized global health efforts worldwide and disproportionately improved the lives of black and brown people. Specifically, his ban on trans fats caused a drop in heart attacks, and his smoking ban helped create a 33 percent drop in smoking.
By the end of his mayoralty, New Yorkers had a three-year longer life span than when he began. His initiatives have had a positive domino effect across global health to this day.
I would love to know how many people -- black, brown, white or otherwise -- are alive today because of policies he put in place as mayor of New York.
Elanna Lazar

To the Editor:
I admire and appreciate Charles M. Blow's passion, but really? If I support Michael R. Bloomberg for president, you want nothing to do with me? Very harsh.

To the Editor:
Re "Run, Mike, Run!," by Bret Stephens (column, Nov. 9):
As a New Yorker, I'm no fan of Michael R. Bloomberg. He sullied the streets of my beloved city with bikes, drove rents skyward and has a penchant for telling people how to live their lives. But politically he's as centrist as it gets, and that's what the country needs.
Pushing the political pendulum to the far left will only provide the potential energy necessary to swing it back to the far right a few years from now. A Bloomberg presidency would be a victory for moderates of every stripe, and extremists on both sides would be left without a voice, as they should be.
For the life of me I can't understand why Mr. Bloomberg wants this aggravation, but he's hard-working, financially independent, and he'll tame the National Rifle Association.
On the other hand he's no socialist, and he probably thinks that being "woke" is what he pays his butler for.
He's got my vote.

Norman Myers, 85; Warned About Threats to the Environment Long Before People Were Listening

Texto completo: He lobbied governments and wrote books, papers and articles to alert the public to looming disasters like mass extinction well before they were common knowledge.
The British conservationist Norman Myers drew public attention to mass extinction, disappearing habitats and environmental refugees long before they became common topics in the news and causes of widespread concern.
Dr. Myers, an ecological consultant who died on Oct. 20 at 85, lobbied politicians, companies and organizations and wrote or helped write nearly 20 books and hundreds of articles in scholarly journals and newspapers that posited groundbreaking ideas, many of which were later supported by further research.
Many of his books and articles were based on examinations of published work rather than on field work of his own. This perspective allowed him to ask questions and make inferences that other researchers might have missed. But it also opened him to criticism that his conclusions were based on insufficient evidence.
Dr. Myers responded to his critics by arguing that the potential for ecological catastrophe made it all the more important that he publicize troubling discoveries. In an essay in The Guardian in 1992, he inveighed against "the established approach," which "has required scientists not to publish or otherwise present their findings until they have a high degree of certainty."
"This approach, productive as it has long been, is less appropriate in a world subject to severe environmental injury," he continued. "If we wait until we achieve certainty about the greenhouse effect, for instance, it will be too late to do much about the problem."
In his book "The Sinking Ark" (1979), Dr. Myers raised the possibility that biologists were gravely underestimating the number of species that go extinct each year by overlooking insects and other invertebrates. Official estimates at the time put the number of extinctions at one per year; Dr. Myers thought it was closer to one per day.
Many scientists now agree that the rate of extinction is far higher than it has historically been. "The Sinking Ark" presaged later works like Elizabeth Kolbert's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History" (2014).
Dr. Myers and his colleagues proposed that biological "hot spots" -- relatively small habitats often threatened by human encroachment -- hold much of the earth's biodiversity, and that government subsidies for industries like energy and agriculture can harm the economy and the environment.
He was one of the earliest researchers to tie the disappearance of the rainforest to the world's growing demand for beef and the consequent need for more grazing land for cattle. He was also one of the first to note the displacement of large numbers of refugees because of environmental concerns. Scientists like Edward O. Wilson and Paul R. Ehrlich embraced some of Dr. Myers's theories.
Dr. Myers proposed pragmatic solutions to ecological problems -- ideas that could be counterintuitive and that sometimes outraged environmental activists. He once suggested that one way to protect the habitat of grazing animals in Africa would be to promote their harvesting as a food source so that local populations would become less reliant on farming and ranching, which destroy habitats.
"Disquieting as it may sound to foreigners, wildlife in Africa should be commercialized in many places -- exploited for every last nickel of income," Dr. Myers wrote in an article cited in The New York Times Magazine in 1982.
He also argued that many scientists should drop their pretense of objectivity and become active proponents for their work. He reached out to politicians like Al Gore and Margaret Thatcher. He worked as an adviser to the World Bank, the United Nations and other international agencies, and to the United States government.
"If scientists exercise 'professional propriety' about environmental problems by remaining silent about them because they lack conclusive evidence, their silence will often be misconstrued by political leaders: absence of evidence about a problem can be taken to mean evidence of absence of a problem," Dr. Myers wrote in 1992. "When politicians decide to do nothing, they decide to do a great deal in a world that is not standing still. To practice undue caution can be reckless."
Norman Myers was born on Aug. 24, 1934, on a farm in Whitewell, Lancashire, England. His father, John, was a farmer, and his mother, Gladys, was a teacher. The family moved to the nearby town of Clitheroe after his father became ill.
He attended Oxford University, where he studied German and French. In 1958, after graduating, he went to Kenya, where he became a colonial administrator and worked closely with Maasai tribesmen.
An avid long-distance runner, he sometimes accompanied the Maasai on daily jaunts of dozens of miles, and for a short time he held the record for the swiftest ascent and descent of Mount Kilimanjaro.
Dr. Myers became a teacher before Kenya declared independence from England in 1963, and in time he became a wildlife photographer. He spent long hours staking out wild animals, waiting for dramatic moments like lions pouncing on zebras at a watering hole. During the waits he devoured material about the species he was observing, and about biology and ecology in general.
"During five years I put myself through an undergraduate course in biology without realizing what I was doing," Dr. Myers said in 1999 to an interviewer from the University of California, Berkeley.
He entered graduate school at Berkeley and in 1973 completed an interdisciplinary doctorate, studying topics like wildlife management, demography, political science and international law.
He married Dorothy Halliman in 1965, and they separated in 1993 and divorced in 2012.
Dr. Myers died at a care facility in Oxford, England. His daughter Malindi Myers said the cause was Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease. In addition to her, he is survived by another daughter, Mara Yamauchi; a brother, John; and two grandchildren.
Dr. Myers's other books include "Perverse Subsidies: How Tax Dollars Can Undercut the Environment and the Economy," with Jennifer Kent, and "Hotspots: Earth's Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions," with Russell A. Mittermeier, Patricio R. Gil and Christina G. Mittermeier. In 2007, Time magazine named him a "hero of the environment."
Dr. Myers remained optimistic that humankind could address the ecological perils faced by humanity, and the other species on Earth.
"These are problems which have never arisen before," he said in the Berkeley interview. "But we still have it in our hands, we still have time to do a great deal to turn those appalling problems into magnificent opportunities."

Texto completo: Former Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is reconsidering a run for his party's 2020 presidential nomination.
Citing the lack of excitement generated by the other candidates, as well as their failure to unite centrist and liberal Democrats, Patrick has expressed concerns to top Democratic officials about the crowded primary field's ability to take on President Trump next year, according to the New York Times.
The 63-year-old two-term governor's potential foray into the contest, less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, follows reports last week that Michael Bloomberg is preparing to launch a last-minute campaign. It also precedes Friday's filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary, set for Feb. 11.
Patrick, a Bain Capital managing director and alumnus of the Clinton Justice Department, was an outspoken supporter of Democrats running for office during the 2018 midterm election cycle. He also met with former President Barack Obama and Obama administration veterans to discuss the prospect of a White House bid before declining to declare his candidacy.
"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I’ve decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me. I’ve been overwhelmed by advice and encouragement from people from all over the country, known and unknown. Humbled, in fact," he wrote on Facebook last December. "But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn’t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask," he added, referring to his wife.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts last week floated Patrick's name as a possible member of her cabinet should she win the White House next fall.

Texto completo: Mixing dance tracks with calls for religious warfare, Hindutva pop amplifies a wave of Hindu nationalism in Narendra Modi's India.
RAIPUR, India -- The Indian pop star, swaddled in gold-trimmed tulle, stepped to the front of the stage at a neighborhood concert. Thunder effects crackled through speakers stacked near an electronics store.
"Every house will be saffron!" the singer, Laxmi Dubey, yelled into her microphone, referring to the color representing Hinduism. "We have to make terrorists run from our blessed land!" The crowd cheered when she added a throat-slitting hand gesture.
Ms. Dubey is one of the biggest stars driving the rise of Hindutva pop music in India over the past few years. Hindutva is a word describing a devout Hindu culture and way of life, and the music that bears its name sets traditional Hindu religious stories or Bollywood clips to dance beats -- with added lyrics that in some cases openly call for the slaughter of nonbelievers, forced conversions, or attacks on Pakistan.
The songs are amassing huge numbers of views on YouTube -- Ms. Dubey's most popular song has more than 50 million on its own -- and a growing fan base among the young.
It is the music of the times in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's India. Muslims and other minorities fear that some of Mr. Modi's Hindu-nationalist supporters are damaging the country's secular foundation and making life dangerous for any who do not display extreme patriotism or Hindu religious fervor. These concerns were only heightened with a court decision Saturday in favor of Hindus over a contested holy site.
During Hindu festivals, the processions have started blasting the music in Muslim neighborhoods in shows of intimidation. Most of the songs prominently feature the call of "Jai Shri Ram!" Meaning "Hail Lord Ram," a major Hindu god, it has become the battle cry for Hindu nationalists. Mobs have attacked Muslims who refuse to chant it along with them.
"Hate bundled with so-called faith has become par for the course today," said T.M. Krishna, one of India's most renowned traditional singers. "The masks are off, and what we are seeing should deeply worry us."
Ms. Dubey, a gleeful provocateur, travels India with a 28-person troupe and is in such demand that families invite her to their homes to bless newborn babies.
Her goal, she said in an interview with The New York Times, is to recruit foot soldiers to make India a Hindu nation. At least one state government dominated by Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has used public money to stage her performances.
"Hindus used to be too innocent and docile to understand that Muslims are the biggest threat," Ms. Dubey said. "They needed someone like Laxmi Dubey to wake them up."
Some of the most violent expressions in Hindutva pop focus on Kashmir, the Muslim-majority territory that is disputed by Pakistan and that was stripped of its autonomy by Mr. Modi's government in August. Popular lyrics call for harsher action against Pakistan and separatist Kashmiri militants, and for forced conversions and a Hindu settlement campaign in Kashmir.
For some of the millions of Indian Muslims, those hyper-patriotic expressions are seen as carrying a personal threat.
In one music video, Sanjay Faizabadi, another popular Hindutva pop artist, lunges toward the camera in military fatigues. Footage of Indian troops, exploding planes and a pack of lions punctuates the song, called "Kashmir Is Our Life."
"I will come to Pakistan and play marbles with your eyes!" he sings, boasting in a subsequent verse of waging a campaign of sexual conquest there.
In an interview, Mr. Faizabadi conceded that his lyrics could give the impression that he supported violence. But the singer insisted that he had nothing against Muslims, only those who spread terrorism.
"I'm Modi's devotee, but I'm not anybody's adversary," he said. "You can label me Hindutva, but I don't spite those who are not."
The far right has never been more emboldened in India. Some of the top figures in Mr. Modi's government have repeatedly referred to immigrants as termites, threatened the citizenship status of hundreds of thousands of Muslims and encouraged vigilante violence against those accused of slaughtering cows, a sacred animal for Hindus. (Most butchers in India are Muslims or from lower castes.)
This summer, the police arrested several musicians for recording a song urging Hindus to kill those who do not chant, "Jai Shri Ram!"
Ms. Dubey's biggest hits feature that chant prominently, and she is outspoken about her intention to incite a revolution through Hindutva pop.
In her songs, Ms. Dubey exhorts Hindus to "perform ceremonies with bullets," "fight proudly against ungodly religions" and "cut off the tongues of enemies who talk against Ram."
Ms. Dubey, 30, said she did not always feel as strongly about Hindu supremacy. She is originally from the city of Bhopal, in central India, and grew up in a musical family regularly singing songs that urged sectarian harmony, like "Hindu Muslim, Brother Brother," she said.
But she said that as a teenager, she grew increasingly irate at an Anglicized political elite -- embodied in the scandal-prone Indian National Congress party of the Gandhis -- who had, in her mind, allowed Muslim terrorist groups to attack India.
Ms. Dubey drew closer to extremist Hindu circles and began subscribing to a belief that Muslims planned to take over India by marrying and converting Hindu women. To show her devotion, she vowed to remain single and moved away from estranged relatives to the nearby city of Jabalpur, where she persuaded 11 girls living in poverty to make a home with her and become disciples.
She spent a few years making music and putting it on YouTube, then found a surging popularity after Mr. Modi rose to power in 2014. Ms. Dubey and several people who work for her said she regularly performs for officials from his Bharatiya Janata Party.
"We go wherever B.J.P. leaders invite us to perform," Ms. Dubey said. "That's because the B.J.P. is helping to propagate Hindutva."
In the state of Chhattisgarh, where Ms. Dubey often sings, Rahul Singh, a director in the culture department, confirmed that his office had paid for some of her concerts. But he said he did not know much about her. Two state politicians from the B.J.P. said they knew the singer but denied support, though party leaders promoted her music ahead of national elections this year.
Her performances draw thousands of people. One show in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, was marketed as a jagrata, an all-night vigil dedicated to deities.
For a couple of hours, she sang about the goddess Durga. Performers dressed as Hindu gods twirled a giant gold trident and lit torches. Much of the audience came for the free, religious-oriented entertainment and did not know Ms. Dubey specifically.
But the singer's tone shifted after midnight, when most of the youngest children had gone to bed.
Turning her attention to the beef industry, which employs many Muslims, Ms. Dubey encouraged the crowd to take action to protect cows, echoing comments by Hindu mobs that have killed dozens of minorities accused of slaughtering cattle.
"People who I give milk to have become my butcher," she said, channeling the animal. "Become a cow protector and fulfill your promise."
Ms. Dubey transitioned to one of her most popular songs, "Every House Will Be Saffron," a YouTube juggernaut that has inspired covers sung by children. During interludes, the singer promised to target those "living in Kashmir, exploding things" and to "spill blood in mother's holy court."
The song's tempo picked up. Clusters of men rose and danced. Ms. Dubey drew her arm back and let go of an imaginary arrow.
"People who don saffron will rule!" she screamed. "Only one slogan, only one name: Jai Shri Ram! Jai Shri Ram!"

Resumen: The image, which includes a watermark from news site The Daily Wire, was taken from an Associated Press photo of the president placing a Medal of Honor around the neck of retired Army medic James C. McCloughan, who reportedly saved 10 men during the Vietnam War, The New York Times said. The fake claim, which has been around since 2014, recently resurfaced on Facebook and Twitter and said al-Baghdadi was detained at Guantanamo Bay prison and released during Obama’s presidential term, the AP said. A conspiracy theory circulating on the internet over the past few years claims comedian Bill Cosby was framed with rape allegations by the Illuminati, a secret society of elites, in order to prevent Cosby from buying the TV network NBC, according to PolitiFact.com.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump retweeted a doctored photo last week showing him awarding a medal to Conan, the dog credited with assisting in the Oct. 27 raid in Syria that resulted in the death of terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to The New York Times.
Trump added "AMERICAN HERO!" to the top of the Twitter post.
The image, which includes a watermark from news site The Daily Wire, was taken from an Associated Press photo of the president placing a Medal of Honor around the neck of retired Army medic James C. McCloughan, who reportedly saved 10 men during the Vietnam War, The New York Times said. In the Daily Wire image, McCloughan is replaced by the dog and the Medal of Honor star is replaced with a dog’s paw.
Although Trump shared an edited image, Fox News reported some members of the media were not "in on the joke."
"The mainstream media had a very serious reaction to President Trump’s not-so-serious tweet," Fox News said.
The following day, the president took to Twitter to thank the Daily Wire.
"Very cute recreation," Trump wrote, "but the ‘live’ version of Conan will be leaving the Middle East for the White House sometime next week."
McCloughan told the Times he was not offended by the altered image and thought the Twitter post showed the president "recognizing the dog’s heroism."
Obama didn’t free al-Baghdadi The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi stirred up an old, false rumor that President Barack Obama had once freed the terrorist leader from prison, according to The Associated Press.
The fake claim, which has been around since 2014, recently resurfaced on Facebook and Twitter and said al-Baghdadi was detained at Guantanamo Bay prison and released during Obama’s presidential term, the AP said.
But al-Baghdadi was never imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the AP said. He was detained in 2004 at Camp Bucca prison in Iraq for anti-U. S. militant activities, a Pentagon spokesman told the AP. Obama served from 2009-2017. George W. Bush was president when al-Baghdadi was released.
Following a 10-month stint at Camp Buca prison, al-Baghdadi joined the al-Qaida branch in Iraq and rose to the top of the group following the deaths of senior leaders, the AP said.
Cosby not framed by Illuminati This one has everything.
A conspiracy theory circulating on the internet over the past few years claims comedian Bill Cosby was framed with rape allegations by the Illuminati, a secret society of elites, in order to prevent Cosby from buying the TV network NBC, according to PolitiFact.com.
A version of this story has been shared on Facebook more than 1,800 times, PolitiFact said.
The article cites a Hollywood insider who said Cosby was such a threat to the "establishment elite" that they had to create accusations against him to destroy his career. The women who accused him were paid to bring false allegations against the former actor, the article said.
Cosby did have a "short-lived" interest in buying NBC in the early 1990s but the deal fell apart in 1993, more than 20 years before he was convicted of rape, according to PolitiFact.
There is no evidence to support the Illuminati story and the writer’s only source is merely described as a Hollywood insider, PolitiFact said. There are no facts to back up the claims.
In April 2018, Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison after being convicted of drugging and assaulting a women in 2004.
No riches from ‘Gilligan’s Island’ reruns Numerous websites over time have published versions of a story claiming actress Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann Summers in the 1960s sitcom "Gilligan’s Island" was the only cast member to receive residuals from the show, according to Snopes.com.
One article claims Wells’ husband, talent agent Larry Rosen, took issue with the standard clause in her contract that only allowed the actress to receive residuals from the first five times the series was shown in reruns. Wells’ contract was changed and she is the only cast member, along with producer Sherwood Schwartz, who receives payment from the show running in syndication, the article states.
But Wells disputed this myth in recent interviews.
In a 2014 interview, Wells said the cast never received any residuals and she made about $700 a week, Snopes said.
And Snopes reported that in a 2016 interview, Wells said, "A misconception is that we must be wealthy, rolling in the dough, because we got residuals. We didn’t really get a dime."

Dancers from opposite ends of the earth converge on the MACC

Texto completo: Can your mind’s eye conjure emerald visions of sugar cane, rolling beneath the trades like swells in the Pacific? Maybe you’re a choreographer at heart. After all, consider this: Totally independently and more or less in passing, the dance makers behind attractions visiting the Maui Arts & Cultural Center over the next weeks have pointed to the same natural phenomenon as the inspiration for the pieces in question: fields of wheat, swaying in the wind. A different harvest from our island cane, yes, but visually, not so very.
Created at opposite ends of the earth, the shows promise to look and feel as different as can be, even so. On Thursday at the Castle Theater, Rosy Simas, an enrolled Seneca from the Heron clan based in Minneapolis, presents “Weave,” developed in collaboration with an ensemble of dancers handpicked as much for the diversity of their backgrounds as for their skills as movers and nonverbal and intuitive communicators. Co-commissioned by the MACC, their somber 90-minute tapestry delves deep into mysteries of heritage.
And on Nov. 24 the production company Strange Fruit of Melbourne, Australia, parachutes in with “The Spheres,” the main event of the MACC’s free 25th- anniversary variety marathon. A 20-minute blast of energy, color and pure ozone, the family-friendly aerialist lollapalooza has previously figured as the cherry on the cake of international festivities by the hundreds, from the carnival in Rio to the Sochi Olympics. Picture a quartet of fancifully costumed artistes caroming overhead atop giant globe-shaped Chinese lanterns mounted on flexing poles a towering 14 feet high. Their purpose? Simply to amaze and delight, as no doubt they will.
Simas describes her piece as “a structured improvisation with some set choreography woven in.” Evidently, though the journey allows for detours, it follows a clear road map. “The work is very intentional,” the choreographer continues. “It’s not about the individual dancer having a private experience. It’s about taking individual experiences and stories and wanting to share them with an audience, albeit in abstract form.”
Wherever “Weave” is presented, half of the cast consists of “community performers,” recruited on-site months ahead of the show (and paid for their participation). “The piece is designed so they can learn their parts and be integrated relatively easily,” Simas says. “So far, we’ve done it in the Twin Cities, Birmingham and Philadelphia. And each time, it’s worked really beautifully. Community performers bring a life into the work that’s so energizing. On Maui some are indigenous, some come from other practices, some are deeply rooted in hula, so they bring a whole other energy and groundedness to the movement. It makes things so new for all of us, so fulfilling.”
For the motley crew of actors, dancers, acrobats, circus types and singers appearing in “The Spheres,” joining hands with the locals quite so literally isn’t really an option. For one thing, shimmying up those poles is no joke. Speaking from the Melbourne headquarters of Strange Fruit, Trevor Wight, the company’s general manager, and Phillip Gleeson, the creative director, speak, as it were, in a single voice. They’re a seamless tag team, never stepping on each other’s lines.
Apart from New Zealand, they say, the MACC gig will be their first ever in the Polynesian triangle. Yes, it’s a Maui exclusive. No, it’s not part of a tour. No, when the company was founded in 1994, no one involved had had a clue of the grisly resonance of the phrase “Strange Fruit.” (Anyone in the dark might want to check out Billie Holiday’s classic take on the song by that name, recorded in 1939.)
“Since we started touring in the U.S., we’ve become very much aware of those connotations,” the dual voice continues. “We agonized a lot about changing it. It’s very difficult. We have a very diverse ensemble. We make a lot of references to heritage. We try to remain positive, transformative, to open up conversations with people.”
With all that in mind, Strange Fruit seeks out engagements that are open to everyone, regardless of age or cultural background, free of charge, no tickets required. “Our performance is a gift to local folks,” Wight and Gleeson continue. “It’s such a privilege to be able to present in that scenario. Even in the most exotic, memorable venue, everything comes down to the bond with the audience. We’ve gone to really poor regions and performed in a school somewhere or in the middle of the road. And we’ve had the most amazing experiences that way. The audiences may never have seen a show before in their lives. Yet they’re so open, so accessible. The memories really lock in.”
As headliners of the MACC’s silver-anniversary extravaganza, in the outdoor amphitheater, Strange Fruit will perform “The Spheres” twice. As we go to press, a complementary lineup of homegrown acts is, shall we say, up in the air. The one sure thing at this point, as well as a surefire crowd-pleaser, is Zenshin Daiko, Maui’s all-kids drumming ensemble, a sensation wherever they appear, even Japan, where the discipline known as taiko was born.
“We do 50 shows a year,” says Anthony Jones, who juggles responsibilities as Zenshin Daiko’s managing director with his day job running the chocoholic’s oasis Maui Specialty Chocolates. “So, sometimes it’s hard to get the kids excited. But playing the MACC, which is a world-class venue, that always gets them up to their game. It makes them work really hard. In June we played our 20th annual concert at the Castle. I don’t know if we’re the biggest attraction, but we’re definitely the loudest!”

Texto completo: Mitch Ceasar,former chairman, Broward County Democratic Party
In Milwaukee, police arrested a man for throwing acid in the face of a Latino, thinking he was an illegal immigrant. He is a U.S. citizen. In Denver, police foil a plan to bomb a synagogue. The man arrested was known for anti-Semitic rants. These are just two hate crimes in the last week. In 2018, there was a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, leaving 11 dead. It was the deadliest attack on Jews in modern U.S. history. These events are on the rise in part because of inflammatory rhetoric from our "leaders". We must stop the hate speech!
Chip LaMarca,member, Florida House of Representatives
This week, Gov. DeSantis announced that the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's Python Action Team reached a major milestone, removing 1,000 Burmese pythons. The South Florida Water Management District's Python Elimination Program and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission's Python Action Team were created to further engage qualified individuals with python control efforts, which significantly increased the number of pythons that have been removed. The task forces have caught 3,600 invasive Burmese pythons. We will continue to prioritize the work to restore our Everglades, and protect Florida's critical ecosystem.
Lori Berman,member, Florida Senate
The results of election night 2019 are in: the "Blue Wave" is alive and well, and it continues to roll over the country. In Kentucky, a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016, Republican Governor Matt Bevin was defeated by Andy Beshear, a Democrat. In Virginia, Democrats retook a majority in both houses of the legislature for the first time in 26 years. This is truly a reflection of the concerns raised by our present political situation and should be a bellwether to all politicians.
Howard Simon,retired executive director, ACLU of Florida
One of the most startling events last week was the unanimous vote of the Citrus County (Florida) Commission to deny the County Library funding for a digital subscription to The New York Times: about $2,700, to provide access to roughly 70,000 library patrons. One Commissioner, echoing the President, called The Times "fake news," and said that he didn't want the newspaper in his county. What may have been most troubling was the choice the Commissioners thought they had: provide access for library patrons to the national "newspaper of record" or support the President. Will removing hard copies be far behind?
Kathleen Cannon,president, United Way of Broward County
Veterans Day is a day to honor all those men and women who have served in our nation's armed forces domestically and abroad, in times of peace and times of war. It is a day to show our appreciation for their bravery, dedication and sacrifices. But let us also remember our veterans beyond the holiday. Support our veterans on all days throughout the year by hiring them, by volunteering at veterans' events, by serving their unique needs and by donating to organizations that support veterans' services.
Anthony Abbate,associate provost, Florida Atlantic University, Broward
The US gave official notice that it is withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement after years spent across several administrations to craft the accord that is based on international collaboration to tackle the biggest crisis of our time. As one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases we need to rethink our position. Collaboration is based on mutual trust and mutual gain. If we are solely focused on ourselves then we also lose trust in the process. Ultimately the price we pay for backing out will be far greater than it would be for staying in.

South Florida veterans came together for the "First Veterans Expo" at the South County Civic Center. One year ago, Palm Beach State College inaugurated a Veterans Success Center funded by the state. Within a year, there was a federally funded appropriation for similar veterans success centers at nationwide colleges. We had over 200 attendees, which demonstrates the need for continued support. I am proud to have sponsored this funding. It puts South Florida at the forefront of helping support and welcome home our veterans.

The Palm Beach County Legislative Delegation met in Tallahassee with the Secretary of Agency for Health Care Administration and Department of Children and Families to discuss solutions regarding the financial misgivings of the Jerome Golden Center. The Center withdrew their bankruptcy petition, and are negotiating to sell their assets and close all facilities. If they sell to a for-profit health network, the Center can lose its federal and state financial support. I'm disturbed by the financial misgivings and concerned for patients. I intend to continue working with state and local partners to find possible solutions.

Texto completo: If you want to see Martin Scorsese's epic 3 1/2 hour new mob film "The Irishman" before it debuts on Netflix, Delawareans will have few options.
Only a handful of independent movie theaters will show the film after large chains turned their noses up at the idea of hosting limited runs of the Netflix film starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci.
While theater chains like Regal, AMC and Cinemark took a pass on the film that Scorsese made for Netflix, indies have been more than happy to welcome a movie with growing Oscar buzz. The film will open at both Penn Cinema Riverfront 14 + IMAX (401 S. Madison St., Wilmington) and Movies at Midway (18585 Del. 1, near Rehoboth Beach) on Friday, Nov. 22.
Since the film is so long, there are only a few screenings at each theater. Penn will show "The Irishman" at 11:15 a.m., 3:30 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. while Movies at Midway has it on the big screen at 1:15 p.m. and 6:05 p.m.
A week later on Friday, Nov. 29 it opens at Theatre N (1007 N. Orange St, Wilmington) with a 7:15 p.m. screening. Two other showings will follow: Nov. 30 at 5 p.m. and Dec. 2 at 6:30 p.m.
It begins screening on Netflix on Wednesday, Nov. 27. "I understand the questions about a theatrical window, but this is Martin Scorsese. We're just not gonna pass on a Scorsese film. He's a legend and his film needs to be seen on the big screen," says Penn Ketchum, Penn Cinema Riverfront 14 + IMAX owner. "We are proud to be in a position that we can make independent decisions about content like this."
"The film, the true story, the cast and crew? Too good to pass up. It's nearly perfect on all counts and now we'll know exactly who killed Jimmy Hoffa. It's a compelling story that touches, in part, on Wilmington. It's real American history. For better or worse!"
The film is based on the 2004 book "I Heard You Paint Houses" (Steerforth, $17) by former Delaware Deputy Attorney General Charles Brandt. He contends one-time Teamsters Local 326 Wilmington president Frank Sheeran admitted to killing famed union boss Jimmy Hoffa. (Hoffa went missing in 1975 and his body has never been found.)
Brandt, 77, has been waiting since 2008 to see his book transformed into film. That's when Scorsese first signed on to the project. So far, movie critics are saying it was worth the wait with a 96 percent on movie review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. Among those heaping praise:
A.O. Scott, The New York Times: "This is Scorsese's least sentimental picture of mob life, and for that reason his most poignant."
Owen Gleiberman, Variety: "Martin Scorsese's 'The Irishman' is a coldly enthralling, long-form knockout — a majestic mob epic with ice in its veins. It's the film that, I think, a lot us wanted to see from Scorsese: a stately, ominous, suck-in-your-breath summing up, not just a drama but a reckoning, a vision of the criminal underworld that's rippling with echoes of the director's previous mob films, but that also takes us someplace bold and new."
Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly: "There's an enormity to almost everything about The Irishman: the casting, the killing, the Iditarod run time. But it's not the blood splatter or the tracking shots or even the much-discussed CG de-aging effects (which are impressive, if not a little unsettling) that stay; it's seeing these faces we've watched for nearly half a century — a sort of craggy-cinematic Mount Rushmore — come together again, most likely for the last time.
Brian Truitt, USA Today: "Sprawling across 3 1/2 hours – and several decades – with infamous figures and an immersive narrative, it's an amazingly crafted historical fiction that's much more than guys shooting each other in the head, though there is still plenty of that."

How the governor's race shook up politics

Texto completo: Republicans have expressed little interest in the governor's Hail Mary. Unless Bevin provides concrete and overwhelming evidence overturning 5,200 votes, Beshear is going to be the next governor. Bevin is already being treated as yesterday's news by Republicans who are pleased with sweeping all the other statewide seats.
Gov. Matt Bevin trotted down the stairs at Lexington's Rupp Arena on Monday, hours before President Donald Trump's raucous rally started.
With state Sen. Ralph Alvarado, his running mate, behind him, the governor's appearance created a commotion loud enough to be heard over Billy Joel's "Piano Man" blaring through the arena.
"The president could be coming for any reason at all, and it would be quite a party," Bevin told reporters. But Trump was coming to back him.
Bevin's swagger told reporters – and eventually Trump – that he was going to win.
Even the governor's skeptics thought the GOP could sweep all six statewide races, and they mocked how Attorney General Andy Beshear's best surrogate was Democratic House Leader Rocky Adkins, who is beloved in Eastern Kentucky. But a few whispered they didn't know how the race would end.
Hundreds of miles away, Beshear was knocking on doors in Western Kentucky. He didn't have a president, senator or national Democrat he could – or would even want to – invite.
A late Monday night plea, paid for by the Kentucky Democratic Party, featured former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, but never mentioned Beshear by name.
But as Beshear campaign manager Eric Hyers explained, the last day of campaigning was a microcosm of the entire race. He said while Bevin was basking in Trump's spotlight, Beshear's team was meeting Kentuckians fed up with the governor's behavior.
"I can't tell you how many times people walked in our offices or sent us an email saying, 'I'm a Republican' or 'I voted for him four years ago' and he's attacked me, my family and has made my life worse," Hyers said.
On Election Day, the governor posted several tweets from his official account touting the administration's accomplishments while encouraging people to vote.
He tweeted a call to voters, using a picture of a U.S. soldier's grave.
"VOTE Because some can't," he wrote. "We should! Some gave all to ensure that we have the right to choose our leaders."
Hyers' Election Day began with watching weather reports showing rainfall in Louisville and Northern Kentucky, two areas where the Beshear campaign needed heavy turnout.
"I looked at the radar and saw this giant line of rain literally hitting those two places and was like, 'Oh, my God, how is this possible?'"
But the downpour subsided before noon, and when the results started coming in, the attorney general was ahead.
"We knew really early on that we were going to get the electorate we wanted," Hyers said.
Bevin's tune changed a bit by the middle of the day. He took to Twitter, where he criticized the national media for being "shocked" at how competitive the race appeared to be.
"REMINDER: Kentucky has far more registered Ds than registered Rs (& always has) I am only the 4th R Gov elected since the 1920's," Bevin tweeted.
Gone were the predictions of winning by 10% that he had proclaimed to The New York Times and to the president.
Soon after the polls closed, Republicans began to see what was happening as they were celebrating early victories at The Galt House in Louisville.
Everyone besides Bevin had huge turnout and larger margins of victory.
"When Bevin took that early lead, he wasn't winning Republican counties by a wide enough margin," said state Sen. Damon Thayer, a Georgetown Republican. "And when the numbers came in from Campbell and Kenton, I knew he was in big trouble."
No place was that more obvious than Northern Kentucky. In 2015, Bevin won Campbell County by a 54-41 percentage margin. He lost the same area to Beshear by a 51-46 margin this year.
Whether it was Bevin coming out in favor of tolls for the Brent Spence Bridge over the Ohio River or resentment for dropping Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton, a tea party favorite, is hard to tell. But voters were splitting their tickets between Beshear and the rest of the GOP slate.
Bevin raked in about 704,400 votes in total. That was significantly lower than all other Republican candidates, who ranged from 746,000 to 855,000 votes.
Thayer, the state Senate floor leader, said that can only be interpreted as a rebuke of Bevin's personality, which had eclipsed the administration's achievements. He pointed, as an example, to Bevin denying how Republicans legislators advised against calling a special session last year to tackle pension reform.
"We advised him not to call it, and he basically called me a liar in the newspaper, which I really didn't appreciate, because I was right," Thayer said of the special session, which adjourned in less than 24 hours.
"Sometimes in politics you have to admit you were wrong," he added. "I did (Wednesday) on the radio. I never believed polling saying Bevin was the least popular governor in America – I was wrong."
Democrats declared victory on social media once the final precincts were reported. Beshear soon took the stage as governor-elect.
But Bevin wasn't going away quietly.
"We are not conceding this race by any stretch, not a chance," Bevin said to roaring applause at The Galt House.
Hyers, the Beshear campaign manager, said the governor-elect ran on bringing civility back to state politics and will stay above the fray.
"He has a budget to put together," he said. "He owes the people of Kentucky to be the best governor he possibly can, and that starts immediately."
Republicans have expressed little interest in the governor's Hail Mary. Unless Bevin provides concrete and overwhelming evidence overturning 5,200 votes, Beshear is going to be the next governor.
Bevin is already being treated as yesterday's news by Republicans who are pleased with sweeping all the other statewide seats. Others have shifted focus to defending Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ahead of next year's federal election.
Thayer said that leaving the GOP party on Tuesday, most attendees were pleased with the overall results of capturing the attorney general's office for the first time since World War II and upsetting Democrat Heather French Henry in the secretary of state's race.
"Everybody else absolutely crushed it," he said.

Republicans have expressed little interest in the governor's Hail Mary. Unless Bevin provides concrete and overwhelming evidence overturning 5,200 votes, Beshear is going to be the next governor. Bevin is already being treated as yesterday's news by Republicans who are pleased with sweeping all the other statewide seats.
Democrats cheer while listening to Gov.-elect Andy Beshear give his victory speech after a narrow win over incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin on Tuesday at a post-Election Day gathering in Louisville's Smoketown neighborhood. Bevin has requested a recanvass of the vote totals.

Chiefs of Staff Everywhere You Turn

Texto completo: The title is suddenly everywhere. It can mean almost anything.
"There wasn't an obvious position for me," Scott Amenta said.
Mr. Amenta, 30, was describing how five years ago he joined Spring, an e-commerce company so small that its employees could be counted on one hand.
Around that time, a mentor advised him to keep an eye on the nascent chiefs of staff in technology world. People in that position were seen as the next wave of founders, he was told. Reid Hoffman (the influential LinkedIn boss) had one! So did the Winklevoss twins!
So Mr. Amenta asked to be named chief of staff.
In 2016, after toiling patiently in business development, he got the coveted title, and took up a position that is suddenly everywhere. In the past half-decade, chiefs of staff have marched from the military and the halls of Congress into the technology world and beyond.
"There's something about the title or the idea of the chief of staff that seems to be in the zeitgeist," said Chris Whipple, the author of "The Gatekeepers," a 2017 history of White House chiefs of staff. "I'm encountering more and more, not only in the political world but in the corporate world."
The chiefs have advanced into banking, art, theater and media. The director of the Whitney Museum of American Art has one, as does the publisher of The New York Times. And they are storming start-ups with particular ferocity.
Rachel Peck, 30, got the chief of staff job at the razor company Harry's in 2015. (She had also heard about Mr. Hoffman's chiefs.) Now, she said, Harry's has two chiefs of staff and will soon have three.
Julie Samuels, the executive director of Tech: NYC, a local network of technologists, said that the founders and chief executives have become more like politicians or movie stars, having to interact with the public a lot at conferences or in the news media.
"Part of why you see all these chiefs of staff is they're helping to do the work that isn't getting done," she said.
Soon after receiving the title, Mr. Amenta helped found the COS tech network, a forum of staff chiefs. Its inaugural dinner, at the Smile on Bond Street in Manhattan toward the end of 2016, was attended by about a dozen people. There are now close to 200 members.
Alter Egos
In the past several decades, chief executive compensation has increased exponentially. In technology, that trend has joined with the so-called cult of the founder, a phrase used recently regarding Adam Neumann, the ousted co-founder of WeWork.
Mr. Neumann's former chief of staff is suing him for discrimination. WeWork, also, has multiple chiefs of staff. The company declined to comment.
Ms. Samuels's chief of staff, Sarah Brown, 34, said that in New York, the title may have become popular in tech thanks to a broad exodus of people who had worked in politics. Ms. Brown herself used to work at the Democratic National Committee and founded the COS network with Mr. Amenta.
"We're at this moment kind of post-Obama where a lot of talented work force found themselves moving from government into start-ups," Ms. Brown said. "I have a couple of friends who were pretty high up in the Obama administration who have come over as chiefs of staff."
Then, too, there is simply the ever-closer relationship between government and business. While he was the deputy mayor of New York City, Daniel L. Doctoroff went through four chiefs of staff.
"They all were viewed as my alter egos," Mr. Doctoroff, 61, said. "People understood very clearly that when each one of them spoke, they were speaking for me."
When he became the head of Bloomberg in 2008, he brought the position with him. He is now the head of Sidewalk Labs, an organization owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google. His chief of staff is Nate Jenkins, who was previously a chief of staff in the Office of Management and Budget at the White House.
"It's the best leadership course you could potentially take," Mr. Jenkins, 37, said of the role. (He was on the same phone call as Mr. Doctoroff.) "It expands my original capabilities. I am expanding how I both take in information and make decisions."
Who's in Charge Here?
Like the creative director, the position du jour about a decade ago, chiefs of staff can be powerful, or not. They can be among the leaders of a company, or not. Frequently, they are not actually in charge of staff. They can be on the executive team, off the executive team, or, like Mr. Amenta at Spring, "straddling the executive team."
They are often former executive assistants. Beth Kurteson joined Winklevoss Capital in 2013 as an assistant and became chief of staff in 2014. Now she is the "managing director of operations, people strategy & growth."
"No chief of staff is the same," Mr. Amenta said.
There are similarities, though. Chiefs of staff tend to help field and minimize their principal's duties. They often mediate between that person and the rest of the world. Mr. Doctoroff called his chiefs of staff a "conduit."
"Generally the chief of staff is a foil to the principal, to supplement him or her," said Dennis Yu, 35, a two-time chief of staff, first at Betterment, an investment app, and now at Chime, a banking app.
Like a weird kind of work twin? "Yes," Mr. Yu said.
Given how vaguely the role is defined, it can be subject to discriminatory practices. Mr. Amenta's network conducted an internal survey and found that while women who were chiefs of staff tended to have more experience, men in the role tended to earn more.
But some chiefs argue that it's a particularly good position for professionals who have been marginalized in the past.
Tani Brown is the chief of staff at Jopwell, which helps companies recruit racially diverse employees. While she did not think her success in the role came because she was a woman of color, she said that "it gives me a unique advantage."
"Since I've been privy to meeting other chiefs of staff, especially in New York City, I've had a chance to meet other women of color in this position," Ms. Brown said. "A lot of women of color have commented that it's been a remarkable opportunity to influence."
Ms. Peck, the former Harry's chief of staff, is now a director at the company.
"The more that this has become a role that people understand in the world, the easier it is to explain what you do and to make the case for what you should be doing next," she said.
Still, the chief of staff corps is angsty about next steps. One of the more popular of the articles Mr. Amenta has written for his network on Medium has the headline: "Is 'Chief of Staff' a dead end role?" (His answer, essentially, is yes.)
"I don't know very many chiefs of staff who have done the job more than once, certainly not twice," Mr. Yu said. "Most people will forge a path themselves into a new function."

Texto completo: Un fiscal asistente del condado de Harris, Texas, fue despedido este viernes tras rechazar investigar un caso de intento de agresión sexual a un preso de una cárcel por considerar que la víctima era un inmigrante ilegal.
Kim Ogg, la fiscal de este condado, en el que se incluye Houston, anunció que tomó la decisión de cesar al funcionario después de que se llevara a cabo una investigación interna. “Preguntar a una víctima acerca de su estatus migratorio está mal, va en contra de nuestras políticas y no podemos tolerarlo”, afirmó en un comunicado.
Los hechos ocurrieron en la noche de Halloween, según The New York Times. Un preso de una cárcel de la metrópoli texana desnudó su miembro e intentó acercarse a otro detenido contra su voluntad, lo que hizo que la víctima gritara pidiendo ayuda.
Un policía intervino y separó a los dos hombres. Después, denunció lo acontecido a la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris. El agente creía que se abriría una investigación por intento de agresión sexual y que se aplicara ese cargo al presunto autor, un hombre arrestado por supuestamente conducir ebrio.
Pero las cosas no fueron así. El fiscal asistente John Denholm, quien recibió la denuncia del agente, le preguntó si la víctima era un inmigrante regular o no y si estaba dispuesto a testificar.
El policía le dijo que no le parecía una información relevante, pero alegó que el agredido parecía ser de México. Denholm entonces rechazó la denuncia al pensar que se tratara de un indocumentado.
El caso salió a la luz tras la denuncia de un sindicato y generó gran alboroto en Houston, una ciudad con fuerte presencia de hispanos y donde la policía considera una prioridad evitar cuestionar a víctimas y testigos sobre su condición migratoria. Como explica The Washington Post, un policía presentó la demanda ante otro fiscal. Denholm fue reasignado a otras tareas.
Pero dos sindicatos de funcionarios de aplicación de la ley, al menos un legislador estatal y la Liga de Ciudadanos Latinoamericanos Unidos, un grupo nacional de defensa de los latinos, pidieron el despido del fiscal al considerar insuficiente que se le reasignara o se determinara una sanción disciplinaria contra él. El viernes, la fiscal Ogg decidió escuchar estas criticas.
Denholm trabajaba en la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris desde enero de 2017. Anteriormente estuvo de teniente de la Oficina del Alguacil del mismo condado. El presidente de una organización de agentes locales indicó al Houston Cronicle que ya en otras ocasiones Denholm rechazó casos y tuvo encontronazos con funcionarios de aplicación de la ley.
En un email de este viernes, el ya ex fiscal asistente dijo al Post que sabía quién había formulado las acusaciones que llevaron a su despido y pareció dar a entender que la versión de la policía sobre este caso era incorrecta.

Texto completo: Late last month, I joined state Rep. Jesse MacLachlan and prominent community leaders in Clinton for a panel discussion on vaping. I only wish we scheduled it sooner. In recent months, vaping and associated injuries and deaths have become a pressing issue. We must take it seriously and protect public health.
As of Nov. 1, more than three dozen vaping-related cases of lung disease and injury were reported to the state Department of Public Health, part of a national trend of more than 1,800 injuries and 37 deaths. Vaping experts are currently studying and searching for answers as to what’s causing the injuries, with suspected sources ranging from black-market products containing THC, the active intoxicating ingredient in marijuana, to potential chemical reactions to vaping flavors, to the vapes themselves.
The uncertainty behind this matter — that so many causes could be leading to these very real symptoms — underscores its severity. When they were introduced, vapes were sold as a low-risk alternative to smoking cigarettes, a way for smokers to reduce the damage they were doing to their lungs. But what we’ve learned in the years since is their target audience quickly became younger than smoking adults.
Reports have shown for years that Juul, one of the largest manufacturers of vaping products, knew its marketing and use of flavors in its products were targeting teenagers and schoolchildren more than they were adults. Just last week, a Reuters report found the company knew young people were attracted to their e-cigarette products — and that flavored e-cigarette products directly appealed to high school students. And yet, it did not change course. “A lot of people had no problem with 500 percent year-over-year growth,” one former Juul manager said in the Reuters article. Further, The New York Times reported Juul knew some of its products were tainted or contaminated — and refused to recall them.
Where does that leave us? More than 5 million young people used e-cigarettes in 2019, according to an annual survey released by the FDA and CDC. That figure represents an increase of nearly 1.5 million students, more than 27 percent of high school students, and more than 10 percent of middle school students. And nearly one in three said they started because of flavors including candy, mint and chocolate.
Where does that leave us today? In many locations, vaping is receiving a de-facto ban. The state of Massachusetts put a four-month moratorium on vaping sales, and my colleague Sen. Saud Anwar called for a similar one in Connecticut now. While the General Assembly in 2019 voted to raise the age of access for tobacco from 18 to 21, we know there’s more to do — especially as a proposed ban on flavored vaping products was not passed, just one of many ideas to protect our youth.
As the numbers show, this is a nationwide problem. In Connecticut, we owe it to public health to take action. I will continue to study and learn from vaping forums, experts and members of school communities in months to come, and I intend to support any legislation designed to protect and improve the health of our state.

Marc Thiessen column: Biden's Iraq war walk-back is revisionist nonsense

Texto completo: The fact is, at the time Biden expressed zero regrets about the complete U.S. withdrawal, which he was in charge of executing. The New York Times reports that in December 2011 Biden was "ebullient" as he presided over the departure ceremony for the last American forces, calling President Barack Obama from Baghdad to tell him "All I've said about this job, I take it back. Thank you for giving me the chance to end this goddamn war."
Of course, he did not actually end the "goddamn war," he unleashed a humanitarian and national security catastrophe. Biden's withdrawal created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State - which had been reduced to just 700 fighters - to regroup, reconstitute itself and build a murderous caliphate the size of Great Britain. The terrorists enslaved and raped thousands of Yazidi girls and carried out gruesome executions across Iraq and Syria. And they spread their murderous tentacles across the globe, carrying out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed over 2,000 people and injured many thousands more.
Biden has criticized President Trump for withdrawing from Syria against the advice of our military commanders. Yet Biden did not listen to our military commanders when it came to the Iraq withdrawal. The Times reports that Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the U.S. commander in Iraq, proposed keeping as many as 24,000 troops in Iraq. According to Biden national security adviser Colin H. Kahl, Austin was told by the White House "you've got to be kidding." So Austin presented Obama and Biden with options for 19,000, 16,000 and 10,000 troops - and told them the lowest number was "unwise." But Biden "aggressively pushed for a smaller force," and Obama agreed. Then, during negotiations with the Iraqis, the administration cut the offer in half to just 5,000 - an offer the Iraqis rejected.
In his interview with the Wall Street Journal, Biden blamed George W. Bush for the U.S. withdrawal, noting that he had negotiated a status of forces agreement that required an end to the U.S. military presence by 2011. Please. Does anyone really believe that if Bush were still in office in 2011, he would have pulled out all U.S. forces? Of course not.
The reason Obama and Biden were unable to get an agreement to extend the U.S. troop presence is because they made it crystal clear to the Iraqis that America was headed for the exits. Iraqis watched as Obama and Biden rejected numbers well above 10,000, only grudgingly agreed to even that number and then cut that number to 5,000. If you were an Iraqi, would this have given you confidence in America's long-term commitment?
Iran and its political allies inside Iraq were pressing for a U.S. withdrawal, and threatening politicians who supported extending the American military presence. For Iraqi leaders, 24,000 American troops might have been worth the political risk, and maybe even 10,000 would have been worth it. But an offer of just 5,000 troops from an administration that was determined to go to zero as quickly as possible was not. If America was leaving, and Iran was staying, why risk siding with the Americans?
In 2013, as the Islamic State was gaining steam, Biden said that he and Obama felt "happy and ... fulfilled" with the decision to withdraw from Iraq. A year later, they would be forced to send U.S. forces back to Iraq to deal with the debacle they had unleashed.
Biden supported the Iraq invasion but then opposed the Bush surge, which crushed the Islamic State and won the war. Then he supported a premature withdrawal that allowed the terrorists to regroup and was celebrating that decision as recently as four months ago - but now says he regrets it. That's quite a record for a man running on his record of experience and judgment.

Texto completo: Donald Trump Jr. is holding a book signing event at a Costco in northern Scottsdale on Monday to promote his new book, "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us."
Kimberly Guilfoyle, Trump Jr.'s girlfriend and a senior adviser for President Donald Trump's re-election campaign and former Fox News host, also is expected to attend.
The Arizona Republican Party announced the event on Twitter and a representative for Costco said the event is only for store members; the media is not allowed to attend, the company representative said.
An online invitation advertising the event says books must be bought at the Scottsdale Costco in order to be signed. Each copy will sell for $30.
The latest visit to metro Phoenix by Trump's eldest son comes as he is plugging his new book, which is to be released next week, with appearances from Florida to Nevada.
The book excoriates Democrats, the press and critics of his father, according to the New York Times. Trump Jr., the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, also revisits his childhood in Czechoslovakia and writes about working alongside his father. He also gives his views on the Trump administration.
Trump Jr. is scheduled to attend a fundraising event with the state Republican Party after the event, a GOP official confirmed.

Texto completo: President Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton has details about “many relevant meetings and conversations” related to Ukraine that lawmakers have not been told, his lawyer said.
Charles Cooper, the lawyer, did not provide details on what Bolton knows in a letter he sent Friday to the chief House lawyer, according to the New York Times.
The Democratic-led committees have sought Bolton’s testimony in their impeachment investigation into Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.
Bolton did not show up for closed-door testimony Thursday because, his lawyer explained, he wanted a judge to decide whether he and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, could speak to lawmakers in defiance of the White House. Cooper has denied that Bolton is coordinating with the White House on delaying his possible testimony.
Bolton “was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,” Cooper wrote in the letter.
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, testified last month that Bolton wanted nothing to do with the “drug deal,” which was how he described other Trump officials’ actions toward Ukraine. Bolton said Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was a “hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up,” according to Hill.
He also told aides to report their interactions with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who was involved in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, to a White House lawyer.

Nicholas Kristof: Don’t let Trump make you numb to what’s unacceptable

Texto completo: The problem with being a frog in a beaker is that you may not notice the water temperature rising to a boil.
Humans, too. In New Delhi, people get used to air that is filthy. In Syria, to checkpoints. In Angola, to corruption. In China, to propaganda. And in America, we risk becoming numbed to a political, social and moral breakdown.
Scandal and dysfunction dribble out from Washington day by day, numbing us so that we may forget just how unprecedented and outrageous the trends are. It was only five years ago that Fox News was deploring a “shocking” and “desperate” presidential scandal that Republican Rep. Peter King described as inexcusable: Barack Obama wore a tan suit! Now we can’t even keep track of how many countries President Donald Trump has asked to do him political favors.
I’ve been traveling abroad, so I’ve been asking journalists and officials how they see America, and from a distance they offer blunt assessments. “If your president isn’t a Manchurian candidate,” one senior European official said, “he’s doing a pretty good imitation of one.”
That distance can be useful to see the big picture. To resist complacency, let’s take stock:
In 2016, Obama’s passivity and Republican intransigence may have allowed Russian cyberattacks to swing the presidency to Trump (there’s no way to be sure, but that’s what the forensic work of Kathleen Hall Jamieson suggests). Yet despite improvement, the United States still doesn’t have an adequate strategy to foil Russian or Chinese interference in the 2020 election.
Trump is a hero of many evangelical Christians who previously emphasized the importance of personal values and restoring “honor and dignity” to the White House. Meanwhile, he is on his third wife, has cheated on all three and has been accused of sexual misconduct by 25 women. And Trump tweeted a supporter’s praise likening him to “the second coming of God.”
Since taking office, Trump has made more than 13,400 false or misleading statements, according to a Washington Post database. The Post found that he has recently accelerated his falsehoods to a rate of 22 per day, more than one per waking hour. (I’ve covered many world leaders, and the only two whom I consider pathological liars are Trump and former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.)
Trump has declared “I am the chosen one.” His press secretary last month spoke of “the genius of our great President.”
Trump, who according to a New York Times investigation is wealthy partly because of fraud, pledged to fight corruption and “drain the swamp.” Since then, he has lost more first-term Cabinet members to scandal than any president in history.
“I’m not going to have time to go play golf,” Trump said before his election. In fact, he has visited golf clubs approximately 224 times since taking office, including more than three months in total at Mar-a-Lago. These vacation trips have cost taxpayers more than $100 million.
Trump’s mother was an immigrant, as are two of the women he married (his current wife may have been undocumented). Yet he has ripped children from parents at the border, and his administration has argued that detained immigrant children do not need soap or toothbrushes.
We haven’t even gotten to Trump trying to buy Greenland, marching into women’s changing rooms to admire undressed teenagers, borrowing Stalinist language to denounce the press as the “enemy of the people,” claiming that climate change is a Chinese conspiracy, banning Muslims or diverting money to build the wall that Mexico supposedly would pay for.
Oh, and that multibillion-dollar wall is now being cut open by smugglers with $100 saws.
Yet America’s dysfunction goes beyond Trump, and it will outlast Trump, even as it is aggravated by him.
American kids ages 1 through 19 are 57% more likely to die than those in other advanced nations, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs. That’s partly because the United States is virtually alone in failing to provide universal health coverage: Trump didn’t create that problem, but he did magnify it so that the number of uninsured children is now increasing.
Long-standing economic inequality in the United States, exacerbated by Trump’s tax cuts and other policies, is staggering. A single hedge fund tycoon, James Simons, made $1.6 billion last year, or more than $4 million each day — yet the United States has 100,000 children who on any given night are homeless. Since 2000, 61,000 foster kids have simply gone missing. Girls and boys are sold by pimps for sex in every American city.
America is not, as Trump once called it, a “hellhole.” It is a nation of enormous strengths and resources, but we need to muster them now. A merit of our species is that we are adaptable and resilient and can get used to almost anything.
But we should never get accustomed to all this. Let’s not let ourselves be numbed by the daily drip into accepting a level of Trumpian dysfunction that should always be unacceptable.

Texto completo: Fans of author David Sedaris know that he’s uncommonly candid. He’ll freely admit he’s a night walker, roaming the streets of England late at night and picking up litter.
“I usually go to bed about 2 or 3 in the morning. I’ll walk for a couple hours around the city, and they don’t have street lights in this country,” the humorist said.
Sometimes his travels take him much farther. He recently returned home to the United Kingdom from Norway, and he’ll be in Santa Rosa next week for a speaking engagement at the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts.
“I’m not home a whole lot. I like traveling,” said Sedaris, 62, who lives with his longtime partner, painter and set designer Hugh Hamrick, in Rackham, West Sussex. “When I’m at home, I talk to one person. And when I go out, maybe I’ll talk to a cashier.
“My world is pretty small. When I travel, I’m talking to a hundred people a day. I love picking up information.”
There’s a lot to talk about. Sedaris has sold 12 million books, translated into 27 languages. While he’s justly known for his sardonic wit, his 10th and most recent book — the New York Times bestselling collection of his essays from 2018 titled “Calypso” — also touches on serious issues.
“I didn’t consciously sit down to write a darker book,” he during a recent phone interview. “I write about aging. As you get older, people you know die, and you have cancer scares. Sorrow gives humor weight.”
To illustrate his meaning, Sedaris cites his young sister, actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, and her work with the Chicago improvisational comedy troupe Second City:
“My sister Amy used to be in Second City, and I’d go to her shows and I’d laugh, but afterwards, I wouldn’t remember anything.”
Among the most serious topics mentioned in “Calypso” is the suicide of the author’s youngest sister, Tiffany.
“I wrote a couple of essays about it and the way it affected our family, and I heard from so many people who had a similar experience,” Sedaris said.
It’s common for people to say, “My job is what I do, not who I am,” but no one is likely to hear that from Sedaris. Writing is quite clearly central to his life. He wrote journal entries, essays and stories for 15 years before the publication of his first book, “Barrel Fever,” in 1994.
“I wrote every day,” Sedaris said. “It just seemed normal to me.”
That first published book included perhaps his most famous essay, “Santaland Diaries,” based on the Christmas season temp job he once took as an elf at Macy’s in New York. The piece made him a public figure when it first aired on National Public Radio in 1992.
His radio work had a lot to do with spreading his fame at home and abroad. For example, English folk often find Sedaris — born in New York state and raised in the suburbs of Raleigh, N.C. — a bit peculiar but likable the just the same.
One fellow approached Sedaris near the train station and politely inquired, “Are you the American on the radio who picks up rubbish?”
When Sedaris confirmed it, the stranger went on to add where the author might acquire some choice bits of cast-off stuff.
“It’s a compulsion,” Sedaris admitted, but his litter-collecting has won him some honors. The Queen of England once invited him to Buckingham Palace on that account.
Just as he felt driven to write throughout of his life so far, Sedaris expects to continue his work as long as he lives.
“I’m compelled to write. I can’t imagine quitting,” he said. “People who have jobs, like accountants, do retire I guess. You don’t retire from writing. I would still write every day.”

U.S. ENVOY IN SYRIA HIGHLY CRITICAL OF TROOP WITHDRAWAL

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A senior American diplomat has written a highly critical assessment of the Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of troops from northeast Syria last month, a decision that paved the way for an attack on U.S.-allied forces in the area, officials said Thursday.
In an internal memo, William Roebuck, the top American diplomat in northern Syria, takes the Trump administration to task for not doing more to prevent Turkey's invasion or protect the Kurds, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the battle against the Islamic State group, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
One of the officials described the memo, which was obtained and first revealed by The New York Times, as "lengthy and harsh."
Mr. Roebuck's memo highlights how President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw American troops was deeply divisive, even within his own administration. Turkey invaded days after Mr. Trump ordered the small number of U.S. special forces in the area to leave.
Iran bars U.N. inspector
ISTANBUL - Iran has prevented a United Nations nuclear inspector from entering a uranium-enrichment facility and revoked her credentials after Iranian officials said she tested positive for explosive nitrates.
The move drew condemnation from the United States, which called Iran's decision to expel the inspector an "outrageous provocation."
A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, confirmed that one of its inspectors was "temporarily prevented from leaving Iran" last week.
According to Iranian officials, the inspector was halted by security at the gate of Iran's main enrichment plant in Natanz after triggering an alarm. The alert raised officials' concerns she was carrying "suspicious material."
3 slain Americans buried
LA MORA, Mexico - As Mexican soldiers stood guard, a mother and two sons were laid to rest in hand-hewn pine coffins in a single grave dug out of the rocky soil Thursday at the first funeral for the victims of a drug cartel ambush that left nine American women and children dead.
Clad in shirt sleeves, suits or modest dresses, about 500 mourners embraced in grief under white tents erected in La Mora, a hamlet of about 300 people who consider themselves Mormon but are not affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Some wept, and some sang hymns.
Members of the extended community - many of whom, like the victims, are dual U.S-Mexican citizens - had built the coffins themselves. Mourners filed past to view the bodies and pay their final respects to Dawna Ray Langford, 43, and her sons Trevor, 11, and Rogan, 2.
They were laid to rest together, just as they died together Monday when attackers fired a hail of bullets at their SUV on a dirt road leading to another settlement, Colonia LeBaron. Six children and three women in all were killed in the attack on the convoy of three SUVs.

Nonvoters Lean to Right of Many Democrats

Texto completo: Demographically, they seem like people who'd want to vote out Trump. Yet at least in the battleground states, many favor Republicans.
It is an article of faith for the activist base of both political parties: An ideologically pure candidate can win by turning out the base and mobilizing a new coalition of voters.
For Democrats, nonvoters have long been a source of hope. They are disproportionately young, nonwhite and low-income, demographics that favor the party. In this year's Democratic primary, turning nonvoters into voters would seem to offer a path to victory for candidates who might seek to win the general election without persuading the moderate swing voters coveted by their party's establishment.
There may be places in the country where this is true. But in the battleground states likeliest to decide the presidency, nonvoters aren't overwhelmingly favorable to Democrats, according to an analysis of 623 registered voters who live in battleground states and stayed home in both 2016 and 2018.
These nonvoters participated in recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys of the six closest states carried by the president.
They lean Democratic, but only by a bit. The president actually leads Elizabeth Warren, 42 percent to 41 percent, among active registered voters who did not vote in either 2016 or 2018. Joe Biden leads this group by three points, and Bernie Sanders leads by four.
Those nonvoters who say that, if they voted, they would vote for any of the three leading Democratic candidates seem no more likely to support progressive causes or a progressive nominee than recent voters. Just 13 percent of nonvoters who would vote for the Democratic nominee call themselves "very liberal." Nearly as many of these Democratic-leaning nonvoters, 8 percent, say they're "very conservative."
The results suggest that higher turnout, though helpful to Democrats in their quest to defeat the president, would not necessarily assure them of victory in these states. And the president's ability to stay close among nonvoters suggests he could remain competitive in a high-turnout election and expand his support beyond his 63 million voters in 2016.
The findings undermine the common assumption that Hillary Clinton lost simply because of low Democratic turnout. This month's Times/Siena polling does suggest she would have benefited from a higher overall turnout; the top Democratic candidates today lead among 2016 nonvoters by between three and eight points. But the relatively narrow Democratic advantage is consistent with a wide body of evidence that the election would have remained deadlocked, even if Democrats had enjoyed a turnout as favorable as the one they had in 2012.
For Democrats, part of the problem is that the demographics of nonvoters no longer work so clearly in their favor. Nonvoters are less likely to have graduated from a four-year college, and the president excels among the less educated white voters who are overrepresented among nonvoters in the battleground states.
But the Democratic challenge runs beyond demographics. In general, the nonvoters are less ideological and less partisan than demographically similar voters, which weakens the expected Democratic demographic edge.
The president, for instance, has a 17 percent approval rating among self-identified Democrats who didn't vote in either 2016 or 2018, compared with an 8 percent approval rating among Democrats who did vote in either of those years. And Mr. Trump has a 19 percent disapproval rating among self-identified Republicans who didn't vote in either 2016 or 2018, and a 9 percent disapproval rating among those who did.
The same pattern plays out by demographic group. The most striking case involves black voters: Those who turn out vote all but unanimously for Democrats, but the Democratic advantage is not quite so clear among those who haven't voted in recent elections.
Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump among nonvoting black registered voters by only 59 percent to 19 percent, but he is ahead, 89-5, among those who voted in both 2016 and 2018. The sample of black nonvoters is small, at just 72 respondents, but the difference is well outside the margin of error. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders underperform among nonvoting black registered voters by a similar level.
What about whites without a degree, the president's base? Mr. Trump has a 25-point lead over Mr. Biden in this group if they have voted in one of the last two elections, 59 percent to 34 percent. Those who stayed home, however, back Mr. Trump by a smaller margin of 53 percent to 36 percent. The pattern holds after controlling for age.
Taken together, the figures imply that a large portion of nonvoters sit out because they do not neatly line up with either party. This fact tends to limit the opportunity available to both parties, but over all it tends to diminish the Democratic advantage that would seem to exist based on their demographics alone.
One exception to this general pattern is among Hispanic nonvoters, who tend to be just as Democratic as their voting counterparts, or even more so.
Over all, Mr. Biden led among nonvoting Latinos, 64 percent to 24 percent, compared with a 63-30 lead among those who had voted in either 2018 or 2016. The sample of nonvoting Hispanic voters is fairly small, but the finding is consistent with data previously analyzed by The Upshot.
As a result, Democrats enjoyed a far larger edge among nonvoters in our poll of Arizona, where 33 percent of registered nonvoters were Hispanic, than elsewhere in the battlegrounds. Mr. Biden led among nonvoters in Arizona, 55 percent to 37 percent, thanks to a 74-12 lead among Hispanic in that group. In the rest of the battlegrounds, Mr. Biden had only a one-point lead among nonvoters.
The relative Democratic strength among Hispanic voters may also mean that nonvoters nationwide may be more Democratic than nonvoters in the battlegrounds, since nonvoters nationwide are likelier to be Hispanic. It may add further intrigue to speculation about Democratic prospects in Texas, where nonvoters are even more diverse than they are in Arizona.
Of course, Democrats -- or Republicans and the president -- could benefit from higher turnout if it drew disproportionately from their pool of voters. The Times/Siena data confirms this has happened before.
The group of voters who stayed home in 2012 and turned out for the presidential election in 2016 was fairly favorable to Republicans. Today, they back Mr. Trump by three points over Mr. Biden.
The voters who stayed home in 2016, but turned out for the midterms in 2018, back Mr. Biden by 17 points in these battleground states. Today, they are just as likely to say they are "almost certain" to vote as those who turned out in 2016.
So for Democrats in the primary, the question is not simply who leads among nonvoters, but what kind of candidate could excite them enough to lure them to the polls.
The results do not offer particularly clear guidance here. On the issues, the nonvoting Democrats look about the same as those who vote. But the group looks relatively likely to include voters who have not been animated by the cultural fights of the last half decade, which might be something of a surprise given their relative youth.
Nonvoters are the likeliest group of Democratic leaners to oppose an assault weapons ban or to support reducing legal immigration to the United States. They're likeliest to agree that discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against minorities, even though the group is only 50 percent white. They're also likeliest to agree that political correctness has gone too far.
It's a combination that informs why this group is somewhat sympathetic to the president, even though they say they would probably vote for the Democratic nominee.
Perhaps this shouldn't be a surprise: If they did care about the same things that animated "very liberal" voters, they probably would have gone to the polls in these crucial states. Eighty-six percent of very liberal registered voters turned out in either 2016 or 2018 in these states, the highest percentage of any ideological group.
That said, there are some signs that Democratic-leaning nonvoters are somewhat likelier to favor a bold candidate who offers something different. In no small part because of their relative youth, they say they would prefer a candidate who promises fundamental, systematic change to American society over one who promises to return Washington to normal. In contrast, Democratic-leaning voters who turned out in both 2016 and 2018 prefer a return to normal.
Young nonvoting Democrats are slightly more likely than young voting Democrats to support fundamental, systematic change over a return to normal. But in keeping with the broader pattern, they offer more conservative answers on the issues than those who vote.
The gap is particularly stark on cultural questions. Among people under 30 who lean Democratic, the nonvoters are far more likely than the voters to agree that the women who are running for president "just aren't that likable."
The pattern also extends to issues like immigration or health care. Over all, the young Democratic nonvoters are far less likely to describe themselves as very liberal.
From all this, you could stitch together a case that Democrats have struggled to appeal to less educated nonvoters, particularly among those who are young and black. These nonvoters do not like the president and they are not conservatives, but they do not appear to have been socialized into the cultural norms of the party's liberal college-educated coastal base. As a result, they have not responded to the president's conduct with the urgency and outrage of their peers. And some of them may even dissent from their generation's progressive consensus on cultural issues.
When it comes to the candidates, Mr. Sanders shows relative strength among nonvoters: He has a 41 percent "very favorable" rating in the group, compared with 33 percent for Mr. Biden and 30 percent for Ms. Warren. This is at least in part because of Mr. Sanders's longtime appeal to young voters.
Not only is Mr. Sanders's favorability rating the best of these three candidates, but he is also the only Democrat whose favorability rating is stronger among nonvoting Democratic leaners than among those who have voted before. His outsider status and promise of fundamental change, without much focus on cultural issues, might offer at least one clue for how Democrats might appeal to these nonvoters, though it need not be the only one.
Although Mr. Sanders's favorability rating is strong in both absolute and relative terms, it is not an overwhelming endorsement.
Democrats also have an opportunity to draw on a different group of nonvoters: the millions who aren't registered to vote at all, and who stand on the sidelines of American politics.
Their views are not measured here, but a prior Upshot compilation of 2018 polls from the Pew Research Center and Kaiser Family Foundation found similar patterns. President Trump's approval rating among unregistered black voters, for instance, stood at 19 percent, and at a surprising 47 percent among unregistered young voters.
None of this precludes the Democrats from benefiting greatly from new voters, as they did in 2018.
But the poll offers little reason to think these voters are poised to save them. Over all, 45 percent of nonvoting Trump supporters say they are "almost certain" to vote, compared with 46 percent of nonvoting Democratic leaners.
What kind of people are likeliest to stay home on Election Day, and which party might benefit if they could be persuaded to turn out? (PHOTOGRAPH BY Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: Six current and former employees are accused of steering car accident victims to specific health clinics, doctors and lawyers in exchange for kickbacks.
For years, Angela Meyers, a 911 operator with the New York Police Department, fielded emergency calls, then filed reports about the calls within the department.
But according to court documents, when someone called 911 after a car accident, Ms. Meyers did something else: She also passed victims' information to an insurance fraud ring in Queens.
Ms. Meyers was one of six current and former New York Police Department employees charged in federal court on Thursday with conspiracy and bribery. They are accused of being part of a citywide medical insurance fraud ring that sent thousands of car accident victims to specific health clinics, doctors and lawyers in exchange for kickbacks.
Law enforcement officials arrested 27 people in connection with the scheme -- 23 of those were expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Thursday.
A key component to the scheme was the five 911 operators and an active police officer, Yanaris Deleon, who provided victims' confidential contact information to the scheme's ringleaders, prosecutors said. Four of the five 911 operators were active employees; one had previously resigned, the police said.
"There is no place for corruption within the N.Y.P.D," James P. O'Neill, the police commissioner, said in a statement. "By tarnishing the shield, as well as their sacred oaths, these employees will be held to the highest account the law provides."
According to court documents, the 911 operators and Officer Deleon provided victims' contact information to the scheme's fraudulent "call center."
The call center would then contact those victims and coax them to visit prearranged medical clinics and lawyers, court documents say. Those call center offices would then pay the ringleader of the scheme, Anthony Rose, 51, in exchange for that information, according to the authorities.
Prosecutors said the department employees received thousands of dollars for their part in the scheme.
"These actions have undermined the integrity of our emergency and medical first responders," said Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan. "This office is committed to rooting out corruption wherever it is found, and will not rest until those who seek to profit by corrupting our public institutions are brought to justice."
The fraud ring employed a network of people within hospitals, medical service providers and law enforcement. Mr. Rose, who is from Queens, ran the scheme from at least 2014 to November 2019, prosecutors said.
As recently as June, Officer Deleon texted Mr. Rose on the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp and provided a list of "nearly two dozen names and telephone numbers" of accident victims, court documents said.
Prosecutors estimate that as many as 60,000 car accident victims may have had their confidential information improperly disclosed.
Mr. Rose ordered his co-conspirators to target car accident victims from low-income neighborhoods because they were more vulnerable, according to court documents. He told his fraudulent call center not to target victims in Manhattan, court documents said, because "those people got attorneys."
"We need all the 'hood cases," Mr. Rose told the call center people, according to the documents. "We want all the bad neighborhoods."
In addition to the Police Department sources, Mr. Rose also bribed employees at hospitals and medical centers to violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, and disclose confidential patient information for car accident victims, the documents say. The investigation is continuing, prosecutors said.

Texto completo: James Butler, de 48 años, y Michelle Butler, de 46, una pareja de New Hampshire, viajaban el mes pasado por Texas presuntamente rumbo a Florida. Nunca llegaron a destino: sus cuerpos fueron hallados la semana pasada trágicamente enterrados en una playa del sur de Texas, días después de desaparecer.
El caso se investiga como homicidio, y las autoridades están siguiendo pistas para resolverlo. Un avance significativo se dio a conocer este miércoles, cuando informaron de que un hombre acusado de robarles un carro fue detenido en México y extraído después a Estados Unidos.
A principios de esta semana, la Policía lanzó un aviso público para dar con Adam Curtis Williams , quien fue fotografiado mientras cruzaba la frontera sur por Eagle Pass, Texas, a bordo del vehículo que utilizaron los Butler, según cuenta KIII TV.
Curtis, de 33 años y procedente de Utah, viajaba junto a una mujer identificada como Amanda Noverr, informan varios medios. Su supuesta fuga terminó cuando la policía mexicana lo interceptó en el estado de Jalisco. El momento de la detención hasta el momento no ha sido concretado.
El sospechoso de robar el vehículo utilizado por la pareja asesinada fue extraditado este miércoles a EEUU, según KRIS TV, medio local de Corpus Christi, Texas, localidad cercana a la playa de la Isla del Padre donde la semana pasada se encontraron sin vida los cuerpos de los Butler.
Actualmente el hombre se encuentra bajo custodia en la cárcel del condado de Kleberg, Texas.
La mujer que viajaba con Curtis, por su lado, se quedó en México, supuestamente con un menor, según las autoridades. También el vehículo robado fue tomado en custodia allí.
The New York Times afirma que Jaime Garza, el agente encargado de informar este miércoles sobre los avances de la investigación no especificó si se considera a Curtis sospechoso de matar a la pareja asesinada.
El pasado martes, las autoridades dijeron que podría haber más gente involucrada en el homicidio. Para hallar los cuerpos de los Butler, desaparecidos desde mediados de octubre, los investigadores usaron la localización de un celular que habían utilizado. No hay detalles actualmente disponibles sobre cómo murieron.
Se piensa que la pareja de dirigía a Fort Laudale, Florida. “Nos alegra escuchar que se realizó un arresto y estamos a la espera de lo que sigue”, dijo la hermana de James Butler, Debbie Van Loon, a la televisora WMUR-TV de Manchester, Nuevo Hampshire.

Texto completo: Sen. Lindsey Graham praised President Donald Trump on Wednesday, telling him the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will be remembered as the "defining moment" of his presidency and that if he wins reelection it will be because of the federal judges he has put on the bench.
The South Carolina Republican made the remark at a White House event celebrating the president's judicial appointments.
"The defining moment of your presidency, for me, was the Kavanaugh hearing," said Graham, who sat on the Senate Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh's confirmation and has since become the committee's chairman. "This room would be empty if we had failed Brett Kavanaugh. "
Impeachment: Lindsey Graham says he won't read transcripts of testimony in 'sham' process
'This is a lynching, in every sense': Lindsey Graham says Trump's impeachment description 'accurate'
During the confirmation process, Graham fiercely defended Kavanaugh after allegations of past sexual misconduct against the nominee surfaced. Graham yelled at Democrats on the Judiciary Committee for their handling of the matter and accused them of wanting "to destroy this guy’s life. "
"Brett Kavanaugh lived a life we should all be proud of," Graham said Wednesday. "He worked hard, and the way he was treated was the worst experience I've had in politics. "
He lauded Trump for sticking with Kavanaugh.
"A lot of people would have pulled the plug on him. Mr. President, thank you for not pulling the plug," he said. If people had "failed Brett Kavanaugh" and let the allegations derail his confirmation, he said, it would have discouraged young conservatives who might have otherwise aspired to become federal judges.
Graham said that if Trump wins reelection in 2020, one of the main reasons will be because "people in the conservative world believe you fight for judges. "

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chaired the Judiciary Committee through the Kavanaugh hearings, told Trump that "20% of the people voted for you" in 2016 because of his promise to put conservatives on the Supreme Court.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , said that on election night in 2016, when it became clear that Republicans would control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives for the first time in a decade, he knew the Supreme Court would be the most important thing on their agenda.
McConnell said Trump "had been helped enormously" by "a decision that I made," after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, to not allow then-President Barack Obama to "fill that Scalia vacancy on the way out the door. "
Scalia died in February 2016, about 11 months before Obama left office. McConnell did not allow Obama's appointment of Merrick Garland to come to the Senate floor for a vote, leaving vacant the seat that Trump eventually filled with Justice Neil Gorsuch.
"And boy, you didn't blow it. Neil Gorsuch is an all-star, isn't he?" McConnell said.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In the spring of 2017, I traveled to the Muckleshoot tribe, south of Seattle, where I spent a whole day with Valerie Segrest, a friend and ethnobotanist, and members of her tribe young and old, harvesting the foods of their area.
We collected maple flowers, young horsetail shoots, wild mints, white cedar, cattails, miner's lettuce, purslane, lamb's ear, blackberries and morel mushrooms. We used all of those foraged ingredients to make a wild elk stew, with meat donated by a tribal hunter, for an annual gathering called the Muckleshoot Elders Luncheon that brought together over 1,000 elders from tribes across the region. We also enjoyed a mixed seafood feast of crab, lobster, clams and salmon -- supplied by a regional Indigenous-owned seafood company -- roasted on a giant grate that hovered over live cedar coals. So simple, so delicious.
When The New York Times asked me to develop 10 essential recipes featuring modern Native American flavors from diverse regions, I thought of that experience with the Muckleshoot.
It is one of many enlightening and inspiring encounters I've had as I research geography, cultures, language, history and foods through an indigenous culinary lens for my company, The Sioux Chef, all of which informed the recipes I developed for The Times.
As an enrolled tribal member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, I had a hard time knowing where to start when I first wanted to educate myself and understand the foods of my own heritage. I struggled to find any information about the foodways of my direct ancestors before European colonists arrived. What methods and ingredients did they use? How did they grow, harvest, forage, hunt, trade, preserve, store and cook food?
So much has been lost in the wake of European colonization. During the Revolutionary War, General Sullivan's Expedition destroyed villages and targeted food supplies and seed banks of the northeastern Six Nations, hoping to inhibit their ability to help the British and forcing Native families to flee for Canada or face imprisonment and possible slavery. There were also the United States government's relocations efforts, brutal and traumatic events like the Cherokee Trail of Tears in 1838, the Pawnee relocation to Oklahoma in the 1870s, and others. There are stories of resilient seed savers, who hid seeds of staple crops so as to preserve them, but in many cases, seeds and other culinary knowledge were lost.
In 2014, I founded The Sioux Chef, part catering company, part food education project that has expanded to become much more. It set me on a path to discover as much as I could about Indigenous foods from texts and experts on history, ethnobotany, archaeology, agriculture, legends and stories. I interviewed and networked with Indigenous elders, farmers, professors, protesters, chefs and food professionals, who have been collectively working to research and share the history of America before colonization. That work has taken me through kitchens and communities across the continent, as well as Europe and India.
I had been invited to the Muckleshoot tribe to present on the work of my company, and on our future nonprofit restaurant, the Indigenous Food Lab. But I also learned about the stories and culinary traditions from the tribal community of that area.
The recipe I developed to feature the region is seared salmon, with crisp salmon skin, seaweed local to that coastline, and fresh blackberries. Many Indigenous communities along the northwest coast have a deep cultural relationship with salmon, and seaweed and fresh berries are understood as food and medicine among Indigenous knowledge keepers everywhere. These ingredients have nourished tribes in that region for a very long time.
My recipe offers an invitation to explore those flavors in your own kitchen. I like the straightforward method of quickly searing and caramelizing the fish to create a charred texture and sweetness. And I let the salmon skin fry up next to the fish into flavorful crisps that accent the dish, along with a simple crumbling of salty dried seaweed and tart blackberries.
All 10 recipes draw inspiration from a region, like bison pot roast with hominy from the Great Plains, heirloom tepary beans with chile-agave glaze from the dry American Southwest, and crawfish and shrimp pot with sassafras from the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Delta.
Of course, 10 recipes barely scratched the surface of what there is to learn, but I chose dishes from different regions that showcase the diversity we have across North America, represent tribal traditions, and include the true flavors of what we know as the United States of America today.

Texto completo: The stars filed a lawsuit on Wednesday as part of an effort to stop fake online endorsements, a growing problem for Hollywood.
LOS ANGELES -- Sandra Bullock and Ellen DeGeneres have spent the last two years in a behind-the-scenes battle with obscure internet companies that peddle beauty products with fabricated endorsements. As soon as one site is taken down, another pops up in its place.
Tired of playing Whac-a-Mole, the stars went public with their fight on Wednesday, filing a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court. They are suing over false advertising and the unauthorized use of their names and likenesses to endorse products -- a "right of publicity" claim. Because Ms. DeGeneres and Ms. Bullock do not know for sure who is behind the fraud, the defendants are identified as John Does Nos. 1 through 100.
"These companies change names frequently, merge in and out of entities formed in states that allow for secrecy, operate websites that pop up and disappear overnight, and generally do everything possible to 'stay one step ahead of the sheriff,"' the complaint said. Michael J. Kump, who is Ms. Bullock's lawyer, and Michael E. Weinsten, who is representing Ms. DeGeneres, can now issue subpoenas to uncover the players.
The lawsuit shines a light on so-called celebrity endorsement theft, which has become a problem for Hollywood in the digital age. It relies on exploiting loopholes in a fast-growing area of advertising known as affiliate marketing.
Affiliate marketing largely involves two online entities: merchants and publishers. Merchants (anyone with something to sell) pay publishers (including bloggers, YouTube influencers, even the New York Times-owned review site Wirecutter) to create ads or links that drive consumers to point-of-sale websites. Each click that results in a sale earns the publisher a commission: 10 percent from Amazon for a luxury beauty purchase, for instance.
By next year, it will be a $ 6.8 billion business, according to estimates from Forrester Consulting, sprawling across websites, email and social media platforms. Most participants are aboveboard. Others are not, and they are the target of the lawsuit filed by Ms. Bullock and Ms. DeGeneres.
A common trick involves setting up fake news sites. The scammers then post a real image -- Ms. Bullock appearing on NBC's "Today" show to promote a film, to use one example from her lawsuit -- that has been doctored to become an endorsement: "Sandra Bullock Talks About Her New Skin Care Line." (She has never had a skin care line.) An accompanying link leads to a site selling the celebrity's supposed products.
Another ad included as an exhibit in the lawsuit fabricated an interview: "Sandra even admitted that plastic surgeons are furious with her after noticing a large decline in patients." (Nope.) In their complaint, the film star and the talk show host listed 40 beauty products that have been sold online with their names fraudulently attached, items like Bella Pelle Wrinkle Cream, that "they have never heard of, used or endorsed."
"The celebrity endorsement-theft business model is based on a scheme to trick consumers into disclosing their credit card and/or debit card information in order to enroll them in costly programs with undisclosed, or poorly disclosed, recurring charges," Ms. Bullock and Ms. DeGeneres said in the complaint. Ads for the products "typically include unsubstantiated claims that the products will lead to dramatic results," they added.
Many of the fake ads associated with Ms. DeGeneres and Ms. Bullock offer free trials. In practice, customers are often charged full price, the complaint said.
Dubious offers of free trials put forward online through affiliate marketers "have infested the internet and social media" and cost more than a million victims upward of $ 1.3 billion over the past decade, according to a report last year from the Better Business Bureau. The number of complaints has also surged abroad, with Australian regulators reporting that for the first nine months of 2018, complaints rose fivefold and losses soared 3,800 percent -- nearly 40 times more than in the previous year.
Fabricated endorsements have been an issue since moviedom's earliest days. The problem became more serious in the 1970s, when advertisers began to pay celebrities huge sums to appear in television commercials: Suddenly a lot of money was at stake. Today, those deals are worth tens of millions of dollars -- more than film work, even for most A-list stars. Julia Roberts, for instance, signed a five-year endorsement contract with Lancôme cosmetics in 2010 that was valued at $ 50 million.
The littering of the internet with phony endorsements can imperil stars' reputations and limit their ability to secure legitimate endorsement deals.
Actresses over 40 whom the public considers trustworthy (Oprah Winfrey, Sally Field, Kelly Ripa) are the most frequent targets of endorsement theft; anti-aging products are one of the biggest rackets. Male stars like Denzel Washington also fall victim, often as fake pitchmen for erectile dysfunction pills.
"It's very hard to track down the source," Mehmet Oz, who hosts "The Dr. Oz. Show," wrote in a Wall Street Journal column in April. His legal team sends out roughly 3,000 cease-and-desist letters a year involving bogus online ads.
The Federal Trade Commission has started to look more closely at affiliate marketing fraud. In one case, the agency found that consumers had been duped into paying $ 179 million over five years for unproven weight-loss, muscle-building and wrinkle-reduction products. The items, advertised on websites designed to resemble publications like Men's Health and Good Housekeeping, featured phony endorsements from celebrities like Paula Deen, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Statham.
Because many affiliate marketing networks are multilayered and purposefully obscured, "it's hard to track down the perpetrators of this kind of fraud," said Susan Grant, director of consumer protection and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. "All of this subterfuge is necessary in order to extend the scam for as long as possible."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO — An advocacy group tracking misinformation says it has found an increase in fake political news shared on Facebook ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
The group, Avaaz, said Wednesday that it found that viral misinformation is still being spread on the social network despite measures Facebook has put in place since the 2016 election. The researchers tracked the 100 most widely shared false news stories between Jan. 1 and Oct. 1 this year. The stories they tracked had all been fact-checked and debunked by Facebook's third-party fact-checking partners, which include The Associated Press.
The group found that, collectively, the fake stories were posted more than 2.3 million times and had an estimated 158.9 million views, along with 8.9 million likes, comments, and shares. The false stories targeted both political parties, though Avaaz says the majority were against Democrats and liberals.
Most of the false news sources were individual users or non-official political pages. Avaaz, a left-leaning online advocacy group, said stories it found spreading even after they were debunked included one falsely claiming that President Trump's grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader and that his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. That story had an estimated 29 million views. Another story falsely claiming that Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar attended an Al Qaeda training camp had an estimated 770,000 views.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report late Tuesday.
Avaaz said in the report that the findings are the "tip of the iceberg of disinformation" ahead of the 2020 election.

Trump to speak at 100th annual New York City Veterans Day Parade
NEW YORK — President Trump may have officially declared himself a full-time Florida resident, but for some reason he keeps returning to his hometown.
On Monday, Trump will be kicking off the 100th annual New York City Veterans Day Parade at Madison Square Park in Manhattan, the event organizers announced Wednesday.
Trump is deeply unpopular in the city, and his visits are often met with protests. On Saturday, Trump popped into Manhattan for an Ultimate Fighting Championship event at Madison Square Garden. The reaction when he arrived: loud boos and some cheers.
The president will give an address at the park. He was also slated to lay a wreath at a memorial inside the park, but the White House decided that he would not after all, according to a parade spokesman, Pat Smith.
Trump will not march in the parade, which begins by the park at 24th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and proceeds north to 48th Street. It kicks off at noon Monday.
For decades, Trump lived in an eponymous skyscraper on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. He began his unlikely presidential bid from its lobby. After winning, he moved to Washington, with only a few trips back to New York City.
But in late September Trump declared that his permanent residence was now his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.
After news broke of the residency change last week, Trump, a Republican, said he had been treated “very badly" by top officials in New York, who are Democrats.
The grand marshals for this year's parade include three Medal of Honor recipients, a Marine who served in the Gulf War, and a decorated Marine infantry officer who served two tours in Iraq.
Douglas McGowan, chairman of the United War Veterans Council, which organizes the annual parade, said in a statement, “This is a day when we put politics aside to focus on honoring our veterans, and to recommit ourselves as a community to providing them with the services they have earned, the services they deserve and, for many, the services they were denied."

Cyclist who lost job after giving Trump middle finger elected to local office in Virginia
The cyclist who lost her job after giving the middle finger to President Trump's motorcade has found a new one after running for local office and ousting a Republican supervisor in Loudoun County, Va., on Tuesday.
The cyclist, Juli Briskman, had been active in local politics before, but in October 2017 she lifted that one specific finger to make a point and ended up gaining the national spotlight.
Trump had just finished a round of golf at his course in Potomac Falls, Va., when his motorcade approached Briskman, who, from the seat of her bicycle, kept her finger raised as the black SUVs passed — and repeated the gesture when she caught up to them in traffic.
News photographers captured images of her protest, and they quickly spread around the internet. The next week, Briskman was told she needed to resign from her job as a marketing analyst for Akima, a federal contractor in Herndon, Va., for violating its social media policy by posting the images online.
Now, as a newly elected member of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Briskman will oversee that same golf course — it's in her district.
Briskman, who ran as a Democrat, defeated the incumbent with just over 52 percent of the vote.
Back in October 2017, Briskman said her “blood started boiling" when Trump's motorcade began to pass her.
“I just got angry," she said then. “I lifted my arm and started flipping him off. I started thinking, 'You're golfing again when there is so much going on right now.' "
She filed a lawsuit over her firing, but it was dismissed by a state judge.
Briskman said in a tweet Tuesday night that she was proud to “#FlipVA." Both chambers of the State Legislature flipped from Republican to Democratic control Tuesday.

'FAKE NEWS': Pence team denies anonymous op-ed author claim about 25th Amendment

Texto completo: A spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence denied a claim in the upcoming anonymous tell-all book that he considered supporting the use of the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office.
"FAKE NEWS," Pence's press secretary Katie Waldman tweeted Wednesday evening.
Tweet
Excerpts from The Warning, written by the anonymous Trump administration official who authored a "resistance" op-ed last year, were reported by the Huffington Post.
High-level White House aides did a tally of Cabinet members they thought would be willing to sign a letter to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment declaring the president unfit to perform his duties. They believed Pence would be in favor of using the 25th Amendment if a majority of the Cabinet agreed to it.
A majority of the Cabinet and the vice president himself would have to sign off on the letter before it got sent to Congress. This would grant Pence the role of acting president.
But the 25th Amendment idea never reached a tangible stage.
In September 2018, the New York Times published an anonymous opinion piece by a senior member of Trump administration who described him or herself as belonging to an internal movement quietly resisting the president. "Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president," the mystery author wrote. "But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over."
At the time, Pence denied being part of any conversation about invoking the 25th Amendment. "No. Never," the vice president said during an interview with CBS News.
Other members of Trump's inner circle reportedly were receptive to the idea of using the 25th Amendment against him in the days after he fired FBI Director James Comey. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein believed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and then-Homeland Security John Kelly could be recruited for such an effort, according to former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.
The Justice Department sent a warning to the anonymous author's publisher warning the book may breach “one or more nondisclosure agreements” signed prior to working in the White House, but the release date of the book remains fixed on Nov. 19.

Masacró a una familia y ahora decidió cambiarse de sexo en prisión

Texto completo: Steven J. Hayes, quien cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por una masacre familiar en Connecticut, está recibiendo terapia hormonal en prisión como parte de una transición de género.
El recluso discutió su plan de cambio de sexo durante una serie de entrevistas telefónicas recientes con Joe Tomaso para el podcast “15 Minutes With…”, informó The New York Times.
Hayes, de 56 años, se encuentra en la prisión estatal Greene en Waynesburg, Pensilvania, después de ser transferido en 2016 como parte de un acuerdo interestatal.
Cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por los asesinatos de Jennifer Hawke-Petit (48) y sus dos hijas, Michaela (11) y Hayley (17), cometidos el 23 de julio de 2007.
“Hay muchos problemas con (mi) presentación como mujer”, dijo Hayes en el podcast. “Mucha gente lo acepta, pero en esta instalación, hay muchos racistas y fanáticos en el personal y no están contentos con eso. Hay dos de nosotros aquí que somos femeninas”.
Hayes todavía usaba el nombre Steven en el podcast, y no dijo cómo prefería ser llamado.
Afirmó tener un diagnóstico médico de disforia de género, en el que la apariencia externa de una persona no se alinea con su estado mental y emocional, y un problema recurrente de drogas.
“Soy transgénero”, dijo Hayes. “Me diagnosticaron a los 16 años con trastorno de identidad sexual. Mi familia nunca lo reconoció y nunca fui tratado”.
Maria Finn, portavoz del Departamento de Correcciones de Pensilvania , dijo que no podía comentar sobre un preso específico, pero comentó que había 222 personas transgénero en instituciones penales estatales.
Finn dijo que el sistema penitenciario estatal no paga las cirugías de afirmación de género, pero gasta $60 mil dólares al año en total y hasta $600 por interno en medicamentos para tratar a quienes tienen disforia de género. Los costos anuales de atención médica promedian $5,582 por recluso, según la vocera.
Además de la terapia hormonal, Hayes habló en el podcast de tratar de obtener “otras cosas” como parte del proceso de transición de género, pero no dio más detalles.
Originalmente Hayes recibió la pena de muerte por la invasión del hogar de Hawke-Petit, junto con un cómplice, Joshua Komisarjevsky, cuya apelación de condena será juzgada por la Corte Suprema de Connecticut.
Ambos fueron condenados a cadena perpetua después de que Connecticut abolió la pena de muerte en 2012, enojando a los partidarios de la pena capital y a los defensores de las víctimas, quienes dijeron que la derogación tenía la intención de ser prospectiva y no aplicable a los reclusos que ya estaban en el corredor de la muerte.
En el ínterin, Hayes se convirtió en judío ortodoxo en la cárcel.
Durante el podcast, expresó su remordimiento por los asesinatos y criticó la apelación de Komisarjevsky.
“No hay defensa para lo que hicimos”, dijo. “No quiero formar parte de este juicio. La familia ya no merece pasar por esto”.
Hayes y Komisarjevsky rastrearon a Hawke-Petit y sus dos hijas desde un supermercado cercano hasta su casa en Cheshire (Connecticut), donde las víctimas fueron retenidas como rehenes, agredidas sexualmente y rociadas con gasolina antes de que su casa fuera incendiada.
Antes de matarlas, Hayes obligó Hawke-Petit a ir a un banco local, donde retiró $15 mil dólares, mientras Komisarjevsky esperaba en la casa de la familia con las dos hijas, de 11 y 17 años.
El único sobreviviente del ataque, el Dr. William Petit Jr., un endocrinólogo que era el esposo y el padre de las víctimas, fue brutalmente golpeado con un bate de béisbol durante la invasión. En 2016 fue elegido miembro de la Cámara de Representantes del estado, por el Partido Republicano.
Hayes habló de haber tenido una recaída de drogas y estar en dificultades financieras en el momento de la invasión de la casa. “No era un monstruo”, afirmó sobre el triple homicidio.

Bill Gates isn't sure how 'open-minded' Elizabeth Warren is

Texto completo: Microsoft founder Bill Gates, one of the richest men in the world with a net worth over $100 billion, thinks wealth taxes like Elizabeth Warren's go too far. But he hasn't spoken with her about it.
“I don't know how open-minded she is or if she'd even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money," Gates said Wednesday at the 2019 New York Times Dealbook Conference.
Warren's wealth tax proposes targeting 2 percent of all assets of more than $50 million, and 3 percent of assets of more than $1 billion.
“I've paid over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to have paid $20 billion, it's fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over," Gates said, adding later that he was “just kidding."
Gates has previously supported an increase in the capital gains tax, the rate at which money made through investments is taxed, and a higher estate tax, which is implemented when a millionaire or billionaire dies and money is passed onto their heirs. But he said Wednesday that too high of a tax could put American innovation at risk.
“I'd love for somebody to find a middle-ground approach," he said.
Warren tweeted Wednesday night that she would meet with Gates to explain her wealth tax.
“I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views...if we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it's not $100 billion.)" she tweeted.
When Dealbook Conference moderator Andrew Ross Sorkin pressed Gates on whether he would vote for Warren if she were the Democratic candidate opposite President Trump on the November 2020 ballot, Gates said he would choose the more “professional" candidate.
“I hope the more professional candidate is an electable candidate," he said.

A Chloé Bag For Just $1,690? Barneys Starts Liquidating

Texto completo: A liquidation sale at Barneys means ... 5 percent off luxury handbags. For now, at least.
Days after Barneys New York was sold for pieces, the store-closing sales have started, with windows bearing signs that proclaim "Everything must be sold!" and in a smaller font: "Goodbuys, then goodbye!"
But a warning before you run out the door: It's a very Barneys kind of sale.
You'll find a Chloé bag for $ 1,690, or $ 85 off the pre-sale price. You could grab an Altuzarra sweater for $ 625.50, marked down from $ 695. Or you can wait and play chicken -- the luxury retail version -- with the liquidation specialists running the sales.
Shoppers wandered into the Barneys Madison Avenue flagship on Tuesday, asking salespeople about discounts on merchandise like handbags. Several left empty-handed after learning that the deals were currently in the range of 5 to 10 percent off and that wares from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton were excluded entirely.
The discounts should increase during the course of the sale "based on a somewhat mathematical, somewhat artful formula," said Scott Carpenter, president of retail solutions at B. Riley Financial's Great American Group, which is handling the sales.
Mr. Carpenter explained that the discounts account for the sales history of a particular item, and a sense of its desirability, and noted that this was a departure from other liquidations that his firm had overseen in recent memory, including Toys "R" Us and Payless Shoe Source.
"They're very high-end, very exclusive designers," Mr. Carpenter said. The retail value of all of Barney's merchandise right now is about $ 500 million, he said.
The company hopes to sell the bulk of its luxury wares -- from five full-price Barneys stores, two outlets and their corresponding websites -- by the end of December but is prepared to run sales into February if necessary. Competing stores generally begin their holiday sales around Nov. 20, which gives Barneys a two-week lead on pocketbooks.
The beleaguered department store was sold in two parts in a $ 271 million deal: Its intellectual property went to the licensing firm Authentic Brands Group while its assets, including reams of designer shoes, tuxedos and coats, were bought by B. Riley.
Authentic Brands, whose plans for the brand include licensing it to Saks Fifth Avenue for shop-in-shops, might operate stores named Barneys in the future. However, Mr. Carpenter said his firm "will sell every stitch of product" in its current locations, shuttering Barneys as it is known today. As part of an agreement with Authentic Brands, the sales are being referred to as "store closing sales" rather than "going out of business" sales.
Executives at many of the high-end brands stocked at Barneys are holding their breath, hoping the sale is not too disruptive. Some are trying to buy back their merchandise. LVMH is the only vendor with an agreement that says its goods cannot be discounted, which it struck with Barneys after the retailer filed for bankruptcy in August, Mr. Carpenter said.
He added that LVMH, whose labels include Celine and Givenchy, even had the right to pull its goods entirely, though the luxury goods purveyor has not exercised that option. He noted that store closing sales often doubled store traffic, which can benefit even full-price brands.
Shoppers with store credit at Barneys will need to use it by Thursday, and returns will not be accepted after Nov. 15.
A sales associate at the store at Madison Avenue and 61st Street said on Tuesday that employees had lost their 60 percent-off discounts after Sunday and that they were anxious about what they would do for work after the liquidation. The associate, who asked not to be identified, citing fear of retribution, said staff members had not received answers to questions about future jobs with the Barneys label through Authentic Brands.
Mr. Carpenter said many of the associates earned commissions and, as a result, would make more money as the firm expected to "double the sales they would normally have had during this holiday period."
When Barneys filed for bankruptcy, its biggest unsecured creditors included the Row, with a $ 3.7 million claim; Yves Saint Laurent, with a $ 2.2 million claim; and Balenciaga, with a $ 2.1 million claim. Others on the list were Celine, Gucci, Prada, Chloé and Azzedine Alaïa.
"We've been contacted by a number of vendors that want to buy their product back, but we haven't made any agreements with any of them," Mr. Carpenter said.
"We're open to talking to them, but generally speaking, they want to buy their stuff back at a discount -- I'd rather sell it to you at a discount," he said. "Some have indicated they might just go into a store and buy the product if they want to do that."

Texto completo: Beto O'Rourke on Friday announced he is ending his bid for president, leaving the question of what's next for the former congressman wide open.
O'Rourke entered the presidential race in March after running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Ted Cruz. The El Paso native narrowly lost the race, but used the momentum from his senate bid as a launching pad for his presidential campaign.
On Friday — after struggling to break through in the polls and with fundraising numbers that lagged behind others in the crowded field — O'Rourke announced that his time as a Democratic presidential candidate had come to a close.
"Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully," O'Rourke said in a news release. "My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee."
As he stumped across the country for president, many expressed desire for O'Rourke to run for senate again, this time against U.S. Sen. John Cornyn.
The race has garnered a large field of Democratic candidates, and more than once while on the trail O'Rourke has ruled out a senate run.
"Let me make your show the place where I tell you and I tell the country I will not in any scenario run for the United States Senate," O'Rourke told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell in August.
However, the filing deadline for the senate race is Dec. 9, 2019, meaning there's still time for him to enter. Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston political science professor, said O'Rourke isn't lacking in his ability to excite Democrats.
"So he's always a figure in the party, but the race has hardened and you've got some top quality candidates running that would be unhappy if O'Rourke suddenly decided to jump into the senate race," Rottinghaus said.
A spokesperson for O'Rourke said the former candidate wasn't available for comment but did say O'Rourke isn't running for senate.
The New York Times reported Friday that Rob Friedlander, communications director for O'Rourke, said "Beto will not be a candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas in 2020."
Were he to enter the race, garnering the same level of support he had in 2018 may be more of a challenge, Rottinghaus said. O'Rourke may have, politically, moved too far to the left for many Texas voters, he said.
"Politically it would be a taller order than it was two years ago," Rottinghaus said.
Some of the Democrats challenging Cornyn took to Twitter after the news of O'Rourke dropping out broke. MJ Hegar, a former Air Force combat pilot, thanked O'Rourke for "representing Texas on the national stage with authenticity and candor."
"From fighting for a real end to gun violence to defending the humanity of immigrants, your voice and perspective moved us forward," said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, who is also running for the seat and has served as a political activist and organizer, on Twitter.
"We look forward to getting your endorsement so we can defeat John Cornyn in 2020," the post states.
Texas Democrats suggested O'Rourke still has a role to play in the state's Democratic party.
Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement that "Beto O'Rourke has done amazing things for the Democratic Party in Texas, and we look forward to his future."
A spokesperson for the Texas Democratic Party declined to elaborate on what could be next for O'Rourke.
"He really did want to make Texas and the entire country a better place for us," said Iliana Holguin, chair of the El Paso Democratic Party. "We are sad he'll no longer be in the race."
One possibility is O'Rourke being tapped for Vice President. Rottinghaus said he may be on the short list for several folks.
"His ability to excite voters in Texas potentially puts Texas in play, which is a game changer for a Democrat running for president," Rottinghaus said.
That said, there are going to be many candidates vying for the second-command spot, including those who may more closely match the future nominee ideologically. Rottinghaus said he has a harder time picturing O'Rourke in a cabinet role.
"Those are kind of formulaic, administrative roles that don't lend themselves to the skill set that O'Rourke has developed on the campaign trail," Rottinghaus said.

Texto completo: If you are looking for the perfect gift for your most stylish friend, several new books are bound to please. While the words "icon" or "legendary" get thrown around loosely, these books all feature true masters of style in different genres: men's and women's fashion, music and art. Whether it's getting a rare peek behind the making of Chanel's haute couture collection or slice-of-life images of New York street style, there's something guaranteed to delight and inspire any reader.
"Bowie: An Illustrated Life"
By María Hesse and Fran Ruiz
One of the most innovative artists of the 20th century, David Bowie created work that crossed genres and shattered boundaries. This inventive biography told through María Hesse's hip illustrations and text by Fran Ruiz explores his life from his working-class childhood as David Jones to his transformation to David Bowie and eventual superstardom to the final recording sessions before his death from cancer in 2016. Told from Bowie's viewpoint, readers follow along his personal and professional life and meet many of the famous musicians he interacted with, including Iggy Pop, Brian Eno, Freddie Mercury and others. $21.95
"Chanel: The Making
of a Collection"
By Laetitia Cénac, Illustrated by Jean-Philippe Delhome
Rarely can mere mortals glimpse how a fashion collection comes together from idea to fruition, but the new book about the House of Chanel by fashion writer Laetitia Cénac pulls back the curtains. This 240-page book contains hundreds of color illustrations by famed artist Jean-Philippe Delhomme detailing Karl Lagerfeld's Spring 2019 collection - Lagerfeld's last before his death. The book also highlights the work of the artisans who create the fashion house's distinct style, the embroiderers, flower-makers, shoemakers and many others. Cénac weaves in the history of the iconic house with its contemporary collections. $35
"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going:
The Art Scene and Downtown New York
in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95
"Hunks & Heroes:
Jim Moore Four Decades of Fashion at GQ"
By Jim Moore
Few editors have had such an influence on men's fashion as Jim Moore, GQ magazine's famed creative director at large. For nearly 40 years, Moore shaped modern men's fashion, discovering new designers, highlighting trends and giving fashion advice and critiques. The book contains 250 of Moore's legendary fashion photographs that showcase in an eye-popping manner the magazine's most memorable covers, many in a double gatefold. It's not simply a look book of cool covers and celebrities but also includes Moore's commentary and shows the evolution of men's style through the decades. Classic covers include a 1980s "American Gigolo"-era Richard Gere and Kanye West, who does the forward for the 352-page book. $75
"Bill Cunningham: On the Street: Five Decades of Iconic Photography"
By The New York Times
From the 1970s until his death in 2016, New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham captured New York street style almost daily. A new book by the newspaper chronicles through his eyes not only how fashion changed over nearly 50 years, but also how people and culture changed. The book focuses heavily on style - it includes essays and contributions from Anna Wintour, Guy Trebay and others - but also on important moments, such as the 1980s New York transit strike, the rise of casual Fridays and President Barack Obama's inauguration. The 384-page book contains famous Cunningham photographs that ran in The New York Times and many never-seen-before images of how he captured life. $65

CONWAY FITS RIGHT IN WITH THIS WHITE HOUSE AUDIO OF A RECENT SCREED DIRECTED AT A JOURNALIST IS SURE TO IMPRESS THE PRESIDENT

Texto completo: As White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway has a simple job that is often - because of clown shows and self-inflicted wounds - not so simple: She has to make the president look good.
As of late, however, Ms. Conway is making herself look bad. As a former congressional aide and pollster, she knows a lot about politics and public opinion. But her people skills need work.
What triggered Ms. Conway was an article written by Caitlin Yilek, who covers breaking news for the Washington Examiner. Ms. Yilek wrote about how Ms. Conway is being considered for White House chief of staff, and the article included a line about how Ms. Conway has "been in the middle of [President] Trump's barbs with her husband, George, a conservative lawyer who frequently makes headlines for his criticism of the president."
Ms. Conway was furious and had her assistant contact Ms. Yilek. Then she grabbed the phone and leapt into a seven-minute screed.
The newspaper posted the audio as well as a transcript of the full exchange.
"I was wondering why in God's Earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway's tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff," Ms. Conway told Ms. Yilek.
The conversation went downhill from there. The low points include Ms. Conway calling Ms. Yilek a "non-reporting reporter," dismissing the reference to any conflict between her work life and home life as "just for clicks," and informing the reporter that "nobody read your story."
At first, Ms. Conway tried to deny that there was any bad blood between her husband and her boss.
Last year, George Conway called the Trump administration a "[expletive] show in a dumpster fire." Earlier this year, he suggested Mr. Trump had a narcissistic disorder. You think?
Mr. Trump fired back by calling the lawyer a "stone cold LOSER&husband from hell" and a "whack job."
Meanwhile, back on the call between Kellyanne Conway and the reporter, things got weird - and a little mean. Portraying herself as a victim, the White House counselor played the woman card. She suggested that it was sexist to mention a woman's spouse in an article about her. When Ms. Yilek offered to connect Ms. Conway with her editor, who happens to be a man, she went off.
"You're really going places," Ms. Conway snarked. "Let me tell you something, from a powerful woman. Don't pull the crap where you're trying to undercut another woman based on who she's married to. He gets his power through me, if you haven't noticed. Not the other way around."
Gee, insecure much? That would make one heck of an inscription on an anniversary card.
I don't think Ms. Conway understands feminism. I'll have to check the handbook, but I don't think you get to claim you're being singled out because you're a woman and then attack another woman.
She went on: "You characterize me as being caught in the middle of something that I'm not caught in the middle of. So why would you do that? Are you an expert on my marriage? Are you an expert on my job?"
My favorite part was when Ms. Conway - who, for the record, has never been a journalist, only a talking head - lectured Ms. Yilek on how to be a journalist. That was priceless.
Ms. Conway asked for "a journalistic reason" why the reporter had dragged her husband into the story, even in a passing reference. "If you're going to call yourself a reporter, let's see some reporting," she said.
At the end, came the warning. That's where Ms. Conway went all "big brother" on the journalist - the real journalist, not the one that Ms. Conway imagines herself to be.
"If you're going to cover my personal life, then we're welcome to do the same around here," she said.
That's pretty clear - and a tad scary. You poke around in our personal lives, she tells the reporter, and "we" will poke around in yours.
Other journalists called that a "threat," which Ms. Conway denied - in a somewhat threatening manner. Discussing the call later with reporters, she said: "If I threaten someone, you'll know it."
Over the course of just a few minutes, Ms. Conway showed that she's no feminist, no journalist, no professional and no help to a White House that already has more than its share of side shows and where chaos is the natural order.
All of which means she's a natural for the job of White House chief of staff. A broken president needs people around him who are just as broken.
Congratulations, Kellyanne. I await your call.

E.U. Defends Farm Subsidy Program

Texto completo: Outright fraud is rare, officials said. A Times investigation found that the program helps underwrite oligarchs, mobsters and far-right populists.
BRUSSELS -- European Union officials, questioned about new revelations of corruption and exploitation of the bloc's farm subsidies, said Monday that outright fraud was very rare and that auditors swiftly root it out.
But they also acknowledged that law enforcement often falls to the same national leaders who warp the system -- and benefit from it.
"We are not here to replace national governments," said Mina Andreeva, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the administrative arm of the 28-nation European Union.
The responses at a daily news briefing came after a lengthy New York Times investigation that showed how oligarchs, populist leaders and their families have made millions of dollars from European farm subsidies, often based on dubious land deals or outright corruption.
European subsidies have helped underwrite Mafia-style tactics in Slovakia and enrich a cadre of politically powerful land barons in Bulgaria. The Times tracked at least $ 42 million in subsidies last year to companies owned by the prime minister of the Czech Republic, Andrej Babis.
The Times report showed how, under the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, farmland has been auctioned off to political patrons and to members of Mr. Orban's own family. Since farm subsidies are linked to the land, the government auctions immediately made the new owners eligible for huge amounts of European subsidies each year.
Ms. Andreeva noted that European authorities were auditing Mr. Babis' companies and that, in response, Czech authorities have frozen some subsidies. She also pointed out that a European public prosecutor, a newly created position, is scheduled to begin work at the end of next year.
That prosecutor will have authority to investigate crimes against the European Union's budget. Hungary is among six countries, however, that refuse to participate in that project. Despite pressure to join, Mr. Orban says prosecutions must be left to the national governments.
The Commission has proposed new rules that would require countries to uphold rule-of-law standards to qualify for money. Hungarian politicians strongly oppose that effort.
In response to the Times report, journalists from several European countries pressed officials about whether subsidy manipulation, when overseen by national governments, enabled fraud to fall through the cracks.
"Obviously there is a no-mans land between the national responsibility for such malpractices and the lack of oversight on behalf of the European Union," said Georgi Gotev, the publisher of the news site Euractiv's publication in Bulgaria.
The Times report showed how the subsidies have been channeled to that country's politically connected elite. Mr. Gotev said he tried to get answers from European officials a year ago about this problem and was referred to local officials, who refused to answer questions.
For years, populist politicians across the continent, including national leaders like Mr. Orban, have condemned the European Union for domestic political gain. They denounce Brussels as an intrusive force, a threat to their national sovereignty, even as they eagerly accept its largesse.
The European Union is not a country and does not have a government, per se. The administration of most of the bloc's budget is governed by what is known as "shared management" -- meaning that the European Commission supervises the spending but national governments carry it out.
"We're acting precisely within our powers," Ms. Andreeva said. But the weakness revealed by the Times investigation is not that the European Union fails to follow its own rules, but that those rules are not enough to restrain abuses.
Europe's $ 65 billion annual farm fund is one of the biggest subsidy programs in the world, accounting for 40 percent of the European Union's budget. The bloc spends three times as much on agricultural subsidies as the United States, and the money is widely seen as sacrosanct.
The farm program dates to the foundation of the European Union itself, and it is one of the key elements that hold the bloc together.
European Commission officials have in years past proposed restrictions like capping how much any one farmer can receive. Such a cap could help narrow the chasm between small farmers and the wealthiest agriculturalists who receive the bulk of the public assistance.
But such proposals have never survived the legislative process. A subsidy cap is once again up for debate as lawmakers discuss the next version of the subsidy bill.

Texto completo: What’s worse: President Trump’s history of egregious spelling errors, or the gaggle of media personalities who try to turn poor spelling into a scandalous offense? If you want Trump out of office, the answer is certainly the latter.
It almost seems as if the media wants to keep impeachment approval ratings from growing, as some journalists have been working overtime not to investigate any of Trump’s actual missteps, but to discredit him with the fatal blow of ... typos on his Twitter account.
Over the weekend, CNN’s Brian Stelter dedicated an entire segment to a scathing takedown of Trump and his sloppy tweeting. Stelter, who claimed this summer that “the president's hateful tweets make journalists less safe,” argued, “if he can’t get the small stuff right, people worry about the big stuff.”
For people who were on the fence before, this deep dive into the spelling expertise of the commander in chief will surely change their minds.
“On average, Trump makes a spelling error at least one out of every five days,” Stelter explained gravely, adding that Trump has made more than 188 spelling errors on Twitter since taking office. Incidentally, the screen Stelter references reads “misspelling errors,” which, as a double negative, means Trump is pretty great at spelling. Yet there's no mention from Stelter on CNN's own grammatical failings.
Stelter then compares Trump to Barack Obama, claiming that since Trump took office, the former president has made zero spelling errors. “Well, this says it all,” he concludes unironically. This makes sense because, as we’ve been told by CNN, Obama's administration was scandal-free.
iFrame Object
In the abstract, a president who doesn’t know capital from the Capitol is pretty funny. At least, it would be if the media could stop pretending that spelling errors are somehow a threat.
“It’s actually not that funny," Stelter warns, in case you were inclined to find any mirth in the situation. “I know English teachers are horrified by the president’s poor form.”
Oh no. Not the English teachers!
Actually, a lot of English teachers would likely dock Stelter's grade for such a hyperbolic reading of the source material.
Unable to explain why spelling errors matter so much, Stelter says, “It gets this deeper issue about his inaccuracy. Of course, some of his aides claim that the misspellings make him authentic. I just think his English teachers would have flunked him for that excuse.”
Ah, if only his English teachers had flunked him in high school, we might not have Drumpf today.
Stelter, who shared a seemingly anti-Trump H. L. Mencken quote this spring, might want to ignore the journalist’s inconvenient quote about spelling: “Correct spelling, indeed, is one of the arts that are far more esteemed by schoolma’ams than by practical men, neck-deep in the heat and agony of the world.”
Nevertheless, Trump’s Twitter has become the latest campaign of the #Resistance.
Over the weekend, the New York Times published “9 key takeaways” from “Trump’s Twitter presidency.” The article noted — before the banal "scoop" that he might not tweet in public because he doesn’t want people to see him in glasses — that some of the accounts he follows on Twitter follow bad accounts.
This, presumably, reflects poorly on Trump. Did the authors stretch before making that reach?
For his part, Trump knows the media is losing its mind over his Twitter. To him, it is funny.
One of his most famous typos came in the now-deleted tweet, “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.” To confound the media's bewilderment, he added hours later, “Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’ ??? Enjoy!”
There is no "true meaning," but that won’t stop CNN and the New York Times for looking for one. So Trump will continue to send the media after red herrings, tweeting as he did Monday morning: “But how do you know it was a 'mistweet?' May be something with deep meaning!”

Nominate Elizabeth Warren to secure Trump a second term

Texto completo: The 2020 election is the Democratic Party's race to lose.
It increasingly looks like they're choosing to do just that.
Despite presiding over the lowest unemployment rate in half a century and the longest bull market in history, President Trump cannot win favor beyond his base. His approval ratings have remained far underwater. As evidence mounts that he pressured Ukraine's president to dig up dirt on domestic political foes by threatening to withhold aid, nearly every Democrat in the country has come around to supporting impeachment.
Trump's base, the segment that promises they'll stick by him no matter what, is stagnant at one-quarter of the electorate.
Democrats really, really hate Trump, and many Republicans still refuse to embrace him. Yet, by two historically predictive metrics, state polling and economic predictions, Trump will handily win reelection if Democrats choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as their candidate.
As it turns out, the only Democratic front-runner who can hold together the Obama coalition — high minority turnout and northern white voters — is President Barack Obama's beloved veep, Joe Biden. Since long before he announced his third bid for the White House, Biden has maintained a double-digit lead in head-to-head polling against Trump.
Warren, the only candidate other than fourth-place South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg to make any meaningful gains in primary polling, has also held consistent leads over Trump outside the margin of error. But as those of us following state polling and job reports have been warning for months, she's both the media's favorite candidate and the one most uniquely situated to replicate Hillary Clinton's historic electoral failure.
Clinton won the popular vote by 2.9 million votes, or just over 2% of the total vote share, but she lost the Electoral College by a combined margin of 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. This gave Trump a critical 46 electoral votes and the Oval Office.
New polling of likely voters from the New York Times hints that Warren could easily win twice Clinton's popular vote margin and still lose the electoral college. This would involve her losing all three of those states, Florida, and North Carolina. The only place where she appears destined to outperform Clinton is in Arizona, where she and Trump are tied.
Astoundingly, a whopping 6% of the country would vote for Biden but not for Warren.
Trump has never been as politically vulnerable as he is right now, yet swing states haven't turned on him. Even as his favorability in those states hasn't improved, impeachment remains politically toxic in swing states. Even if those farmers harmed by his trade war and suburban women who gave Democrats the House in 2018 out of disgust with Trump still dislike him on a personal level, they won't vote to triple our annual deficit and crash their 401(k) plans thanks to a crisis in consumer and investor confidence spurred by a President Warren. Furthermore, Warren has failed to appeal enough to minority voters, the backbone of the Democratic electorate.
Clinton, in losing, won a nearly 80-point margin among black voters in 2016. Warren is currently polling more than 10 points behind where she was in this category. Warren is also underperforming Clinton among Hispanic voters, winning by 24 points compared to Clinton's 35 points. Among other nonwhite voters, Clinton earned an 11-point lead, whereas Warren leads by only 3 points.
Biden, in contrast, polls just as well as Clinton among minorities while increasing his support among both college and non-college-educated white voters.
Unlike Clinton, Warren hasn't spent a quarter of a century as the enemy No. 1 of the Right. The skeletons in her closet — embellishing her background, questionable scholarship, past corporate hypocrisy — are of the normal politician's ilk and are unlikely to overshadow Trump's scandals.
But her top-line plans for a $52 trillion "Medicare for all" program and punishing middle-class tax hikes are not the way to excite black Democrats, who are significantly more moderate than her media cheerleaders and also less likely to turn out for someone they dislike.
And in a time of relative domestic stability and prosperity, Warren's radicalism undercuts the easiest and most obvious case against Trump. The country may be tired of constant chaos in the White House, but if the alternative is planned chaos that will destroy your retirement savings, then suddenly those Twitter tirades become a lot easier to stomach.
The clock is ticking down to the Iowa caucuses, and a late-breaking uptick in polling for Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar may prove promising to moderates looking for an alternative to the septuagenarian Biden. But if Democrats are serious about taking down Trump, they would be wise to coalesce around Biden. They nominate Warren at their own peril.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump empieza la semana con pésimas noticias, ya que el Segundo Circuito Tribunal de Apelaciones determinó que deberá entregar ocho años de sus declaraciones de impuestos personales y corporativas a los fiscales de Manhattan.
Es posible que los defensores del mandatario busquen un nuevo camino para evitar entregar dichos informes: acudir a la Corte Suprema, según The New York Times.
Los fiscales de Manhattan están investigando el papel del presidente y su negocio en los pagos en efectivo hechos la estrella de cine porno Stormy Daniels , y a la exmodelo de Playboy Karen McDougal antes de las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, quienes acusaron tener amoríos con él, pero su silencio fue “comprado”.
Esta batalla legal comenzó a fines de agosto después de que se pidiera a la firma de contabilidad del presidente Trump, Mazars USA, las declaraciones de impuestos y las de su negocio familiar que datan de 2011.
El objetivo es determinar si el mandatario y su empresa, la Organización Trump, violaron alguna ley del estado de Nueva York, al realizar el pago y reembolsar el dinero al exabogado personal del republicano, Michael Cohen.

3 billion fewer birds comes as a shock to many

Texto completo: When a team of Cornell University researchers and others published a bird study in the online journal Science on Sept. 19, they didn't expect the worldwide reaction that followed.
The findings: North America has lost 2.9 billion birds in the past 50 years — 29% of the avian population.
The impact: An ecosystem is losing a key component and it's a sign of a quickly changing environment that will affect other wildlife, plants and more.
The spotlight: Once the study was released, the New York Times picked up the story and highlighted a startling statement from David Yarnold, president and chief executive of the National Audubon Society, who called the findings "a full-blown crisis." Other major media outlets picked up the story, and conservationists around the world were shocked and inspired to take action.
"The reaction to the study has been phenomenal. We were hoping for a big response," said Ken Rosenberg, an applied conservation scientist at Cornell, the study's lead author and a leader of research and planning on joint initiatives by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology Lab and the American Bird Conservancy.
"We expected some response, but this is the biggest thing we've seen for a bird paper. It was amazing to see the findings on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post. All of networks talking birds for one day was so great. The trick now is how to keep the interest and keep the momentum going so it is not a headline that disappears."
From Ithaca and beyond To publish the study, the team of scientists tracked birds for decades, and parts of the study came from Ithaca's backyards and skies, as countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers submitted their observations to databases and helped carry out studies of bird populations every year.
Some of the most fascinating parts of the study came from weather radar maps as the researches found some types of birds were declining in population, but others, such as waterfowl and raptors, were increasing in numbers.
"It was quite overwhelming," said Adriaan Dokter, a research associate at Cornell. "It reached Europe, too. It went all over the world. It was more than what we expected."
Dokter noted he and Rosenberg were interviewed by Australian, Dutch and Spanish media.
"People see this trend not just here, but in Europe," Dokter said. "It's not just a local U.S. phenomenon, but a trend all over the world."
To Dokter, the confirmation of the population decrease across hundreds of bird species is like a canary in a coal mine.
"It's a decrease in the vitality of the ecosystem that we see. Birds depend on insects. Insects are important to the ecosystem of plants," he said. "It means something fundamental in our environment ... It's a warning sign that we have to be careful. Things are rapidly changing."
How scientists researched the decline in birds Surveying: Scientists and amateurs observed birds to complete censuses.
Weather radar: Scientists examined weather radar maps to determine the cumulative weight of birds in the sky.
Research: Researchers examined hundreds of different surveys.
Analysis: After finding the best data from the surveys, scientists conducted statistical analyses to determine how much populations have decreased.
The team at Cornell partnered with the American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, Canadian Wildlife Service, the Georgetown University Georgetown Environment Initiative, United States Geological Survey and the Smithsonian National Zoological Park Conservation Biology Institute.
"'Were there declines or shifts?'" Rosenberg said about the questions researchers had years ago. "Someone never did this comprehensive work."
Researchers then obtained answers they were searching for — there's been an overall decline in the bird population, and the largest declines have been in the most common species.
"It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised," Rosenberg said.
Using weather radar, Dokter was able to pick up the cumulative weights of birds migrating, which he later analyzed. The birds he researched tended to be long-distance migratory birds, which contribute more to the bio-life on radar maps.
"The U.S. has a very large network of radars that cover ... anything in the sky — not just weather, but also wildlife," Dokter said. "Birds give strong signals. More and more have realized this, and it's an important data source for biologists. If you look at it on your iPhone, you don't see the individual bird, but a blob of bio-life moving. That's what is used for birds.
"We don't see the numbers, but the kilograms of birds in the skies. What we did see recently is the amount of migration that has changed. It's a nice complement to what's seen on ground. Radar gives really good coverage. With radar, we can count many more birds than what we could count on the ground."
Bird biomass in the skies has decreased by about 14% since 2007, Dokter told the Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University's in-house publication.
"The decline in night skies might be steeper than what we see on the ground. It's migratory birds, especially birds that travel long distance ... they seem to be not doing too well," Dokter said. "It's what I want to document next, and the why and what we can do to turn it around. Where do they face the most problems and challenges?"
Outside of weather radar data, scientists looked through more than 500 surveys, Rosenberg said. They then used a statistical model to analyze the data.
Locals get involved in tracking bird population The primary data source was the North American Breeding Bird Survey, which started in 1966 as a collaboration between scientists and bird-watchers.
While there have been studies on the changes of bird populations on the continent, the most recent study was the first time anyone has ever collected and analyzed 50 years' worth of data and findings in North America.
For decades, countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers have submitted their observations to databases. In the new research, professionals examined those studies to estimate the populations of 529 species from 2006 to 2015.
"The study published in Science was shocking to me, with its report of just how deeply bird populations have crashed since 1970," said Diane Morton, president of the Cayuga Bird Club. "The paper let us know that it is not just our subjective impression that there are fewer birds now, but that hundreds of different bird species really are much, much less abundant than they used to be.
"Among other alarming declines, the authors reported that forest birds like warblers, and grassland species like meadowlarks and sparrows, now number hundreds of millions fewer than in the 1970s."
The Cayuga Bird Club's annual Christmas Bird Count contributed to the findings. In addition, the club also counts birds for the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas.
"It was rewarding for those of us who participate in the annual Christmas Bird Count to know that the numbers we gather in our bird counts year after year were useful for these analyses," Morton said. "We did not provide any direct input, but our participation in citizen science projects generated some of the data that this extensive study used."
Surveys by Rosenberg and other local scientists contributed as well.
"The birders are the eyes of the world," he said. "You need to have all the eyes and ears out there because scientists can't do it alone. But it's not just the observation of amateurs. It's data collected for the purpose of the survey."
Birds that have seen the largest decrease The research shows most of the birds lost belong to 12 families, including warblers, finches, sparrows and swallows.
Birds associated with farmlands have seen the largest decline in numbers and percentage.
"Some birds in our backyards are the steepest in decline that we see," Dokter said. "Hopefully, it will lead to action take care of nature."
Out of all of the bird families, the largest decline was among larks. There are 70 million fewer Eastern meadowlarks, 60 million fewer Western meadowlarks, and a 67% decline for all larks.
"We're seeing this loss of abundance, because birds are integral parts of ecosystems. They perform ecological functions like seed dispersal," Rosenberg said. "The loss of this chunk of birds is causing ecological consequences. Because we have this data on birds, the fear that is happening with birds is happening across the board with other animals."
What's being done for North American birds The National Audubon Society has responded strongly to the report and is mobilizing its 1.65 million members to urge lawmakers to act on bird conservation.
The organization is pushing for the passing of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act and implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Both plans focus on providing an optimal environment and water for birds in the regions.
The group also wants lawmakers to defend and reinforce the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which the Trump administration has been trying to weaken. Conservationists say the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects close to 1,000 species of North American birds and is the most import bird conservation law in the U.S.
How you can help the birds Individuals can take a variety of actions to help, including making windows safer, reducing plastic use, keeping cats indoors, using native plants and avoiding the use of pesticides. To learn more, visit 3billionbirds.org/.
What's next for the bird population The Cayuga Bird Club will census birds for the next New York Breeding Bird Atlas, which will have five years of surveys starting from January 2020.
"The Science paper is a call to action," Morton said. "It has sparked more urgent discussion about how to address the decline of bird populations — through conservation management, changing the developed landscape to provide better habitat for birds, and taking individual steps to reduce the threats that birds face. Continued monitoring of bird populations will also be important for prioritizing conservation efforts."
Because the study did not state the reasons for the decrease in bird populations, Rosenberg said he and the researchers are assembling a group of experts early next year to investigate the causes of the declines.
"The most important thing is that this doesn't become a news flash," Rosenberg said "We want people to pay attention and to track birds.
"People who love birds have to speak up. ... We won't reverse the declines unless people who love birds demand action."

Texto completo: While the House has been conducting an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and others in his administration have kept their focus on the White House-released memo on Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, claiming that simply reading the "transcript" is all that's needed to evaluate the impeachment probe. But congressional testimony has revealed key pieces of information beyond that conversation.
Trump questioned the need for any more testimony in an Oct. 29 tweet, saying, "How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT!"
Vice President Mike Pence similarly twice said in an Oct. 28 "PBS NewsHour" interview that if the American people "read the transcript," they "will see the president did nothing wrong. There was no quid pro quo."
Earlier this month, on Oct. 2, Trump said, "The whistleblower was wrong. The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the president of Ukraine. It was perfect." (The transcript actually backed up the three main points the whistleblower made about the July phone call, as we've written before.)
The House Democrats' inquiry concerns Trump's decision to withhold appropriated security aid to Ukraine and whether he did so to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 political rival.
Trump's July 25 phone call was one of the events described in an Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint. Trump, according to the White House memo on the call, told Zelensky the U.S. "has been very very good to Ukraine" and asked for "a favor," that Zelensky look into CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee after its computer network was hacked by Russian intelligence officers. That's an apparent reference to a debunked conspiracy theory.
In his phone call, Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. As we've written, Trump has distorted the facts when he has claimed that Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold "billions of dollars to Ukraine" unless it removed the prosecutor general who "was prosecuting" Biden's son, Hunter, and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. There's no evidence Hunter Biden was ever being investigated or prosecuted.
But the House impeachment probe has revealed that several government officials raised concerns about Trump's phone call and actions before and after the call.
While the testimony so far has occurred behind closed doors, many of the prepared opening statements have been released, and some details of the sessions have been reported by the press. The House is set to vote on a resolution on Oct. 31 that would set the rules for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry.
Here are several key moments we have learned regarding Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
What was left out Time after time, Trump has falsely claimed that the White House released an "exact word-for-word transcript" or "verbatim transcript" of his July 25 phone call with Zelensky.
But as we've written before, the White House memo of the call includes a "caution" note saying it "is not a verbatim transcript." It is the "notes and recollections," it said, of staff "assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation."
Ellipses are used three times in the memo, seeming to indicate missing words.
The New York Times, citing three unnamed sources, reported that, in private testimony before House impeachment investigators on Oct. 29, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the White House's National Security Council who listened in on the July 25 call, testified that certain words and phrases were omitted and that his subsequent attempt to have them included was not successful.
"The omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump's assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden's son Hunter," the Times said. The newspaper also reported that Vindman "tried to change the reconstructed transcript made by the White House staff to reflect the omissions. But while some of his edits appeared to have been successful, he said, those two corrections were not made."
Vindman reportedly said that at the point in the memo where the third set of ellipses appears, Trump mentioned there being tapes of Biden — which the Times said was "an apparent reference" to Biden's comments at a January 2018 event about his efforts as vice president to get Ukraine to force out Viktor Shokin as its prosecutor general.
According to the memo, Trump said, "There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me." (As we've written, Biden didn't brag about stopping "the prosecution.")
In his opening statement to House investigators, Vindman said he was concerned by the call and reported those concerns to the NSC's legal counsel.
"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security," he said.
'Two channels' of US policymaking It was known long before the whistleblower's complaint that New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the president's private lawyer, was working in Ukraine on behalf of his client. In May, the New York Times reported that Giuliani planned to visit Ukraine to encourage Zelensky to "pursue inquiries" involving political matters that could help Trump's 2020 reelection: "One is the origin of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The other is the involvement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch."
But the impeachment inquiry has shed light on Giuliani's influence on U.S. policy toward Ukraine inside the administration.
In his Oct. 22 opening statement to the House committees, William B. Taylor, the chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, said there were "two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation" in Ukraine, which he called "regular" and "highly irregular."
"[T]he irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani," Taylor said, and included Energy Secretary Rick Perry; Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union; and Kurt Volker, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine at the time.
Taylor, who spent his career in public service and had been ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, was tapped for his current job by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after Marie Yovanovitch's assignment as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was cut short in May.
This is how Taylor described the U.S. policy toward Ukraine when he arrived in Kyiv in June:
Taylor, Oct. 22: There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the Chief of Mission, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes, including the bulk of the U.S. effort to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion and to help it defeat corruption. This regular channel of U.S. policy-making has consistently had strong, bipartisan support both in Congress and in all administrations since Ukraine's independence from Russia in 1991.
At the same time, however, there was an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making with respect to Ukraine, one which included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and as I subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani. I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland included me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels. This irregular channel began when Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson briefed President Trump on May 23 upon their return from President Zelenskyy's inauguration.
In particular, Taylor said the "irregular channel" was working with the president to pressure Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine would investigate Trump's political rivals. That pressure included the withholding of U.S. security aid.
"I became increasingly concerned," Taylor testified, "that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons."

Texto completo: The Delaware River is the official border between the First State and New Jersey, right?
Yes and no.
Unbeknownst to many residents, the two states actually share two land borders, one of which is nearly 2 miles long.
Not only does Delaware own a small chunk of Artificial Island, where the Hope Creek Nuclear Power Plant is, but there's a weird swath of land just outside Pennsville, New Jersey, that belongs to the Diamond State.
The entire thing is only about 580 acres, but it and rights to the nearby Delaware River have been the subject of not one, but three U.S. Supreme Court cases, the most recent of which concluded in 2008.
Local residents call it "The Point" or "The Baja."
"It's weird, and it has been weird for a long time," Pennsville Mayor Robert McDade said of property's existence. "Most people wouldn't even know that it's out there."
So why is the tiny piece of land such a big deal? And why does it exist in the first place?
The answers to both questions are surprisingly complex.
How was the border established? The answer to the second question, which we'll tackle first, lies with Delaware's northern border, which is curved instead of a straight line.
Its existence dates from a deed to William Penn from the Duke of York on Aug. 24, 1682, which granted Penn all the land west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile compass circle beginning at the courthouse in New Castle.
Unlike other territorial boundaries, however, where rivers are essentially split in half between two states, the deed gave Penn rights to the entire waterway up to the low-tide mark on the east side.
Originally, that also gave Delaware ownership of a marshy wetland just outside Pennsville, which was designated a federally protected bird habitat in the 1930s.
It was called Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge.
But then, in the first part of the 20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the river and depositing silt at Killcohoook, eventually turning it into solid land.
Tim Boyle, a spokesman for the Corps, said the process took several decades.
Dredging helps keep the river deep enough for shipping traffic, and during and after World War II preserving nature took second priority to finding an easy place to dump silt and mud, according to The News Journal's archives.
The wetland was transformed into fields of tall plume grass and dusty hills, and Killcohook's status as a refuge was revoked in 1998. Conservationists cried foul and raised concerns about chemicals and pollution from the mounded dredge spoils.
Thousands of geese, mallards, ducks, teal and pheasants were replaced by empty beer bottles and junked cars. On a recent Thursday, the only sound one could hear at The Baja was that of the wind racing through invasive phragmites, a species of reed that crowds out native vegetation.
The New York Times, which wrote about the dredge-spoil dumping in 1985, said the failed wildlife area was perhaps one of New Jersey's "ugliest ecological secrets."
Ownership and management of Killcohook was "a real ball of wax," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the newspaper.
The land is part of Delaware, is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been managed as hunting grounds by wildlife agencies in both New Jersey and Delaware.
"It was a bastard within the national wildlife system," an official later told The News Journal in 1998. "It really has been kicked back and forth between its parents."
Today, Boyle said the land isn't used for anything specific. McDade, Pennsville's mayor, said dredge spoils are still routinely dumped there.
The Army Corps of Engineers has since become more environmentally conscious and uses dredge spoils to create or restore wildlife habitats, replenish beaches and more, according to its website.
What were the court cases about? New Jersey has long argued that the small strip of land created by dredging shouldn't be Delaware's in the first place.
There have been three Supreme Court cases between the two states over its ownership and rights to the Delaware River.
The first was resolved in 1905 with a compact between the two states that addressed fishing rights but didn't define the border. The second lawsuit, in 1934, concluded that Deleware owned "the river and the subaqueous soil" up to the low tide mark.
A third case in 2007 was sparked by a liquid natural gas plant. In 2005, a fight erupted between the two states over British Petroleum's then-proposal to build a $500 million LNG import facility just across the river from Claymont.
Under the plan, New Jersey would have built a delivery pier that jutted into Delaware's territorial waters. While New Jersey saw jobs and economic development, Delawareans feared potential explosions of the condensed fuel.
In 2006, Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington, co-sponsored a bill, likely in jest, that would have authorized then-Gov. Ruth Ann Miner to send the Delaware National Guard across the river to physically block construction of the port's bulkheads and piers.
New Jersey jokingly threatened to bring the Battleship New Jersey down.
By 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Delaware's laws could, in fact, prevent the plan from progressing.
No man's land While Delaware hasn't ceded the small strip of land outside Pennsville to New Jersey, it has relied on the other state to help maintain order there.
It's a bit of a no man's land, referred to by some local residents as "The Baja," Pennsville police Chief Allen J. Cummings said. He's not sure what inspired the nickname but said it's been referred to as that since he was a kid.
In the past, New Jersey police had no jurisdiction over the property, which means people would go there to commit crimes, according to a 1990 Baltimore Sun story.
Teens could do drugs and drink there without fear of arrest.
Then, in 1987, Pennsville police found the body of a 45-year-old hunter who had been shot in the head.
The department had to call Delaware coroner's office to pick up the body because no one in New Jersey was authorized to do it. The man was only 10 feet over the state line, authorities said.
The death, which was eventually ruled a suicide, highlighted jurisdictional issues over the land. Eventually, the two states agreed that the Pennsville Police Department could enforce laws on the property.
That doesn't mean Cummings and his officers patrol The Baja, the police chief said. They only go out there if they get a call about something.
"We've had a few fatalities up there, kids on four-wheelers or motorcycles or dirtbikes," Cummings said.
The mayor said for a time, after word got out that the land was a good place for off-roading, people were coming from nearby states like Pennsylvania with big trailers full of ATVs.
Accesses to the property are blocked off by iron gates, but they can be circumvented by small recreational vehicles, Cummings said. There are fewer off-road vehicles now, thanks to enforcement efforts, but teens likely still use the area to party.
Even so, it's better than it used to be when he was in high school.
He said the department hadn't gotten any calls from the area in a couple of years, though if you walk along the shoreline there are signs of recent bonfires and drinking.
"We don't have to drive up there and check it every night," Cummings said. "It's not like that anymore."
The department also gets calls about human remains found in The Baja. Sometimes, when someone takes their own life by jumping off the Delaware Memorial Bridge, they will wash up on its shores.
Years ago when Cummings was a detective, a child even found a human skull on the beach, which he brought into the police department in a milk crate.
Near the site it was found, police found a pair of pants with a set of car keys in the pocket, which were matched to a vehicle found abandoned near the bridge.
When there are fatalities or human remains are found in the water or the land belonging to Delaware, Pennsville officers call the Delaware State Police Department, which recovers the bodies and heads up any subsequent investigations.
"It's an interesting place," Cummings said. "There's a lot of history there."

Legislation is victory for animal welfare

Texto completo: Last month, the U.S. Senate passed the Rescuing Animals With Rewards (RAWR) Act.
Aimed at stopping the killing of elephants, rhinos, and other wildlife for commercially valuable parts on the black market, the legislation amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize rewards for thwarting wildlife trafficking linked to terrorism and organized crime.
The House passed a nearly identical bill, too, and it will go to President Trump for his signature soon after the House makes a technical fix.
Introduced by U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley, R-Oregon, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, the bill is yet one more victory on animal welfare issues for Oregon's junior senator.
Recently, Merkley worked with a Republican Congressman from Florida to halt a long-running USDA Agricultural Research Services lab that had been infecting cats with toxoplasmosis and then euthanizing them. That program, resulting in the death of 3,000 kittens and costing taxpayers $22 million, had been running since 1982 purportedly to address foodborne illness issues but not yielding much of any benefit for people or pets.
These days, the common poacher is competing more and more with the militant poacher, killing elephants for their ivory and turning that cash into arms purchases to fund violent crime and even terrorism in far-flung parts of the world.
In the last decade, a number of national security reports have linked the Lord's Resistance Army, the Janjaweed, and other rogue militias in East Africa to wildlife trafficking to finance larger criminal operations. Indeed, wildlife trafficking is estimated to generate well more than $10 billion in illicit commerce.
They are not just robbing animals of their lives, but also nations of living capital.
Think of the millions who trek to protected areas to catch a glimpse of wildlife, boosting not just the travel, hotel, and food and retail industries, but rural people who sell crafts, act as local guides, and provide other forms of fee-based services, employing men and women in remote areas.
A study by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNTWO) compiled figures from government and tour operators throughout the continent found that the industry contributes 80% international travel sales to the continent, a large percentage of the $34.2 billion African tourism industry.
And it's not just Africa.
Palau in the South Pacific has a tourism economy built around watching marine species. Tiger-watching safaris are big business in India. Even Spain has Iberian Lynx excursions in the Pyrenes.
In 2016, Oregon voters approved Measure 100, with 70 percent favoring the citizen initiative, to stop the trade in elephant ivory, rhino horn, and the parts of 10 of mammalian species at risk from unfettered trade.
Let's hope the RAWR Act pays out rewards to people who work with law enforcement throughout the world to protect wildlife and people. Our fates have never been bound together more tightly.
And our cause has never been more urgent.

Texto completo: Every now and then, a personality comes along to remind you that life really is like the movies and not the other way around. The movie producer Robert Evans was one. He died the other day at 89, but I'm sometimes not certain he existed on our actual, molecular, physical plane. He seemed too good a story to have happened in fact, if only because the stories he told about himself were so fabulous in all senses of the word.
Like all long careers in Hollywood, Evans's was a roller-coaster ride of triumphs and ignominy. Without him as producer and/or studio head, we wouldn't have “The Godfather" (1972) and “The Godfather: Part II" (1974), “Chinatown" (1974) and “Rosemary's Baby" (1968), “Love Story" (1970) and “The Odd Couple" (1968) and “True Grit" (1969). It goes on: “Harold and Maude" (1971) and “Serpico" (1973) and “The Conversation" (1974) and “Marathon Man" (1976) and “Urban Cowboy" (1980). Sometimes it seems as if all the movies worth talking about in the Me Decade trace their genesis or development to him.
But there's also the sense that Robert Evans was his own most glittering production. As the 36-year-old “boy genius" who in five years transformed Paramount Pictures from Hollywood's least-profitable studio to its most-, Evans was an anomaly: a larger-than-life movie executive just as the breed was dying out. The film industry in the late 1960s was a business in flux, with faceless conglomerates buying up the legendary film factories. Yet when Gulf+Western acquired Paramount Pictures, in 1966, CEO Charles Bluhdorn picked Evans to run the show, based primarily on a laudatory New York Times article by journalist Peter Bart. (Evans returned the favor by making Bart one of his first hires.)
The man had a talent for getting noticed. Born Robert Shapera in 1930 to a New York City dentist and his wife, Evans had his eye on the spotlight early on, initially as an actor. When that initially didn't pan out, he joined his brother's clothing company, Evan-Picone. (“I was in women's pants," the producer would later growl with the hubba-hubba terseness that became a trademark.) On a mid-1950s business trip out West, he was spotted poolside by Norma Shearer, an aging queen of MGM, who thought he might play her late husband, the original Hollywood boy genius, Irving Thalberg, in an upcoming film. That's the legend, anyway, as is the anecdote that gave Evans the title of his 1994 autobiography and a subsequent 2002 documentary.
Cast to play the lead in 20th Century Fox's 1957 production of “The Sun Also Rises," Evans found himself opposed by author Ernest Hemingway, costar Ava Gardner, and almost everyone down to the key grip. But Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck watched Evans film a bullfight sequence from a seat in the arena, stood up, and bellowed, “The kid stays in the picture!" And so he did. That's the legend, anyway.
Soon enough, the kid figured he was no actor and that the real money was in what Zanuck was doing. The moguls of the Golden Age had left the building by then; Louis B. Mayer of MGM, Jack Warner of Warner Bros., independent mavericks like Samuel Goldwyn and David O. Selznick, whose lives and sayings sometimes got more press than their pictures. When Evans was tapped to run Paramount, it was a roll of the dice by his new boss Bluhdorn but also a way of keeping faith with the kind of executive Hollywood knew best: an outsize figure who loved the movies as much, if not occasionally more, than the bottom line.
How many studio executives marry a gorgeous movie star? Well, most of them. How many get publicly dumped when that wife runs away with her costar, as Ali MacGraw did with Steve McQueen on the set of “The Getaway" (1972)? She was the only wife Evans mentions in “The Kid Stays in the Picture," but there were six other marriages, none of which lasted more than three years. One marriage, to actress Catherine Oxenberg, in 1998, lasted nine days. In the film version of “Kid," a section is given over to an orgiastic montage of the women in Robert Evans's life in which their glamorous faces eventually become a blur next to his taut, ageless, eternally suntanned grin. God knows what the #MeToo movement would have done with him (or his close friendships with Roman Polanski and other very bad boys of 1970s Hollywood), but he probably would have survived, as he survived everything.
He survived a raging cocaine addiction, which sent his brother and an associate to prison and saw Evans sentenced to producing an all-star (and now hilariously unwatchable) anti-drug special. He survived being linked to the 1983 murder of Roy Radin, a co-producer with Evans on “The Cotton Club." (Radin's coke dealer, Karen Greenberger, and three others were ultimately convicted of the crime.) He survived battles with filmmakers on movie sets and every so often in court, with Francis Ford Coppola earning a status as Best Frenemy on the many projects they worked on together. Coppola accused the producer of meddling above and beyond the call of duty during “The Godfather" shoot, but Evans's defenders claim his input turned a brilliant mess into a classic for the ages.
Evans also survived a 1998 stroke to write his memoirs (a second volume, "The Fat Lady Sings," was published in 2013) and stage a comeback as a grizzled mentor to a new generation of Hollywood wiseguys. A year before the stroke, he had already been immortalized by Dustin Hoffman's swaggeringly Evans-esque producer in the political satire “Wag the Dog." And to watch the documentary version of “The Kid Stays in the Picture," or to listen to the audiobook from which the film takes its voice-over narration, is to hear Robert Evans build and burnish his own myth, that of the ultimate Tinseltown insider/outsider/king/victim, loved by the ladies and tossed about by fate. He leaves behind some great, great movies, and an awful lot of good ones, even if Francis Ford Coppola is getting the last laugh this fall with a director's cut of “The Cotton Club" that's making the rounds.
Above all, Evans leaves behind a promise he extended during the New Hollywood era and that has seemed tantalizingly within reach ever since — that with hustle and luck and confidence and charm, you can make a lot of money and good art while having the time of your life.
That's the legend, anyway. If anyone knew it was all in the telling, it was Robert Evans.

INSIDE THE NHL; College hockey eyes net gain via new rule; Even players in relatively low-profile sport could benefit after NCAA acts.

Texto completo: All Blake Lizotte wanted was a jersey.
Not for himself, and not one of his own game-used St. Cloud State uniforms either. A custom replica hockey sweater was all he desired, one with his last name across the back, that his family members could have bought and proudly displayed during his two-year collegiate career at a university only 45 miles from his Minnesota hometown.
"My family just wanted to wear a 'Lizotte' jersey," he said.

But the bureaucratic red tape of NCAA regulations got in the way. The arbitrary rules of amateurism wouldn't allow it.
"No one would print my name on a St. Cloud jersey," said Lizotte, who signed as an undrafted free agent with the Kings last April. "They literally couldn't."
Such a scenario might soon change.
When the NCAA Board of Governors voted unanimously Tuesday to permit college athletes to benefit from the use of their name, image and likeness -- with the caveat it occur "in a manner consistent with the collegiate model" -- attention was immediately fixated on football and men's basketball.
Will Heisman Trophy candidates be allowed to sign endorsement deals? Will top basketball prospects finally be allowed to formally partner with shoe companies? Will the athletes that generate millions of dollars of revenue for their schools at last be allowed to profit themselves?
Similar questions can be asked about the future of college hockey too.
Though it pales in national prestige compared to its dryland counterparts, men's ice hockey holds a unique place in the collegiate athletics landscape. Though there are only 60 NCAA Division I programs, including four in the Mountain time zone and none along the West Coast, the sport is the biggest attraction on many of those campuses.
Take the Buffalo Sabres' Jack Eichel and Colorado Avalanche's Cale Makar as recent examples. Makar, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2017 draft, became a regional star the last two seasons at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
"If they were selling Cale Makar jerseys at UMass last year," said Joe Meloni, a senior writer for College Hockey News, "there would have been 2,000 of them in the crowd every game."
In 2014-15, Eichel reached even greater levels of notoriety during his one and only season at Boston University (he was drafted No. 2 overall behind Connor McDavid in 2015). That year, the school packed its intimate 6,000-seat arena for home games, turned away some media requests to make room for outlets such as the New York Times, and had several of its game broadcast by Canadian sports channel TSN.
"There is celebrity for college hockey players," Meloni said. "It's muted in comparison to football and basketball, but at a school like BU that isn't a basketball powerhouse and doesn't even have a football team, hockey is everything. There is a lot of opportunity for this."
This year, Kings prospect Alex Turcotte (the No. 5 overall pick in this summer's draft) has similar star potential as a freshman with the Wisconsin Badgers. No other current college player was drafted as early as Turcotte, and Fox Sports West is airing 11 Badgers games in Southern California.
"I mean, would Alex Turcotte be better off with a stick deal? With a skate deal?" said Todd Milewski, who covers Badgers hockey for the Wisconsin State Journal and is also the executive editor of college hockey outlet USCHO. "These are big questions that need to get answered. And how it works is the bigger question."
Indeed, it remains unclear exactly how the NCAA might reform its amateurism rules, a long-debated topic that was spurred earlier this year by the passage of California Senate Bill 206.
Still, at the very least, the sale of custom merchandise suddenly seems like a realistic possibility. Even on college hockey's smaller scale, it isn't difficult to imagine even greater opportunities in the future.
"For the hockey part of it, there are some dominant players that have come through and probably could have been benefactors." said Kings coach Todd McLellan, whose son, Tyson, is a senior on the University of Denver's Division I team.
"We couldn't ask for anything over or above that [for Tyson]. But there are some athletes that generate a lot of revenue for schools and other students that maybe should be allowed that opportunity."
Of the nine current Kings players who previously played in the NCAA, not everyone was as optimistic of potential widespread impacts.
"I was never a part of a situation where we were bringing in such an enormous amount of revenue," said defenseman Sean Walker, who graduated from Bowling Green in 2017. "Personally, I was just happy to have my full scholarship and go to school, and if they were going to use my image, that was fine with me."
There is also a question as to whether more relaxed NCAA regulations would simplify the junior-hockey structure.
Currently, players in the Canadian Hockey League (which is the top junior league in North America and allows players to participate even after signing a professional contract) are ineligible for NCAA play, thus preventing some of the game's top prospects from enrolling at the collegiate level.
But as the world of collegiate athletics, the hockey community included, braces for change, there is hope that the NCAA is headed down a positive progressive path.
"It's a step in the right direction for sure," Lizotte said. "It just loosens things up, which is great."

SNL's attempt at gender-identity humor falls flat - again

Texto completo: For as much criticism as it faces from at-home viewers, "Saturday Night Live" maintains the ability to amuse its live studio audience to the point where there are full Reddit threads on whether the sketch comedy series uses a laugh track. (As far as we are aware, it does not.) So it is particularly noticeable when a joke bombs, as was the case during the "Weekend Update" segment of the Oct. 26 episode.
The bit began innocuously, with co-anchor Michael Che poking fun at Kanye West's new gospel album and public pivot to Christianity by stating: "At first, I thought Kanye was losing his mind, and now I feel like he's fine. He's just turning into an old white lady.
"I mean, he used to be, like, one of the coolest black dudes on earth," Che continued. "Now he's showing up to events in sweatpants and orthopedic sneakers, listening to Kenny G and trying to get black people to like Trump. It's like, how long before this guy changes his name to Kathy?"
The audience laughed until Che's next joke, which was met with silence, aside from a few groans. Beginning with, "Now, you might think I'm crazy," he went on to refer to Caitlyn Jenner - the reality star and former Olympian who was married until 2015 to West's mother-in-law, Kris - as another "fella" who moved to Calabasas, Calif., turning the joke about West into one mocking and misgendering the transgender woman. (Che also dead-named Jenner, or called her by the birth name she no longer uses.)
The debate over where the line is between provocative and offensive humor has become more prevalent in recent years, and comedians have defended themselves by pointing out that the remarks in question were made in jest. That defense is often fair on its own, as jokes don't necessarily reflect the personal views of the people who make them, but it can also fall apart when placed in a larger context.
Take Dave Chappelle, who set his target on "cancel culture" in his newest Netflix special, "Sticks & Stones." Though the popular comedian built a career out of irreverent social commentary, the special's largely negative reviews suggest that in some cases, he made jokes solely for the sake of provoking - among them, a bit where he does a stereotypical impression of a Chinese man after claiming that if trans people were born in the wrong body, then the same logic should apply to race.
Che responded to the criticism of Chappelle's special in a since-deleted Instagram story, writing that the comments seemed "to be about the take, and very little about the actual art." It wasn't just "the take" that people took issue with, though, but the pattern Chappelle has recently displayed of punching down at this specific community. In a July review of his Broadway show, the New York Times noted that since taking flak for mocking trans people in past sets, he "seems to have become fixated on the subject."
Placed in context, Che's misgendering and dead-naming of a trans woman - which, to be clear, is what most people have taken issue with, as Jenner has been the subject of other edgy jokes in the past - represents SNL's latest misstep in joking about gender identity. Any show that has aired for decades is bound to fumble at times, whether due to changing social norms or the sheer volume of material put out. But SNL has grown since the days of, say, Julia Sweeney's Pat, an androgynous character introduced in the early 1990s whose comedic value came from other characters' inability to determine Pat's gender. (In 2017, "Transparent" creator Jill Soloway referred to "It's Pat," the 1994 movie built around the character, as a "hateful, awful thing to do to non-binary people.")
This might explain the uproar in November 2016, just days after the election, when "Weekend Update" co-anchor Colin Jost jokingly blamed those who support trans and non-binary people for the voting outcome: "The dating app Tinder announced a new feature this week which gives users 37 different gender identity options," he said. "It's called 'Why Democrats lost the election.' "
Five years before that, a sketch called "Once Daily Estro-maxx," which spoofed pharmaceutical commercials and featured male-identifying cast members in drag as trans women, angered GLAAD enough for the LGBTQ advocacy organization to issue an online petition asking NBC to apologize for the segment. Others argued that the segment parodied drug advertisement tropes more than it did trans people.
SNL has more successfully addressed gender identity in other cases. Take the viral 2015 sketch "A Thanksgiving Miracle," in which the only thing that can keep a family from fighting at dinner is the act of singing Adele's "Hello." Upon sitting down at the table, the grandparents mention that they saw trans people at the airport. "Very interesting trend, this," says the grandfather, played by episode host Matthew McConaughey, to which Jay Pharoah's character responds, "Transgender is not a trend, Mr. Paul."
"There weren't any around when I was younger," the grandfather claims. Cecily Strong's character snaps, "Yeah, they were there, but they couldn't say anything, so they lived sad lives and died."
It's a frank statement but one that, unlike Che's "Weekend Update" joke, leans in favor of trans visibility. If social media is any indication, many at-home viewers were as disappointed as the studio audience over the reference to Jenner, calling it "hacky, lame" and, in several cases, transphobic. Some Twitter users also delivered what, for Che, might be the ultimate creative blow: calling the bit "unfunny."

Cuomo on Trump's Florida move: 'Good riddance'

Texto completo: ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo is not lamenting President Donald Trump's decision to change his residency from his lifelong home of New York to Florida.
"Good riddance," the Democratic governor said in a statement late Thursday.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump, a Republican, and first lady Melania Trump filed separate "declarations of domicile" in Florida last month, a legal move that shifts his residency from Manhattan to his Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach.
The move means Trump's permanent residence will no longer be Trump Tower, the Manhattan building where he has long called home.
And it means New York will no longer be able to lay claim to being the home of the sitting president, though Cuomo — like Trump, a native of the New York City borough of Queens — did not seem to mind.
"It's not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway," Cuomo said in his statement. "He's all yours, Florida."
Trump confirmed the move in a series of tweets Thursday night, criticizing state leaders for what he said was unfair treatment.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," the president wrote.
Trump has repeatedly clashed with Cuomo and other Democratic officials in his former home state.
Cuomo has repeatedly criticized Trump for the 2017 Republican tax reforms that limited state and local tax deductions to $10,000, a change that disproportionately affected wealthy residents of high-tax states like New York.
State Attorney General Letitia James' office is currently leading dozens of legal actions challenging the Trump administration's policies and actions.
In June, state lawmakers approved a bill allowing the state to release Trump's state tax returns — which the president has declined to make public — to certain congressional committees, if requested. Cuomo signed the bill into law the next month.
And Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance has subpoenaed Trump's tax returns, though Trump is fighting the subpoena in federal court.
Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly lamented the decline of upstate New York from its industrial heyday, telling reporters in February that upstate residents should consider moving.
"If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job," Trump said.
In his tweets Thursday, Trump said his shifting residency "will be best for all concerned."
"As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York," Trump wrote. "It will always have a special place in my heart!"
President Donald Trump departs O"Hare International Airport on Monday.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Gov. Andrew Cuomo is not lamenting President Donald Trump's decision to change his residency from his lifelong home of New York to Florida.
"Good riddance," the Democratic governor said in a statement late Thursday.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump, a Republican, and first lady Melania Trump both filed "declarations of domicile" in Florida last month, a legal move that shifts their residency from Manhattan to his Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach.
The move means Trump's permanent residence will no longer be Trump Tower, the Manhattan building where he has long called home.
And it means New York will no longer be able to lay claim to being the home of the sitting president, though Cuomo — like Trump, a native of the New York City borough of Queens — did not seem to mind.
"It's not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway," Cuomo said in his statement. "He's all yours, Florida."
Trump confirmed the move in a series of tweets Thursday night, criticizing state leaders for what he said was unfair treatment.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," the president wrote.
Trump has clashed with New York leaders On Fox News, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham declined to respond to Cuomo's original statement.
"We're not going to waste our time with a governor who would say something like that," Grisham said Friday. "That was petty and that was silly."
Trump has repeatedly clashed with Cuomo and other Democratic officials in his former home state.
Cuomo has repeatedly criticized Trump for the 2017 Republican tax reforms that limited state and local tax deductions to $10,000, a change that disproportionately affected wealthy residents of high-tax states like New York.
State Attorney General Letitia James' office is currently leading dozens of legal actions challenging the Trump Administration's policies and actions.
In June, state lawmakers approved a bill allowing the state to release Trump's state tax returns — which the president has declined to make public — to certain congressional committees, if requested. Cuomo signed the bill into law the next month.
And Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance has subpoenaed Trump's tax returns, though Trump is fighting the subpoena in federal court.
Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly lamented the decline of upstate New York from its industrial heyday, telling reporters in February that upstate residents should consider moving.
"If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job," Trump said.
Trump family, Cuomo trade criticism In his tweets Thursday, Trump said his shifting residency "will be best for all concerned."
"As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York," Trump wrote. "It will always have a special place in my heart!"
Cuomo doubled down on his statement Friday, openly speculating as to whether Trump is somehow trying to bolster his fight against Vance's subpoena by shifting his residency.
He questioned whether Trump was ever a real New Yorker, saying his ideals didn't match up with those who make the Empire State home.
"I don't believe he was ever a New Yorker anyway," Cuomo said. "Because living in New York does not make you a New Yorker. To be a New Yorker is a state of mind, it's a set of beliefs, it's a set of principles that you live by, and New Yorkers do not discriminate."
Donald Trump Jr., Trump's eldest son, came to his father's defense.
"Nice soundbite," Trump Jr. tweeted about Cuomo's original statement. "Now do the tens of thousands of other successful New Yorkers and businesses fleeing your idiotic policies every week. I'll wait."

Texto completo: Bernardine Evaristo, the first black woman to win the literary award, talks about her mission to write about the African diaspora and why her novel involves 12 interconnected characters.
The morning after Bernardine Evaristo won the Booker Prize, for her novel "Girl, Woman, Other," her American publisher, Grove Atlantic, announced that the book would come out in the United States a month earlier than previously scheduled -- and that it was printing 50,000 more copies, up from an initial run of 10,000.
Now the book is set for release here on Nov. 5, and while it is Evaristo's eighth novel, for many American readers it will be their first exposure to her work. "Girl, Woman, Other" is written in a mix of poetry and prose that she calls "fusion fiction," featuring a dozen interconnected characters who are mostly black British women but varied in age, class, sexuality and gender.
It was an effort, she said, to show through these women, "We are all things and everything. You cannot dismiss us, nor can you easily define us."
Evaristo is the first black woman to win the Booker, one of the world's most prestigious literary awards, though this year's prize made news for another reason as well: The judges, unable to choose one winner, gave it to her and Margaret Atwood, for her "Handmaid's Tale" sequel "The Testaments." That prompted a backlash among some of Evaristo's fans who felt the split decision undermined her historic achievement.
She disagrees. "I don't actually feel that the impact of the prize has been lessened for me," she said. "No single book is the best book in the world anyway."
Evaristo was born in London in 1959 to a white English mother and a Nigerian father. She initially studied acting but grew frustrated with the dearth of plays by or about black women. "It made sense to start writing," she said.
A few days after the prize was announced, her voice worn down from nonstop interviews, she talked about experimentation and activism in her work, writing complicated older women and why it's not quite right to say "Girl, Woman, Other" is a book about 12 black British women.
This interview has been edited and condensed.
Can you talk to me about why you wrote this book and where the idea came from?
I just had this idea that I would put as many women as I could into a single book and somehow connect it all through x degrees of separation and see what happened with that. In a sense, you could almost call it an activist novel. I don't feel, as a black British woman writer, that I would want to write a book just because I want to explore something about the human race. My mission is to write about the African diaspora. That's what I've done with all my books. And so focusing on 12 black British women was my way of addressing our invisibility and also exploring our heterogeneity. There are probably about 800,000 black British women, and we're all different.
How did you approach writing a novel with so many characters while making sure they were fully fleshed out?
It's an experimental novel where each woman has her own space, and that's what's so important. I think the form is very important, because they're not short stories, it is a single novel. Everybody is interconnected and interrelated. But you go through the sorts of consciousness and lives of all of these different women as you read them. You encounter one, then you encounter their child or their mother or their friend, and then you encounter maybe a schoolteacher and then her mother and then her work friend.
The book was written in poetry and prose but also seemed to have some elements of playwriting. What were your influences in terms of format and structure?
I might track back in fact to "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf," by Ntozake Shange. I think I might have seen that in 1979. She wrote about seven black women and their lives.
I found "For Colored Girls" very inspiring as a young woman in Britain. Seven black women onstage -- amazing. That had never happened before.
Why does the number of women matter? Why did it feel important to have nearly a dozen women in "Girl, Woman, Other"?
Black British history is very different to American history. We do go back 2,000 years to the Romans, which is something I wrote about in one of my books, but from the middle of the 20th century, we saw the big wave of migration that began. My father migrated from Nigeria in 1949, and still today we get waves of migration from different countries. We come from all over Africa, we come from all over the Caribbean. We're kind of recent in terms of our own personal histories, although not in terms of black presence in this country. I wanted to explore that. I wanted to explore different sexualities. Women are on the queer spectrum, some of them. I wanted to explore class. The idea of, you're born into one class in this very class-obsessed society that I live in, and then you move out of it. And also ages -- the youngest is 19, the oldest is 93, and there's every generation in between.
All of these things I was able to explore to some degree through 12 characters. I would not have been able to do that with two characters.
To your point about wanting to present a heterogeneous group of women, I wonder to what extent the women presented in the novel are a reflection of the variety of women in your life?
Amma is loosely based on my younger self. Dominique is similar to the women I mixed with, theater women in the '80s. Yazz is a version of one of my goddaughters. I know teachers, my mother was a teacher. I know nonbinary people. So I am respectively drawing on the people I know, but I'm also drawing on everyone I've ever known. Because we create character from how we absorb the people in our lives and the people we observe and the people we hear about.
I really like being around young people. I like the fact that they're seeing the world differently, and that especially young black feminists -- this is a world full of possibility for them. I like to be connected to every generation. I don't think I could have written the young women in the novel in the way that I did if I didn't have connections with young people.
Quite a few of the women in the book are middle-aged. Why was age diversity important for you?
Because older women are hardly ever written about in fiction, let alone older black women, even when the writers are older women. It's like we are fixated with youth, yet in my opinion older women are so interesting. Have lived long lives. Have so much to say and to offer. I wanted my older women to have agency, to be complicated. Through writing their imperfections I made them very real. All of those things that they get up to, those secrets that they keep and so on, is really about me strengthening them as characters. I don't want any character to come over as predictable or as a stereotype -- the earth mother, the suffering but strong black woman. People may see bits of that, but I don't think you can define any of those women in any simple ways. They are made up of many things. They have multiple identities. We are multidimensional as humans.
I wanted to clarify one last thing: The book has been described, sometimes by you, as being about 12 black women. But there's a nonbinary character ...
It's just so easy to say 12 black British women, because it just slips off the tongue. I sometimes might write it as 12 black British women with an "x." So W-O-M-X-N, which is kind of women of color inclusive and trans inclusive, so then it embraces all the women. Other people as a shorthand say 12 black British women, but that's not the truth.

TWITTER CEO GIVES ZUCKERBERG LESSON ON BASIC INTEGRITY

Texto completo: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey struck a needed blow for tech integrity and democracy Wednesday when he said that the social networking company would pull the plug on political ads.
If only Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg would see the light.
For decades tech companies were renowned for embracing the highest standards of business ethics and respecting the needs of their customers.
Zuckerberg has arguably done more in the last decade to destroy public trust in tech than any CEO in Silicon Valley history.
His stubborn refusal to vet political ads for accuracy threatens the integrity of our elections and those of countries around the world and the future of democracy. If that wasn't enough, Zuckerberg continues to line his pockets by invading the privacy of Facebook's 2.4 billion users. Bill Hewlett and David Packard must be spinning in their graves. Zuckerberg may have a fortune of nearly $70 billion, but history will not treat him kindly.
Even Facebook employees are appalled. The New York Times this week published a letter sent to Zuckerberg by 250 Facebook employees in which they said, "Misinformation affects us all" and "Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing."
It wasn't a coincidence that Dorsey timed his announcement minutes before Zuckerberg made an earnings call that showed Facebook's financial performance exceeded analysts' expectations.
"We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought," Dorsey said.
Dorsey also tweeted: "This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address."
No one knows how much misinformation played a role in the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. At first, Zuckerberg claimed there was no effect. But, as evidence poured out, Zuckerberg apologized after admitting in 2017 that Russian operatives used Facebook to spread divisive messages by purchasing at least 3,000 ads on its site.
Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page, "For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness and I will work to do better."
Really? If so, it's hard to tell.
Zuckerberg tried Wednesday to defend Facebook's policy of allowing false political ads by saying he didn't "think it right for private companies to censor politicians and the news."
That puts Facebook in the position of knowingly joining forces for financial gain with those spreading lies and misinformation for political gain. Separating fact from fiction in political ads is time-consuming work, but it's a basic responsibility for those who publish them. If Zuckerberg is not prepared to do the work, he should stop accepting the ads.
Zuckerberg is right when he says that political ads make up less than 0.5% of Facebook's revenues, or roughly $300 million. But, while that might not be a lot of money to the billionaire, it's nearly half of all the money candidates have raised so far in the presidential election.
He's also correct when he says other companies, including Google-owned YouTube, publish false or misleading political ads. But that doesn't make it right. That others do it is a pathetic excuse for Facebook, especially given the company's record of enabling political manipulation.
A day of reckoning awaits Facebook and other tech companies if they fail to get ahead of basic integrity issues that threaten long-held American values. Twitter's Jack Dorsey on Wednesday took a step in the right direction. The question is to what degree will others especially Facebook follow?

Texto completo: There was never was there a more joyous moment in the Griffin household than when than May 17, 1954, when the Supreme Court case Brown vs. Topeka School Board struck down school desegregation as the law of the land.
My father, born in 1896 the year of Plessey vs. Ferguson, had lived long enough to see the doctrine of "separate but equal" overturned.
The problem with the doctrine was that only half of it was ever enforced. There was never any doubt about "the separate." "Equal" was the issue.
The first case I am aware of to integrate public schools was argued in Boston 1849 by Massachusetts abolitionist Sen. Charles Sumner with co-counsel Robert Morris. They propounded the right of black 5-year-old Sarah Roberts to go to her nearest school rather than to have to walk past three other better equipped white schools to attend a dilapidated, rundown facility. They were ruled against by Judge Lemuel Show, but the ruling was superceded six years later by the Massachusetts legislature which bared segregated schools in the Commonwealth. The case was a landmark insofar as it originated the phrase and the legal argument that separate is "inherently unequal."
If schools in predominantly black neighborhoods were provided the same funding, quality instruction, enrichment programs and resources as schools in more affluent neighborhoods, the push for integration would be more of a sociological imperative rather than an educational necessity. Who wouldn't want to send their kid to a neighborhood school you could walk to and be ensured a quality education? Given the disparity in educational outcome California State Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued a desegregation order against Sausalito and Marin City Schools.
Headlines around the nation blared. The Los Angeles Times wrote, "First desegregation order in 50 years hits Marin." The New York Times wrote, "California school district agrees to desegregate."
This is disheartening for a county that prides itself on its liberality. Recently, Terra Linda High was the site of an educational equity summit. Among the speakers were a panel of young educators followed by California Superintendent of Schools Tony Thurman and Jonathan Logan, the Marin Community Foundation vice president and director of engagement. The superintendent made it clear there were equality issues which needed to be addressed. The overall plan was to bring about educational equity in measurable outcomes for lagging students of color by 2028.
The young educators on the panel spoke to their own challenges while students in the county: They have not been feeling heard, understood or acknowledged at all times. They pointed to more than 50% of Marin students being of color while 9 of 10 teachers are not. Disparities like that lead to a demonstrable impact on educational outcomes.
That brought me back to my own ninth-grade experience. My teacher thought it unnecessary for me to take Latin, which was then a college requirement. But for my father's insistence that I was college-bound and that he had been taught Latin and Greek by the textbook's author, I would have been denied access to a class I needed for college.
What struck me viewing the summit at youtu.be/5IkFirORdcEon were the words of Logan at the 1 minute, 42 second mark, who asserted: "All young people can learn. Talent is equally distributed among all races (and genders)." It's not race and poverty which is a predictor of educational outcome, but racism, poverty and a lack of enrichment opportunities."
While I support integrated schools more as a sociological imperative to know one another, rather than from the standpoint of one group being advantaged by sitting next to another. I support the idea of being where there is an equal distribution of funds, resources, equipment and the highest level of teacher excellence.

Texto completo: Abundan las evidencias de que la política migratoria del país está en manos de gente extremadamente cruel e inepta.
En una entrevista de radio hace años, Ken Cuccinelli comparó a las familias hispanas con “ratas”, “mapaches” y otras plagas. Hoy, Cuccinelli —cuyos ancestros italianos escaparon pobreza y miseria emigrando a Estados Unidos— es el director interino del Servicio Federal de Ciudadanía e Inmigración. Y la facción más cruel sobre política migratoria en la Casa Blanca quiere convertirlo en el nuevo Secretario de Seguridad Nacional.
Según el libro “Guerras Fronterizas: Dentro del Asalto de Trump a la Inmigración” del New York Times, un frustrado Donald Trump llegó a ordenar a sus consejeros clausurar la frontera con México, disparar a los migrantes en las piernas, y fortificar el muro con un foso lleno de caimanes y serpientes.
Trump no logró realizar su sueño medieval, pero su cruel racismo sigue causando estragos en la frontera . La Unión de Libertades Cívicas informó recientemente que la administración separó a más de 1.500 niños inmigrantes de los que se tenía constancia, elevando así el total a más de 5,400 menores arrancados de los brazos de sus padres en la frontera.
Otro reporte de Human Rights First reveló que la política de Trump de forzar a los solicitantes de asilo a que esperen en México —hasta el momento unas 50,000 personas— ha generado más de 350 casos de violación, secuestro, tortura y otros crímenes en ese país. Un informe similar del Centro de Política Inmigratoria que entrevistó a más de 600 solicitantes a la espera en México confirmó esta nueva crisis innecesaria de la administración. Uno de sus autores expresó al The Washington Post que “estamos literalmente enviando a personas a su muerte potencial” , agregando que al hacerlo Estados Unidos incumple sus compromisos internacionales de derechos humanos.
En medio de este caos y crueldad, la construcción del muro medieval de Trump avanza con devastadoras consecuencias para el medio ambiente . Hasta el momento ha diezmado más de 600 acres de terrenos públicos, arrasando plantas autóctonas, interrumpiendo corredores migratorios de la fauna y malgastando cruciales recursos hidráulicos en el Suroeste.
El daño causado en Arizona incluye la destrucción de cactus y sitios arqueológicos en el Monumento Nacional de Organ Pipe Cactus. Bombear agua subterránea para mezclar concreto para esta construcción amenaza con secar frágiles humedales del desierto en Quitobaquito Springs y el Refugio Natural de Vida Silvestre de San Bernardino, en Arizona.
Al mismo tiempo, en Texas, empezó la construcción del muro en lugares adyacentes al Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre del Bajo Río Grande, al sur de una sección de 3,300 acres de Las Palomas, hogar de la paloma de ala blanca y muchas otras especies nativas de esa región.
Aún así, dejando a un lado todo atisbo de vergüenza profesional, el director en funciones de la Oficina Federal de Gestión de Terrenos (BML), William Pendley , mintió diciendo que el muro fronterizo “está solucionando la crisis ambiental que impacta los terrenos más vulnerables de nuestro país”. Este ecologista de opereta —un acérrimo negacionista climático— defiende la catástrofe ecológica que es el muro fronterizo argumentando falsamente que la frontera “está abrumada por ilegales, gente con armas, gente que trafica drogas”.
En realidad, la frontera, sus maravillosos parajes y, sobre todo, las personas que la habitan y transitan están abrumados por la insensata y racista política migratoria de Trump, Cuccinnelli, Pendley y tantos más.
Sus palabras sobre ratas, mapaches, caimanes y serpientes dejan claro que, para ellos, la crueldad es política de estado.

Debt, doomsayers and double standards

Texto completo: So the federal budget deficit just hit $1 trillion (actually $984 billion, but close enough). That's about $300 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office was projecting in the summer of 2017, before the Trump tax cut was enacted. And basically everybody yawned.
Were there fiery speeches in Congress, denouncing fiscal irresponsibility? No. Was there intense media coverage? No - the story was tucked deep inside major newspapers. Was there severe market reaction? No - interest rates are substantially lower than they were before the deficit surge.
This lack of reaction to a deficit that would have been considered shocking only a few years ago is sort of the fiscal policy equivalent of Sherlock Holmes' dog that didn't bark in the night. It tells us a lot about economics, politics - specifically the utter hypocrisy of the GOP - and the news media, which on economic matters has a de facto conservative bias.
Start with the economics.
The budget deficit has now soared back roughly to where it was in 2012, when the unemployment rate was more than twice its current level, and the economy desperately needed deficit spending to sustain demand.
Back then, however, the inside-the-Beltway crowd was obsessed with deficit reduction. And it wasn't just politicians. As Ezra Klein, now the editor of Vox, noted at the time, "the rules of reportorial neutrality don't apply when it comes to the deficit. On this one issue, reporters are permitted to openly cheer a particular set of highly controversial policy solutions." And those of us who argued that reducing the deficit shouldn't be a high priority were treated like freaks.
But the deficit wasn't a crisis then, and it isn't one now. In fact, leading economists are now telling us that concerns about government debt have been greatly exaggerated all along. The Very Serious People were completely wrong, and those who opposed austerity have been vindicated.
Of course, while practically everyone in Washington was hyperventilating about debt circa 2012, the most apocalyptic warnings came from Republicans - people like Paul Ryan (remember him?), who declared then, "In this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time." His pose as the ultimate deficit hawk won him media adulation, which in turn propelled him into becoming speaker of the House.
The truth, however, is that right from the beginning it was obvious that Ryan was a phony. All you had to do was look at the actual content of his budget "plans." But the media narrative demanded that there be serious, honest Republicans, so that blame for the deficit could be equally divided between the parties; so Ryan was slotted into that role even though he was totally unsuited for the part.
And then, when he and his party got a chance to exercise the fiscal responsibility they declared essential, they blew up the deficit instead. Republicans only pretended to care about debt as an excuse to hobble President Barack Obama and slash social programs. They were and are complete hypocrites when it comes to budgeting (and other things, too, like patriotism, but that's another topic).
Which brings me to the issue of double standards.
When progressives propose new or expanded social programs, they face intense media scrutiny bordering on harassment over how they intend to pay for these programs. Republicans proposing tax cuts don't face anything like the same scrutiny; they are seemingly able to get away with blithe assertions that tax cuts will pay for themselves by boosting economic growth, even though every single piece of evidence we have says that this is nonsense.
We're talking about big numbers here. As I said, the Trump budget blowout, overwhelmingly driven by tax cuts, seems to have raised the deficit by around $300 billion, or around 1.5% of gross domestic product. Over the course of the next decade, that would amount to something like $3.8 trillion - substantially more than, for example, the combined cost of all of Elizabeth Warren's proposals other than Medicare for All, which we're still waiting to hear about.
And the truth is that proposals like universal child care are far more likely than tax cuts to repay a significant fraction of their upfront costs, partly by freeing up adults to work, partly by improving the lives of children in ways that will make them more productive adults.
The point is that the media clearly leans conservative in covering budget issues. Progressives face intense grilling over the cost of fairly modest social programs, while conservatives get a virtual free pass on budget-busting tax cuts.
Let me be clear here: I'm not complaining about the lack of panic over our trillion-dollar deficit. We shouldn't be panicked. The problem is the selectivity of deficit hysteria, which somehow kicks in only when a Democrat is president or progressives propose spending that would make American lives better.
That selective hysteria has done enormous harm. And those who propagate it need to be called out for their bias.

Once again, the haters get us all wrong

Texto completo: If you live in California, here's a news bulletin:
We are done. We are history. Pack up and leave now, while you still can.
I'm not just talking about the fact that half the state is on fire, which is tragic and frightening enough all on its own.

I'm parroting what a pack of gleeful doomsayers are saying about us in publications across the country. We are off the rails and off our rockers and it's no wonder our great western experiment in modern living is going up in smoke.
The political right, of course, has long specialized in the sport of California mockery. But we're now getting it from the left, as well. People are running for their lives and losing their homes, and the haters can't wait to do a grave dance.
"It's the End of California As We Know It," warned a New York Times headline on an op-ed piece declaring that "at the heart of our state's rot" is "a failure to live sustainably."
Yeah, we've got problems and a long way to go, but is there a state in the union that has done more in the interest of sustainability?
"California Is Becoming Unlivable," screamed the Atlantic.
Speaking of which, do we sit around in California wondering if the Southeast -- where many states are governed by Republicans, not wifty liberals -- is unlivable because decades of construction on fragile coastal land has put millions of people in the direct path of killer hurricanes?
"Climate change," the Atlantic said of our state, "is turning it into a tinderbox; the soaring cost of living is forcing even wealthy families into financial precarity. And, in some ways, the two crises are one: The housing crunch in urban centers has pushed construction to cheaper, more peripheral areas, where wildfire risk is greater."
Some fair points can be found in this article. But even when you have to clear your throat to draw attention to yourself, there is no good reason to use the word "precarity." Second of all, are some wealthy families, God forbid, selling their Range Rovers and laying off half the domestic staff? Are those among the horrors of financial precarity?
Even before fire season, California was under attack.
"California's Hobo Paradise" was the title of a September editorial in the Wall Street Journal. The piece parroted President Trump's bashing of California, particularly San Francisco and Los Angeles, for its tent cities and public health problems.
By the way, please advise Trump he doesn't need to fuel up Air Force One and fly to California if homelessness is a genuine concern, because there's a sizable population within walking distance of the White House.
"The city council has banned plastic straws," the Journal editorial said, referring to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, "but the good liberals don't seem bothered by streets strewn with human feces and needles that fall into storm sewers."
First of all, we may be morons, but we have discovered that it's possible to drink beverages without plastic straws. Second, I don't know of anyone, liberal or conservative, who is not bothered by homelessness and the condition of our streets. And the rest of the country should be, too, since a lot of the people sleeping on our streets tell me they've come here from somewhere else, like the Midwest, the East and the South.
"California is a failed state," said Breitbart News, which, as I recall, was founded by a man who lived rather comfortably here in one of the many affluent areas of our failed state.
"As climate change ravages the Golden State, earthquakes could become the least of residents' concerns," said the New Republic, which also questioned whether California is still livable.
Among her mother's frequent warnings, the writer said, were these:
Don't walk alone at night. Don't eat processed food. And don't ever move to California, because, among its myriad other problems, "California's going to fall off the face of the country and sink into the ocean."
I doubt that, even as sea levels rise, but I don't doubt that Trump will keep calling climate change a hoax even after he has to snorkel through the front door of Mar-a-Lago.
It's not that I disagree with all of the criticisms we're hearing about California, and even a lot of Californians have issues with the state, because more people are now leaving than moving in. It wasn't long ago that I fretted in a column about our inability to keep the lights on and the twin demons of flat wages and high housing costs and the growing epidemic of homelessness.
But as a native, I've got a license to swing that club. And as I pointed out, our fair state is also home to the world's fifth-largest economy and is a world capital of innovation and creativity. California has a hell of a lot more going for it than you'll ever hear from our jealous critics and gasbag pundits. We have our share of problems for sure. But on issues such as climate change, immigration, criminal justice reform and investments in children, we are actively trying to make things better.
"Why would anyone live in California?" the Washington Times asked in September in an op-ed that said "eggs cost 50% more" in Los Angeles than in D.C. because of our cage-free law.
Why would anyone live here?
Gee, I don't know. The 40 million or so people who call California home might have an answer or two, but let me offer a few of my own.
The beaches, the mountains, the deserts, the sunsets, the rural, the urban, the red, the blue, the people, the wildlife, the languages, the history, the diversity, the endless curiosities, the energy, the universities, the music, the art, the food, the culture, the climate, the risks that worked, the experiments that failed, the long tradition of break-away politics and the collective agreement that you can say or think of us what you will -- we don't really care one way or another-- just shelter in place (unless you're a firefighter) and please don't move here.
It is unmanageable and unlivable, I'm telling you.
Designed and guaranteed to fail.

Texto completo: The last meeting for many of Deadspin's journalists took place on Wednesday in a conference room adorned with fake black cobwebs, a large spider and bloody handprints beside the words: "HELP US."
The plea, it seemed, went unanswered.
By Thursday, almost the entire staff -- nearly 20 writers and editors -- had resigned.
The journalists at the site, founded as a sports blog in 2005, had chafed against an instruction handed down Monday in the form of a memo from management to confine themselves to sports-related posts.
While largely focused on sports, Deadspin for years had delved into a broad range of topics in a voice that was sometimes rude, often funny and always conversational. On Tuesday, the site's top editor, Barry Petchesky, was fired after refusing to go along with the order.
The departures shocked fans of the site, which put a new spin on sports coverage for a generation of digital natives. But they were the result of a long buildup of resentment between the journalists and their new bosses, according to interviews with 13 current and former employees of Deadspin and G/O Media.
The main topic of discussion at the Wednesday meeting was the stick-to-sports memo, which was signed by Paul Maidment, the editorial director of G/O Media, the company that became the owner of Deadspin and sibling sites like Jezebel and Gizmodo six months ago.
Stories that showed the intersection of sports and other topics were fair game, Mr. Maidment wrote in the memo. He said at the meeting that he had enjoyed a recent post about President Trump getting booed at a World Series game. But purely non-sports content was forbidden.
Deadspin writers and editors considered that to be meddling.
Mr. Maidment, a British veteran of The Financial Times and Forbes who was brought in as the editorial director of G/O Media this year, called the staff meeting on Wednesday. And as it unfolded, he appeared eager to listen.
"Paul was very reasonable, and nothing he said was so inflammatory that I was like, 'I'm going to quit right now,"' said Kelsey McKinney, a staff writer who resigned later that day.
She suggested that Mr. Maidment was in a difficult position, serving as an emissary for G/O Media. But he failed to persuade the journalists that the company's editorial direction was in their -- and the site's -- best interests.
"He tried to paint it broadly but was not willing to be specific about what posts we had done that fell outside of that mandate," said Chris Thompson, a staff writer who also resigned this week. "He resisted altogether the institutional knowledge of the people in the room."
Soon after the meeting, Deadspin writers and editors began filing into his office to quit. Many of them posted the news of their resignations on Twitter, and Deadspin became a trending topic on social media into the night.
The company came into existence after Deadspin and its sibling publications were sold by Univision to the private equity firm Great Hill Partners in April. Univision had bought the sites when they were part of Gawker Media in a bankruptcy sale. Founded by Nick Denton, the company had been financially ruined when Terry G. Bollea, the former professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, won a $ 140 million judgment against Gawker for an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit backed by the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel.
G/O Media installed Jim Spanfeller, a digital media executive who had previously run Forbes.com, as its head. Mr. Spanfeller promptly got rid of some top editors and made Mr. Maidment the editorial director.
Signs of tensions between the irreverent journalists and the management team came quickly. They were not helped by an Aug. 2 Deadspin article whose reporting was critical of G/O Media, Mr. Spanfeller and his executive team. The piece took issue with their "lack of knowledge about" the sites now in their portfolio and "their seeming unwillingness or inability to get up to speed."
A few weeks later, Deadspin's top editor, Megan Greenwell, resigned, saying in a farewell post that her job had become untenable, given management's demands. (Ms. Greenwell recently completed a stint as a weekly advice columnist for The New York Times.) The next major event at G/O Media occurred on Oct. 10, with the shuttering of its politics site, Splinter.
On Monday, the day of the "stick to sports" memo, all of the G/O Media websites published posts that decried the new video ads on their home pages. The ads were offensive to readers, the articles argued, because they were set to play automatically, with sound. Such ads are broadly understood to lift advertiser impressions while annoying readers. The posts were swiftly removed without a warning from G/O Media to the sites' editors.
"We were existentially angry about a post being taken off our website -- a red line we thought was uncrossable," said Tom Ley, Deadspin's features editor, who resigned Wednesday.
Staff members, members of the Writers Guild of America East union, discussed how to respond on a private Slack channel. Their collective-bargaining agreement included a no-strike clause, so a strike seemed out of the question. And quitting seemed drastic.
"It's hard to lose your job," said Ms. McKinney, the former staff writer. "There are not a lot of jobs in our industry."
They settled on a protest consistent with the site's cheekiness: They would conspicuously post stories that had nothing to do with sports.
"We thought that was a Deadspin-style way of handling it, and something that our readers would be in on and find clever," Mr. Ley said. "We didn't want to be preachy, we just wanted to try to have some fun with it."
And so on Tuesday morning, Deadspin featured articles on subjects like a Washington pumpkin thief and the German actor who played a villain in "Ghostbusters II."
Mr. Petchesky, the interim editor in chief, was pulled out of a meeting and escorted to the office of Mr. Spanfeller, the chief executive. There, he was fired. Mr. Petchesky said Mr. Spanfeller ordered him to leave using an obscenity. (Through a spokesman, Mr. Spanfeller declined to comment.)
Shaken by the editor's departure, Deadspin staff members retreated to a nearby Planet Hollywood in Times Square for a drink. Roughly a third were ready to quit, Ms. McKinney estimated. The others thought they should try to negotiate editorial protections or the reinstatement of Mr. Petchesky. They gathered again later that evening at the Magician, a Lower East Side bar popular among Gawker-era bloggers, for a planned wake for Splinter.
On Wednesday morning, the workers met in Ms. Greenwell's vacated office. The sentiment had turned. More staff members were inclined to leave.
The meeting with Mr. Maidment followed in the afternoon. (Through a spokesman, Mr. Maidment declined to comment.) During the meeting, Deadspin staff members laid out their case for posting articles that did not touch on sports. A recent internal study found that a small fraction of Deadspin's posts fell under this category, and that they drew a larger readership than sports stories.
Some staff members also described what they saw as a lack of clarity from the editorial director. Where should they draw the line between a sports piece and one that would flout the new rule? A weekly N.F.L. preview called the Jamboroo -- by Drew Magary, a popular writer who confirmed Thursday that he had also resigned -- often started with a long personal essay. And what about the landmark Deadspin essay from 2014 on "Gamergate"? Would that be off-limits, given that G/O Media has a separate video games site, Kotaku?
There was the broader question: Why? In digital media, Deadspin would be considered, from a business perspective, a modest success. In a good month, it had 20 million unique visitors, according to Mr. Ley.
Now Deadspin is down to few, if any, staff members. Mr. Maidment is running the site himself as G/O Media seeks a new top editor.
Those who resigned do not expect to benefit from the agreement on severance that was reached four years ago, when Gawker Media became a union company. G/O Media told them they would be paid through Friday.

TWITTER TO BAN POLITICAL ADS, UNLIKE FACEBOOK POLICY

Texto completo: As Facebook continues to defend its controversial policy that allows politicians to run false advertising, Twitter said Wednesday it is pulling the plug on political ads altogether.
"We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally," Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Wednesday. "We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought."
The new policy, effective Nov. 22, will apply to candidate and issue ads.
"While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions," Dorsey added.
If that sounds familiar, it's because online misinformation has been shown to have played a key part in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Dorsey and the top executives of Facebook and Google all have testified before Congress over Russian misinformation campaigns run on their social media platforms, among other things.
Some are cheering Twitter's move which could negatively affect its already declining revenue while also pointing out that the company hasn't solved its misinformation problem. So far, the company has offered no antidote for politicians who make false statements in their own tweets.
"Rather than taking the Facebook route and letting anarchy ensue, Twitter is taking responsibility," said Eric Goldman, director of the Santa Clara University School of Law's High Tech Law Institute. "But it's still allowing politicians to lie without consequence."
Goldman said it's not just about President Donald Trump, whose online megaphone of choice is Twitter.
"Trump is a symptom of the disease," he said. "The disease is: Politicians will lie if given the chance." Goldman believes politicians currently in office shouldn't be allowed on Twitter or any other platform where they can spread their messages unfiltered.
Twitter's much bigger competitor, Facebook, has been under fire for refusing to take down an ad by Trump's reelection campaign that included accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden that have been proven false. Facebook said it does not fact-check political ads and has no intention of doing so.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the policy is a matter of freedom of expression. During Wednesday's earnings call, he dug in and pointed out that TV networks and Google run political ads, too. He also said that political ads will bring in only 0.5% of the company's revenue this year.
People such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren have sharply criticized Facebook's policy. Warren ran a false ad on Facebook claiming that the tech company is supporting Trump's reelection, which it is not to illustrate her point.
Bernice King, daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr., also has been critical of Facebook recently because Zuckerberg invoked her father while defending the tech giant's policy. She tweeted a couple of weeks ago: "I'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination." On Wednesday, she wrote in a tweet directed at Dorsey, "Thank you, @jack, for taking the lead on responsible sharing of political ads via social media."
Last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's questioning of Zuckerberg exposed holes in Facebook's policy of not checking facts in political ads. When the congresswoman from New York asked the CEO whether she would be able to buy an ad that would target black voters and give them an incorrect election date, he said no. Their exchange has inspired many memes.
In addition, The New York Times this week published a letter sent to Zuckerberg by 250 of his own employees in which they said, "Misinformation affects us all" and "Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing." It was a rare public show of dissent within Facebook.
One San Francisco man is going so far as declaring himself a candidate for California governor to further highlight Facebook's policy. He argues that if Trump can run false ads on Facebook, why can't he?
Adriel Hampton this week registered for the 2022 gubernatorial race, but Facebook has blocked a false ad he tried to run.
"The problem here is regular people in America are being abused by the corporate state," Hampton said Wednesday in an interview with this news organization. He said he's considering suing Facebook over its blocking of his ad and that he plans to produce a whole bunch of fake video ads for other political candidates who also want to call out Facebook over its policy.
Facebook has not returned a request for comment about Hampton.

A necessary education for white Americans

Texto completo: No doubt you've seen President Trump's recent comparison of the impeachment process to a lynching. Citizens, activists and political pundits have been swift to admonish the president, and rightly so.
But as we struggle to make sense of his comments, let's also take a moment to consider the conversation many of us are not having: Blithe use of racially insensitive terminology - and the ignorance it represents about our past and present - isn't only a Trump problem. It is a widespread American problem.
Had Mr. Trump referred to lynching a month ago, I may not have felt as strongly as I do now. As a white American with the privilege of neither suffering from generational trauma nor having to live in fear of racial discrimination today, I am part of the majority group that was taught and encouraged to believe the mythic American story: land of the free, home of the brave; a place where all people are created and treated equally as promised by the Constitution.
But after visiting the Equal Justice Initiative's (EJI) Legacy Museum and The National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, earlier this month, I have a much deeper understanding of what the term "lynching" connotes in America: racial terrorism inflicted upon black Americans between the 1870s and 1950s in order to preserve white power.
The same racial discrimination that enabled lynching to occur continues to pervade our society in deep and damaging ways now manifested through police brutality, presumptions of guilt and the use of mass incarceration as a weapon to silence and control people of color. I believe American citizens - especially white Americans and most especially our president - share a moral responsibility to proactively seek to understand this history and its lasting legacy.
The Legacy Museum chronicles our evolution of racial oppression through four key chapters: slavery, racial terror lynching, segregation and now, mass incarceration. I listened to stories of families separated by the domestic slave trade. I absorbed over 4,000 names of lynching victims inscribed on hanging plaques. I read letters from current inmates appealing death sentences. There were thousands of life stories asking to be told, shared, listened to. I was struck by the suffering as well as the resilience of African Americans in this country.
Above all, however, I found myself stunned at my own lack of awareness. I was embarrassed to feel as though I was relearning - and sometimes learning for the first time - details of landmark Supreme Court cases and their lasting legal and cultural ramifications on civil rights. I reflected on the seemingly whitewashed version of U.S. history I had been taught in school. And I wondered why so much of the story remains either invisible or distorted in the minds of many Americans today.
I sought answers by inquiring about the response to the museum since it opened 18 months ago. Several EJI staff said they receive a large number of international tourists, but fewer domestic and local visitors.
As I thought more about it, I realized that none of my immediate family members, friends or colleagues had been; few of them had even heard of the museum.
In my mostly white community, we don't talk about our racial past or its present ramifications in our day-to-day life. Perhaps this is because it is more comfortable to ignore and, for us, it's possible to ignore.
But our inability to openly discuss history - our "white fragility," as Robin DiAngelo calls it in her book of the same name - makes it harder to understand how modern-day practices like harsh criminal sentences that disproportionately affect African Americans are inextricably linked to slavery and lynching. Active dialogue is the first step toward recovery - recovery such that we might evolve into a more just society where all human life is valued equally, as Bryan Stevenson, founder of the EJI, advocates.
I believe every American who can afford it, such as President Trump, has the responsibility to visit Montgomery and proactively pursue dialogue about our racial history and legacy. Efforts like EJI and The New York Times' 1619 Project can help open discussion.
It might be easier to react on Twitter and quickly move on than to use this as an opportunity to engage in conversations about race in America. But we, especially white Americans, must start and become active participants in those conversations. Our ability to achieve racial and social justice depends on it.

Texto completo: Consumer spending remained solid, but business investment declined.
Dogged by uneasiness over trade frictions and weak global growth, the American economy's growth inched lower over the summer.
Gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy -- grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate for the third quarter, according to preliminary data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday.
There is something of a tug-of-war going on between consumers, who continue to spend, and businesses, which have sharply pulled back on investment.
The year started out with a surge, but the pace of growth declined in the spring and again over the period that spanned July, August and September.
While the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates later in the day, to keep a slowdown from turning into a slide, several analysts emphasized that the economy remained rooted in solid ground. "If I saw cracks in the consumer sector, I would be worried, but I don't see that yet," said Ben Herzon, executive director of United States economics at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. "The economy is not slowing into a recession."
Consumer spending accounts for the largest chunk of G.D.P. by far, and while its growth fell to a 2.9 percent annual rate from the 4.6 percent showing in the second quarter, it remained solid. Residential investment rose at a strong 5.1 percent annual rate after months of declines. Exports rose as well, but not as much as imports, a net loss.
Business investment, which includes research and development, buildings and equipment, was disappointing, though, with a 3 percent drop. Spending on factories and offices sank by a whopping 15.3 percent.
Third-quarter growth suffered a bit from a six-week strike at General Motors that halted production. Troubles at Boeing, the nation's largest aerospace manufacturer and its largest manufacturing exporter, have also nibbled away at output. The company's 737 Max has been grounded after two calamitous crashes, and deliveries of planes coming off the assembly line have largely halted.
Mr. Herzon sees those as temporary developments. And businesses that have stepped back from building inventories, he argued, will reverse course soon.
Consumer prices, excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, rose at a 2.2 percent rate, slightly above the Fed's target.
The number has political resonance.
The economic data will help shape campaign narratives for the 2020 presidential election. Democratic candidates have focused not just on the total size of the economy, but also on how its rewards are distributed.
President Trump has repeatedly highlighted the economy's performance as evidence that his recipe of tax cuts, deregulation and confrontational tactics on trade is working.
The annual growth rate, though, has fallen short of the president's repeated promise that it would surpass 3 percent, or even 4 percent. In July, the White House predicted that the figure would hit 3.2 percent in 2019, and remain at 3 percent or above for the next five years.
That outlook is far more optimistic than those of the Fed, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and most Wall Street analysts. Most forecasts hover around the 2 percent mark -- a rate that many economists consider sustainable over the long haul. Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, characterized the 1.9 percent rate as "a nice soft landing" in line with long-term growth trends.
Still, it is a pace that Mr. Trump scorned in his 2016 campaign.
Though hearty annual growth rates were common for most of the postwar era, the economy has not expanded by 3 percent or more in a full calendar year since 2005.
Growth figures can swing from one quarter to the next, and the Commerce Department will revise this latest result twice more, as more data comes in.
Other parts of the economy have demonstrated a reassuring sturdiness. Although the number of jobs created each month has drifted down, for instance, the jobless rate is still at its lowest point in decades. And the stock market continues with regular bursts of enthusiasm like the record high the S&P 500 reached Monday.
The trade battle with China is a wild card.
Word from Mr. Trump that the United States and China are close to completing what he calls "Phase 1" of an agreement helped calm some of the roiling anxiety swirling around trade relations. But there have been no substantive details on what a pact would include, and analysts remain wary that this potential breakthrough, like previous ones, could be followed by an abrupt policy reversal from the White House.
"There's been a big drop in business confidence, across the board," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "This 'Phase 1' thing is trivial compared to enormous obstacles."
Summertime shopping might have been given an artificial lift by importers who rushed to bring in goods from China before tariffs were scheduled to increase in September, Mr. Shepherdson added. But that short-term gain, he warned, could mean a falloff in the next three months.
Grady Cope, founder and president of Reata Engineering, a design, tooling and production firm in Englewood, Colo., offered a guarded outlook.
"As business owners, we're all a little bit scared of tariffs," said Mr. Cope, whose company has a long list of multinational customers. "China is a huge part of the global economy and the only place where some parts can be made."
Still, he said, "business has been good."
"We see some customers slowing down," he said, "but not as many as we were expecting based on stuff we were hearing last year."
Missteps could change the outlook.
During the first three months of 2019, the economy confounded downbeat prognosticators and grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent.
As the temporary lift from tax cuts faded and hopes for a trade deal with China fell apart in the spring, growth slacked off in April, May and June. The annual rate shrank to 2 percent. Trade tensions and a slowing worldwide growth hit the manufacturing sector particularly hard. Exports fell and business investment slumped.
Worries about a recession thickened over the summer. Mr. Trump escalated his attacks on China and unleashed another round of retaliatory tariffs. Wall Street was particularly unsettled by quirky movements in the bond market that have usually been associated with recessions. Industrial activity around the globe stalled.
Since then, the concerns have abated.
"The biggest risks to the economy today are uncertainty and complacency," Cris deRitis, deputy chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an analysis. "With political risks and uncertainty casting a shadow across economic regions" around the world, he added, "the potential for policy errors and significant global shocks may overwhelm solid economic fundamentals."

Texto completo: Here's one reason to fork over $4.99 for a subscription to Apple's new streaming TV network: so you can join those of us already trying to figure out how they spent all that effort and money ($15 million per episode, I read) and got two of Hollywood's most powerful women to sign on, co-produce and co-star in a #MeToo-inspired drama series that is somehow so implausibly overblown and poorly envisioned that the one character you wind up relating to - even sympathizing with - is the predatory creep.
Everybody calm down. "The Morning Show," the marquee offering from Apple TV+'s long-anticipated launch on Friday, is hardly what I would describe as a car wreck, at least judging by the first three episodes (of 10) made available for this review. It is, however, a conspicuous fender bender, in which ambition has been rear-ended by self-importance, causing it to bump into a dump truck full of cliches.
As a show, it's spread on as thick as it looked to be in all those teaser trailers, a promisingly salacious tale of conflict that gets bogged down by its need to also seem noble. It's reminiscent of Aaron Sorkin's leadenly righteous HBO series "The Newsroom," another finger wagger about the high-stakes, ethically murky world of broadcast news. Keep in mind, there are still viewers out there who thought "The Newsroom" was fantastic stuff; if you're among them, then "The Morning Show" will probably soon have you eating out of its hand.
The story itself couldn't be more topical, especially if you happen to think what happens behind the scenes at a network morning show is endlessly fascinating. The intrigue! The tantrums! The tantrums about the tantrums!
Based loosely on the initial revelations of sexual misconduct that wiped Matt Lauer from the face of NBC's "Today" show in 2017, "The Morning Show" is set at the fictional UBA network, where longtime morning co-anchor Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) gets to work as usual at 4 a.m. to discover that her on-air partner of 15 years, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), has been fired for sexual misconduct against women who worked in subordinate jobs at the show.
With little in the way of details and the dawning awareness that the network kept the problem secret for some time before taking action (some of which has been leaked overnight to the New York Times), Alex must take the anchor desk alone and tell America the news of Mitch's dismissal - a challenging combination of personal grief and tonally appropriate sympathy for the accusers. Aniston's laserlike eyes bore in on the camera as she portrays Alex handling this task like a pro; the immediate reaction from America is that they are standing with her.
"Too bad you can't throw a crisis at her every day. It turns her lights on," remarks the network's recently named head of the news division, Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup), who quickly proves himself to be the first of many snakes slithering around in "The Morning Show's" pit.
Out in leafy, lofty suburban estateland, Mitch watches Alex's broadcast with blazing indignation, rationalizing his misconduct as nothing more than consensual affairs. He lashes out at his agent, lawyers and crisis consultants, who are gathered in his living room to assess the damage, which is, in every sense, irreparable. Finally, he takes a fireplace poker to the flat-screen, just before his wife tells him she wants a divorce.
Carell wouldn't be cast in this part unless "The Morning Show" (developed and co-written by Kerry Ehrin, whose work includes "Bates Motel," "Parenthood" and "Friday Night Lights") intended to go deep into the private and public torment of such a man: Do the clouds of rage lift long enough for Mitch to admit his wrongdoings? Will he cling to the hope that the world will somehow realize he's the victim here? Can he see and hear what the women are saying through the walls of raging entitlement? Let's put a pin in that for the moment.
Reese Witherspoon, in all her spitfire glory, plays Bradley Jackson, a roving reporter for an apparently conservative-leaning local news chain called Southeast News Network. Unwittingly (or perhaps not), Bradley becomes the news cycle's other big viral sensation when she is seen confronting a pushy protester at a West Virginia coal mine, lecturing him on his ignorance of energy issues as well as the ignorance of coal proponents.
In one of "The Morning Show's" more overwrought monologues, Bradley's tirade extends itself to the very essence of truth-telling in America. It draws several million shares and the attention of the morning show's best booker, Hannah Shoenfeld (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who pitches an interview with Bradley as a way to distract from the ongoing crisis at the network.
Bradley accepts the show's invitation to come to New York, where she gets grilled, live, over journalistic ethics by a skeptical and grumpy Alex. A crackly chemistry emerges between the women - indicating that a sisterly Savannah-and-Hoda origin story is not in the offing. It feels more like the story of Megyn Kelly's wobbly ascension: Who is Bradley, and what original skill set might she bring to this glass anchor table? Whatever the camera loves about her, Cory is also delighted and immediately begins wooing Bradley for a permanent slot on the show, against the panicked objections of a stereotypically haggard, nerdy executive producer (Mark Duplass as Chip Black).
"The Morning Show" is "inspired by" a nonfiction book about TV morning shows by CNN media reporter Brian Stelter; Apple announced the series eons ago, and it has since shed its original producer and showrunner, with Ehrin taking over. Early on, it was described as a comedy drama. Now it's just a very serious drama (with a few sharply witty lines thrown in), a kind of fancifully modern "All About Eve" worn inside-out.
Neither Aniston nor Witherspoon paves new ground here, but they're giving better performances than the scripts they've been handed. At one point in the third episode, I began to wonder whether they'd been miscast and ought to switch roles for a mightier - and more surprising, satisfying - challenge? I also wondered whether "The Morning Show" has what it takes to steer well clear of the temptation to devolve into glamorous but disappointing fights that pit women against women.
As for Carell's role? A week ago, I reviewed HBO's "Mrs. Fletcher" and suggested that, as strong as the title character's story is, the slightly more fascinating parts of the series are about her college freshman son's disastrous encounters in a liberal arts atmosphere of gender and racial awareness. That review netted a few angry responses: How dare I take away from the fact that it's a show about a middle-aged woman's life and sexuality?
Sorry to say, then, that the best part of "The Morning Show" is once again about the awful dude. Carell's Mitch experiences the full effects of cancel culture, although he does have the salve of being a multimillionaire, and the series is rightfully (if perhaps offensively) obsessed with his misery. He tries commiserating with other louts (Martin Short is particularly effective in a cameo as a disgraced but unrepentant film director); he tries to marshal his defenses into an effective comeback plan. As presented so far, "The Morning Show" is less a standoff between two women and instead hinges on one question: Will men ever listen?

Texto completo: How many times in your life have you thought to yourself or been earnestly told that you should write a book? Journeys through unimaginable experiences and mind-boggling coincidences are just waiting to be recorded in your own distinctive style. What are you waiting for? It's never too late to start writing.
I love to write and here's why. Writing helps appreciate and remember the fine details. On a recent trip to the Mediterranean, visiting fascinating places and being surrounded by riveting history as well as an eclectic mix of people, I chronicled the splendid points of each day's adventure. Whether or not I draft a memoir, these missives will long be mine to treasure.
Writing expands your vocabulary. My daughter's teacher once commented that her story needed more "sizzling" words. What a descriptive and relatable phrase to motivate a young author into improving her prose. The Thesaurus feature of the Word program is also a writer's comrade at the ready with stimulating verbs and touchy feely nouns.
Writing keeps your brain sharp. There's ongoing news and research about dementia. Maintaining good reading and writing skills is undeniably outstanding exercise for the brain.
In almost every grade, students are tested on their writing abilities and many struggle with the process. My first efforts of putting pen to paper were on the pages of a pink diary with a tiny brass lock and key.
In college, I enrolled in creative writing classes and then found evening courses on writing at this hip place called The Learning Annex. As much as some claim writing is a solitary diversion, hours spent with eclectic groups of artsy writers, all doing and sharing what they loved, felt transforming. Then and now, writing is an escape; a creative outlet to express feelings, articulate thoughts and preserve memories.
Writing lets your imagination run free. I've written newspaper columns, internet blogs, short stories, full length novels and now have released two children's books, "The Adventures of Percy the Siberian Cat" and "No More Bullies!" Mountains of paper rumble around the rooms and closets of my house never to see the light of day, and that's OK too.
Writers can participate in critique groups at libraries, attend meetings with fellow members of a local guild and join classes. Being surrounded with others who understand and share the love of creating prose helps overcome those crushing thoughts and nagging doubts of whether any of what's painstakingly penned and edited is worth reading.
Where to begin on this journey? Write what you know. Don't write with false expectations of landing on the New York Times best-seller list. Start small with a short story. Enter a story in an online writing contest. Self-publishing today is attainable with some patience (and YouTube help videos.) There's Kindle Direct Publishing (www.kdp.com), www.lulu.com and more. But first finish your masterpiece.

‘Anti-Trump dynasty’: Brother of 2020 Democrat in line to become top editor of New York Times

Texto completo: The brother of Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bennet is reportedly in line for one of the top editorial jobs at the New York Times.
Dubbed the "Anti-Trump Dynasty" by the Washington Post, James Bennet, 53, and his brother Michael, 54, chose different professions but share similar values and have both been outspoken in their criticism of President Trump. James currently oversees the editorial page of the Times and is rumored to be next in line for the Executive Editor position when it is vacated by Dean Baquet.
The opinion sections in the New York Times were referred to as "far left-wing" by Baquet, who indicated in 2016 that some more conservative voices in the Times should be justified. James Bennet, who has served as the Editorial Page Editor since 2016, has been the subject of some controversy for including Brett Stephens in the team of opinion writers.
Stephens' first column for the newspaper cast doubt on some theories about the effects of man-made climate change and resulted in subscription losses. Stephens and Bennet found themselves embroiled in controversy once again when, earlier this year, Stephens criticized an academic for referring to him as a "bedbug," and asserted that it was akin to the dehumanizing language employed by the Nazis in World War II.
Stephens became a punchline on Twitter after publishing his article about language, and Bennet quickly came to his defense, noting that he had helped edit the column before it ran.
"After that whole thing erupted, James and I went out for a very friendly drinking session,” said Stephens after the incident. “His line was: ‘We seem to be approaching peak Twitter insanity.'"
While Stephens' editorial voice bends against many of the more liberal positions at the Times, some conservatives have been critical of his more left-wing views on issues, such as gun control. He has also consistently spoken out against the president, once comparing him to fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.
Bennet defended his choice to hire Brett Stephens, despite criticism from people who felt he was too conservative.
"I think if we show we take conservatives seriously and we take ideas seriously … we get a lot more moderates paying attention to what the New York Times has to say," Bennet said in a staff meeting.
Throughout the criticism, however, Bennet found support in his mission to diversify the editorial voice of the New York Times from owner A.G. Sulzberger.
"It’s increasingly hard to find places where diverse voices debate ideas respectfully and thoughtfully. But that’s exactly what James believes is needed, and it’s what he’s building,” said Sulzberger. “Under his leadership, Opinion has been vital, creative, and unafraid to tackle big issues, from privacy to domestic abuse to the legacy of slavery. He’s not only a great editor but a deeply honorable one. As much as any journalist I’ve worked with he’s constantly pushing himself to make the right journalistic decision."
Bennet and the New York Times were the subjects of controversy after running a piece in 2017 that linked former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to the shootings in which then-Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise were injured. Though the original article was edited to remove that link, Palin later sued Bennet and the newspaper for defamation. He later referred to the gaffe as an "honest mistake."
Sources from the Times indicated that Bennet had been the subject of evaluation by Times employees, which some say is an indication that he is a serious candidate for the role Baquet is expected to leave in the near future.
Michael Bennet, who currently represents Colorado in the U.S. Senate, has a harder road to his next promotion. He is currently at an average of less than 1% among other Democratic contenders for the Oval Office.

What takes five ingredients, 8 hours and tastes mind-blowingly delicious?
Mississippi roast.
If you haven't had this internet phenomenon, you haven't lived.
Pinned more than 1 million times on Pinterest and dubbed "the roast that owns the internet" by the New York Times, this slow-cooker sensation is not one to pass up.
Bursting with flavor, it's rich and juicy, melt-in-your-mouth tender and takes zero effort to make.
And, again, it's five ingredients - how could you not make it?!
While there are many versions to be found, I went with Helen's.
Helen is the mother of my buddy, Paul Brown. She is the sweetest lady. She visits nursing homes, loves Perry Mason, and, like myself, enjoys cooking and sharing recipes.
She also happens to be from Mississippi, where this recipe hails, so using her version was a no-brainer.
It calls for a 4-pound chuck roast, a packet of ranch seasoning, a packet of au jus mix, 1 cup of sliced pepperoncinis and half a stick of butter. An odd combination of ingredients, but it creates the best roast ever!
You dump all the ingredients into a slow cooker, and are you ready? Set it and forget it!
After 8 hours of enduring the enticing aromas, the meat is shredded and ready to be savored.
While it's tempting to just grab a fork and eat it right out of the slow cooker - which you totally can, no judgment here - it's great served over mashed or baked potatoes, rice, egg noodles or, my favorite way, on a toasted hoagie and dunked into its own juices French dip-style.
If you're wondering if the pepperoncinis make this spicy, they don't. Their vinegar flavor adds a welcomed zesty kick to the dish.
And in typical pot roast fashion, potatoes, onions, carrots or celery can be added. Just place them into the slow cooker during the last 2 hours of cooking.

1 (4-pound) beef chuck roast
1 (1-ounce) packet ranch dressing mix
1 (1-ounce) packet dry au jus mix
1 cup sliced pepperoncini peppers
1/4 cup butter
Coat the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray and place the roast in it. Sprinkle the ranch dressing mix, au jus mix and pepperoncini peppers over the roast and then top with butter.
Cover and cook on low for 8 hours.
Shred and serve over mashed potatoes, noodles, rice or rolls.

Texto completo: AP Television Writer
LOS ANGELES — The Morning Show started life as a behind-the-scenes peek at a slice of network TV as familiar and routine as a wake-up cup of coffee. Then shocking revelations of sexual misconduct engulfed NBC’s Today and beyond, and the story changed.
The 10-part drama series, part of the first wave of shows launching the Apple TV Plus streaming service Nov. 1, expanded its original focus on women’s role in media to include the repercussions of workplace bad behavior. It all plays out in the lucrative, hypercompetitive world of A.M. news-and-fluff programming.
“When the Me Too movement happened it was really hard to ignore, nor would we want to ignore it. We would be negligent,” said Mimi Leder, an executive producer and director for The Morning Show.
While Hollywood has paid glancing attention to the sexual abuse and harassment scandals that have roiled it and other industries, with accusations derailing the careers of actors, executives and journalists, The Morning Show is among the few major projects to delve more deeply.
Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon lead the cast that includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell and Desean Terry. Aniston plays Alex, the long-reigning queen of the now-slumping Morning Show, and Witherspoon is Bradley, an outspoken TV reporter with a shaky job history who lands hard on Alex’s turf.
But Alex’s longtime co-anchor Mitch (Carell) already has wreaked havoc. The drama opens with him fired by network UBA for multiple instances of alleged misconduct, evoking Matt Lauer’s dismissal from Today. Mitch’s banishment creates career and psychological upheaval for Alex and opportunity for those waiting in the wings for their shot at network glory.
Among them is Daniel (Terry), an African-American co-anchor who chafes at what he considers pressure to downplay his ethnicity and hopes the top anchor job will be his reward. There are impressive displays of ambition and plot twists galore in the three episodes Apple made available of the glossy, expensive-looking drama that’s debuting three episodes on Nov. 1. Remaining episodes will be released consecutively on Fridays.
Apple TV Plus costs $4.99 a month after a seven-day free trial, and a subscription can be shared with up to six family members. The streaming service is free for a year to buyers of a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV box.
Alex’s somber on-air response to the scandal evokes memories of Samantha Guthrie and Hoda Kotb telling Today viewers about Lauer’s November 2017 firing for what NBC called “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.” The fallout has yet to subside: co-anchors Guthrie and Kotb returned to the subject of Lauer earlier this month after further allegations against him emerged in Ronan Farrow’s new book, Catch and Kill.
“Morning television is where the women in television were left to pick up the pieces,” observed Mary Murphy, an associate professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Series executive producer Michael Ellenberg began work on what became The Morning Show before #MeToo, saying he was intrigued by “what it means to be a woman in media” and specifically a woman with power in the morning network realm. He found the “authentic, precise” details he needed in journalist Brian Stelter’s 2013 nonfiction book, Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.
Ellenberg optioned the book, Aniston and Witherspoon were attached and Kerry Ehrin (Friday Night Lights, Bates Motel) was brought in as writer and showrunner (Stelter, a former reporter with The New York Times and now with CNN, is a consultant-writer). Leder said the drama from a nearly all-female slate of executive producers — including Aniston and Reese — is at its core about the relationship between Alex and Bradley.
The two are “colliding at a certain point in their lives,” Leder said, with Alex at “a plateau where ageism is starting to hit, and Bradley being this character who’s trying to make her mark, and what can these two women give each other?”
From Aniston and Witherspoon’s takeaway on what women in TV endure, they need all the friends they can find.
Women face more scrutiny on “how they’re allowed to dress, what jewelry they can and cannot wear,” Aniston said. “You never see a man being told you have to … get that gray out of your hair. You also never really see a gray-haired female newscaster.”
Added Witherspoon: “There’s just great disparity, gender disparity for sure” among on-air talent.
While viewers may play a guessing game about the fictional duo’s possible real-life counterparts, comparisons between Mitch and Lauer are inevitable. But Leder said the character and his actions were woven from many strands.
“We’re not just telling one story. Our stories are inspired by every story we’ve heard about, read about, witnessed or experienced in our personal lives,” said the veteran movie and TV director whose credits include On the Basis of Sex and The Leftovers.
Carell said he found the script “very honest” and with a layered depiction of his character.
“I thought, that’s what my approach is: That he was a guy who was at the top of his game, very popular, very liked, a narcissist, an egomaniac, but charming. And within his power, he had this enormous blind spot” to his failings, Carell said. In one notable scene with a friend (played by Martin Short) who’s also accused of sexual wrongdoing, the men spout off about their anger and frustration — until Mitch gets an eye-opening lesson in culpability.
“We’re so right in the middle of this process, in this moment of history, in the midst of this reckoning,” Leder said. “I think it’s exciting to explore all the gray and all the nuances of misconduct.”

White House Tests Loophole To Fill Vacancy

Texto completo: Officials who lead agencies in the department and echo the president's language on immigration were initially thought to be ineligible under a federal law.
WASHINGTON -- The White House has found a way to bypass a federal statute that dictates who can fill secretary positions, potentially allowing President Trump to choose whomever he wants to lead the Department of Homeland Security, according to an administration official. The route may run through an office established to counter weapons of mass destruction.
The Trump administration has encountered legal and personnel challenges in its search for a candidate who is aligned enough with Mr. Trump to carry out his hard-line immigration agenda and satisfy the legal credentials to be the acting secretary of a department riddled with vacancies.
After Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary who had a tumultuous relationship with the White House, announced this month that he would resign, it was widely believed in the administration that Mr. Trump would tap someone who would not question his more extreme policies. Mr. McAleenan has said he will step down on Thursday.
But officials leading agencies in homeland security who echo Mr. Trump's fiery language on immigration were initially deemed ineligible under the federal Vacancies Act. The law states that acting officials who take over cabinet-level positions must be next in the line of succession, have the approval of the Senate or have served 90 days under the previous secretary.
The White House, however, is exploring a loophole in the law, according to an administration official. Under this route, the White House would tap someone to be the assistant secretary of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which is vacant, and then elevate that person to be the acting secretary of homeland security.
The chief of that office is known as an "inferior officer," and under an exception in the laws governing appointments, such officials can be appointed to acting positions with the sole approval of the president, the official said.
The White House and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.
This year the Trump administration has purged, installed and transferred leaders in the department, sowing chaos among its ranks and creating a legal maze on personnel matters. The latest dubious workaround would mean that Mr. Trump has found a way to use the many holes in the department to fill a void.
It would also allow the White House to choose a hard liner previously believed to be ineligible for the position.
Mark Morgan and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, who both joined the department in recent months in an acting capacity, were thought to be out of the running for the job after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel advised that their appointment would violate the Vacancies Act. Neither Mr. Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, nor Mr. Cuccinelli, the acting director of the agency overseeing legal immigration, was confirmed by the Senate or served for at least 90 days under the last Senate-confirmed homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.
Mr. Cuccinelli, who would face a difficult road to nomination, was widely thought to be a top contender for the position after the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that Mr. Cuccinelli "would be good at the job."
But Mr. Cuccinelli has a tumultuous relationship with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell previously voiced his disappointment to the White House over Mr. Cuccinelli's appointment to the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Cuccinelli endorsed an effort by hard-line conservatives to force Mr. McConnell to step down and backed Mr. McConnell's primary challenger in 2014.
Mr. Cuccinelli told reporters this month that Mr. McConnell's comments were "political."
The appointment of Mr. Cuccinelli, who said this summer that the Statue of Liberty "referred to people coming from Europe," would be a significant turnaround for a conservative who just a couple years ago led a fierce opposition to Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy, including by criticizing his immigration policies.

Australia Says Google Misled on Phone Tracking

Texto completo: The company did not disclose the need to disable two different Android settings to stop data collection, regulators said in a lawsuit.
SYDNEY, Australia -- Australian regulators on Tuesday accused Google of misleading consumers about its collection of their personal location information through its Android mobile operating system, the latest government action against a tech company over its handling of vast quantities of user data.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleged in a lawsuit that Google falsely led users to believe that disabling the "Location History" setting on Android phones would stop the company from collecting their location data. But users were actually required to also turn off a second setting, "Web and App Activity," that was enabled by default.
Google did not properly disclose the need to disable both settings from January 2017 until late 2018, the suit alleges. The company changed its user guidance after The Associated Press revealed in August 2018 that it was continuing to collect the data even after the Location History setting was switched off.
The commission also said that while Google made it clear to users what features they would lose by turning off location services, the company did not inform them adequately about what it would do with the data collected.
"This is part of a system of not being able to make informed choices about what's being done with your data," said Rod Sims, the commission's chairman.
Mr. Sims called the lawsuit the first of its kind by a national government against a tech company over its use of personal data. The agency is seeking what he called significant financial penalties against Google, among other corrective measures. He added that he hoped the case would raise awareness among consumers over how much data is being collected.
"We need to be getting ahead of them, because this is a whole new world," he said of data collection issues.
A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company was reviewing the allegations. She said Google would continue to engage with the commission over its concerns but intended to defend itself.
The action by Australian regulators comes as governments and consumer groups around the world have expressed growing concern about the power of tech companies, including their collection of personal data from devices that are indispensable to the lives of billions of people.
Consumer groups from several European countries had already sued Google over the location tracking issue under a comprehensive data privacy law adopted in Europe last year. Under that law, a French agency fined Google 50 million euros, or about $ 55 million, in January for not properly disclosing to users how it collected data to create personalized ads.
In the United States, regulators approved a $ 5 billion fine against Facebook this year over its role in allowing Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump's 2016 election campaign, to gain access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users.
While Google has made changes to Android in later iterations that limit the location data it gathers, the business incentives for collecting as much personal data as possible remain great. Location-targeted advertising is worth an estimated $ 21 billion a year, and Google, along with Facebook, dominates the mobile ad market.
The Australian lawsuit is in part the product of a 19-month investigation by the consumer commission into the market power of Google and Facebook. It issued 23 recommendations, including an overhaul of privacy laws, to limit their reach and force them to take more responsibility for the content they disseminate.
The Australian government has also passed legislation challenging the power of tech companies, including a law in 2018 that compelled tech-industry giants to disable encryption. And under a new law criminalizing "abhorrent violent material" online, Australia is using the threat of fines and jail time to pressure platforms like Facebook to block such content, and it is moving to take down websites that hold any illegal content.

Pushing America to the Breaking Point

Texto completo: Not in the Cold War, not during Vietnam, not during Watergate did I ever fear more for my country.
If America's worst enemies had spent years designing a plan to erode our greatest strengths, they could not have done better than what some of our fellow citizens are doing to the country every day for short-term financial or political gain.
Prominent figures in government, politics and commerce are behaving in ways that are so destructive of the core institutions and norms that underpin our democracy, one can only assume that they take the country's stability as a given -- that they can abuse and stress it all they want and it won't break.
They are wrong. We can break America, and right now we're on our way there. Not in the Cold War, not during Vietnam, not during Watergate did I ever fear more for my country.
This moment "is like Wall Street before the financial crisis, when everyone just took for granted that the system was forever stable," remarked Gautam Mukunda, research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and author of "Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter."
"So they kept taking bigger and bigger risks and pushing it harder and harder -- until they pushed too hard and it crashed and the government had to step in and rescue everyone. If they keep acting like this, Trump and his allies will keep getting short-term wins until the system crashes. Only there won't be any government to step in and rescue them, because they'll have broken it -- and the country along with it."
What am I talking about? I'm talking about a president willing to sink to banana republic governing norms, including withholding aid to Ukraine to compel its leadership to investigate his political rival.
I'm talking about Republican lawmakers who know that the president's Ukraine machinations are indefensible and impeachable, particularly after Tuesday's disclosures by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, that he personally heard President Trump appeal to Ukraine's president to investigate Joe Biden.
Republicans now have a clear choice: let the constitutional impeachment process proceed or attack the process, i.e., our legislative-judicial order. Alas, a majority seem to be opting for the latter.
They justify it with daily new conspiracy theories amplified by Fox News. They even stormed a secure room in the Capitol to mislead the public into thinking these hearings are totally one-sided -- when in fact both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and lawyers from the relevant committees are doing the questioning.
In attacking all the diplomats, intelligence officers and civil servants who have stepped forward, at great professional risk, to bear witness against Trump, they are attacking the people who uphold the regulations -- and provide the independent research and facts -- that make our government legitimate and the envy of people all over the world, where many people have to bribe government workers for service.
And, finally, there's the internet barons who for too long ignored the weaponization of social media, which is turning our free press into a house of mirrors, where citizens can no longer cognitively discern fact from fiction and make informed judgments essential for democracy.
I watch it all and wonder: "Are you really doing that? Do you all go home at night to some offshore island where the long-term damage you're doing to America doesn't matter?"
And what's even more frightening is that there are now so many incentives in place in media and politics -- from gerrymandering to unlimited campaign contributions to data systems that can ever more perfectly define us, divide us and subdivide us -- to ensure that these people will keep on hammering our system until they smash it to pieces.
Look at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was questioned last Wednesday at a House hearing by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A.O.C. was trying to grasp why Zuckerberg thinks it's O.K. for politicians to run political ads that contain obvious lies, as the Trump campaign has already done in a Facebook ad about Biden viewed by some five million Facebook users.
This is all about money for Zuckerberg, but he disguises his motives in some half-baked theory about freedom of the press -- so half-baked that he couldn't explain it even when he knew he would be asked about it by a congressional committee. Read it and weep:
A.O.C.: "Could I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal?"
M.Z.: "Can you repeat that?"
A.O.C.: "Would I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal? If you're not fact-checking political advertisements, I'm trying to understand the bounds here of what's fair game."
M.Z.: "I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head."
A.O.C.: "Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?"
M.Z.: "Congresswoman, I think lying is bad. I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That's different from it being -- in our position, the right thing to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied."
A.O.C.: "So you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? It's a pretty simple yes or no."
M.Z.: "Congresswoman, in most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves."
Yeah, right, as if average citizens are able to discern the veracity of every political ad after years of being conditioned by responsible journalism to assume the claims aren't just made up.
Just once I'd like to see Zuckerberg look into a camera and say: "I will take Facebook stock down to $ 1 if that is what it takes to ensure that we're never again an engine for the perversion of democracy in any country, starting with my own. Facebook is not going to accept any more political ads until we have the resources to fact-check them all."
I doubt he'll do that, though, because his priorities are profits and power, and he seems quite ready to hurt American democracy to get them.
Would that he were alone. Think about the Oct. 23 statement that White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham put out, no doubt on Trump's orders, after the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified before House committees.
Taylor's testimony also indicated that Trump withheld vital military and economic aid from Ukraine to pressure its president to conduct an investigation that could sully the man he may run against in the next election -- Biden.
"President Trump has done nothing wrong," said Grisham's Orwellian statement. "This is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution."
And who is Stephanie Grisham to render that judgment? She is someone, this newspaper reported, who ascended to her job after a career in which she "mixed toughness and loyalty to her bosses with professional scrapes, ethical blunders and years spent alternately wooing and pounding the press on behalf of scandal-prone Arizona Republicans."
And who is Bill Taylor? Someone who has devoted his entire adult life to public service -- someone who has served honorably in both Democratic and Republican administrations, as a West Point grad, an infantry officer in Vietnam, a diplomat at NATO, a civil servant in numerous cabinet agencies and a U.S. ambassador. Oh, and this "radical unelected bureaucrat" was chosen for his current position by Mike Pompeo, Trump's secretary of state, who has not uttered a word in his defense.
And who is Senator Lindsey Graham? He's the senator who's always willing to ask American soldiers to make the ultimate sacrifice in places like Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq -- to protect our precious democracy -- and he's the senator who's always unwilling to make even the smallest political sacrifice to protect democracy when it's threatened at home by this president.
Graham was all for impeaching Bill Clinton for lying over sex with an intern and he won't lift a finger to judge Trump for using taxpayer money to coerce a foreign leader to intervene in our election on Trump's behalf. Graham -- and all the rest of them -- will live in infamy.

The Navy SEALs' crisis of character

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade – who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times – Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons." Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

Trump se molesta por testimonio de militar en su contra para jucio político

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump expresó su rechazo del testimonio del teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , un experto de Ucrania asignado al Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, quien testifica en la Cámara sobre la llamada del mandatario al presidente ucraniano.
“Supuestamente, según los Medios Corruptos, el testigo de hoy que nunca ha sido trumpista calificó de ‘preocupante’ la llama a Ucrania. ¿Estaba en la misma llamada que yo? ¡No puede ser posible! Pídanle que lea la transcripción de la llamada. ¡Cacería de brujas!” , escribió el mandatario.
Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call “concerned” today’s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can’t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019
The New York Times adelantó que Vindman alertó sobre las peticiones del mandatario republicano a su homólogo ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky , para investigar al exvicepresidente Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter , por una indagatoria supuestamente cancelada por la participación del segundo en una empresa gasera de Ucrania.
A cambio, la Administración Trump asignaría recursos militares y prepararía una reunión de ambos mandatarios en la Casa Blanca.
Vindman es el primer testigo de esta primera parte del proceso de juicio político que escuchó la llamada del 25 de julio entre los presidentes Trump y Zelensky, durante la cual Trump dijo que quería un “favor”, luego de que el ucraniano sacara el tema de casi $400 millones de dólares en ayuda militar estadounidense prometida.
El teniente coronel estaba escuchando desde la Sala de Situación junto con otros funcionarios de Seguridad Nacional y personal del vicepresidente Mike Pence , dijo en declaraciones preparadas.
Agregó que le parecía que la acción era preocupante y que podría verse como “un juego partidista que podría afectar la seguridad nacional de los EEUU.

Texto completo: El teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , principal experto en Ucrania para el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, testificó este martes ante los representantes encargados de la investigación previa a al juicio político del presidente Donald Trump. Su testimonio no gustó al mandatario pero reveló información que puede ser clave para que los demócratas sigan adelante con un proceso que puede sacar a Trump de la Casa Blanca.
Vindman estuvo en la llamada telefónica que el presidente hizo el 25 de julio a su homólogo ucraniano y que llevó a la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, a anunciar el inicio de una consulta que reuniera los apoyos necesarios para someter a Trump a un impeachment. En dicha conversación, tal y como confirmó el coronel en su testimonio, Trump presionó a su homólogo ucraniano para que investigara a su rival político Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter.
Vindman aseguró a los legisladores que la transcripción de la llamada que publicó la Casa Blanca había excluido la palabra “Burisma” , la compañía de gas ucraniana por la que Trump quiere que investiguen a los Biden. En la transcripción tampoco aparece las palabras de Trump afirmando que había grabaciones de Biden .
The New York Times publicó en la tarde del martes que Vindman ofreció correcciones pero las rechazaron. Según sus declaraciones, el excombatiente en Irak no comprendió por qué hicieron unos cambios y no otros.
Su testimonio supuso la quinta confirmación hasta ahora de que Trump condicionó o bien una reunión con Zelenski o bien la entrega de ayuda militar a Ucrania a una investigación de sus rivales políticos, un tema que podría espolear un proceso de destitución del presidente.

According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons." Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

Texto completo: The Torlonia family assembled one of the world's most important private collections of statuary. It will go on display in Rome in March, a prelude to a grand tour.
ROME -- Several of this city's finest museums bear the names of the aristocratic families who once built majestic palazzi and stuffed them full of priceless art: the Borghese, the Barberini, the Doria Pamphilj, and more still.
But one of the world's most precious private collections -- that of the Torlonia family -- has remained out of bounds, unseen by the public and known to most scholars only through its catalog, published in the late 19th century. It includes scores of busts and a veritable who's who of classical mythology, dating from the fifth century B.C. to the fourth century A.D. Eventually the collection would swell to 620 statues depicting Greek and Roman gods, goddesses and mythical heroes, as well as portraits of Roman emperors. The catalog's author, Pietro Ercole Visconti, described the sculptures as "an immense treasure of erudition and art, amassed in silence over the course of many, many years."
Inaccessibility fueled its mystique, and the Torlonia Collection became the stuff of legend.
After decades of negotiations and false starts, the public will be able to decide whether reality lives up to the myth when 96 statues go on display at the Palazzo Caffarelli, part of the Capitoline Museums here, in March. The exhibition, "The Torlonia Marbles. Collecting Masterpieces," will be open for a nine-month stint, a prelude to a grand tour.
On a warm October morning, a small group of visitors, including reporters for The New York Times, had a preview of the collection in the ground-floor former granary on Via della Lungara where the Torlonia Collection was installed around 1875.
Sculptures lined the walls and peppered the floors of several brightly lit rooms that for the past three years have served as a restoration laboratory.
At a news conference after the viewing, Italy's culture minister, Dario Franceschini, told reporters that he still felt a little giddy.
"You come out feeling stunned by so much beauty, such stupefying quality," he said.
The art historian Salvatore Settis, the co-curator of the exhibition with Carlo Gasparri, and a former director of the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, played the consul Cicero on the tour for Mr. Franceschini, Mayor Virginia Raggi, sundry culture ministry authorities and their respective retinues.
Passing through a leafy courtyard in a beehive of residential rentals owned by Torlonia family companies, Mr. Settis took a sharp right through a nondescript door and into an Aladdin's Cave of classical art.
He paused before a relief of a ship tied to a mooring block in a harbor, found at the site of the artificial ancient Roman harbor of Portus. "It's only been studied from photographs, no one has ever seen it," Mr. Settis told the minister.
Many pieces of the collection were well known without having been viewed, he told reporters.
"When I first entered the warehouse, I recognized dozens of pieces that I'd read about but had never seen," he said.
Students of classical art would have probably recognized the so-called Hestia Giustiniani, or a bust that has been identified as portraying Euthydemus of Bactria. The collection also includes a restoration by the Baroque-era sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini of a Greek statue depicting a resting goat. It was as though Bernini was "competing with antiquity," Mr. Settis said of the sculptor's integration of the work. The curator said that he thought other works in the collection would gain fame once they were known, including the bust of a third century A.D. matron, her hand wrapped in a fine veil.
In the case of the port scene, the restoration brought to light some of the traces of color that originally adorned the surface. Brightly painted sculptures were common in antiquity, but the color rarely survived the passage of time and the tastes of later collectors, who liked their marble sparkling white.
Restoration of the sculptures -- some Greek originals, others Roman copies of Greek statues as well as Roman originals -- began three years ago.
"The works were not in critical condition, but they were very dirty," mostly layers of dust that had settled over the years, Mr. Settis explained. The restoration, which was commissioned by the Torlonia family and sponsored by the Bulgari jewelry company, was carried out under the watchful eye of culture ministry experts to "return them to the splendor of antiquity," the curator said.
In a video on the website of the Torlonia Foundation, the chief restorer, Anna Maria Carruba, frees a statue from a papier-mâché shell imbued with a solvent, and then gently cleans the surface with soft sponges and a toothbrush.
"This has been the most wonderful restoration commission of my life," she told Ms. Raggi, the mayor, explaining how her team had documented each individual intervention on the statues over the centuries. Ms. Carruba has been working for a decade on the Torlonia Collection.
Different eras used different materials to restore and integrate classical works, and these often left visible traces, she explained. "We'll do the same, only our materials are more suitable," she said.
The collection was formed in the 19th century when the Torlonia began acquiring antiquities as befitting Rome's noble families.
The first lot acquired by the family, at public auction, belonged to the 18th-century restorer and sculptor Bartolomeo Cavaceppi, and included ancient statues and sarcophagi, along with terra cotta vases and bronzes that ended up decorating some of the Torlonia family villas. In 1825, the Torlonias acquired 270 works amassed by the 17th-century nobleman and art collector Vincenzo Giustiniani, an admirer of Caravaggio. At the same time, the collection swelled with works found during excavations on Torlonia properties around Rome. In 1866, the family bought the Villa Albani with its collection. It can be visited by appointment.
In 1875, Prince Alessandro Torlonia decided to found a museum on the Via della Lungara. The collection was open only to small groups of visitors, while scholars had sporadic access. In more recent decades, negotiations between the family and the Italian culture authorities to find a suitable showcase for the works never panned out.
In 2014, a descendant, Prince Alessandro Torlonia, created a foundation to promote the collection. Two years later, he and Mr. Franceschini signed an accord to exhibit part of it. The prince died in 2017, but the foundation carried on his wishes.
As the Torlonia sculptures are a "collection of collections," Mr. Settis explained, the exhibit in the Palazzo Caffarelli will showcase both the collection and the collecting practices of the Roman nobility from the 15th century on.
Under the terms of the accord the 96 statues on show in Rome will travel to museums around the world, though they have not been chosen yet.
The restoration laboratory, which includes a makeshift photo studio, takes up just a portion of the many rooms where the collection is stored. In the dark, sculptures wait for their turn to be scrubbed.
To this viewer, the most striking were the dozens of busts: expressive and moving portraits of long dead Romans, famous and not.
"Is there another Augustus?" asked Jean-Christophe Babin, chief executive of Bulgari, referring to the first Roman emperor.
‎Mr. Settis said the Torlonia had collected some 180 busts, making it one of the biggest collections of Roman portraiture in the world. Some are of "great quality," he said.
Italian officials are now seeking a site where the collection can be permanently displayed, so that the Torlonia, like other noble families, will have a museum of their own.
"This is a story with a happy ending," Mr. Settis said.

Texto completo: Alphabet, Google's parent, said its profits fell after a sharp increase in spending for research and development.
SEATTLE -- Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Monday that its quarterly profit fell 23 percent after it sharply increased spending, in a rare financial stumble by the tech giant.
Alphabet reported that its revenue rose 20 percent to $ 40.5 billion for the third quarter, but that profit dropped to $ 7.07 billion. Profit, which missed Wall Street forecasts, was hurt by rising costs for research and development and marketing, the company said.
In after-hours trading, Alphabet's stock declined 2 percent.
The performance demonstrated the challenges of trying to maintain growth at the company and showed how Google must invest to keep that up. While advertising, rooted in the dominance of Google's internet search engine, has sustained Alphabet's bottom line in recent years, that business isn't growing as fast as it once did. Google is also facing new competition for marketing dollars from Amazon and others.
Alphabet faces other challenges. Google is squarely in the sights of regulators and politicians who want to take down a monopoly. Its employees have been unhappy with management, political conservatives accuse the company of bias and YouTube has been under attack for spreading misinformation.
For the last few years, Google has worked to reduce its reliance on advertising dollars. It has invested in wooing corporate customers to its cloud computing services, branched into hardware with new smartphones, smart speakers and computers, and has continued to plow money into so-called moonshot investments like self-driving cars and cellular connectivity from hot-air balloons.
To build out these new businesses, Google is spending heavily to hire employees, invest in data centers and pay for marketing of new products like its Pixel smartphones.
Those investments have not yet paid off. Google Cloud is growing rapidly, but remains behind Amazon and Microsoft and it is unclear whether the business is profitable. Google's smartphones are an afterthought to Apple and Samsung.
The most notable financial gains from Alphabet's moonshot investments -- which it calls "Other Bets" -- are that they aren't burning as much money as before.
Ruth Porat, Alphabet and Google's chief financial officer, said the company was spending to hire and also to add infrastructure in areas like development of artificial intelligence and cloud computing "to support our growth."
Alphabet is also looking to extend its advertising stronghold by pumping more advertising into other online properties like YouTube and Google Maps. One-third of all global digital advertising spending flows through the company, according to the research firm eMarketer.
In addition to rising expenses, Alphabet said it incurred a $ 1.5 billion loss after writing down its investments in the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft. The company had made those investments through its various venture capital arms. It also took a $ 550 million charge to settle a legal investigation in France over its tax practices.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Alphabet's results were "still bad" since profits fell even without factoring in the investment losses.
In total, Alphabet's expenses grew 25 percent, outpacing revenue growth.
Ms. Porat said Alphabet's increase in hiring was "unusually high" during the quarter because it brought on a lot of recent college graduates. Alphabet said it added about 6,500 employees in the quarter, for a total work force of about 114,000 people.
The company also said its tax rate doubled to 18 percent from 9 percent a year ago.
Even though Google is facing regulatory scrutiny, Sundar Pichai, the company's chief executive, said on a conference call that he sees opportunities to pursue new business areas or make acquisitions.
"There are many new areas of opportunities available for us. In many of these new areas, we are the new entrant and we create competition," he said, without disclosing any specifics.

Women need a new script for life

Texto completo: "We've created a culture based on lies. Here are some of them: Career success is fulfilling; I can make myself happy; Life is an individual journey; You have to find your own truth; and Rich and successful people are worth more than poorer and less successful people."
Those are the powerful words of New York Times columnist David Brooks, who wrote an op-ed earlier this year entitled "Five Lies Our Culture Tells" to promote his new book, The Second Mountain. Brooks' core argument is that America has "overdone" it with the concept of hyper-independence. The only way forward to a meaningful life is to focus on our relationships. "We are formed by relationship, we are nourished by relationship, and we long for relationship. Life is not a solitary journey. It is building a home together. It is a process of being formed by attachments and then forming attachments in turn."
Brooks' message couldn't have come at a better time. Not only are millennials plagued by loneliness and depression, women across four generations are also unhappier than ever. Much of their misery is due to the lies our culture tells.
The one thing Brooks doesn't do is point the finger at who, specifically, is doing this lying — and why. He points to an attitudinal shift in the 1960s when Americans were encouraged to live for the "self." It was a reasonable reaction, he adds, to the stifling nature of the 1950s. But then something happened. "By conceiving of ourselves mostly as autonomous selves, we've torn our society to shreds."
Indeed we have. But who was primarily responsible for sending this message in the 1960s, and to who was the message directed?
Let me help you: feminists and women.
According to the latter study above, 49% of women say, "work-life balance is a myth." Indeed, women today feel "more stressed, tired, overwhelmed, anxious and burned out across every aspect of their lives than in the past — and significantly more so than their male counterparts."
Funny, this data is eerily similar to a 2009 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research that found women have become decidedly less happy in the post-feminist era. "In the 1960s," writes Ross Douthat in "Liberated and Unhappy," "American women reported themselves happier, on average, than did men. Today, that gender gap has reversed. Male happiness has inched up, and female happiness has dropped."
This phenomenon is a direct result of the lies women were fed about what constitutes a happy life. Since the 1960s, elite feminists have been shockingly successful at selling the idea that marriage and motherhood are stifling, that in order for a woman to be truly happy and fulfilled, she needs to live a man's life — because men (presumably) have the better end of the deal. Being out in the world slaying dragons, despite having a boss and the constant pressure to produce, is sold to women as liberating. And women listened.
There's just one problem: It isn't true that men had it made. What's more, no one explained to women how they were supposed to follow the male trajectory while also raise a family. No one told them those two paths invariably clash, causing women to crash and burn ultimately. No one told them that not only is it impossible for anyone, male or female, to "have it all," men and women are vastly different by nature and will thus never be successful in leading identical lives.
The reason American women are "more stressed, tired, overwhelmed, anxious, and burned out across every aspect of their lives than in the past" is precisely because, similar to the lies on Brooks' list, they were groomed to believe that career success is more fulfilling than marriage and family and that they don't need a man to be happy. Yes, some men (such as Brooks, by his own admission) fell prey to the idea that achievement makes us happy, but it is women who lead the charge.
It is women, not men, who have had these cultural lies drilled into them since the day they were born. Feminists feed women lies for political gain. They need women to believe professional success is where true fulfillment lies in order to achieve their goals. They don't want women to be focused on relationships. They don't want women to make commitments and keep them. They don't want women to be happy.
Men just followed suit. Prior to the 1960s, men were as focused on family as women were. Getting married and having children was considered the cornerstone of life, not the capstone. It was, for both men and women, the whole point. Professional success was all well and good, but it didn't compete with family. It supported the family to help it succeed. In other words, men went with what they thought women wanted. But as it turns out, it's not what women want. Otherwise, they wouldn't be miserable.
The only path forward is, as Brooks suggests, to dump the "individualist" worldview and to return to our relational roots. "Eventually, most people realize that something is missing in the self-interested life."
That's true, but wouldn't it be nice if people understood this before their lives started? Must everyone learn the hard way? It's absolutely within our control to change the road we're on, but it will require a monumental mind shift, and it will demand that women take the lead by doing the exact opposite of what the culture tells them to do.
Ladies, it is you most of all who have absorbed the lies our culture tells. The greatest lie of all is that career success is fulfilling in and of itself. If that is all you wind up with, you'll be miserable. Career success pales in comparison to finding a man to love who will love you back. It pales in comparison to having strong, healthy relationships with your children.
If you put your relationships first and fit the rest of your life around that, you're home free.

THE DEUCE 9 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. David Simon's breakout show "The Wire" articulated how the lives of ordinary people are shaped by the institutions they find themselves caught up in. "The Deuce," which Simon created with George Pelecanos, has a similar theme. For three seasons the series has shown how changes in the pornography industry in the United States affected the people involved in it. The show's final season, which concludes Monday, jumped to the mid-1980s, when VHS technology made it possible for people to watch erotic films easily at home. Some of the show's characters, like Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who went from prostitute to pornographic film director, seem to have prospered amid these changes, while others, like Frankie (James Franco), have clearly suffered. But for the most part the message is clear: Everyone is trying to get by in a world controlled by forces stronger than any individual.
What's Streaming
THE 39 STEPS (1935) Stream on the Criterion Channel. Rent on Amazon and iTunes. This Hitchcock thriller, one of his first sound films, helped establish the director's reputation in the United States and anticipates his later works like "North by Northwest" (1959). Robert Donat plays Richard Hannay, a man who is drawn into espionage intrigue after a chance meeting with a female spy -- who dies in his apartment after being attacked. With her last breaths, she reveals that she has discovered a plot to steal British military secrets. Richard flees to Scotland with a map she was carrying to escape her killers and find the leader of the plot. He meets Pamela (Madeleine Carroll) -- an early iteration of the infamous "Hitchcock blonde" character -- along the way.
AGATHA RAISIN & THE HAUNTED HOUSE Stream on Acorn TV. In this Halloween-season special, Agatha Raisin (Ashley Jensen) tries to make the jump from amateur investigator to professional sleuth. When her detective agency struggles to draw clients, Raisin's boyfriend, James (Jamie Glover), suggests she turn her attention to a local landmark, Ivy Hall. Some claim the home is haunted, and that its current owner, Olivia (Richenda Carey), is too. But the police refuse to investigate. Raisin steps in but things become more complicated when Olivia is killed and all of the village residents are potential suspects.
THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (2006) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner, a struggling entrepreneur competing for a job at a stock brokerage firm and taking care of his young son, Christopher Jr. (Jaden Smith), while homeless. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis questions the film's treatment of poverty and success. "It's the same old bootstraps story, an American dream artfully told, skillfully sold," she wrote. But Dargis also praised Smith's "warm expressiveness" and called both his and his son's performances "likable in the extreme."

Texto completo: By Catherine Porter
Hi, this is Catherine Porter and I am filling in for Ian Austen.
This week I told the story of Ooloosie Saila and her hometown: Cape Dorset, the town that art built but, as I learned, has not redeemed.
[Read: Drawn From Poverty: Art Was Supposed to Save Canada's Inuit. It Hasn't. ]
Cape Dorset is the farthest north I've ever been. It was an enlightening experience for me as a Canadian. We consider ourselves a northern nation, but few of us really go north, not only because it's sunnier in Florida.
It's also a lot cheaper to head south. I flew to Cape Dorset three times for this story and just the flights for each trip cost 3,200 Canadian dollars.
I had dreamed of going to Cape Dorset since a friend gave me a print created there as a wedding gift. The town is often called the art capital of Canada. Perched on the edge of the Arctic Ocean, it has produced more artists per capita than Toronto or Montreal.
Art was stitched into the hamlet's very existence. One of the first local businesses was the West Baffin Eskimo Co-Operative, which produced carvings and prints lauded by the country's establishment.
It seemed a brilliantly progressive idea: an Inuit-led cooperative encouraging local artists to express their culture, sell their work and then plow the money back into the community. That, I assumed, had shielded Cape Dorset from some of Nunavut's depressing statistics. Just look at the $ 9.8 million cultural center that had opened!
I hadn't even landed before I discovered I was wrong.
The airplane was filled with members of the circuit court, flying in to hold trials in the community hall. I learned that this was their busiest docket, jammed with assault and sexual assault cases. Almost all of the cases involved binge drinking.
"Everyone in town seems touched," said Mike Blanchard, a defense lawyer.
Cape Dorset is officially a restricted hamlet, meaning that people who want to buy alcohol must be approved by a local committee that checks criminal records. Many residents instead turn to the black market, where a 750-ml bottle of vodka goes for a mind-blowing 600 Canadian dollars. That's one reason residents across Baffin Island in Iqaluit voted to open a beer and wine store: They figured it would reduce poverty as well as violence.
I was in Cape Dorset only a few hours when I heard the name Ed Horne. He is notorious in Canada as a convicted pedophile, a teacher who moved around the north. He taught in Cape Dorset for three years, starting in 1978, and sexually assaulted a whole generation of boys. Many were left with severe PTSD that went untreated for two decades, until a settlement was reached with the government, Allison Crawford, a psychiatrist, told me.
Over days, I sought out artists who would talk to me about their work and their lives. One of those I met was Johnny Pootoogook -- an artist of unusual talent and of thoughtfulness. He was also homeless, couch surfing as he made his way up the town's lengthy waiting list for public housing. Mr. Pootoogook did have a house once. He lost it after he was sent to jail for using a firearm while drunk.
His story was not unusual.
Councilor Chris Pudlat told me that while art had helped some residents, it could not fill an existential crisis that began when the Inuit left their nomadic existence.
"My grandparents were born in igloos or skin tents on the land, literally," said Councilor Pudlat. "Before, people had something to do to contribute to the community or camp. They had a sense of purpose in life. That was taken away."
Some have managed to bridge both worlds and fashion a life as a modern Inuk. Quvianaqtuk Pudlat is one of them. I trudged to his house through a snow squall on my second trip and found him drawing at his kitchen table. He picked up a pencil three years ago, after an injury made construction work too painful. His subjects are mostly the wild animals he sees while out hunting.
Mr. Pudlat lived nomadically for the first years of his life. For him, being on the land isn't just recreation, it's what makes him Inuit.
When I came back in June, he took me ice fishing one night. At 8 p.m., the sky was still bright and the clouds were reflected in pools of water on the ice, giving the illusion we were flying through the sky behind his snowmobile. It was breathtaking.
Most artists told me they dreamed of this, making enough money to buy a snowmobile or a boat to get back to the land. But few pull it off. Even Mr. Pudlat planned to return to construction, and create art on the side. "It's not really making a living," he told me.
Over the course of my trips, my thinking evolved. Initially, I wondered why, with all that talent, Cape Dorset had not been saved by art. By the end, the question I asked myself was how, against all the odds, the artists of Cape Dorset kept producing such spectacular work.
You can check out the latest prints from the hamlet, released last weekend.

This week's Trans Canada and Around The Times were written by Ian Austen.
______
Trans Canada
■ Matthew Wong, a 35-year-old, self-taught artist from Edmonton whose work was attracting critical acclaim and international attention, died this month. "He synthesizes stylized representations, bright colors and mystical themes to create rich, evocative scenes," one critic wrote of Mr. Wong's paintings. "His works, despite their ebullient palette, are frequently tinged with a melancholic yearning."
■ As most of you know by now, Canada's federal election returned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to power, if humbled and without a majority in the House of Commons. Dan Bilefsky and I also looked at how the campaign and the result affected Canada's ever-present regionalism.
■ In Opinion, which is a separate shop from News where I work, the editorial board of The Times wrote of its hope "that Mr. Trudeau returns to office chastened and wiser." Jen Gerson, a political journalist in Calgary, argued that the "only factor saving Mr. Trudeau from a disastrous outcome on Monday was that none of the other parties convinced the electorate that they were better equipped to deal with the future that lies ahead." While Cheryl Thompson, a professor at Ryerson University in Toronto who has researched the history of blackface in Canada, said that responses to Mr. Trudeau's brownface and blackface past "made me realize what lies at the heart of Canadian racism. It's our signature behavior, our made-in-Canada brand. Nice and polite people can't be racist, after all."

On Nov. 11, a live edition of The New York Times podcast "Still Processing" featuring The Times's critic-at-large Wesley Morris and New York Times Magazine staff writer Jenna Wortham will close out the Hot Docs Podcast Festival in Toronto. Tickets and details are available here. And Canada Letter readers who use the code NYTPODFEST19 will receive a 10 percent discount.
And for those of you who missed the pre-election discussion Dan and I held, you can find a recording of it here.
______
Around The Times
■ A giant padlock was undone, a steel door opened and my colleague, Ben Hubbard, found himself in a jail cell in Northern Syria with 22 prisoners who had been captured in battles with the Islamic State.
■ If, like me, you enjoyed -- if that's the right word -- Patricia Highsmith's dark, psychological thrillers and the films they inspired, you may now be awaiting the publication of selections from her diaries, the 56 volumes of which were discovered at the back of a linen closet after her death in 1995. The editors promise they will provide an unembellished look at Ms. Highsmith, without glossing over her racism and anti-Semitism.

Houston Has Its Mission Under Control

Texto completo: As the Breeders' Cup World Championships approaches next weekend, another horse died at Santa Anita Park -- the event's host -- on Sunday, bringing the track's death toll to 36 and renewing anxiety over whether the landmark California racetrack is safe enough to welcome the world's best racehorses and host North America's richest days of racing.
Bye Bye Beautiful was euthanized after the third race, after being pulled up past the mile pole. The 2-year-old filly sustained a right forelimb lateral condylar fracture with medial sesamoid involvement. Her rider, Tiago Pereira, was not injured. Bye Bye Beautiful finished fourth in her first career start last month.
"The thoughts of the team at the Stronach Group and Santa Anita go out to everyone who cared for the filly, including trainer J. Eric Kruljac and his staff," the racetrack said in a statement.
On Friday on Santa Anita's training track, another horse, C Q Covergirl, injured both of her front legs and was euthanized. In all, six horses have died at Santa Anita since the track reopened last month, an alarming number considering that 30 horses had to be euthanized on its premises from Dec. 26 to June, prompting law enforcement investigations and calls from animal rights activists for the track to shut down.
In September, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said that horse racing was dangerously close to being out of business in his state.
"What happened last year was unacceptable, and all of the excuses be damned," Newsom said at a meeting with reporters for The New York Times. "We own that going into the next season, and we're going to have to do something about it. I'll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform. That's horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just to spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace."

Let the wedding games begin

Texto completo: Meredith and Andrew Shackleford didn't want their wedding to have an ordinary cocktail hour. Instead of having their guests sip drinks and eat canapes, the couple divided everyone into six teams to compete in a series of games that included croquet, ladder ball, and blindfolded wine tastings. The winning team took home bottles of Champagne and a trophy.
"The games were a way to prevent people from staying glued to their phones," said Meredith Shackleford, 34. "We wanted to create something where people could really get involved and interact with each other."
The Shacklefords, who are from Vancouver, British Columbia, and married in 2014, and own the wedding planning blog Love & Lavender, aren't the only ones breaking away from traditional cocktail hour fare. In recent years, a number of rental companies have cropped up to meet this growing demand for wedding games that can be played both indoor and outdoor.
Ian Samson an owner of Rustic Charm Event Co. in Charlotte, North Carolina, started his side business three years ago, after seeing how much fun guests had playing cornhole, giant Jenga, and giant Connect 4 at his outdoor wedding in Mason, Michigan. "We try to bring back classic games like Yahtzee and tic-tac-toe and KerPlunk," Samson said. "You can tell people are going back to a different time in their lives when they played these games."
Erin Fogg and her mother, Elaine Mee, founded Power of Love Rentals in 2013 in Portland, Oregon. They offer lawn games in addition to table linens, place settings and other wedding decor.
Wedding games, Fogg said, allow guests to mingle in a way that dancing doesn't. "People can socialize and chat when they're playing games, and oftentimes that's not possible when people are dancing to loud music," she said.
Bea Rue, 33, and Tyler Alan Mason, 32, who are from New York City, drew inspiration from older games - some from as far back as the 1500s - when they started Upstate Jamboree, a wedding game rental business that operates in New York's Hudson Valley and New York City. "We have a maze game that dates back to the 17th century, and it was created in Switzerland," Rue said.
Rue and Mason, who are engaged, started the business last year, after lending out their personal set of cornhole boards for a friend's wedding. "They had a little gaming corner during cocktail hour, where they also had ladder ball and croquet and it was really fun," Rue said. "We became quick friends with these far-flung family members of our friends who we had never met before, people from Canada and England and Spain. That's when the light bulb went off."
Upstate Jamboree offers four-hour rental packages that cost $900 to $3,200. The basic package provides lawn games like cornhole and croquet, while more expensive ones also offer the couple's signature games, which Mason, a carpenter, builds by hand. Other companies, like Power of Love Rentals, let customers rent each game for three days for a flat fee, though customers are sometimes responsible for picking up and returning the games themselves. (Power of Love offers delivery and setup for an additional fee, starting at $100.)
Rue says that her packages come with more than just instructional cards. "All of our rentals include an attendant who is there to teach people how to play the games, reset the games, and get people excited about them," she said.
Nina and Nicholas DePalma, both 29 of Olivebridge, New York, said having games at their wedding in Wallkill, New York, last year made it easier for guests to socialize with new people. "We had several groups of friends and family that had never met one another, so it felt really important to have some sort of icebreaker, besides the bar, that would allow people to feel comfortable and really get to know each other," said Nina DePalma, who is a project manager and coordinator for a research organization. "Our wedding was also a reunion for a lot of friends who hadn't see one another in some time, so it was cool to see those old friends come together and get in on some friendly competition."
Katie Test Davis and Dan Davis, both 34 of Raleigh, North Carolina, said the lawn games at their 2017 wedding in Charlotte, North Carolina - Jenga, Connect 4 and cornhole - were a hit with guests, from toddlers to baby boomers. "Even before the ceremony started, we had kids from both sides of our family find the games and start playing," said Katie Davis, who owns a public relations firm. "During cocktail hour, we gathered up a group of friends, grabbed drinks, and played a fairly competitive game of Jenga. That remains one of my favorite memories of the day."
Garland Middleton, 31, and Maxwell Johnathan Lasky, 29, of Crested Butte, Colorado, are big fans, too. The couple's wedding, which took place this summer at the mother of the bride's farm in Denver, New York, in the Catskill Mountains, had a barn and a rustic atmosphere that paired well with lawn games, Middleton said.
"Guests went nuts for the games," she said. "It was a great way to have people interact, and it provided a whole other area of hanging beyond where the reception was happening. People were thrilled and played all night long." - (The New York Times)

A tough out for Rays

Texto completo: ST. PETERSBURG  For Rays fans, the news could be viewed as a compliment. Or a kick in the gut. In this case, the two ideas are not mutually exclusive.

Word is the Red Sox have decided to hire Rays executive Chaim Bloom to run their baseball operations department. I suppose when you have the largest payroll in the game and you finish behind the smallest payroll, you might want to explore some of that magic yourself.

And, in some ways, this was inevitable. Tampa Bays front office is the envy of the league, and it was only a matter of time before Bloom was snatched up. But it would have been a lot nicer if he had gotten a job with the Giants or Mets last year. Heck, why not the Chunichi Dragons? Just somewhere far, far away from the Rays and the American League East.

Heres the problem:

It isnt what the Rays are losing, although that is substantial. It is what the Red Sox are gaining.

The Rays are already facing a greater challenge to differentiate themselves from the pack. Some of their innovative ideas from 10 years ago are now standard practice in a lot of major-league

front offices, which means the Rays have less and less room to operate within the margins.

And that task is now exponentially harder.

Bloom doesnt just know Tampa Bays secret sauce, he has added some of the ingredients over the years. First, while working under Andrew Friedman and, later, working alongside Erik Neander and Matt Silverman. And now he can bring some of those cutting-edge concepts to a team with a revolving door on its vault.

Look at it this way:

Since Friedman left Tampa Bay for Los Angeles in 2015, the Dodgers have 1) the best record in baseball, 2) won the division title every season, 3) won two pennants, 4) cut their payroll by 20 percent during his tenure.

Scared yet?

Granted, the Red Sox have their own challenges. Mookie Betts needs to be signed long term and J.D. Martinez can opt out of his contract next month. The pitching staff is bloated with unattractive contracts handed to David Price, Chris Sale and Nathan Eovaldi, and is also losing Rick Porcello.

Being the man in charge of Boston has its drawbacks, too. The spotlight is enormous, and the pressure is substantial.

Unfortunately for the Rays, that makes Bloom the right man for the job. He is not as polished or charismatic as outgoing Red Sox president Dave Dombrowski, but Bloom is utterly secure in his own skin. His time in Tampa Bay has taught him the value of sticking to the process and not being swayed by outside noise. That temptation to ingratiate yourself to fans and ownership with popular  but illogical  moves is the greatest threat to a general manager in charge of a large payroll.

As for the Rays front office, it will survive. During the postseason series with Houston, Bloom himself explained the uniqueness of Tampa Bays operation. The Rays dont just hire good people, they also give them the authority to make decisions. Even if that means making mistakes. If a midlevel exec is in charge of developing all the information on a potential move, Bloom said they should also be prepared to make the call themselves.

With that in mind, the Rays should be able to absorb Blooms departure. They have, after all, been anticipating it for a while.

Based on the talent on the roster, in the farm system and in the executive offices, theres ample evidence that Tampa Bay will still be a threat to win 90 or more games for the foreseeable future. The problem is whether that will be enough in the AL East with a resurgent Yankees team and a Red Sox franchise thats about to get a serious boost in IQ.

Once upon a time, Rays fans were apoplectic when Carl Crawford signed a free agent deal with the Red Sox. It was unthinkable. It was sacrilege. It was a violation of the natural order. The Rays would never be quite the same, the New York Times wrote the morning after Crawford left.

This?

This is worse. Much, much worse.

Heisler: Lakers have hopes, but Clippers are seeing dreams come true

Texto completo: We’re off and running in the capital of professional basketball.
It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

JIM ROONEY'S BOOK ON HIS FATHER, DAN, EXPANDS A LEGACY

Texto completo: You wouldn't suspect there'd be a lot of people walking around thinking, "I wish there were more books about the Rooneys, especially Dan," but that's never really discouraged anyone.
There's Art Rooney Jr.'s book about his brother Dan and Art Rooney Sr. and just about everyone the author or his primary subjects ever came into contact with; there's Dan's book about himself; there's Dan's book about North Side history and architecture, there's Pitt historian Rob Ruck's book about Art Sr., and I'm sure there are more.
None of that is to suggest it can't be a useful undertaking, such being the scope of the Rooney legend, and Jim Rooney's "A Different Way To Win, Dan Rooney's Story from the Super Bowl to the Rooney Rule," is in fact highly useful on a number of levels, perhaps most particular as it focuses on head coach Mike Tomlin, even if this new book has its emotional grounding amid the inescapable demands of grief.
In representing a second generation of Rooney to author a book primarily about his father, Jim Rooney was only getting started as Dan's life ended 2 1/2 years ago. Further, Jim dedicates the book to three deceased sisters, Kathleen, Rita and Joan, so even though "A Different Way To Win," presents as a book about business (the original intent was to pitch it to the Harvard Business Review), it is informed and sustained by loss.
"It was some of the best grieving experience anyone could ever have," Jim was saying the other day in the near North Hills. "Patricia Hume, whose husband John Hume won the Nobel Peace Prize (for his work on Ireland's troubles), her and I were in tears together for two hours. I had wonderful conversations with Loretta Brennan Glucksman (herself a part of the Irish peace process), with Joe Greene, Donnie Shell, Mel Blount, with (Former NFL) Commissioner (Paul) Tagliabue I probably sat with him over six days. I went down to see him in D.C., sitting in his office; he's not an emotional guy; it wasn't teary, but I remember him looking out into the D.C. skyscape and just remembering my dad in a way that was so much more than just a technical, professional relationship."
I thought Jim was describing a kind of speed grieving, almost, one that ultimately expanded the scope of the project.
"I didn't plan that," Jim said. "I was just trying to get the story, but the experience with these folks, and I talked to over 50 people, was that while they all had some kind of professional connection with him, they were moved in a way that to me appeared to be similar to a family member passing. That was the relationships he created."
No one should attempt to minimize Ambassador Rooney's legacy when it comes to Ireland or to the NFL or to the singular relationship between the Steelers and Pittsburgh, or to many other things, but the most topical and perhaps enduring on this side of the Atlantic remains the Rooney Rule, which mandates that any NFL team with a head coaching vacancy interview at least one minority candidate.
I hear from too many people who believe, for a variety of reasons, the Steelers should have such a vacancy today, and that the Rooney Rule painted the team into a corner from which they hired Mr. Tomlin in the first place. I hear from fewer, and still way too many, who refer to Mr. Tomlin as Coach Rooney Rule.
Some of this is benign ignorance, but another part is not so benign.
The truth is, Dan Rooney's commitment to equal opportunity predates not only Mike Tomlin's tenure here, it predates Mike Tomlin's life. As related by Jim in this book, it goes all the way back to Selma, 1965.
"Father Mark Glasgow was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1962 and was assigned to my parents' parish church," Jim wrote for the book. "Father Glasgow was part of a generation of young priests eager to apply the lessons they learned in the seminary to the problems and injustices of modern life. His homilies were filled with references to the struggle for civil rights. 'Father Glasgow's preaching it hit (Dan) right between the eyes,' my mother recalled.
"Dan, now in his early 30s, was already involved in the Urban League and the NAACP chapters in Pittsburgh. But Father Glasgow's homilies and private conversations persuaded him that he could be doing more. In 1965, after civil rights workers and advocates were beaten and, in several cases, murdered, he and a couple of other priests went to Selma. Father Glasgow invited Dan to join. In a decision that my father would regularly refer to as the biggest mistake of his life, he did not go."
Dan's interest in social justice, sparked by his father, would soon manifest in his role as one of the NFL's leading executives and thinkers, but the rule that now bears the family name was the end piece of a vast, league-wide structural effort that included too many critical agents to name, but included Mr. Tagliabue, the late Bill Nunn, Tony Dungy, Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeff Lurie, Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, the then-St. Louis Rams' Stan Kroenke, lawyers Tom Williamson, former player and longtime NFL exec John Wooten, and many others.
When the rule finally passed in 2003, Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike Brown, whom Jim describes as the last holdout and perhaps least persuadable on the initiative's merits, became the first owner to have a minority coach in the Rooney Rule era - Western Pennsylvania native Marvin Lewis.
Mr. Tomlin's emergence along the meticulously curated network of worthy candidates began long before Bill Cowher and the Steelers separated after the 2006 season.
When the job came open, the Steelers started with a list of 37 candidates they narrowed to 12 and then to four. Before Mr. Tomlin was even interviewed, the team had already adhered to the letter of the Rooney Rule by interviewing Ron Rivera, then the defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears and, since 2011, the head coach of the Carolina Panthers.
But Mr. Tomlin, according to book contributor Judy Battista, the former New York Times NFL essayist who is now with NFL.com, "blew Dan's doors off. He was the embodiment of everything Dan believed in this area. He was not a token hire, not a token interview."
Not surprisingly, some of the most emotional testimony in Jim's book comes from Mr. Tomlin, now in his 13th year in Pittsburgh, where he's never had a losing season and has been to two Super Bowls.
"I knew what my hiring meant to him," Mr. Tomlin says. "I knew what it short-term meant, long-term meant, what my hiring meant, and I didn't want to let him down. I know that he didn't view it in that way, but boy I did. It went beyond doing the job for me, and always will, because I understand it. I've always understood it and knew that how we performed was critical to the shaping of the legacy of his in some way. That legacy was so devoted. It's really always been a guiding force for me, in terms of having the desire to perform.
"I know he didn't want me to feel that way, but I felt that way nonetheless. How could you not?"

Texto completo: "Get Me Roger Stone," the 2017 Netflix documentary, was a piquant portrait of a pivotal political pal of Donald Trump. Now comes its unofficial prequel - or companion piece - called "Where's My Roy Cohn?"
Cold Warrior Roy Cohn, legendary master of the dark arts of American politics, specialized in turning empty vessels into powerful demagogues. He first came to fame in 1951 during the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg treason trial, pushing hard and successfully for their execution, for which he was beloved by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.
Soon after, Hoover recommended him to be chief counsel for Sen. Joseph McCarthy's Communist-hunting committee (1953-1954), where we see Cohn - in riveting newsreel footage - whispering questions whereby the lives of dozens of "un-American" leftists were wrecked.
On to Cohn's association with such crime figures as Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno and godfather John Gotti, Cardinal Francis Spellman, and the full range of Manhattan's celebrity and power-broker circles, consumed as he was with being part of it. Extremely smart (he graduated from Columbia Law School at 20), he learned early how to manipulate and came to see himself as a top-level political puppeteer: Nancy Reagan personally thanked him for engineering John Anderson's third-party candidacy, which assured husband Ronald's 1980 victory over Jimmy Carter.
But Cohn's greatest protégé was Donald Trump, whose father, Queens real-estate baron Fred, was bolloxed up with a major anti-black rental bias suit in 1973. Cohn got it settled without an admission of guilt and, thenceforth, became the younger Trump's own mentor, lawyer and "fixer" through the apotheosis of Trump Tower's construction in 1983.
Oft indicted (bank fraud, perjury, stock manipulations, a yacht murder), Cohn was just as oft acquitted, with brilliant use of reporters like Barbara Walters, columnists like William F. Buckley and Liz Smith. According to Roger Stone, Cohn sometimes actually dictated his quotes to them on the phone, complete with punctuation ("comma, exclamation point!") where he wanted it.
Says his cousin Gary Marcus: "Roy was a personality in disarray and anarchy, with no rules or boundaries" who enjoyed living on the edge because it was dangerous and exciting.
Director Matt Tyrnauer (previous documentaries include "Valentino: The Last Emperor" and "Studio 54") makes fine use of archival materials. But it's not necessary to inform us - more than once - that Cohn's mother Dora was ugly or that, in rejecting middle-class Jewish values and traditions, "Roy was the very definition of a self-hating Jew." This is a one-sided documentary to be sure. You won't find much of a defense for the subject.
But you also won't find much that's defensible.
Cohn's and McCarthy's main attraction was the Commie business. Their less-remembered witch hunt that harmed far more people was waged against homosexuals, resulting in the firing of scores of gay men in and out of government. Final grim irony: Cohn was diagnosed with AIDS in 1984. He tried to keep his illness secret even while receiving experimental drug treatment (courtesy of President Reagan) in NIH clinical trials of AZT. He died in 1986 at 59.
The bottom line of the McCarthy-Cohn hearings (and their lives) is that, in the corruption of truth, you could substitute The Big Lie - repeated over and over until it was believed by enough people to at least sow doubt.
Roy's Rules to live by:
1. Leave no paper trail.
2. Never admit you're wrong.
3. Always attack, change the debate.
4. The only thing is winning. If you lose, declare victory.
It's not in the film, but the title derives from the current president's rage (quoted in The New York Times Jan. 4, 2018) after learning that Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference. In a furious tirade in front of many White House officials, he said he'd expected his A.G. to protect him the way (he thought) Robert Kennedy did for his brother concluding with the plaintive, "Where's my Roy Cohn?"
It's one of two Cohn docs this year. The other, produced by HBO, is called "Bully. Coward. Victim." - the three words woven into Roy Cohn's square in the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt.

Texto completo: When I lived in New York, smells of cinnamon-tinged, buttery cake filling the air after Labor Day meant one thing: Italian prune plum season. Everyone seemed to rush to the markets to buy the blushing, tart fruit. Some might make it into jam, but most made Marian Burros' famous plum torte, which was originally published in the New York Times in 1983 and has been, more or less, every September since.
In my first autumn in Los Angeles, I wanted to relive that baking thrill but with less East Coast freneticism. Although we get Italian prune plums here at the same time as in New York, because of the breadth of wonderful produce available here all year long, the plum's appearance isn't a runway stunner, no Naomi Campbell cameo.
For my spin on Burros' classic cake, I wanted to use my favorite fruit, which has a decidedly more West Coast feel than any other: persimmons. Yes, you can get them all across the country (I grew up eating them in the South), but the sight of them signals fall in California to me more than any other, especially in late October and November when I see their dried versions, called hoshigaki, in markets.

To my delight, both varieties of persimmons -- the squat, tomato-like Fuyu and the bell-shaped Hachiya -- make a great one-for-one swap with the plums. One caveat: Although persimmons, especially the Hachiya variety, need to be water-balloon-ripe to be sweet and delicious, you want fruit that is ripe but still a little firm, like a stress ball. Otherwise, it'll dissolve in the batter and not maintain shape.
I don't mess with Burros' cake batter too much.
I take the sugar down a smidge and increase the lemon juice a tad to balance the more overtly sweet persimmons. I also add a few spices -- some turmeric and ginger -- to boost the lightly vegetal-sweet flavor of persimmons without overwhelming their delicate aroma. The turmeric adds a gorgeous golden-light color to the batter too, hinting that a little West Coast sunshine looks good on everything, even a Yankee fruit cake.

BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX
California Persimmon Torte
1 hour 10 minutes. Serves 8 to 12.
Marian Burros' plum torte is often the first recipe most bakers use, because it's easy to make, looks great and has stood the test of time. This California spin on it swaps the Italian plums for ripe, fragrant persimmons, which peak in late autumn. Because persimmons can be less acidic than plums, I lower the amount of sugar here slightly from Burros' original and add lemon juice. Ground turmeric and ginger support the flavor of persimmons and add great color without overwhelming the fruit. Avoid using persimmons that are overly ripe. They may be great for eating raw in this state, but in this recipe, they will dissolve into the batter.
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing pan
1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for pan
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2-3 ripe but firm Fuyu or Hachiya persimmons, cut into 6 to 8 wedges each
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-inch cake or springform pan with butter and dust with flour, tapping out the excess.
2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ginger, turmeric and salt. In a large bowl, combine the butter and 2/3 cup sugar and beat on medium-low speed of a mixer until smooth, about one minute. Add the eggs one at a time, beating to incorporate each fully before adding the next, then beat in the vanilla. Add the dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until the batter just comes together.
3 Spread the batter in an even layer in the prepared pan. In a medium bowl, toss the persimmon wedges with the lemon juice until completely coated. Starting from the outside, arrange the persimmon wedges skin side up in a circle at the edge of the batter then work your way toward the center (you may have one or two wedges left over). If there is any lemon juice left in the bowl, pour it over the fruit. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar evenly over the top of the batter and the fruit.
4 Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake (trying to avoid touching the fruit) comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack and let cool completely before unmolding.

Texto completo: Hank Stuever's Oct. 17 Style review, " 'Modern Love': A spreading sickness," examined harshly a new Amazon Prime series based on the New York Times column "Modern Love." Now, I haven't seen the "Modern Love" TV show, but I read the New York Times column every week. And I had my hideous personal essay published in the shorter version, "Tiny Love Stories," this year. Sweet? Maybe. Self-centered? I guess, but I wasn't writing about anyone's experience except my own. Nauseating? That seems a little churlish.
I wrote that after my husband died, I received an email two days later from a senior dating service asking if I was ready to try love again. I burst out laughing and immediately thought to share it with my husband, who would think it hilarious. Oh. I couldn't.
The 100-word limit meant I couldn't share what happened next. My late husband's health insurance company called to say it wasn't too late for a flu shot. Actually, it was. So for a time, my mantra was: too soon to date; too late for a flu shot.
Sometimes you just have to laugh. And sometimes it's fun to share that laugh.

Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren?

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
New polls offer different takes on who's leading 2020 race
Just over three months before Iowans caucus for Democratic presidential candidates, four polls out this week present a muddled picture of a primary race that is unfolding in varying, and sometimes conflicting, ways nationally and in early-voting states.
A pair of new national polls present starkly different results. A CNN survey released Wednesday had former Vice President Joe Biden with a commanding lead of 15 percentage points ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday had Warren as the front-runner, 7 points ahead of Biden.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished a strong third in both national polls, suggesting that his standing in the race has not been diminished by his heart attack earlier this month - and that he may have been buoyed by endorsements from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
Two other polls from early-voting states show a tight race in Iowa and Biden maintaining a comfortable lead in South Carolina.
Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, continued to show particular strength in Iowa, earning third place and 13% support in the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats released Monday. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who is now staking her campaign on a top-three finish there, was in a four-way tie for fifth in that poll with 3% support.
It is not clear why the CNN and Quinnipiac polls present such divergent results for Warren and Biden. But the polls, both considered to be of high quality and able to help candidates qualify for the next Democratic debate, add data points to a divide that has emerged in recent weeks: between surveys that show Biden with a commanding lead, and those that have him in a statistical dead heat with Warren.
A number of things can affect a poll's results, including the wording of a horse-race question and the order that items are asked. In CNN and Fox News polls this year, respondents have typically been asked for their opinions on each of the Democratic presidential candidates, among other questions, before being queried about their vote preference.
In Quinnipiac's polls - as well as those conducted by Monmouth University, which have also shown Warren climbing steadily - people have not typically been asked to evaluate the candidates one-by-one before giving their vote choice.
If such small differences in survey structure are indeed having an effect on results, it may reflect the fact that many respondents are not yet certain about their feelings.
The CNN poll released this week brought that point home, finding that a majority of Democratic voters who favored one candidate - 53% - said they could still change their mind about whom to support for the nomination.
"It makes me think that voters are not settled, that they're still shopping for a candidate - that's why you're seeing some movement between polls," Doug Schwartz, Quinnipiac's polling director, said Thursday.
The Quinnipiac poll also qualified Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota for the debate next month in Georgia, making her the ninth candidate to do so. Candidates must meet a donor requirement set by the Democratic National Committee as well as a polling requirement; Klobuchar, who is getting a second look after a strong performance in the October debate, received 3% support in the Quinnipiac survey and two others this week, giving her a total of four qualifying polls and securing her spot in the debate next month.
National polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate's mood, and the extent to which a candidate's debate performance has helped or hurt a campaign. The Quinnipiac poll, which had a margin of error of 5 percentage points, said Warren had registered 28% support compared with 21% for Biden.
Biden's support in the survey was down 6 points from a similar national poll that Quinnipiac released 10 days earlier and was conducted before the October debate; Warren's support was around the same in that poll. Support for Sanders rose slightly in the post-debate poll, to 15%, while Buttigieg remained in fourth place with 10%.
The CNN poll, which had a margin of error of 4 percentage points, put Biden's support at 34% and Warren's at 19%. It seemed to add credibility to the results coming out of Fox News and other polling operations, which have consistently shown Biden alone at the front of the Democratic pack.
Members of CNN's polling team declined to comment about the results of their latest survey.
At the state level, the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats showed Biden in the lead with 18% support, Warren just behind him with 17%, Buttigieg next with 13% and Sanders finishing fourth with just 9% support.
The outcome of Iowa voters' caucus in February could influence South Carolina voters, who go to the polls about four weeks later. Throughout the primary, Biden has held on to a steady and sizable lead in the polls there. The Monmouth University poll out of South Carolina this week showed his support there dipping to 33% this month from 39% in July, but Warren still finished a distant second with 16% support.
Mark Blumenthal, an independent pollster who has advised Democratic candidates, pointed out that turnout in presidential primaries and caucuses is generally quite low - sometimes under 1% in some state contests. For this reason, the results of any survey that polls all registered Democratic voters nationwide is bound to capture many people who will not in fact participate.
"The big challenge of polling in any election is measuring a population that doesn't yet exist," he said. That is true of "presidential primaries in particular - because they're a small fraction of the larger population and because they're these very high-profile events where the composition can change dramatically from election to election."
"Odds are good," Blumenthal added, "these results will converge as we get closer to voting."

'Watershed' On the cusp of electricity arriving in a small rural town in west Tennessee, Nathan, a young engineer takes a room in a boarding house in 1937. He is part of a team working on a federal dam project that looms over the town. Nathan just needs to hold this job through to the end, build his resume, and get references for the next big job. But he is also running from his past. While staying there he meets Claire, a local woman recovering from a wicked illness courtesy of her unfaithful husband. Claire finds new freedom and a desire for new experiences when she leaves her husband because of his cheating ways.
This is the setting for Mark Barr's debut novel, "Watershed." In it Barr depicts a community on the verge of inevitable change where traditional ways come face to face with the accelerating modern world of the 1930s. The story exists within that moment just before the lights flicker on and expose all the dirt that was until then hidden in the dark. And once that light truly shines, Nathan and Claire must face the past and move toward a future, consequences and all.
Published by Hub City Press in Spartanburg, South Carolina, "Watershed" is a part of The Cold Mountain Fund Book Series, supported by author Charles Frazier. The fund seeks to spotlight works of fiction by new writers from the American South. Join us at 6 p.m. Oct. 28 at Malaprop's as Barr is joined by Frazier for a discussion of "Watershed."

Tulsi Gabbard not seeking reelection to Congress

Texto completo: After serving nearly seven years in office, Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday on her presidential campaign website that she will not seek reelection to Congress in 2020.
“Mahalo, Hawaii,” the message says on the Tulsi Gabbard for President website.
She also asks the people of Hawaii for their support for her candidacy for president of the United States.
She said the country is so divided, and “closer to being sucked into another even more disastrous war in the Middle East.” Tensions are mounting in nuclear-armed countries like Russia and China, “leading us to a new Cold War and nuclear arms race,” she adds.
“In light of these challenges, I believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander- in-Chief,” she writes on the website.
Gabbard represents Hawaii’s 2nd Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, and has served on the Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees.
She grabbed national headlines after Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 and former secretary of state, alluded to Gabbard, though not by name, being a Russian asset.
President Donald Trump weighed in Monday, saying of Gabbard, “She’s not a Russian agent.”
Clinton appeared to call her “the favorite of the Russians” in a recent interview, saying she believes the Russians have “got their eye on somebody who’s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” The Associated Press reported.
Trump said he thinks Clinton’s attack boosts Gabbard and his own political chances, claiming it shows concerns about Russian interference are just a “sham,” the AP said.
Gabbard responded to Clinton in a tweet saying: “You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.
“From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,” she continued. “We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.
“It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me,” she tweeted. “Don’t cowardly hide between your proxies. Join the race directly.”
In response, someone retweeted Gabbard’s apparent support for Russian President Vladimir Putin when Gabbard tweeted, “Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and must be defeated. Obama won’t bomb them in Syria. Putin did.”
Gabbard was polling at 2%, managing to qualify for the October televised debate of 12 Democratic presidential candidates. She had threatened to boycott it to protest a “rigging” of the election by the Democratic National Convention and corporate news media but participated anyway.
During the debate she repeated her goal of ending “regime change wars.”
She said, “Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria,” criticizing The New York Times and CNN with smearing her and other veterans for calling an end to such wars.
She said the Times put out an article saying she was “a Russian asset and an Assad apologist.”
But the Times said the article she refers to says the congresswoman is a frequent topic of Russian state news media, but did not imply she is a Russian asset.
She also paid a visit to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in January 2017 in his country.
The Times reported that she has said Assad is not the enemy of the United States, but in August called him a brutal dictator.
In a Wednesday Newsweek opinion piece, the author of “How to Catch a Russian Spy,” Naveed Jamali, wrote that the Times on Tuesday changed its reporting that Clinton never suggested Gabbard is being groomed to be a Russian agent, but rather Clinton said she is being groomed by Republicans as a third-party candidate and is used by the Russians as an asset.
“Agents are groomed and directed, while assets are used — often unwittingly,” he wrote.
Gabbard met with Trump after he was elected in 2016, and news reports said she had been considered for jobs in his Cabinet.
She resigned in 2016 as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee when she endorsed Bernie Sanders for president instead of Clinton in the primaries.
Politico reported that was when the blowback against her came and a Clinton Foundation director wrote to her saying he and a friend would no longer help her campaign raise money.
The 38-year-old is an Army National Guard major and has served for 16 years and deployed twice to the Middle East.
Gabbard says her campaign is powered completely by people and does not accept contributions from corporations, lobbyists or political action committees.

Texto completo: The committee said it was investigating allegations that Michael F. Q. San Nicolas, a Democrat, had a sexual relationship with a congressional staff member and broke campaign finance laws.
WASHINGTON -- The House Ethics Committee said on Thursday that it was investigating allegations that a Democratic freshman, Delegate Michael F. Q. San Nicolas of Guam, had a sexual relationship with a congressional staff member, a violation of House rules, and broke campaign finance laws.
A former chief of staff and campaign official for the delegate accused Mr. San Nicolas in September of having an affair with a woman he then hired onto his congressional staff. The former staff member, John Paul Manuel, also alleged that Mr. San Nicolas used campaign funds to pay for a trip he took with the woman, according to The Guam Daily Post. Mr. Manuel also accused Mr. San Nicolas of accepting more than the $ 2,700 limit in campaign contributions from a single donor as a candidate.
"The congressman welcomes the opportunity for due process," the delegate's office said in a brief statement.
When Mr. Manuel filed a formal complaint with the Guam Election Commission in September, Mr. San Nicolas told The Pacific Daily News that the allegations were "baseless" and the timing of that filing was intended "to cause maximum political damage."
Mr. San Nicolas, a freshman and the sole nonvoting delegate representing the United States territory, serves as vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
It was the second time in two days that the Ethics Committee had announced an investigation into allegations that a House lawmaker had a sexual relationship with a congressional staff member. The investigations are the first public ones opened by the committee since the House codified language this year barring lawmakers from having relationships with staff members.
On Wednesday, the committee announced that it was looking into allegations that Representative Katie Hill of California, another Democratic freshman, had a sexual relationship with a member of her congressional staff.
In both instances, the committee noted that "the mere fact that it is investigating these allegations, and publicly disclosing its review, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the committee."
Ms. Hill has acknowledged a separate relationship with a member of her campaign team, but denied the allegation the committee. is investigating The rules do not cover campaign staff members.
Lawyers for Ms. Hill sent a cease-and-desist letter on Thursday to The Daily Mail, after the website published nude photos said to be of Ms. Hill.
"By spreading these purported claims, and dehumanizing and shaming images across the globe, you have perpetuated the cycle of abuse Representative Hill has endured," the two lawyers, Marc E. Elias and Rachel L. Jacobs, from Perkins Coie, wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times and first reported by HuffPost.
The two lawyers also said another claim by The Daily Mail that Ms. Hill "has Nazi imagery on her body in the form of a tattoo is false and defamatory."

As C.E.O.s Fret, Stock Buybacks Slow

Texto completo: Companies have binged on share buybacks in recent years, pumping up prices, but their appetite could wane as economic uncertainty rises.
American companies spent more than $ 800 billion on their own shares last year, taking a windfall from deep corporate tax cuts to try to bolster their share prices and improve the look of their quarterly earnings reports.
This year, as the economy's worsening prospects rattle executives, those buybacks are slowing down. The mood among corporate bosses is likely to stay subdued in the face of the trade war, the broadening impeachment inquiry of President Trump and the 2020 presidential election.
"If you're at a point where trade and politics are stymieing the ability to plan for the future, I think that that's another huge factor in terms of how companies are going to spend cash or if they will spend as much cash as they have been," said Savita Subramanian, head of United States equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Confidence among chief executives fell to its lowest level in a decade in the third quarter, according to survey data collected by the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group. The last time the survey came close to showing these levels of gloom, businesses were still shedding about 800,000 jobs a month because of the recession.
Things are nowhere near as bad as they were in 2009. Unemployment is lower than it has been in about 50 years. But the economy's growth has slowed from a 2.9 percent pace in 2018. The economy is expected to grow 2.3 percent this year and could slow to 1.7 percent next year, which would be the slowest rate since 2016, a period that many now view as something of a mini-recession.
In addition, the chief financial officers who control a company's spending are also far less optimistic than they were two years ago, according to a quarterly survey by Duke University.
If companies hold back spending, including stepping in to buy up stocks when the market swoons, stock trading could be bumpier.
In the normal course of business, companies use their cash to build a new plant, raise wages or acquire a competitor. When they feel they have more cash than they need, they often hand it back to shareholders.
One way to do that is by paying a dividend. The other is to repurchase shares in the stock market, adding to demand and lifting their price. Either move at best serves only to reward shareholders, rather than bolstering the fundamentals of a business.
Buybacks can also make a company's results look better, even if the fundamentals have not changed. And they have their critics, who say that buybacks are not a productive use of cash, that they put a priority on shareholders over other stakeholders like employees and customers, and that they amount to financial engineering aimed at making things look better than they are.
And a company's willingness to spend money on this kind of reward tends to move in step with executive confidence. If executives are worried about the future, they might hang on to cash in case of a rainy day.
When corporate leaders were more bullish about the economy, and had more cash to throw around, they snapped up shares. Last year, 30 percent of the cash spent by S&P 500 companies was used to repurchase stock, outpacing even the amount they put into long-term capital expenditures, such as investments in plants, equipment and buildings, according to Goldman Sachs.
The pace of buybacks this year has declined from last year's record of more than $ 800 billion. That's partly because the surge was fueled by the large tax cut, which left companies with high levels of cash.
But waning confidence could mean the drop continues into next year. Goldman Sachs analysts expect buybacks will fall 15 percent in 2019, to a bit more than $ 700 billion, and then 5 percent in 2020 to $ 675 billion.
That could have repercussions for the stock market.
Over the last few years, companies have often stepped in to buy stock when the market was tumbling. For instance, trading data from Goldman Sachs shows that when stocks suffered a 10 percent drop that began in January 2018, they bottomed out after a burst of corporate buying. A sharp tumble in stocks last fall was also blunted by the surge in buybacks, which stabilized the market temporarily.
"The corporate buyer has been willing to step in, and I think that's definitely supported share prices in a significant way," said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
So back to what this all means to stock prices. A drop in share buybacks has important implications for one of the key metrics on which stocks are judged: earnings per share.
Share repurchases improve this gauge of profitability because when a company buys back shares, it shrinks the number of shares outstanding. In other words, a company's profit is spread over the smaller number of shares. That can bolster a company's earnings-per-share number even if a company's profit stays the same, or even falls.
This is where the financial engineering claims come up. Analysts say this technical effect of share buybacks has been a top reason that earnings-per-share growth has kept climbing even when profits have dropped.
That was the case in 2016, when earnings per share rose 1.3 percent even as net income, or profit, at S&P 500 companies fell 1.8 percent.
Profit expectations this year are similarly modest, with Wall Street analysts expecting S&P 500 companies to see their earnings per share grow 1.4 percent.
"If you didn't have buybacks coming in and supporting the earnings-per-share growth, you'd probably be looking at some slight declines," Ms. Calvasina said. "It's sort of kept you in slightly positive territory on earnings growth, and it's also just supported share prices when they've been willing to step in and buy."

Texto completo: THE Toledo Lucas County Main Library's Gala Event of the Year, presented by ProMedica and hosted by the Library Legacy Foundation featuring No. 1 New York Times best selling author James Patterson was in celebration of the multi-million dollar transformation of the new Main Library.

It was the highest priced fund-raiser of the year in Toledo, with tickets ranging from $400 to $2,500, raising an estimated $40,000.

The 150 formally clad guests who had received library card style invitations, arrived to valet parking and strolled the red carpet into the newly renovated library. A dedication of the Historic Court to the late library director, Clyde Scoles, included a champagne toast by library director Jason Kucsma : "For his passion and vision and kindness and humor - to Clyde!" as Clyde's wife, Diane Scoles , tearfully smiled.

Cocktails and passed canapes followed in the Saloff Family Children's Library. VIPs - who paid at least $500 - had a photo with Mr. Patterson and received a copy of his 19th Christmas co-written with Maxine Paetro .

Meanwhile, guests perused the art from the late Posy Huebner Collection, and the Nancy Drew room with the late Millie Benson, former writer for The Blade, and more.

Patterson, in the McMaster Center with moderator Dawn Buskey of ProMedica, said he couldn't get to a Mud Hens game but was at Tony Packos where he signed a hot dog bun. He writes everyday out of love, saying, "I don't work for a living, I play for a living."

He has written mystery, true crime, non fiction, tragedies, combat stories, romance, and more, and has met all kinds of people as a result, but his current passion is children's books to encourage reading across the country to help children go out into the world equipped for success.

His said his key to success, which can apply to any field, is listening.

During the Q&A, the audience learned that a lot of changes happen when books are made into movies. If Patterson were a character in the Downton Abbey series, "I would be the novelist who came in to raise hell."

Patterson, who loves to golf, is not political, but he has worked with Bill Clinton and others, and "by far, Trump is the best golfer!"

A Vanderbilt graduate degree alum, he mentioned he may team up with Dolly Parton for a book. Kurt Franck, president and executive editor of The Blade, asked about author Michael Connelly , who Patterson and Franck knew while living in Florida.

Dinner in the atrium was by Erika Rapp of Registry Bistro.

Frank Jacobs , Library Legacy Foundation board president, said, "It's important for children to learn to read early! Patterson has funded millions of dollars for school libraries," which drew an applause of gratitude.

In the atrium, dinner was served at tables centered with colorful flowers: cold poached lobster and beef short rib or a vegetarian option all finished with a decadent dark chocolate bombe dessert. Ned Hein , there with Louise Jackson , was delighted to sit facing the painting donated by his family.

Also seen were Sue and Bob Savage, Pat Appold, Joe and Judith Conda, Susan Conda, Yolanda and John Szuch, Bill and Paula Fall, Brenda Geiger, Jesus Salas, Tony and Mary Clark, Dick and Shelley Walinski, Sheila Odesky, Rodney and Sheila Easen, Karen Fraker, Bob and Kathie Maxwell, Karen Merrels, Bill and Pam Davis, Rick and Mary Sabin, Bill and Cathy Carroll, Dan and Elaine Johnson, Stu and Denise Cubbon, MaryLouise and Pat Bowe , and Rodney Rogers and wife Sandra Earle .

Texto completo: Republicans are resorting to Occupy Wall Street tactics.
GOP lawmakers seeing red over the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry stormed into a secure hearing room on Capitol Hill Wednesday and staged an hours-long sit-in, delaying a Pentagon official's planned deposition in the probe and likely violating security protocols.
Led by right-wing Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, roughly two dozen Republicans barged into a House Intelligence Committee room where Laura Cooper, a senior Defense Department official, was supposed to share her information on President Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and other Democrats before the 2020 election.
"We're going to try to go in there and we're going to try to figure out what's going on on behalf of the millions of Americans that we represent," Gaetz said during a press conference outside the room before rallying the troops and heading in.
The stunt derailed Cooper's testimony and jeopardized national security, according to Democrats, as many of the Republicans who forced their way into the room refused to give up their cell phones.
"These bogans infiltrated a classified, secure room with commercial cell phones, which is strictly prohibited for security reasons," a senior Democratic aide told the Daily News.
Nonetheless, some Republicans, including North Carolina Rep. Mark Walker, even tweeted from inside the room, which is especially forbidden.
"UPDATE: We are in the SCIF and every GOP member is quietly listening," Walker posted midway through the storming, using an acronym for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.
Democrats alerted the House sergeant-at-arms and urged the security office to take action against the Republicans.
But Republicans dug in their heels and refused to leave. Eventually, pies of pizza were seen being delivered for the stubborn Republicans holding court in the secure room.
After delaying Cooper's deposition for roughly five hours, the Republican renegades finally gave up and left, and testimony was underway late Wednesday afternoon.
A congressional source familiar with the matter told The News that President Trump was informed of the Republican revolt beforehand. Bloomberg News reported the president even gave his blessing to the effort during a meeting with GOP lawmakers at the White House on Tuesday.
But Gaetz took sole responsibility for the stunt and claimed Trump had no advanced knowledge of it.
"This is blatantly false," Gaetz said in a statement. "I organized and led the press conference, including entering the committee room. I wasn't at the White House meeting yesterday and hadn't discussed my plans with any White House official - including the president."
Despite complaints from Gaetz and other Republicans, GOP lawmakers are allowed to participate in all closed-door depositions taken in the impeachment inquiry - they just have to sit on one of the three committees in charge of the probe.
Gaetz sits on the House Judiciary Committee. The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees are leading the impeachment proceedings.
Democrats say the hearings are being held behind closed doors because they are still investigating Trump's actions and don't want witnesses to tailor their testimony based on what previous witnesses have said.
Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) blasted the GOP protest as dangerous "theatrics."
"We see this as an effort not only to intimidate this witness, but to intimidate future witnesses," Swalwell said.
It wasn't immediately clear what light Cooper shed on Trump's Ukraine scandal.
As with many other administration officials who have been interviewed in the inquiry, Cooper was ordered by her department to blow off the hearing, an aide working on the probe said. She was subsequently served with a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee and appeared for questioning as planned, the aide said.
Cooper is the Defense Department's top official in charge of Ukraine policy and may have knowledge of Trump's decision to put a freeze on more than $391 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine while putting pressure on the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to launch investigations that could benefit him politically.
Cooper's testimony came one day after Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told impeachment investigators that Trump explicitly held up the security aid to strong-arm Zelensky into publicly committing to investigating baseless corruption allegations about Biden's son, Hunter, and debunked claims that anti-Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 election to help Hillary Clinton.
Taylor said Trump similarly threatened to not invite Zelensky to the White House if he didn't announce Biden and 2016 investigations.
After bipartisan outrage at home, Trump eventually released the U.S. aid to Ukraine on Sept. 11, ostensibly without Zelensky launching investigations. Ukraine relies on the aid to counter Russian aggression.
Taylor's bombshell testimony prompted even some powerful Republicans to flinch.
"The picture coming out of it based on the reporting that we've seen is, yeah, I would say not a good one," South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the upper chamber, told reporters Wednesday.
But Trump suggested on Twitter that, even if he held up military aid for political purposes, it couldn't amount to quid pro quo since the Ukrainians weren't aware of his having put the brakes on the crucial U.S. assistance.
"You can't have a quid pro quo with no quo," Trump posted.
As if on cue, The New York Times reported within hours of Trump's tweet that Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials found about the aid suspension in early August, about a month before Trump released it.
The Times report, which cites records and interviews with unnamed officials, says Ukraine found out the holdup was not a bureaucratic glitch, adding weight to the Trump pressure campaign to launch probes into his political opponents.
Another report on Wednesday said that Zelensky was aware of Trump's hope for investigations as early as May, shortly after he took office, and months earlier that was known.
The Associated Press said Zelensky held a May 7 meeting with advisers at which he brought up Rudy Giuliani's push for dirt on Joe Biden and a probe into the 2016 election.
Massachusetts Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, said Trump has opened himself up to impeachment even if the quid pro quo element can't be substantiated.
"I think it was here ... I think that will be proven," Lynch said of quid pro quo. "However, merely soliciting a foreign government to do a political hit job on your political opponent in a U.S. election is a violation of the law."

Behind Iran's game of disinformation

Texto completo: In recent years, social media has frequently announced the removal of hundreds of fake accounts, groups, and pages originating in Iran for engaging in “coordinated manipulation.” These actions, taken by Facebook and Twitter, have been followed on at least one occasion by a sharp reaction from Iran’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Javad Zarif.
It is highly amusing that Zarif complained that the suspended accounts belonged to real Iranian users — as if he were in touch with hundreds of disgruntled locals who had been banished from Twitter. And it is doubly amusing, given the fact that all social networks are blocked in Iran by government authorities.
Take this, along with a close reading of Iran-related stories in the English-language media, as a sign that the regime is heavily engaged in psychological warfare through the spread of disinformation — at times aided by Western journalists and even the U.S. government.
Mohammad Javad Zarif, the architect of the Iranian regime’s disinformation campaign, started his diplomatic career in 1982 as an adviser at the Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York. He became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in August 2013.
One month after becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zarif began his disinformation campaign in a Twitter exchange with Christine Pelosi who is Nancy Pelosi’s daughter, and a member of Democratic National Committee, which he claimed, “Iran never denied Holocaust.” Of course, this is not true: the Holocaust has been repeatedly denied by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the main decision-maker on Iran’s foreign policy. Thus, through a Twitter exchange with a DNC political strategist, Zarif’s disinformation campaign had commenced.
Zarif effectively based Iran’s disinformation campaign on the old KGB playbook, particularly in terms of its strategies with Western Media. He focused on those who shape public opinion, such as journalists, artists, publishers, academics and businessmen, and in this he was aided by his decades of living in the U.S.
The Iran nuclear deal was Zarif’s biggest project yet, and the U.S. government actually helped him in the effort. As David Samuels explained in an article in the New York Times Magazine, the Obama administration tried to mislead the public and media by claiming that “a ‘moderate’ faction inside the Iranian regime beat ‘hard-liners’ in an election and then began to pursue a policy of ‘openness’, which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its illicit nuclear-weapons program.”
Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Adviser for President Obama, was the conductor of this orchestra. “We created an echo chamber,” he told the New York Times Magazine. “They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.” He added. NIAC is one of the organizations that helped arrange the Iran deal. Trita Parsi, the one-time president of NIAC and one of its founders, met with the Obama administration 33 times from 2013 to 2016, according to White House visitor logs. Patrick Disney, who worked as policy director at NIAC, later became a member of the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the same year the Obama administration started secret negotiations with the Iranian regime.
Last November, Reuters reported that “more than 70 websites which look like media outlets...are actually a channel for Iranian propaganda and fake news.” Reuters correspondent Jack Stubbs put it thus: “Often people ask if the influence operations actually have any real-world impact. And in the case of the Iranian campaign, we can say yes it has.”
The disinformation campaign continues, and it seems the Trump Administration has taken it seriously. Trump has banned Iranians from traveling to the U.S. by issuing an executive order, all while a significant number of families of high ranking Iranian officials are living in the states. The U.S. government has imposed heavy sanctions on Iran, stating that its goal is not to harm the people but to change the regime’s behavior.
Recently, there have been some demonstrations and strikes in Iran. The U.S. State Department denies that this is part of a regime change project on its part, or an attempt to bring the Iranian regime back to the negotiating table. But some of these actions, like the travel ban and sanctions, have already fed the Iranian regime's disinformation campaign.
The presence of senior U.S. government officials on Twitter is perhaps partly an attempt to respond to this campaign. The State Department has a Twitter account in Persian, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appears to be Trump's point man for Iranian affairs, tweets and hashtags about Iran even in Persian.
“Shame on #FakeNewsweek for helping @JZarif spread lies," he tweeted at one point. "The truth is: the U.S. does not, and never did, sanction food and medicine. They are exempt from sanctions, as are financial transactions related to humanitarian needs,” Pompeo tweeted.
The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Zarif, calling him a "propaganda minister" rather than a diplomat. Mike Pompeo also called him Khamenei’s "chief apologist." Subsequently, during Zarif’s stay in New York to attend the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, the U.S. imposed tight travel restrictions on him.
The Iranian regime's desire to deal with a Democratic administration in the White House has been proclaimed frequently, and Iranian interference in U.S. elections is evident. On Oct. 4, Microsoft reported that it has found evidence that hackers linked to the Iranian government targeted accounts associated with a U.S. presidential campaign, in addition to journalists and U.S. government officials.
But the Islamic regime’s disinformation campaign will not be limited to this. The regime will continue its ideological subversion campaign because this regime doesn't believe in the western concept of national sovereignty, and its survival depends on the spread of its ideology.

Bret Stephens: Will the Democrats become born again neo-cons?

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria has drawn widespread scorn from Republicans and Democrats alike, and with good reason: The U.S. has betrayed an ally and ceded influence to a gallery of rogues — Bashar Assad, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Vladimir Putin and Qasem Soleimani, to name a few — in exchange for a hollow talking point about ending endless wars.
But give Trump this: He’s turning a remarkable number of foreign policy liberals and progressives into born-again neoconservatives.
That’s a thought worth pondering as the president pursues a foreign policy that, had it been undertaken by a Democratic administration, would likely have been met with considerable approval on the left. After all, getting America out of fill-in-the-blank — Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Iraq, Afghanistan — has for decades been the go-to slogan of progressives.
Why, now, should our retreat from Syria be any different?
If the argument is that the Kurds stood by us, depended on us, and helped us to wage a difficult war, well, so did many others, such as the Montagnards in Vietnam. If the argument is that our retreat from Syria creates the conditions for a humanitarian disaster, one must ask: Where was that humanitarian concern when much of the left was agitating for immediate U.S. withdrawal from Iraq as terrorist and sectarian violence exploded in 2005 and 2006? If the argument is that we are sending a fatal signal of fecklessness to friend and foe alike, why were so many liberals prepared to give Barack Obama a pass when the Assad regime violated his chemical red line in 2013?
And if the argument is that we are vacating territories in which terrorists are sure to flourish, why are major Democratic presidential candidates uniformly in favor of withdrawing from Afghanistan, to the guaranteed benefit of the Taliban and their inseparable allies in global jihad?
The real difference is that the current exercise in retreat is being orchestrated by Trump. True, one can quarrel with the speed and manner of the withdrawal, along with the president’s bizarre, inane, and self-aggrandizing defense of the deed. One can also argue that our presence in Syria, unlike our involvements elsewhere, yielded high geopolitical returns at relatively low cost.
Yet the U.S. suffered just 14 fatalities in Afghanistan last year while preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country. Maybe the Democratic contenders will change their minds on that score once they notice that Trump is on their side.
And not just on Afghanistan. Trump’s embrace of policies once more popular on the left than the right seems to have had an extraordinarily clarifying effect regarding the consequences of those policies.
On Russia, Obama attempted a famous “reset” in 2009 to much liberal fanfare, despite the fact that Putin had invaded Georgia just the year before. Trump’s abortive reset with the Kremlin (however suspect its motives) seems to have awakened former reset fans to the belated understanding that the Russians are not our friends.
On North Korea, many liberals loudly assailed Trump for his “fire and fury” rhetoric about Kim Jong Un. Now they mock him, correctly, for his naïveté about the North’s malign intentions.
On Ukraine, the Obama administration’s refusal to supply the country with anti-tank missiles when it was being dismembered by Russia met with consternation from the likes of John McCain, but less-than-vociferous opposition by Democrats. Now the supply of those same weapons has become a vital “insurance policy” against the prospect of renewed Russian aggression.
On economics, the Democratic Party was moving sharply away from its previous embrace of free trade, with both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton opposing the Obama administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in 2016. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the partnership as one of his first acts of office, and now free trade is back in vogue.
On America’s global role, Obama was lauded by Democrats for pursuing geopolitical “retrenchment” for the sake of “nation-building at home.” Trump has made the identical false promise in the name of “America First.” Only now it’s being condemned as a derogation of America’s global responsibilities.
All of this raises the possibility — faintly — that while Trump steers the American right toward a foreign policy of retreat, appeasement, and non-intervention, liberals might rediscover their Trumanesque faith in the necessity of Pax Americana. The world quickly becomes unsafe in the absence of U.S. power and will. Ceding ground to dictators is destined to work about as well today as it did when it was last tried in the 1930s.
I won’t get my hopes up yet. Trump’s foreign policy ought to be a lesson to all Americans about what a post-American world would look like. So far, the result seems mostly to be a George Costanza exercise in doing the opposite.

Texto completo: La Casa Blanca está instando a las agencias federales a cancelar sus suscripciones a los diarios The New York Times y el Washington Post .
La secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Stephanie Grisham, dijo este jueves en un comunicado que “no renovar las suscripciones de todas las agencias federales supondrá un importante ahorro para los contribuyentes “. “Cientos de miles de dólares”, asegura la presidencia que las instituciones nacionales dejarían de gastar.
The Wall Street Journal fue el primero en dar a conocer las intenciones de la presidencia, pero previamente el presidente Donald Trump había señalado que la Casa Blanca debería “acabar” con las suscripciones que tenga a ambos diarios . Tump ha criticado ampliamente a ambas publicaciones desde que fue candidato a las elecciones 2016.
“The New York Times, que es un falso periódico, ni quiera lo queremos en la Casa Blanca nunca más. Probablemente vayamos a prescindir de él y de The Washington Post“, dijo Trump en Fox News la tarde del lunes. “Echas un vistazo a The New York Times y […] al tipo de reportajes que hacen… Y todo resulta ser incorrecto “, añadió el presidente.
A pesar que Grisham aseguró que la supresión de estas suscripciones significarían un ahorro de “cientos de miles de dólares”, no está claro cuantas agencias federales están suscritas al Times y el Post y, por tanto, tampoco el dinero que el gobierno gasta en los diarios.

With intolerance posing as righteousness at Harvard, where's George Orwell when you need him?

Texto completo: I don't know what they're teaching at Harvard, but whatever it is, they need more Orwell.
George Orwell couldn't have dreamed up a more absurd situation than students at one of the world's most prestigious universities opposing campus journalists seeking comment from a government agency.
Borrowing a page from Orwell's anti-authoritarian fable “Animal Farm," in which innocuous barnyard animals turn into sneering, vindictive fascists drunk on power and self-importance, a group of students took it upon themselves to instruct reporters at the student newspaper, The Crimson, how to do journalism.
In short, the students at Act on a Dream, an immigrant advocacy group, told The Crimson to abandon a basic journalistic tenet or be branded fascist collaborators.
Worse, they created an online petition, encouraging others to embrace the idea of silencing anyone who disagrees with them.
“We are extremely disappointed in the cultural insensitivity displayed by The Crimson's policy to reach out to ICE," the petition reads. “In this political climate, a request for comment is virtually the same as tipping them off."
Really?
The petition, which has more than 600 signatures and was endorsed by 13 student organizations, including Harvard College Democrats and Harvard College Democrats for Warren, demands that The Crimson apologize and change its ways. Crimson editors stood their ground, and good for them.
The kerfuffle started when Crimson reporters covered a campus protest where demonstrators called for the abolition of ICE because of its treatment of immigrants.
After the protest, The Crimson called ICE for comment. ICE didn't respond.
But Act on a Dream accused the newspaper of being in bed with ICE because it — gulp — asked for comment.
I've never shied from criticizing ICE, especially when instead of going after criminals it picks on decent, tax-paying immigrants who take care of their families and keep their noses clean. But it's a bit extreme to abolish an established agency before trying to reform it, and, like the archaic, chaotic immigration system that ICE enforces, there has been no serious attempt at reform.
Like some in Congress, Act on a Dream wants to destroy ICE. Good luck to them. It's a free country.
But when they engage in “you're either with us or you're the enemy" thinking to determine what they consider good journalism, they're in league with that nutty guy in the White House they all hate.
Orwell took a bullet fighting against fascists in Spain. He was a courageous critic of right-wing authoritarianism. But he cast an equally cold eye on intolerance from the left.
“So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don't even know that fire is hot," he wrote in 1941. He had little time for what he dismissed as “the shallow self-righteousness of the left-wing intelligentsia."
After Orwell wrote “Animal Farm," government censors warned him not to publish the book because it was clearly aimed at the Soviets, an indispensable ally in the fight against the Nazis. Censorship was rife. Four publishers rejected the manuscript.
In a proposed preface, called “The Freedom of the Press," Orwell ruefully noted that during the war against fascism it was verboten to criticize Soviet totalitarianism.
“Hardly anyone will print an attack on Stalin," he wrote, “but it is quite safe to attack Churchill."
Act on a Dream does some admirable advocacy, but in attacking The Crimson and trying to get others to boycott it, the group employs an anti-democratic tactic favored by despots around the world.
Looking at the bios on Act on a Dream's website, its members seem like great kids — accomplished, well-intentioned, and wanting to change the world for the better. Good for them.
I asked Act on a Dream for comment but didn't hear back.
One last observation from Orwell: “If you encourage totalitarian methods, the time may come when they will be used against you instead of for you."

Texto completo: Re “Terranea Resort, in Rancho Palos Verdes, introduces new panic buttons in lead up to ballot measure” (Oct. 24):
I’m glad to see that Terranea Resort President Terri Haack has provided panic buttons to the hardworking housekeeping workers at Terranea.
The resort also claims they pay their workers at least $15 an hour. If this is true, why not codify these policies so that workers will be guaranteed this protection against sexual assault and a base pay of $15, no matter who the management is? Measure B would do just that.
Terranea has spent an alarming amount of money and energy trying to defeat this measure that they claim to already live up to. This is money that would be better spent implementing these commonsense protections and paying their workers fairly.
Terranea has been promoting their Saints and Sinners Halloween Party. In my opinion, the saints are the hotel workers who work long hours cleaning up after and waiting on hotel guests and making Terranea the place visitors love so much and are willing to pay top dollar for. The sinners? That’s for you to decide.
Ultimately, Measure B’s fate will be decided by residents of Rancho Palos Verdes. If I lived there, I would vote yes.

We’ve seen this before
The year is 1971. Bumbling burglars break into the Democratic campaign office to get dirt on behalf of a Republican president. The cast: Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Charles Colson, John Dean, Archibald Cox, a whistleblower, and the Washington Post. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
Fast forward to 2019. Bumbling Republican president shakes down the president of Ukraine to get dirt on Democrat opponent.
The cast: Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Stephen Miller, Mike Pompeo, William Barr, Robert Mueller, a whistleblower and The New York Times. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
We’ve seen this movie before. The latest news is just a preview of a sequel. In the previous movie, many of the characters ended up in prison or ignominy. So should many characters in this sequel. Exception, impeach and convict Trump.

What's next in the impeachment inquiry?

Texto completo: The House impeachment inquiry is accelerating. What's next? Here's what to look for:
More closed-door testimony A number of closed-door depositions were originally slated for this week before the House committees conducting an impeachment inquiry. But some were postponed so Congress can observe the passing of the late US Representative Elijah Cummings, who died last week. It also appeared two Trump administration officials were refusing to show up.
That left only two. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, set off a firestorm when he testified Tuesday that the freezing of military aid to Ukraine was directly linked to President Trump's demand that Ukraine carry out investigations for Trump's political benefit. Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense, was expected to testify Wednesday, though there were efforts by Republicans to disrupt her testimony.
Public testimony Closed-door depositions are expected to continue for a week or two and then be followed by public hearings. “A week or two of depositions, and then hearings," Representative Jackie Speier of California, a member of the House Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees, two of the three committees leading the investigation, told Bloomberg News on Wednesday. (House Foreign Affairs is the third committee investigating.)
Another Democrat on the oversight panel, Lacy Clay of Missouri, agreed with Speier. He noted that some witnesses who've already been interviewed may also need to be called back.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has said in the past that following the initial investigation stage, he plans to call some of the witnesses back for public hearings.
He has also said he plans to release transcripts of the depositions “subject to any necessary redactions for classified or sensitive information."
Drafting of articles of impeachment If the House impeachment investigation determines that impeachment is warranted, it is expected to draw up articles of impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee has historically assumed this task.
The question of what might be included in the articles against the scandal-plagued president has been sparking debate among Democrats.
They're mulling whether to keep a narrow focus on an alleged “abuse of power" in the Ukraine scandal, as well as obstruction or contempt of Congress, or widen it to other alleged violations, NBC News reports.
The Atlantic reports that other candidates for impeachment articles include potential emoluments violations by Trump and the 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice noted in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Trump-Russia investigations.
House vote The impeachment articles would then go to the House floor for a vote. But that won't be any time soon.
The New York Times reported Monday that House Democrats thought the impeachment proceedings would extend into the Christmas season because the Democrats need to wage full-scale public hearings to make a convincing and devastating case.
A majority vote in the House on any article would impeach the president — and then it's on to a trial on any article in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote would be needed to convict and remove the president. While public opinion has been moving in favor of impeachment, there's no real sign yet that the Republican-dominated Senate would vote to remove the GOP president.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has told Republican senators to be ready for an impeachment trial as soon as Thanksgiving.

Omar’s claim on tax burden of 1% needs context

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., explained her support for a “Medicare for All” single-payer health care proposal with criticism of the U.S. tax system, saying it is too generous to the richest Americans.
“Let these facts sink in: The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else,” Omar tweeted Oct. 12. “27 million Americans don’t have health insurance. We can address both issues by taxing the wealthy to fund #MedicareForAll. Let’s get it done when we get back to Washington.”
Here, we’ll take a closer look at her first assertion that “the 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else.” We found that the reality is more complicated than Omar portrayed it.
A study says one thing, Omar said another
Several days earlier, Omar shared a New York Times article about “The Triumph of Injustice,” a new book by University of California-Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The book by Saez and Zucman offered a similar statistic — one that received significant media attention.
The book argues that in 2018, the richest 400 households in the United States paid a lower effective tax rate than households in any other income range. Effective tax rates refer to taxes paid as a percentage of income earned. Due to tax breaks and other factors, effective tax rates are usually lower than the statutory tax rates for a given income level.
Some critics have questioned the Saez-Zucman methodology, saying it exaggerates the amount of taxes paid by lower-income Americans. That’s because their analysis excluded refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, even though both are administered through the tax code.
Failing to account for these tax refunds artificially shows higher tax payments for the lower-income households that take advantage of these credits, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.
That’s important context, but there’s something else to know for this fact-check: The statement Omar tweeted is not identical to the widely publicized finding of the Saez-Zucman book.
First, their finding didn’t address the top 1% of households — it addressed the top 400 households in the country. That’s not a minor switch: The most recent IRS figures show that 1.4 million households belonged to the top 1%. That’s a universe more than 3,500 times larger than the top 400 households.
Second, Omar’s tweet said the top 1% paid “less in taxes” than everyone else, which can be read to mean a dollar amount. However, the Saez-Zucman research addressed effective tax rates, which is the percentage of income paid in taxes, not the overall amount paid.
How much does the 1% actually pay?
By other measures, however, Omar has a stronger point that the richest 1% of Americans pay less in taxes than the rest of the country.
Tax Policy Center estimates for 2019 show the top 1% paid 27% of all federal taxes, compared with 73% of taxes paid by the bottom 99%.
Meanwhile, the total amount of tax dollars paid by the top 1% ($828 billion) was exceeded by the amount paid by the bottom 99% ($2.27 trillion).
Still, it’s not too surprising that a group 99 times as large would collectively pay more in taxes. Omar’s decision to focus on this point obscures some key context: The 1% still pays a disproportionate share of the federal tax bill.
How do we know this? This data shows that 1% of the U.S. tax-paying population earns 16.1% of the nation’s pre-tax income. But it pays 27% of the tax burden.
You can argue that the richest Americans should pay even more than 27% of the nation’s taxes; either way, it’s clear that the current tax system requires that a small but wealthy fraction of Americans shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden.
Our ruling
Omar tweeted, “The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else.”
We rate the statement Half True.

Texto completo: MACY'S WILL STOP SELLING FUR PRODUCTS BY 2021
Macy's said its namesake chain and Bloomingdale's department stores would stop selling fur products by early 2021. The company conducted two years of research into alternatives and consumer views. The shift will mean the closure of 34 Fur Vaults at Macy's and 22 Maximilian salons at Bloomingdale's. The declaration from Macy's, which operates more than 600 department stores, follows a string of similar announcements from brands like Michael Kors and Gucci and even the state of California.
UNDER ARMOUR TAPS COO TO SUCCEED KEVIN PLANK AS CEO
Baltimore-based Under Armour, one of the biggest names in sportswear, said founder Kevin Plank will step down as chief executive and turn the reins over to his chief operating officer. Patrik Frisk, former head of the Aldo Group, will assume his new role Jan. 1. Since joining Under Armour in July 2017, Mr. Frisk has focused on boosting the lagging North America business. Mr. Plank has been Under Armour's only chief executive since the company was founded in 1996. He started it as a college student working out of his grandmother's basement. But with its novel use of synthetic materials, Under Armour quickly caught up with giants like Nike and Adidas.
MCDONALD'S Q3 EARNINGS DOWN ON TECH INVESTMENT
McDonald's says it's setting itself up for growth by investing in advances like voice recognition ordering technology. But for some investors, the short-term financial pain is hard to swallow. McDonald's net income dropped 2% to $1.6 billion in the third quarter as it rapidly remodeled stores and expanded delivery. Last month, McDonald's acquired a Silicon Valley voice recognition startup called Apprente, with an eye toward using it at drive-thru windows. The company plans to build a Silicon Valley tech lab around that acquisition. Earlier this year, it spent $300 million to buy Dynamic Yield, an Israeli startup that helps it provide customized recommendations at drive-thrus based on things like weather, restaurant traffic and customer order patterns.
FACEBOOK PLEDGES $1B FOR CALIFORNIA HOUSING
Facebook said it would give $1 billion in grants, loans and land toward easing California's severe housing crunch by building an estimated 20,000 new housing units for middle- and lower-income households. The move is the latest effort by technology companies to put their financial resources toward addressing a crisis that has afflicted tech centers, including the Bay Area and Seattle. In June, Google pledged $1 billion in a similar effort in the Bay Area, while Microsoft pledged $500 million toward affordable housing in Seattle in January.

Texto completo: Pacific Gas & Electric warned that it was likely to cut power temporarily to almost 200,000 customers in Northern California by Wednesday night, the second pre-emptive blackout in two weeks.
A growing threat of offshore winds combined with dry air and high temperatures have made 16 counties in the Sierra Foothills and the North Bay vulnerable to wildfires, the utility said on Tuesday. The company sent phone messages, texts and emails to those who might be affected by the shut-off, as a new fire in Southern California burned near multimillion-dollar homes.
PG&E expects to begin cutting power Wednesday afternoon just ahead of the fierce winds. The weather conditions are expected to subside Thursday, when the utility plans to begin restoring power.
The sole purpose of the shut-off "is to significantly reduce catastrophic wildfire risk to our customers and communities," said Michael Lewis, PG&E's senior vice president for electric operations, who made the decision to cut power to about two million people two weeks ago.
Bill Johnson, the utility's chief executive, said during a news conference late Monday that several steps had been taken to improve the process this time, including making community resource centers with restrooms, bottled water, chargers for electronic devices and other amenities available in advance.
On Tuesday evening, he told reporters, "We understand the hardship of the safety shut-offs."
PG&E, which has been convicted of criminal negligence for its handling of its natural gas system and blamed by the state authorities for a wildfire that killed scores of people, was widely criticized for its handling of the previous power shut-offs, which began Oct. 9 and lasted four days. Millions were left in the dark, many without notice. Businesses and schools were forced to close. The utility's website crashed twice.
Residents scrambled to buy power generators. Those with disabilities and dire health concerns found their lives were endangered.
PG&E said some customers reported having trouble on Tuesday gaining access to information about weather updates and the power shut-off on its website. The problem was fixed after about 45 minutes, the utility said.
The utility ran tests on its website afterward, Mr. Johnson said, and he tried to assure Californians that it would work.
"I have checked this myself," he said. "I am keeping an eye on it, and it better work."
The utility has used the power shut-offs in an attempt to prevent another year of devastating wildfires, modeling its efforts on those by San Diego Gas & Electric, which pioneered the strategy.
Guarding against wildfires caused by its equipment has become crucial for PG&E, California's largest utility. The company filed for bankruptcy in January as it faced tens of billions of dollars in liability claims. Its equipment has been blamed for causing two dozens fires in recent years.
But state regulators and Gov. Gavin Newsom railed against PG&E's executives for their handling of the power shut-offs, saying the company had failed again.
"PG&E's lapse in planning to provide adequate, accurate and accessible information to its customers and the public was inexcusable," Mr. Newsom wrote in a scathing letter to Mr. Johnson on Tuesday.
PG&E's meteorological and operations teams determined that dry offshore gusts might exceed 55 miles per hour late Wednesday through Thursday afternoon for portions of the Sierra Foothills. Gusts of 35 to 45 m.p.h. have been forecast for some North Bay counties, with some localities expected to experience 55 m.p.h. gusts.
The dry, hot, windy weather on Wednesday is also expected to affect Southern California. Southern California Edison, the second-largest utility in the state, announced Tuesday that it was considering cutting power to more than 130,000 in its service area.
State officials have classified more than half of PG&E's 70,000-square-mile service area in Northern and Central California as posing a high fire threat because of dry grasses and numerous dead and dying trees. The state's high-risk areas have tripled in size in seven years.
For this event, PG&E said customers visiting the pge.com website were being redirected to a special, strength-tested site able to accommodate high volumes of traffic. The temporary site provides customer information by address, community resource center locations and other shutdown-related information. Online services such as bill payments will be unavailable until after power has been restored.
Mr. Johnson said the increasingly disastrous effects of climate change would continue to make power shut-offs necessary, though less often as PG&E and other utilities harden their electric systems. But he said it would probably be a decade before PG&E no longer used power shut-offs as a tool for preventing wildfires based on what he had seen from the experiences at San Diego Gas & Electric, which began work on its system after fires in 2007.
"I think we're being realistic about it," Mr. Johnson said. "There will be fewer every year."
Time is of the essence for PG&E to demonstrate its ability to manage its operations. Cities like San Francisco and San Jose have increasingly called for breaking up PG&E and turning its operations into municipal utilities.
Mr. Newsom has said he wants PG&E to issue rebates of $ 100 to residential customers and $ 250 to small businesses for the effect of the power shut-offs earlier this month. Mr. Johnson said that the utility was reviewing the idea but that he was concerned about the precedent such a request might set. The governor called for the rebate again on Tuesday.
For all the criticism, Mr. Johnson has maintained that the most significant result of the power shut-off strategy has been that it prevented the utility's equipment from causing a wildfire. Even though the execution of the power shut-offs was poor, he said he believed the scope, targeting two million people, was necessary.
"We got that right," Mr. Johnson said.
State Senator Jerry Hill, a Bay Area Democrat, said that because of the utility's negligence and the loss of lives throughout its service area, it had become difficult to believe PG&E.
"We just don't, we meaning the public, we can't rely on their assessment of the need," Mr. Hill said. "It may be necessary, but there's no one to verify their actions and no one can trust their actions."

Texto completo: Revelations of a pervasive culture of sexual harassment and abuse at NBC just keep getting worse.
On Monday, writer Sil Lai Abrams shared in the Daily Beast that Ronan Farrow isn’t the only one who has had a sexual abuse story killed by the media company.
Abrams says she was raped by film producer Russell Simmons in 1994 and sexually assaulted by former Extra co-host A.J. Calloway in 2006. When she reached out to NBC’s Joy-Ann Reid with the story, it got stalled through an increasingly nebulous set of hurdles.
“When I approached Joy,” she wrote, “I had no idea that NBC had a reputation for not breaking news about men accused of sexual assault.”
After months of waiting for NBC to finish its vetting process and run an interview with her, Abrams got a call from Reid.
Abrams recounts that Reid told her on the phone, “I’ve never done a story that has this much evidence before. I have more evidence than the LA Times and the New York Times stories combined. So the whole thing is, if my company will trust the evidence that I’ve shown them, which is substantial, they will do the story.”
But by April 2018, NBC reportedly stopped responding to Reid’s inquiries about the story.
“Just like that, NBC threw Joy and me under the bus,” Abrams wrote. “It killed her story and — at least temporarily — silenced me.”
“The media is supposed to be a watchdog for abuses of power,” she continued. “Yet we keep learning how NBC uses its power to protect those in power.”
NBC has been in the news lately for ignoring a new sexual abuse accusation against former host Matt Lauer, silencing Ronan Farrow’s reporting on Harvey Weinstein, and harboring multiple executives accused of sexual misconduct.
This certainly seems like enough corruption and intrigue for a Hollywood film.
There's already a market for it. In December, Lionsgate is releasing Bombshell, a film about sexual abuse allegations against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. The upcoming Apple TV Plus series, The Morning Show, is not technically about Matt Lauer, though it’s basically about Matt Lauer.
If Hollywood cares about telling stories about abuse at the highest echelons of the journalism world, what better story to tell than the apparent cover-ups and misdeeds at NBC? The story could make a film just as intriguing as a movie about Fox News or a show about a single television host.
Bombshell, which is already drumming up Oscar buzz, looks like a powerful film about sexism and power dynamics in the media. There should be a similar movie about NBC, but that will only happen when Hollywood decides to care about women in the workplace as much as it cares about taking shots at Fox News.

Inside the media bubble: New York Times praise for Hillary Clinton’s sad post-2016 career

Texto completo: If you want a good example of what people mean when they say there is a media echo chamber, look no further than the New York Times’ daily political newsletter and its praise for Hillary Clinton’s headlong descent into bitter online trolling.
You would have to live in an alternate universe, or at least surround yourself with solely like-minded colleagues and peers, to believe Clinton is now “living her best life,” as the New York Times On Politics newsletter declared this week. Clinton’s post-2016 public career has mostly involved her crisscrossing the country blaming everyone except herself for her defeat. But the newsletter opens with these lines:
Is Hillary Clinton trolling us?
First, that is a gross mischaracterization of Clinton’s baseless slander of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The twice-failed presidential candidate did a lot more than suggest the Hawaii congresswoman and combat veteran is a “favorite of the Russians.” Clinton said in an interview last week that the Russians “got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and [they are] grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She is a favorite of the Russians." After this reference, which her spokesman later confirmed was to Gabbard, she then referred to 2016 Green Party nominee Jill Stein, stating "she is also a Russian asset." So that's an indirect but explicit statement that Gabbard is a Russian asset.
But anyway, the New York Times newsletter continues, arguing that the normally buttoned-down Clinton is now cutting loose, “speaking her mind,” and thriving as a “master troll” on the internet. That the authors of the newsletter see this almost as laudable as opposed to soul-crushingly sad says more about them than it does the former secretary of state.

Its paean to Clinton the Troll ends, weirdly enough, with a dig at Sen. Mitt Romney, who the newspaper apparently never tires of mocking.
“And Senator Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, admits to being a ‘lurker’ in online political discourse, with a secret Twitter account under the name Pierre Delecto. (‘C’est moi,’ Mr. Romney told the Atlantic last night, after Slate exposed him),” the newsletter states, adding later in its final line, “Mrs. Clinton, at least, trolls under her own name.”
But Romney did not use his burner account, which is now locked, to troll people online. He used it to defend himself politely from critics. Clinton, on the other hand, uses her account to mock her enemies in a less than clever manner. Living her best life indeed.
Let's be serious for a moment: Were Hillary Clinton anyone else who chose to live out her life post-failed candidacy by trawling for validation on social media, disputing the results of national elections, warning of a fascist takeover by her victorious opponent, calling for China to investigate said victorious opponent, and blaming everyone and everything around her for losing the 2016 election, there is no way anyone at the New York Times would describe her participation in public life in positive terms. We would be inundated instead with an endless stream of news reports and op-eds commenting on the sad state of our political discourse.
But Hillary Clinton is Hillary Clinton, and press sycophancy runs deep. That's why we get delusional and bizarrely generous commentaries such as this one from New York Times.

Texto completo: Un reporte de The New York Times hecho por la periodista Paulina Villegas afirma que los residentes de Culiacán apoyaron la decisión del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López, alias “El Ratón” .
El texto destaca que aunque analistas y medios nacionales y extranjeros cuestionaron la liberación del hijo de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , quienes vivieron la violencia desatada en Culiacán, Sinaloa, consideran que fue la mejor opción.
“Los residentes de Culiacán, la capital del estado de Sinaloa y el lugar de nacimiento del cártel, no comparten esos sentimientos. Dicen que la decisión salvó vidas” , indica la autora del texto, quien realizó una crónica de los días posteriores a los hechos violentos.
La historia expone los resultados del enfrentamiento y el miedo generalizado entre la población.
“Las huellas de la violencia estaban en todas partes. Los agujeros de bala golpearon edificios gubernamentales, restaurantes y hogares, e innumerables residentes llevaron consigo el trauma de lo que habían vivido ”, indica.
Las acciones del Cártel de Sinaloa provocaron terror entre los residentes de la capital.
“En los días posteriores al asedio de la ciudad de Culiacán por el Cártel de Sinaloa, los residentes se sintieron aliviados: alivio de que el terror haya terminado”, indica el Times. “Que más personas no murieron”.
La postura de los “culichis” coincide con la del presidente López Obrador, quien ha defendido la decisión de liberar a Guzmán López, a fin de de evitar más muertes.
“Ningún criminal vale más que una vida” , habría dicho el mandatario, quien este martes reconoció que desconocía que había un operativo para detener a “El Ratón”, aunque un día después de los enfrentamientos había dicho que respaldó la liberación del hijo de Guzmán Loera.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When Representative Elijah E. Cummings died last week at age 68, a photograph of him that was published with his obituary in The New York Times was also displayed outside his office and widely shared on social media.
Mr. Cummings, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, is pictured standing in the room where the committee meets, in a navy suit, holding a gavel. (Staff members at The Times were told he really liked the image.)
The photograph was taken by Justin T. Gellerson for an article about Mr. Cummings' role as a key player in the impeachment investigation of President Trump.
The congressman had been moving through the Capitol on a motorized scooter and was in poor health. But in the photo, Mr. Cummings, who represented a district that included much of Baltimore for 23 years, seems to embody his position as one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress.
Mr. Gellerson, the photographer, reflected on what it was like to photograph the congressman that day. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
Describe the day that you photographed Representative Cummings.
I've been a part of a lot of shoots with politicians and done a fair amount of it myself. I had asked if we could use the committee room that he was the chair of just because I kind of thought that would make for a more powerful space to photograph him than an office where there are a lot of reflections and stuff on the wall.
He didn't seem to love the process of being photographed, but he gave me a lot of time. But it did seem like he was in pain. I don't know if I understood that about him, that his mobility was limited in that way.
He was such a powerful voice throughout politics that I didn't want this thing to read that it was hard for him to stand for sustained periods of time. But the reality was that we were having to go near objects that he could brace himself.
What are the challenges in photographing a politician?
I think politicians are used to being photographed. A lot of politicians are aware of their image and aware of their brands in a way that most people aren't.
How do you address that?
Representative Cummings was really natural. For him, it was just kind of putting him in a place and giving him direction for what to do with his shoulders or head. He had a fired-up energy about him. He wasn't unpleasant, but no nonsense.
What do you hope that a portrait will accomplish?
I want it to feel natural and I wanted it to feel like it's that person and it represents that person to the best of my abilities. Every time I photograph someone, I say: "If I have asked you to do anything that you're not comfortable with doing, please let me know. At the end of the day, it's just my name under the photo. It's your face. This is more about you."
How much time did you have with Representative Cummings?
I think probably 10 minutes. But I had a lot of time to think about the setting and think about lighting.
The photograph also seems to evoke the historical political portrait.
That was definitely something I was thinking about -- making something that kind of felt like a painting, or painterly, and just being able to control the shadows on him. I worked with Elizabeth Herman and Celeste Sloman to photograph 130 lawmakers in the 116th United States Congress. We did that for three days creating these painterly portraits, and a lot of the references for that were paintings.
What are the elements of this portrait that do that?
A lot of it is the setting. We often see politicians behind a podium, or waving on a stage, or kissing a baby's head -- the tropes of portraits. By setting it in a committee room, it strips away a lot of that stuff. It takes away the things that feel modern. If this were in his office you could see a telephone on the desk, or family photographs.
But when you take it outside of that setting and put it in a room with beautiful wood and leather chairs and the flags loose in the background, there aren't so many distractions. The setting itself feels important, and you're just looking at him.

Texto completo: Deep sea explorers aboard a research vessel have used sonar images to pinpoint the location of the Akagi and Kaga, two carriers that took part in the Battle of Midway in 1942.
In the murky depths thousands of feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, two Japanese warships that have rested undisturbed since the Battle of Midway in World War II have been discovered.
In the past few days, deep sea explorers aboard the Petrel, a 250-foot research vessel that explores historically significant shipwrecks, announced they had located the wreckage of the Japanese carriers Kaga and Akagi, two among the six-carrier fleet used by Japanese aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor in 1941.
In June 1942, American dive-bombers attacked the carriers in one of the most famous battles in American naval history, about six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, which prompted the formal entry of the United States into the war. It was named after the Midway Atoll, a strategic ring-shaped reef some 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu, and was seen as a turning point for the United States in the Pacific campaign against Japan, which had naval superiority but lost four carriers in the episode. The Petrel crew had spent weeks surveying the area, documenting more than 500 square nautical miles before picking up the wreckage in a conservation site known as Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the atoll region of the Central Pacific. Using sonar images, the Kaga came into view on Wednesday, and the Akagi was detected on Sunday in depths of 17,000 feet, according to Vulcan Inc., which owns and operates the Petrel and has served as the multibillionaire Paul G. Allen's organization overseeing and supporting his philanthropic initiatives. The carriers were the largest Japanese carriers that Japan had at the time.
The crew has discovered more than 30 sunken warships, including, this year, the remains of the American aircraft carrier Wasp, which was sunk by a Japanese submarine in July 1942, and, in 2015, the Japanese warship Musashi.
"This project is significantly different from previous missions as it required a level of investigation, analysis and survey of a carrier-based engagement initially separated by over 150 nautical miles," Robert Kraft, director of subsea operations for Vulcan, said in a statement. "It was a major carrier-to-carrier battle that left its eerie evidence strewn for a total area covering thousands of square nautical miles across the ocean floor."
Petrel owes its existence to Mr. Allen, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, and to Vulcan. Underwater exploration and World War II history were interests of Mr. Allen's. He died in 2018 at 65 after a recurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
During the Battle of Midway, from June 3 to 7, the two carriers were dive-bombed by American planes and Kaga was torpedoed before they were scuttled by their own navies. The battle's overall casualty toll was 2,204 Japanese forces, and 307 American forces, according to Naval History and Heritage Command figures.
The scene as the two carriers went to their underwater graves was captured in a New York Times dispatch on June 10, 1942:
The sister ships Kaga and Akagi are no more. Tossing in his rubber boat in the waters off Midway, our wounded Ensign Gay watched the two great Japanese carriers blasted into flame from stem to stern as their planes circled helplessly above them, unable to land on the blazing furnaces which had been their nests.
An Associated Press reporter onboard the Petrel who is writing about the discovery said that the Akagi was resting amid a pile of debris and that the ground around it was clearly disturbed by the impact of it hitting the seafloor.
"She's sitting upright on her keel, we can see the bow, we can see the stern clearly, you can see some of the gun emplacements on there, you can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be," Mr. Kraft told the A.P.
In the battle, the United States lost one carrier, the Yorktown, and a destroyer, Hammann, while two other Japanese carriers, the Soryu and Hiryu, also sank.
"With each piece of debris and each ship we discover and identify, our intent is to honor history and those who served and paid the ultimate sacrifice for their countries," Mr. Kraft said.
Similar to previous discoveries, there are no plans to disturb the carriers, which are considered war graves that will go untouched, a Vulcan spokeswoman confirmed.
Frank Thompson, a historian from the Naval History and Heritage Command, who is part of the team aboard the Petrel, said the discovery would give historians a "new perspective" of the pivotal battle. "Unlike land battles, war at sea leaves no traces on the surface," he said in the statement.
Kitty Bennett contributed research.

The Mood on Impeachment Across 6 Swing States

Texto completo: With core supporters and opponents dug in, a crucial sliver of people support the inquiry but not necessarily removal.
Voters in the states likeliest to decide the 2020 presidential election support the impeachment inquiry that House Democrats began last month, but a majority still opposes impeaching President Trump and removing him from office, according to a New York Times/Siena College survey.
In the six closest states carried by the president in 2016, registered voters support the impeachment inquiry by a five-point margin, 50 percent to 45 percent. The same voters oppose impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office, 53 percent to 43 percent.
The survey depicts a deeply divided electorate in battleground states a year from the election, with the president's core supporters and opponents exceptionally energized and unified. Yet at the same time, a crucial sliver of relatively moderate voters -- just 7 percent of the electorate -- support the inquiry without backing Mr. Trump's impeachment and removal from office.
The findings suggest that public opinion has stabilized since shifting quickly against the president in late September, and it leaves American politics where it has been for some time: deadlocked, with neither side likely to face severe political costs for its position on the president.
Democrats have long feared that impeachment would alienate moderate voters. But in the pivotal states of Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona, a majority of voters support the inquiry. Self-described independents back the inquiry, 51 percent to 43 percent.
Support for the impeachment inquiry is largely consistent with recent national surveys, which show registered voters backing the inquiry by an average of nine points over the last three weeks, or a margin four points higher than the one in the Times/Siena poll. In 2016, the six battleground states were about four points more favorable to Mr. Trump than the rest of the country was, a pattern that persisted in the 2018 midterm election.
The results suggest that the president continues to be stronger in the top battleground states than he is nationwide. This is keeping his narrow path to re-election alive and insulating him and his party from national political opinion -- to an extent.
National surveys have been less consistent about the issue of removal. A few high-profile national surveys, including a Fox News poll criticized by the president, show a majority of voters support impeachment and removal. But many surveys have not shown support for removal.
An NBC/WSJ poll, for instance, found that adults opposed impeachment and removal by a six-point margin, 49 percent to 43 percent, nearly the reverse of Fox's result of 51 percent supporting and 43 percent opposed. Other surveys -- from Marist College, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS and Monmouth College -- also found more opposition than support for impeachment and removal. The Times/Siena results are fairly consistent with those surveys.
A group that could be crucial to shifting the balance of public opinion is voters who say they support the inquiry but are not ready to support removing the president. This 7 percent slice of respondents tends to be younger -- 33 percent are 18 to 34 -- and nearly half are self-identified independents. They could prove tough for Democrats to convince: 51 percent say that the president's conduct is typical of most politicians, perhaps suggesting that they hold a jaded view of politics that would tend to minimize the seriousness of the allegations against him.
Mr. Trump's supporters from 2016 are nearly unanimous in their opposition to removing him. Over all, 94 percent of respondents who said they voted for him four years ago said they opposed his impeachment and removal. It is possible that Trump voters who have soured on him are less likely to divulge their 2016 preference to a pollster. (Crosstabs available here.)
Trump voters are not convinced that the president's conduct was atypical for politicians in Washington. Only 11 percent of Mr. Trump's 2016 supporters believe that his Ukraine-related conduct is worse than the conduct of most politicians, while 75 percent said it was typical.
Democrats and self-reported Hillary Clinton voters strongly support impeachment and removal, but they are divided by ideology and levels of political engagement.
Over all, 83 percent of Democrats and 85 percent of Mrs. Clinton's voters said they supported impeachment and removal from office, compared with 93 percent of Republicans who opposed.
Just 75 percent of moderate and conservative Democrats say they support impeaching and removing Mr. Trump, while 21 percent are opposed. Very liberal Democrats, on the other hand, are all but unanimous: 93 percent in favor and 4 percent opposed.
Much of the hesitation among Democrats comes from voters who say they aren't following the news about impeachment very closely. Of these voters, 21 percent oppose impeaching and removing Mr. Trump.
Support for impeachment could grow as Democratic voters tune in; Democrats who are paying "very close" attention support impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office, 94 percent to 5 percent.
New developments could sway public opinion as well. The Times/Siena survey of 1,934 respondents had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points and was conducted from Oct. 13-20, largely before the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, acknowledged that aid to Ukraine was conditioned on an investigation of Democrats. (He later retracted those comments).
But more time doesn't guarantee a shift in public opinion. The rapid increase in support for impeachment after Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement of the opening of the inquiry last month has clearly slowed and perhaps even ground to halt.
Paying close attention doesn't ensure that voters will resolve to remove the president, either: Trump voters who say they're following the impeachment news "very closely" oppose impeachment and removal from office, 97 percent to 3 percent.

Texto completo: With impeachment looming, it's time to take to the streets again.
All over the world right now, outraged citizens are taking to the streets. Mass protests in Hong Kong have been going on for months, at one point drawing about a quarter of the territory's population. For the last five days, hundreds of thousands of people have been marching against austerity and corruption in Lebanon, and the government has pushed through a package of reforms to address their grievances. In Chile, protests over a subway fare increase have exploded into a broader uprising against inequality.
These demonstrations are part of a global trend. "There has been in this decade a real rise in the use of mass protests in particular as a way to address grievances against governments around the world," said Erica Chenoweth, a Harvard professor and co-author of "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict." In fact, she said, in the last 10 years there have been more mass demonstrations calling for the removal of political leaders than in any decade since 1900.
So as Donald Trump's sneering lawlessness and stupefying corruption continue to escalate, it's confounding, at least to me, that Americans aren't taking to the streets en masse. This presidency began with the biggest protest in American history, and its first two years were marked by a series of high-profile demonstrations. But three years in, even as the conviction that Trump threatens the Republic unites stolid military heroes and socialist feminists, demonstrations against the administration have faded. Lyndon Johnson was famously tormented by protest chants that could be heard through the walls of the White House. Why isn't Trump?
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
Organizers and experts offer both optimistic and pessimistic explanations for Americans' relative quiescence. Let's start with pessimism: Some people are burned out. In her book "American Resistance: From the Women's March to the Blue Wave," Dana Fisher, a professor at the University of Maryland, described how a series of "moral shocks" propelled people who hadn't thought of themselves as activists to join protests. But after three years of Trumpism, it takes more to shock people than it used to. "People have grown accustomed to a certain baseline level of outrage," Fisher told me.
But that's far from the whole story. Fisher surveyed people at the Women's March and other demonstrations, and then tracked them afterward, doing follow-up surveys six months before the midterms and two days after. "All of their levels of civic engagement went up," she said.
Many had called elected officials and attended town halls. Now, she says, much of the Resistance is focused on organizing for presidential candidates, particularly Elizabeth Warren. "One of the reasons we're seeing less protest is that protest is being seen as the beginning of activism and political involvement rather than being the end," she said.
So if America isn't seeing the sort of huge demonstrations roiling other countries, it's at least in part because those most fiercely opposed to Trump still believe in the power of our democracy to get rid of him. "People actually trust the election to sort it out," said Chenoweth. "This is something that's common in democracies -- when you start to see a protest wave really pick up, a lot of time that mobilization really gets filtered into the next election."
But the next election is a year away, and American democracy is in danger now. You can't count on an election to restrain the president when the president is using the power of his office to subvert the election with foreign interference. Each day, it seems, Trump and those around him become increasingly brazen in their lawbreaking.
The president's re-election campaign is selling T-shirts that say, "Get Over It," which is what the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said after admitting on national television to Trump's quid pro quo with Ukraine. Trump associates are blithely defying congressional subpoenas. With the staffers who used to at least try to restrain the president long gone, he's testing the limits of his authority. And he's retreating only in the face of bipartisan public fury, as he did when he backed off his plan to hold next year's G7 at the Trump National Doral, his failing Florida resort.
As the impeachment investigation closes in, Trump will continue to act out. That's why a growing number of people -- many of them more temperate than I am -- have started calling for mass protest in response.
Organizers are brainstorming how to make this happen. "Our experience has been that the most successful mobilization moments have some kind of trigger or flash point," said Leah Greenberg, a co-founder of the anti-Trump organization Indivisible. "The place that we have agreed as a movement to make that next flash point mobilization moment is going to be around the House vote."
Once the House votes to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, there needs to be a public groundswell to force the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to allow a thorough and transparent trial. Then, assuming the evidence is as compelling as it seems, there should be mass nonviolent action calling for Trump's removal.
Americans might feel that democracy in our country is more robust than in places disrupted by enormous protests. But at this dangerous phase of a dangerous presidency, enormous turnout in the streets may be the only way to make sure it stays that way.

Mitt Romney says he's behind 'Pierre Delecto' Twitter account

Texto completo: Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the former Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor, is also, apparently, the man behind a Twitter account that uses the moniker “Pierre Delecto."
Romney on Sunday admitted to McKay Coppins, a writer at The Atlantic, that he was responsible for the social media account, which he uses to covertly monitor political discourse and occasionally defend himself. It's unclear what, if anything, Pierre Delecto is a reference to.
Several events preceded the admission.
First, The Atlantic published Sunday a profile of Romney, one of the few prominent Republican lawmakers to criticize President Trump over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Those efforts form the basis of an impeachment investigation by the House.
Trump lashed out in response this month, calling the senator on Twitter a “pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning." In one tweet, the president used the hashtag “#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY."
In the Atlantic profile, Romney admitted to having what he called a “lurker account" — essentially a profile under a different name that he operated in secret to monitor the political conversation.
But he declined to divulge the name associated with the account.
The admission spurred curiosity, particularly that of the online newsmagazine Slate.
Slate theorized that Pierre Delecto, or Twitter user @qaws9876, was Romney after it discovered the account among the Twitter followers of one of his grandchildren.
Slate noted that Pierre Delecto's first follower was Romney's oldest son, Tagg.
The account was created in 2011, shortly after Romney announced his intention to run for president.
The account also posted several telling replies to Romney-related tweets, which were captured by screenshot before the account was made private Sunday night.
In one tweet from May, Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger at The Washington Post, said Romney's strategy on Trump was “non-confrontation verging on spinelessness."
“Jennifer, you need to take a breath," Pierre Delecto replied. “Maybe you can then acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure even if not in every measure."
The Slate article prompted many on social media to surmise that if Pierre Delecto was in fact Romney, he had concocted one of the most prolific social media pseudonyms for a public official ever.
After Slate published its article, Coppins circled back with Romney to ask if he was indeed “Pierre Delecto."
“Just spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto," Coppins said in a tweet. “His only response: “C'est moi."'
A spokeswoman for Romney did not directly answer questions about the account Sunday night. But in an e-mail, the spokeswoman sent a link to the tweet from Coppins describing Romney's admission.

Facebook ramps up election security efforts before 2020
With just over a year left until the 2020 US presidential election, Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world.
The efforts outlined Monday include a special security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors their accounts for hacking attempts such as login attempts from unusual locations or unverified devices. Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly, and invest $2 million in media literacy projects.
The company also said it has removed four networks of fake, state-backed misinformation-spreading accounts based in Russia and Iran. These networks sought to disrupt elections in the United States, North Africa, and Latin America, the company said. In the past year, Facebook said it has taken down 50 such clusters of accounts, a sign that efforts to use its services to disrupt elections are not letting up.
Facebook is under fire from presidential candidates, lawmakers, regulators, and privacy advocates around the world for problems ranging from election security to alleged anticompetitive behavior, privacy violations, and what many see as its outsized, often negative influence on society.

Democrats make bids to be new Oversight chairman
The race to replace the late representative Elijah Cummings as chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee is already quietly underway, with nearly half a dozen Democrats considering bids to replace him.
The potentially divisive contest — set to turn on questions of seniority, diversity, and effectiveness — will determine which Democrat will inherit a lead role in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump as one of three chairmen jointly directing the investigation.
Congress often obeys the rules of seniority when it comes to passing the torch for panel leadership positions. Yet there is no hard-and-fast rule mandating that is the case; instead, candidates make their case to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which will make a recommendation in a process that will commence after Cummings's funeral Friday, according to Democratic aides.

Trump says Gabbard is not an agent of Russia
President Trump is attacking Hillary Clinton for suggesting Democratic presidential candidate Representative Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent.
Trump says of Gabbard, "she's not a Russian agent."
Clinton appeared to call Gabbard "the favorite of the Russians" in a recent interview, saying she believes the Russians have "got their eye on somebody who's currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate." Speaking during a Cabinet meeting Monday, Trump says Clinton and other Democrats claim everyone opposed to them is a Russian agent.Trump says he thinks Clinton's attack boosts Gabbard and his own chances.

Texto completo: Justice Brett Kavanaugh has dethroned Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the most well-known justice on the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh, a conservative who was sworn in last year after a contentious confirming hearing, had 83% name recognition, according to a Marquette University Law School poll.
Seventy-nine percent of those polled had heard of Ginsburg, a liberal darling. In comparison, two-thirds could identify Chief Justice John Roberts.
Kavanaugh’s name recognition comes with a high unfavorable rating, as 32% of respondents view him in a negative light. Kavanaugh’s unfavorable rating is the highest among the nine justices.
Justice Clarence Thomas, who also faced sexual misconduct allegations during his confirmation hearing nearly three decades ago, was viewed more negatively than most of his colleagues, with a 23% unfavorable rating.
Ginsburg was next in line with a 17% unfavorable rating, though she bested her colleagues by double digits with 41% of those polled having a favorable impression of the 86-year-old.
The poll, conducted Sept. 3-13, surveyed 1,423 adults nationwide and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

There's no reason to assume the Ukraine whistleblower is a patriot just because he's a career 'public servant'

Texto completo: It’s really hard not to laugh out loud at liberal New York Times writer Michelle Cottle’s defense of all the career government employees who make up the so-called “deep state” by describing them as “patriotic public servants.”
I hate the term “deep state” because it sounds so conspiratorial. But if Cottle agrees that it’s just a synonym for “permanent Washington bureaucrats,” fine. But the only reason she might honestly believe those people are nothing more than civic-minded diplomats is because she doesn’t know any.
“President Trump is right: The deep state is alive and well,” she wrote Sunday. “But it is not the sinister, antidemocratic cabal of his fever dreams. It is, rather, a collection of patriotic public servants — career diplomats, scientists, intelligence officers and others — who, from within the bowels of this corrupt and corrupting administration, have somehow remembered that their duty is to protect the interests, not of a particular leader, but of the American people.”
Isn’t that precisely what people like James Comey and Andrew McCabe have revealed themselves to be? Just two patriotic public servants who wanted nothing more than to protect the interests of the American people.
Oh, wait, no, that’s not right. It turned out that Comey, former head of the FBI, was leaking information to the New York Times in order to hurt President Trump. Then he lied to Congress about doing just that.
Andrew McCabe, the FBI's deputy director, was fired shortly before his retirement, also for leaking to the media and then lying about it, and he has since spent his days getting paid by CNN to call for Trump’s impeachment.
The federal government is packed with people like this— people who have lived in Washington for most or all of their adult lives, doing very little actual work while promoting themselves, lying a lot, and making a lot of money. If you’ve ever wondered why there’s truly very little difference between Democratic and Republican administrations, these people are a big reason why. Their job is almost by definition to keep things the way they are, regardless of who was elected and why.
Trump may have been elected to “shake things up” but if we’ve learned anything from his first three years in office it’s that there are a lot of people whose paychecks depend in part on making sure that doesn’t happen.
The so-called “whistleblower” at the center of the Ukraine issue that has now likely led to Trump’s impeachment is exactly this kind of person. I have no idea if he’s a patriot. But let’s not pretend that he must have been motivated by some devotion to the American ideal.
Far more likely, he’s the same as the other career government employees who don’t like Trump and don’t want to see Washington change. And that isn’t patriotism. It’s politics.

Texto completo: Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the former Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor, is also, apparently, the man behind a Twitter account that uses the moniker “Pierre Delecto.”
Romney on Sunday admitted to McKay Coppins, a writer at The Atlantic, that he was responsible for the social media account, which he uses to covertly monitor political discourse and occasionally defend himself. It’s unclear what, if anything, Pierre Delecto is a reference to.
Several events preceded the admission.
First, The Atlantic published Sunday a profile of Romney, one of the few prominent Republican lawmakers to criticize President Donald Trump over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Those efforts form the basis of an impeachment investigation by the House.
Trump lashed out in response this month, calling the senator on Twitter a “pompous ‘ass’ who has been fighting me from the beginning.” In one tweet, the president used the hashtag “#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.”
In the Atlantic profile, Romney admitted to having what he called a “lurker account” — essentially a profile under a different name that he operated in secret to monitor the political conversation. But he declined to divulge the name associated with the account.
The admission spurred curiosity, particularly that of the online newsmagazine Slate.
Slate theorized that Pierre Delecto, or Twitter user @qaws9876, was Romney after it discovered the account among the Twitter followers of one of his grandchildren.

Slate noted that Pierre Delecto’s first follower was Romney’s oldest son, Tagg. The account was created in 2011, shortly after Romney announced his intention to run for president. The account also followed all of Romney’s children who are on Twitter and several former advisers, according to Slate.
The account also posted several telling replies to Romney-related tweets, which were captured by screenshot before the account was made private Sunday night.
In one tweet from May, Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger at The Washington Post, said Romney’s strategy on Trump was “non-confrontation verging on spinelessness.”
“Jennifer, you need to take a breath,” Pierre Delecto replied. “Maybe you can then acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure even if not in every measure.”
The Slate article prompted many on social media to surmise that if Pierre Delecto was in fact Romney, he had concocted one of the most prolific social media pseudonyms for a public official ever (besting the former FBI director James B. Comey’s onetime moniker of Reinhold Niebuhr).
After Slate published its article, Coppins circled back with Romney to ask if he was indeed “Pierre Delecto.”
“Just spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto,” Coppins said in a tweet. “His only response: “C’est moi.”’
A spokeswoman for Romney did not directly answer questions about the account Sunday night. But in an email, the spokeswoman sent a link to the tweet from Coppins describing Romney’s admission.

Texto completo: Attorneys representing the Dayton Daily News, WHIO-TV and multiple other news organizations put the Supreme Court of Ohio on notice of the planned appeal in the legal fight for the release of the Bellbrook-Sugarcreek school records of Connor Betts, the man who fatally shot nine people in Dayton’s Oregon District.
The Notice of Appeal filing comes weeks after the Ohio Second Appellate District Court’s decision in which the justices sided with the Bellbrook-Sugarcreek school district’s move to withhold the release of Betts’ records.
Betts, 23, injured dozens in addition to the nine people he fatally shot the night of Aug. 4 along East Fifth Street. The mass shooting ended after approximately 30 seconds when Dayton officers fatally shot Betts as he attempted to enter the Ned Peppers bar.
Betts’ former classmates told reporters that his behavior in high school raised red flags that, if properly addressed, might have prevented the shooting.
Once the notice is entered into the record with the Ohio Supreme Court, attorneys representing the media companies will have 40 days to file the merits for the appeal, according to Christopher Hollon, attorney for Dayton Daily News and WHIO-TV.
Other national media companies, including CNN and the New York Times, are plaintiffs in the case.
In denying the media’s request to force the release of Betts’ school records, the second appellate court’s three-judge panel concluded that the school district “does not have a clear legal duty to release them” because the records being sought do not qualify as public records under Ohio law.

Texto completo: Dos senadores republicanos han expresado en los últimos días que se plantean apoyar el proceso que echaría al presidente Donald Trump de la Casa Blanca , en caso de que la Cámara de Representantes vote primero a favor. Esto hace que el llamado “muro rojo” de apoyo al mandatario se empiece a resquebrajar en el Congreso, a posar del sólido respaldo de las bases del partido.
Además, dentro del partido republicano también han surgido fuertes oposiciones a acciones polémicas del presidente como la retirada de las tropas estadounidenses del norte de Siria o intención (luego cancelada) de celebrar la Cumbre del G-7 en una de sus propiedades. Hasta ahora han sido dos los funcionarios republicanos que han alzado públicamente la voz contra el presidente.
Uno de ellos es el senador Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur , que este lunes en una entrevista en Axios TV expresó una raro enojo por el comportamiento del presidente. Graham, uno de los más acérrimos aliados del presidente, aseguró que respaldaría el impeachment si se demuestra que el presidente se saltó la ley.
Por su parte, Mitt Rommey, senador por Utah , fue más allá en la entrevista con el medio ya que incluso enumeró los motivos para destituir al presidente de su cargo. Rommey sí que está entre los republicanos más críticos del presidente. De hecho, fuentes cercanas al senador dijeron a Axios TV que sería de los primeros en votar para condenar a Trump.
Trump sabe que el apoyo de un republicano moderado como Rommey a una hipotética destitución podría alentar a otros colegas de ideas afines a seguir sus pasos. El Washington Post y The New York Times coinciden en que esta teoría parece haber asustado al presidente, que el pasado fin de semana dio marcha atrás en su intención de celebrar la cumbre del G-7 en su resort de Florida .
Para que el impechament salga adelante en el Senado, tras su aprobación en la Cámara Baja. 20 republicanos deben unirse a los 45 demócratas del Senado y a dos independientes para conseguir al menos los 67 votos que echarían a Trump de la Casa Blanca. Hasta ahora, Axios solo ha identificado a ocho republicanos de la Cámara Alta que podrían votar en contra del mandatario.

Gloria Allred says her New York Times critics "don't understand the practice of law"

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – On Sunday, Lionsgate held a “tastemaker” screening of its new film “Bombshell,” about the women who called out sexual harassment at Fox News. It was a typical awards season event, featuring a Q&A with the movie’s stars – Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie – and a guest list peppered with influencers whose endorsement might help give the film traction. Taylor Swift was there – though few actually laid eyes on her – as was actress Cara Delevingne, Rodarte co-founder Laura Mulleavy and lawyer Gloria Allred.
On the surface, Allred’s appearance at the Hollywood screening made sense. She has represented dozens of women who have sued powerful men for sexual harassment, though none who publicly spoke out against former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes or network host Bill O’Reilly.
But in the past month, Allred’s reputation as a feminist crusader has come under scrutiny. In their new book “She Said” – and a subsequent podcast episode of The Daily – New York Times journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey have raised questions about whether the attorney truly has her clients’ best interests at heart. Through their reporting, the journalists argued that Allred was actually part of the problem instead of the solution, pressuring clients to accept secret settlements instead of publicly speaking out against their accusers in court.
In the case of Harvey Weinstein, Kantor and Twohey found, Allred’s firm negotiated a $125,000 settlement for one actress in 2004 – 13 years before Weinstein’s pattern of alleged predation came to light.
But at the “Bombshell” event, Allred said she was unbothered by the negative press. “It hasn’t been intense for me at all. I know what I’m doing is right,” she said, moments after posing with two middle-aged female party guests who had asked for a photograph.
“I felt that, frankly, the New York Times reporters seem to be new to the issue of confidential settlements,” she continued. “I do understand they have a different role than I have. Reporters want to know everything, because that’s their job. I don’t criticize them, because that’s their job. But my job is not to be a member of the press. My job is to put my client first.”
In response to Allred’s comments, Kantor and Twohey said that they had spent more than two years investigating confidential settlements and found “that while they can provide victims of sexual abuse with financial recompense and privacy, they also allow alleged predators to repeatedly cover their tracks and go on to reportedly hurt others,” the reporters wrote in an email. “We are watching closely as legislators in California and elsewhere pursue alternative ways for victims to receive financial recompense that don’t enable predation.”
Allred insisted that she never pressures her clients into accepting settlements. Her job, she said, is to outline the benefits and risks of every option: Do you want to file a public lawsuit and litigate for four or five years – and maybe the jury will side with you? Or do you want a confidential settlement that does not require you to testify in court but may also prohibit you from speaking publicly about the allegations?
Most of her clients, Allred said, go the settlement route.
“So yeah, the press is like, ‘That’s not right. They’re not helping other women,’” Allred said. “I don’t want women to feel that they always have to sacrifice themselves for something called the greater good. They get to have the greater good for themselves too. They get to have the money to pay their therapy bills and their medical bills and maybe start a new chapter and also have their privacy and go on. They get to make that decision. They’re adults.”
But doesn’t Allred stand a great chance of benefiting financially if her clients accept a settlement? In the case of the Weinstein accuser, Kantor and Twohey reported, Allred’s firm kept 40% of the client’s $125,000 payment. The attorney responded by saying there was not always a financial upside, pointing out that if a case took five years to get to trial, “maybe we’d get a larger verdict.”
Still, even if a client opts for a settlement – doesn’t it ever bother her that the silence might allow a perpetrator to continue a pattern of harassment?
“I’m not in control of whether they engage in that behavior or not,” Allred said. “And I always believe – and I said this about O.J. Simpson many years ago – he will be the cause of his own destruction. That’s what happened with Bill Cosby. That’s what happened with Harvey Weinstein. That’s what happened with Jeffrey Epstein. R. Kelly. It’s within them. They will fall.”
Allred would not comment on the New York Times reporters’ revelations about her daughter, attorney Lisa Bloom. In “She Said,” Kantor and Twohey publish a memo written by Bloom in which the lawyer laid out a strategy to attack Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan, noting she felt “equipped to help [him] against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them.”
“She speaks for herself,” Allred said of her daughter. “She said it was a mistake to represent [Weinstein]. Whatever she decides, I love her. She’s a great attorney.”
As for “Bombshell,” which Lionsgate has set for a December release, the lawyer said she thought filmmaker Jay Roach “did a very good job with it,” creating a film with a documentary-like feel that showed the conflict female employees who have been harassed in the workplace often experience.
“Often the press says, ‘Why don’t they come out, why don’t they have a voice, why don’t they tell the story?’ Well, there are lots of reasons,” Allred said. “I have no doubts [when a client takes a settlement] because I know I’ve helped my client and helped them have a new life. I get these emails all the time – ‘Thank you, and here’s what I’m doing with all of this. I’m saving. I’m sending my kids to college. I’m going to college. I’ve started my own business. I’m getting all my therapy. I feel empowered.’

Texto completo: A federal program to encourage black homeownership in the 1970s ended in a flood of foreclosures.
When tens of thousands of African-Americans held the keys to their first homes in the early 1970s as part of a new federal program that encouraged black homeownership, they thought they were about to fulfill the American dream. Instead they got an American nightmare.
The story begins with the urban uprisings of the late 1960s, which were reactions to decades of poverty, racism and a lack of opportunity. According to the Kerner Commission, a major cause was government-sponsored housing segregation that had confined African-Americans to rental housing in urban neighborhoods while subsidizing white flight to the suburbs. Black people, too, wanted to enjoy the benefits of homeownership and the uprisings pressured Washington to take that seriously.
Richard Nixon gave voice to a shift in government policy in 1968 when he declared that "people who own their own homes don't burn their neighborhoods." The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 created policies that let low-income black renters, long excluded from conventional mortgages and other standard ways of financing homes, become homeowners.
At the core of the law were three components: A down payment cost only $ 200; a buyer's mortgage was linked to her income, not her house's value; and the interest rate on the loan, subsidized by the federal government, was capped at 1 percent.
It was a boon -- at least for banks and the real estate industry.
The Federal Housing Administration backed mortgages arranged through this program and bankers didn't have to worry about foreclosures or defaults because if buyers fell behind on their payment, Washington would simply pay off the loan. An unprecedented number of black renters in Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago and other urban centers became homeowners.
But the program was troubled from the start. The conditions that allowed for homeownership also set the groundwork for fraud. Racist exclusion gave way to predatory inclusion.
Speculators bought decrepit or even condemned houses on the cheap and then quickly flipped them. F.H.A. appraisers, often part-time real estate agents, would sometimes pocket bribes to inflate the value of the house.
Meanwhile, bankers signed off on bloated appraisals because Washington absorbed the risk. These bankers made money on both the fees to make the loan and the closing costs to sell the house, so they cared only about issuing a huge number of mortgages, which they'd package and resell. It didn't matter to them whether a house went into foreclosure.
In turn, black buyers were paying more for homes that were older and shoddier than the ones their white peers were buying in the suburbs. As a result, the nation's first programs to encourage black homeownership ended in the 1980s with tens of thousands of foreclosures. The push to uplift black homeownership had turned into a gold mine for real estate agents and mortgage lenders. And champions of deregulation could point to it as an example of the dangers of government intervention.
One of the Americans who saw their hopes of owning a home shattered was Janice Johnson, a black single mother on welfare and living about as far from the lily-white suburbs as a person could get. She and her 8-year-old son had lived in a decaying apartment, in a building that had recently been condemned by city officials, in a working-class black neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia.
Facing eviction, Ms. Johnson needed to quickly find a new place to live. Her mother told her of an apartment for rent in the same neighborhood. Instead the landlord suggested that she buy a house there through the new HUD program.
Ms. Johnson bought her first home in September 1970. But days after she moved in, the sewer line broke, spewing wastewater all over the basement floor. The electricity was sporadic and haphazard. There were holes in the foundation. The windows were nailed shut and inoperable. The floorboards in her dining room were so rotten, she feared her table would fall through the floor.
The crumbling structure of the house was not the wors­­­­­­­t of it.
The day before Halloween, Ms. Johnson's son woke up to find a rat in his bed. Rats were everywhere, including in the kitchen and bathroom, entering the house through holes in the basement, where they made their nests.
She called the real estate agent who sold her the house to complain. He sent workmen out a couple of times, and they even patched the failing plaster in her dining room; but soon after, the agent reminded her that the problems in her house were "homeowner's business."
The details of Ms. Johnson's woes come from a court case; it's unclear how her story ends.
There were thousands of cases like hers from Memphis to Minneapolis and they made front-page news. The Chicago Tribune even won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for its coverage of this crisis. Generous government subsidies had helped the real estate and banking industries overcome their reluctance to sell and lend to African-Americans. But of course they never stopped believing blacks presented a threat to property values, perpetuating the real estate industry's segregationist practices.
While the policies created by the Housing and Urban Development Act did not immediately change the practices or the beliefs within the real estate industry -- or among agents working for the Federal Housing Administration -- it did allow for the participation of broader networks of real estate operatives and lenders that circulated billions of new dollars throughout the urban housing market.
This public-private partnership in the production of low-income housing tethered the public agencies of HUD and the F.H.A. to real estate brokers, mortgage bankers and homebuilders. These close relationships made it unlikely that anti-discrimination laws would be aggressively enforced. This allowed banks and real estate agents to continue to illegally steer black buyers away from neighborhoods with better housing at better prices.
One reason for the reluctance to push industry to obey federal laws was that federal workers eventually wanted jobs in the more lucrative private real estate industry. Another was that too much regulation could prompt the private partners to take their business far from the red tape of government.
The recruiting of thousands of poor black women as homeowners was strategic for an industry in search of new customers -- and underlined the dubiousness of the program.
Real estate brokers and mortgage bankers valued black women like Janice Johnson precisely because they were poor, desperate and likely to fall behind on their payments. The HUD-F.H.A. guarantee to pay lenders in full for the mortgage of any home in foreclosure transformed risk from a reason for exclusion into an incentive for inclusion. Banks could profit from being repaid for inflated mortgages, and profit again when the foreclosed property was resold to another poor family that qualified for a government-guaranteed mortgage.
When the federal government guaranteed Ms. Johnson's mortgage, it became implicated in the shoddy business practices of private sector agents bent on profiting from the desperation of low-income urban residents. A legacy of the failure of the program is that it contributed to the conditions that eventually allowed for the widespread use of subprime loans. Indiscriminate F.H.A. lending that resulted in mass foreclosures in the 1970s helped cement the perception of black neighborhoods as dilapidated and deteriorating -- which became the basis for declaring a place, or even a person, subprime.
Racial discrimination persisted in the new market because it was good business, not simply because the industry was stuck in its old ways. Our failure to fully recognize this history has meant that housing policy continues to uncritically revolve around market-based solutions even as black homeownership rates fall to historic lows.
It's hard to uproot these predatory practices because race has been so important to the real estate industry's bottom line. At the very least, Washington must renew its commitment to aggressively enforce its own civil rights laws and ruthlessly punish offenders. This could finally undo the ways that racial inequality has continued to find value in our housing market.

Texto completo: After an off-season in which it seemed like the N.B.A. never took a break, The New York Times talked to a few of the league's stars about some of the other important things in their lives -- anything but basketball.
First is Jimmy Butler, the four-time All-Star who joined the Miami Heat this summer after a deep postseason run with the Philadelphia 76ers.
MIAMI -- The day before he won a gold medal with the United States men's basketball team at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Jimmy Butler tried a form of game preparation that was completely foreign. He watched the men's soccer final as a fan at Brazil's famed Maracanã stadium.
It was the first soccer match that Butler, then 26, had ever attended.
"I watched the greatest soccer player of all time win gold as well," Butler recalled. "You know who I'm talking about, right?"
As usual with the Miami Heat's ever-edgy Butler, there was little subtlety in his delivery. He was, of course, referring to the star forward Neymar, whose goal and subsequent clinching penalty kick in a shootout against Germany finally secured Brazil's first Olympic gold to go with its five World Cup crowns.
"He won gold in his own country, which is even better," Butler said. "It was the first time I really paid attention to it and he was killin' -- look at 10 go. And the crowd was just going nuts. I went that one time, and that was it."
What he means: That initial exposure to the 5-foot-9 Neymar da Silva Santos Jr. was enough to turn the 6-foot-8 Butler into Neymar's self-proclaimed biggest fan.
Upon Butler's return to the United States, it wasn't long before he started regularly wearing Neymar's club and national-team jerseys and posting pictures to Instagram. Friends say Butler, who turned 30 in September, also will routinely throw thank yous "for the gift of Neymar Jr." into the blessings he recites before meals.
Neymar said in an email that Butler's support was "very special to me" and added: "Jimmy has a big heart. Our friendship is based on sincerity and honesty. He is shy and at the same time, his fun side is what makes him different."
By the summer of 2018, Butler and Neymar were full-fledged pals, connecting through social media in what surely ranks as one of the most high-profile bromances in sports.
In August 2018, after his first season with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Butler went to France to watch Neymar play for Paris Saint-Germain. This June, Butler prepared for N.B.A. free agency by traveling to Rio to spend time with Neymar.
"Now we kick it every summer as much as we can," said Butler, who also was treated to a dose of Neymar on United States soil last month when Brazil played Colombia in Miami in an international friendly.
For much of Butler's N.B.A. career, one of his signature quirks was taking an American football with him to throw around in his spare time wherever he went. Butler, in 2016, elicited incessant ribbing from his Olympic teammates in Brazil for repeatedly insisting -- loudly -- that he was an N.F.L.-caliber wide receiver.
But after Neymar introduced him to the racket sport padel, Butler adopted it as his new conditioning hobby. Now he travels with a professional padel bag loaded with rackets and plays frequently with James Scott, his personal performance coach.

Butler is the first to admit that pastimes such as padel and watching soccer weren't "in the cards for me at all." Growing up in the Houston suburb of Tomball, Texas, he never kicked a soccer ball.
"Nope," Butler said. "Only kicked a basketball when I got" angry.
But Butler has done a lot of changing since his arrival in the N.B.A. as the 30th overall pick of the Chicago Bulls in 2011. He blossomed into a four-time All-Star with a reputation as a hypercompetitive and demanding teammate, unafraid to also challenge coaches, team executives, whomever. In an interview with Yahoo Sports last season, Butler acknowledged that he could rightly be described as "confrontational." He has also described himself as "a little extra at times."
None of that, though, has prevented him from bonding with some of world soccer's elite. In addition to Neymar, Butler enjoys a budding friendship with the mercurial Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba -- whom he met over FaceTime in July after a chance introduction to Pogba's mother, Yeo, in Senegal.
While Butler was on a trip to Senegal to visit the family of the Philadelphia 76ers' player-development coach, Remy Ndiaye, Yeo Pogba spotted him in a hotel lobby and arranged for the basketball star to speak to her son. Within a month -- while spending six weeks of his off-season in London to help feed another one of his passions, international travel -- Butler made a trip to Old Trafford on Aug. 11 to watch Pogba and Manchester United rout Chelsea, 4-0, in the English Premier League.
"I'm Neymar to the death of me, and I'm Paul Pogba to the death of me," Butler said.
The sudden manifestation of Butler's soccer fandom has earned him some further needling from fellow players -- especially since he wasn't lured to the game through the much more common route for N.B.A. players: playing Electronic Arts's popular FIFA video game series.
One example: Miami's veteran guard Goran Dragic, much more seasoned as a soccer-watcher after growing up in Slovenia, doesn't hesitate to challenge Butler's frequent "Neymar is the G.O.A.T" proclamations by telling him Lionel Messi is the smarter choice for the greatest of all time.
But Butler makes it clear that he is serious about his soccer -- no matter what anyone thinks. When a reporter sought to Americanize the conversation by asking which of Neymar's "jerseys" he owns, Butler offered a stern rebuke.
"They're called 'shirts,' by the way," Butler said. "Not 'jerseys.' You sound like a rookie."
As he prepares to begin his new work life with the Heat, Butler is pushing back harder against those around the N.B.A. who have criticized him for how much he has changed from his early days in the league. Back then, he was known as a coach-pleaser who liked to accentuate his Texas roots by wearing cowboy boots and oversize belt buckles, and listening to country music.
"I like it," Butler said of the knock that he has changed too much. "I am different. I've picked up a lot of different hobbies. I don't want to stay the same.
"I do what makes me happy. Some people just don't like it. Some people just don't want people to be happy."
And some people, like Butler, think it is perfectly reasonable to sit on a balcony in Rio days before committing to join the Heat, sketching a green No. 10 inside a yellow square and then announcing to the world in an Instagram video that he's "drawing pictures of goats."
"I just saw him that first time and I was like, damn, damn, he's tough," Butler said. "Ever since then, he's my friend, and I'm a fan."

Maryland Fights Clean Water Rollback

Texto completo: The Environmental Protection Agency revoked two regulations last month dealing with clean water and air that present conflicting positions from the Trump Administration over the role states should play in protecting their own natural resources.
The first came in the removal of an Obama-era rule that sought to protect streams, lakes, wetlands and other bodies of water from pollution, a move state officials say threatens the Chesapeake Bay.
"(The Trump Administration's) determination to weaken the Clean Water Act threatens to undo our hard-won progress cleaning up (waterways) in Maryland and across the nation," Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement. "We plan to vigorously challenge this latest unlawful rollback."
The 2015 Clean Water Rule expanded the definition of "navigable" bodies of water that fall under federal jurisdiction. It was a decision that Trump EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler called "an egregious power grab" at a Sept. 12 press conference announcing the repeal.
"When President Trump took office he immediately set into motion a process to remove and replace regulations that were stifling economic development," he said. "The Obama administration's 2015 'Waters of the U.S.' definition was at the top of the list."
A replacement to the rule has not yet been announced.
Under the Clean Water Act, it is illegal to pollute in U.S. bodies of water without a permit. Under the 2015 rule, the Obama administration, working in collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers, adopted the new rule to clarify which waterways were defined as federal, a change that impacted about three percent of the country's waters.
For farming and ranching advocates, however, the rule was a burdensome overreach that significantly raised the legal risks of pollution. According to the American Farm Bureau, the 2015 definition of "waters of the United States" made it unclear whether extremely minor bodies of water like ditches or streams could be subject to federal enforcement.
"We're all supportive of water quality," said Don Parrish, AFB senior director of congressional relations. "But farmers deserve clarity."
Environmental advocates say the rollback won't have a major impact within Maryland, as the state has stronger water protections than the federal government to begin with. However, pollution could migrate from states like Delaware and West Virginia that follow federal regulations, according to Maryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles.
"The loss of a federal safety net for wetlands and waters upstream of us will threaten our Chesapeake Bay progress," Grumbles said in a statement.
A preliminary analysis of the impacts of revoking the Obama rule completed by the Maryland Department of the Environment showed that up to 2.3 million pounds of nitrogen and 57,000 pounds of phosphorus could enter the Chesapeake Bay.
According to Jon Mueller, the vice president for litigation at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, cooperative state efforts like preventing pollution in the Bay necessitate strong federal protections in states with less stringent water quality rules.
"Even if you have strong state laws, you can only protect things within your state for the most part," Mueller said.
Mueller added that EPA regulations create a baseline floor for protection in most states, and "when that floor moves lower, the protections in those states that follow federal law are removed."
Both the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection denounced the rollback, citing water quality concerns.
The EPA noted that expanding federal jurisdiction over clean water "failed to adequately recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of states to manage their own land and water resources."
But the following week, the EPA revoked a rule that seemingly contradicts this stance. On Sept. 17, the EPA moved to take away California's authority to set its own emission standards, which 13 other states, including Maryland, follow.
Frosh subsequently joined 25 other attorneys general in a lawsuit challenging the administration, arguing that the new regulation "fails to respect states' authority to protect public health and welfare."
Wheeler said at a press conference that the administration would be moving forward with a new national fuel economy and greenhouse emission standard for cars.
"We embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation," he said.
The Trump Administration has scaled back more than 50 environmental regulations since the president took office, according to The New York Times. Dozens more rollbacks are in the works.
The EPA is considering a change to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a provision that allows individual states to block construction of interstate projects like pipelines or dams that damage water quality. Maryland has opposed construction of the Potomac Pipeline, which would bring natural gas to West Virginia from Pennsylvania and cross through Maryland public land.
Environmentalists say the proposed adjustment, which is under a public comment period, limits the time states have to assess projects for potential impacts.
"It's not being done with the public's interest in mind, it's not being done with the states' interest in mind," said Anne Havemann, general counsel for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. "It's directly rolling back what the states want to do and are trying to do."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That’s great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
A Marist poll asked voters whether “the economy is working well for you personally.” Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64% of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68% of whites, and 61% of nonwhite people. So do Americans of every generation: 63% of Generation Z and millennials; 69% of Generation X; 63% of baby boomers; and 69% of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters. So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60% in the West, 65% in the Northeast, 67% in the Midwest, and 68% in the South. So do most voters in every type of American community: 63% of both big and small city voters; 64% of small-town voters; 66% of rural voters; and 72% of suburban voters. Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59%), Democratic women (55%) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55%). So, when Warren declares that President Trump is “part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else,” it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And the New York Times reported in May that “over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases.” Americans don’t just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday’s debate.
This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on earth would Americans rally to her call for “big structural change” to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and — whether she admits it or not — would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren’s proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. “Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion,” Riedl says. And that’s before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports. There’s no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren’s wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren so hard at Tuesday’s debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump’s policies but don’t like Trump. They can’t do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will “repeal the filibuster,” she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump’s message — “whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me” — will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

Media meltdowns and political polarization: Joel Kotkin

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

A decir de la publicación, ‘El Chapito’ habría sido detenido inicialmente pero pudo escapar según fuentes pues un grupo de sicarios superó a las fuerzas militares mexicanas.

‘Una vez libre, el hermano mayor orquestó una asombrosa muestra de fuerza para conseguir la liberación de su hermano, Ovidio’, se lee en la nota en del New York Times en inglés.
‘La acción no sólo consistió en tomar como rehenes a los soldados, sino en secuestrar a sus familias, de acuerdo con las dos personas informadas sobre el asunto, quienes no estaban autorizadas a hablar públicamente’, señaló el periódico.
Según versiones que circularon el día de lo ocurrido pero que no han sido desmentidas ni confirmadas por autoridades, sicarios del Cártel de Sinaloa tenían la orden de asesinar a familiares de elementos castrenses, de los cuales habían obtenido direcciones en caso de que no se llegara a ningún acuerdo para la liberación del hijo de ‘ El Chapo ‘ Guzmán .
Y aunque dichas versiones no han sido confirmadas, basta con recordar las declaraciones del propio presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador ( AMLO ) quien aseguró que respalda a quienes tomaron la decisión de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López pues estaban en riesgo las vidas de muchos seres humanos, ‘porque no se trata de masacres pues eso ya se terminó’.
Recordemos que el pasado 17 de junio, Ovidio Guzmán , alias ‘ El Ratón ‘, fue detenido por autoridades federales en la capital de Sinaloa, Culiacán, lo que provocó una serie de balaceras y hechos violentos donde se reportó un saldo de 8 muertos, 16 heridos y 51 reos prófugos.

Dems debate, Trump's acts on Turkey and impeachment heats up: The week in politics news

Texto completo: Advancements in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump were made, a week of tension over the Turkey-Syria conflict resulted in a deal and the Democrats faced off yet again on the debate stage.
All of this and more happened in one busy week for U. S. politics. Each news update threatened to eclipse the last, making it tough to keep track of it all.
We rounded up the biggest news of the week:
Updates on the impeachment inquiry
House Democrats heard testimony from more witnesses about their knowledge of Trump's relationship with Ukraine. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, told House lawmakers that he was disappointed he had to consult with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine policy.
"Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings," Sondland said.
Also this week, former Russia adviser Fiona Hill testified and Energy Secretary Rick Perry resigned right before his subpoena deadline.

Turkey and the U. S. negotiate a deal to pause Syria invasion
Vice President Mike Pence announced on Thursday that the U. S. and Turkey had come to an agreement for a five-day pause in Turkey's attack in Syria, allowing longtime U. S. allies the Kurds to withdraw from the region.
Also in Turkey news this week, the House passed a resolution opposing Trump's decision to pull out of northern Syria by an overwhelming majority. And, Democratic leaders in Congress dramatically walked out of a meeting with Trump over Turkey.
This all came after Trump had announced early in the week he signed an executive order authorizing sanctions be placed on Turkey. Pence said those would be lifted if Turkey complies with a permanent ceasefire.

President's chief of staff stuns at press conference
For the first time, the White House acknowledged that Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate potential corruption in U. S. politics was part of the decision to delay military aid funding.
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said at a press conference "We do that all the time with foreign policy" when asked about a quid pro quo.
But Mulvaney later walked back those comments, saying the media had spun them and that there was never a tie between the aid and the request for an investigation.
At the same press briefing, Mulvaney broke the news that the administration chose Trump's Miami-area resort as the site of the next G-7 summit where world leaders convene.

12 Democrats face off in the 4th presidential debate
Yes, the fourth Democratic primary debate happened this week; so much has happened since that it feels longer ago. The focus of rivals' attacks seemed to shift from former Vice President Joe Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has recently climbed in the polls. She was grilled on her Medicare for All and weather her "wealth tax" plans.
Tuesday was also the first time businessman and billionaire Tom Steyer qualified to take the debate stage, and everyone seemed to hone in on his interesting tie selection.
In no surprise, impeachment and Biden's role in Ukraine were first up in questions from moderators, and Biden tried to put the focus on Trump's corruption instead.
And, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is set to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders at a rally this weekend.

Congressional legend Elijah Cummings dies
Washington was rocked by the unexpected death early Thursday of Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, who was 68 years old.
He served in the House of Representatives since 1996 and took on the role of chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee in January.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that, "In the House, Elijah was our North Star. He was a leader of towering character and integrity, whose stirring voice and steadfast values pushed the Congress and country to rise always to a higher purpose. "
"He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation’s diversity was our promise, not our problem. It has been an honor to walk by his side on this incredible journey. I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly," said his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who is chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party.

Texto completo: Our national security is in peril
“All roads with you lead to Putin” said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, confronting President Donald Trump at a recent White House meeting.
Indeed.
Who does the president profess to believe when asked if Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections? Not the unanimous conclusion of his own intelligence agencies, but Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Who is the beneficiary of Trump’s frequent attacks on our European allies? Who benefits when the U.S. withholds money needed for Ukraine’s defense against Russia to try to force a desperate country to create a false narrative about his Democratic opponent? Who gains ground in Syria and Turkey when Trump abandons the Kurds, our allies in Syria, to slaughter? Who gets access to the 30 or so U.S. nuclear weapons still in Turkey?
Vladimir Putin does.
Putin is a former KGB spy who has journalists and his own people murdered to maintain his hold on the Russian narrative and his and the Russian oligarchy’s money and power. This is the man that our president would, and may yet, try to emulate.
Before the election in 2016 there was near universal agreement in this country that Russia must be contained on the world stage. Have we all lost our minds now?
I hope the Republicans will understand that our national security is being imperiled and that unacceptable precedents are being established. They must speak out and condemn President Trump’s actions in support of Putin.

It’s hard to change beliefs that are strongly held
I believe that character, competence, discipline and stability are important requisites for the presidency of the United States. These transcend political beliefs. By these measures, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president. He is simply unable to get beyond his own ego and narcissism.
He has little curiosity and has admitted that he does little to no reading. He does not have the patience to learn about the complexities of governing, believing that his gut instincts will be adequate for the job, no matter how difficult the problem. Simple answers to complex problems is not a sound leadership attribute and ultimately can lead to disastrous results.
He was elected by people who feel left behind, and in many respects their grievances are legitimate. He was elected by people who feel the nation has been moving too far to the left, and there are some legitimate arguments for that view. However, they did not understand nor take into consideration the basic character of the man. He often displays a deep ignorance of how our system works and, more important, an ignorance of the shared values of our society. And his erratic behavior is creating, almost daily, anxiety within the nation and around the world.
However, for his supporters to change their strongly held belief in him would be pretty tough. It is now known that, for nearly everyone, the ability to receive and accept contrary information about a strongly held belief most often results in a strengthening of that belief. The reason is that to admit to error is pretty hard for anyone to do.

Tulsi Gabbard ready to serve as commander in chief
As an independent voter, I forced myself to watch the fourth Democratic “debate.” Unfortunately, there wasn’t much of a debate. The forum is lousy to begin with, and it was really a promotion piece for “Hillary 2.0” — U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The program was so lousy and slanted that one of my avid Trump supporter friends called from Utah and asked if I was watching this crap. He was very concerned that U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and others were being ignored.
My candidate, Gabbard, had considered boycotting the debate as both CNN and The New York Times (the debate hosts) had published disparaging articles about her in the days before. With Gabbard getting about 6 minutes of airtime and Elizabeth Warren getting 24, I guess we know who the Democratic National Committee, CNN and The New York Times have anointed as their presidential candidate.
Some will say that Gabbard and other “second tier” candidates aren’t polling well. I don’t know how you can possibly get a poll in this day and age. My wife and I have gotten to the point that, if our phone doesn’t recognize the incoming number, we are not answering. Even then if we recognize the number, there is a good chance it is not who we assume it is. It’s pretty much the same with email.
I will continue to support Gabbard as she is the only candidate who has voter appeal from Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Libertarians, etc. She is 38 years old and has served 16 years in the military (she missed the third debate as she was tied up serving her two weeks duty in Indonesia), including two combat tours in the Middle East. In her seven years as a representative for Hawaii, she has served on several committees that give her the best experience to assume the position of commander in chief on Day One.
I urge anyone not familiar with Tulsi Gabbard to go to her website, tulsi2020.com, and check her out.

Texto completo: The acting chief of staff's admission changes everything.
John Maynard Keynes may not have been the one who said, "When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?" But the line, often attributed to him, remains a good one. And it captures my shifting view of the impeachment inquiry.
That view shifted again this week with Mick Mulvaney's hallucinatory press conference on Thursday, in which he appeared to admit a version of the quid pro quo the president and his minions have spent the past few weeks fervently denying. "Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server?" the acting chief of staff said of the president. "Absolutely. No question about that."
He added: "That's why we held up the money."
Mulvaney clarified his comments -- which is to say, contradicted himself -- a few hours later, insisting in a carefully scripted statement, "There never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the D.N.C. server." For this, he offered as proof "the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server."
True. Except, as everyone knows, the money was released only after several infuriated lawmakers, including Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, pushed the administration to deliver the aid without ever being told the real story of why it had been delayed in the first place.
In other words, a White House that initially insisted it had nothing to hide was, in fact, hiding something. It then claimed that it didn't intend to do what it clearly intended to do, based on the fact that it didn't get away with doing it. Next, it compounded the prevarication by admitting to its intentions, and insisting there was nothing wrong with them. And, finally, it reverted to denying those intentions altogether.
What kind of fool is Mulvaney, to take the rest of us for such fools?
Mulvaney's Inspector Clouseau routine follows a week of disclosures about the extent to which U.S. policy toward Ukraine became the province of Rudy Giuliani to the exclusion of the State Department and National Security Council. Giuliani, in turn, was paid $ 500,000 by the company of a shady business associate who was helping him dig for political dirt in Ukraine. That associate and his partner were recently pulled from a flight on one-way tickets and arrested on charges of campaign-finance violations connected to the ouster of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. No wonder John Bolton described this shadow foreign policy as a "drug deal."
Donald Trump's inveterate defenders insist that the president is entitled to conduct foreign policy any way he wants, and delegate authority to whomever he pleases. That just isn't true.
No president has the right, ever, to use the powers of his office to enrich himself, which is what Trump appears to be doing by designating his Florida golf resort as the site of the next G7 meeting. No president has the automatic right to impound congressionally appropriated funds, above all for nakedly political ends. No president may delegate foreign policy to anyone who abuses that trust for personal profit. No president should derail the career of a foreign-service officer because she would not violate the trust of her office to enable his political vendettas.
And no president should lie so wantonly about his public conduct or enlist the officers of government in the concealment of that conduct. This has been the story of the Trump administration from its first day.
For Democrats, the question is whether impeachment is the right response to indisputably outrageous acts. I've previously been skeptical for several reasons, not least that a party-line vote in the House would simultaneously diminish the stigma of impeachment while boosting the president's re-election chances. And I was particularly skeptical if the entire case against Trump rested on that one phone call.
Now it's clear that it doesn't. Whatever the political calculus, the impeachment inquiry needs to press on, aggressively.
As for Republicans, a question they might usefully ask themselves is whether the standard of behavior they now either accept or embrace in this president is one they are prepared to condone in a Democratic administration. All of their casuistry in Trump's defense today may, and probably will, be used against them in the future. The wretched bargain that partisans inevitably make with demagogues on their side is that they inspire, and license, the demagoguery of the other.
A suggestion for Nancy Pelosi: Offer the House a vote on censure, neither as a substitute for the impeachment inquiry nor for impeachment itself, but as an opportunity for members to go on record as to how they judge the president. It would give at least a few Republicans, for whom an impeachment vote is a political bridge too far, an opportunity to save a piece of their souls. History will judge the rest.

Brexit deal faces big hurdle in Parliament

Texto completo: BRUSSELS - Britain and the European Union agreed on a Brexit deal Thursday, setting the stage for a fateful showdown in the British Parliament, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces an uphill struggle to marshal enough votes for his plan after three years of anguished, politically corrosive debate.
However, Johnson, who has yet to win a vote in Parliament as prime minister, may win even if he loses. He can rightfully say he negotiated an agreement but that Parliament is to blame. He is then likely to call for a general election in the coming weeks, hoping to win a mandate to do what Britain's paralyzed political class has so far been unwilling to do: pull Britain out of the EU as swiftly as possible.
Britain's opposition Labour Party is determined to reject the agreement and defeat Johnson at the polls, and others are hoping to force a second referendum that could reverse Brexit altogether.
"If Johnson gets the deal through Parliament, this is the end of the beginning," said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford University. "If he does not, Parliament with luck comes up with another way forward. It's a fork in the road, but it's hardly the end of the road."
Northern Ireland's influential Democratic Unionist Party refused to support the deal, saying it would cleave Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and hurt its economy. The party's rebellion deprived Johnson of his most obvious path to a majority.
Johnson, who called a special session of Parliament for Saturday, appears to be betting that he can cobble together enough votes from other lawmakers who are fed up with the endless wrangling over Brexit and may view this deal, however imperfect, as better than any alternative.
It is a breathtaking gamble by a buccaneering leader who has already upended Britain's political establishment in his quest to take Britain ou: of the EU - shutting down Parliament for several weeks, purging rebels in his Conservative Party and drawing a rare rebuke from Britain's Supreme Court
"This is Boris Johnson's moment of maximum vulnerability," said Anand Menon, a professor of European affairs a: King's College London. "He is vulnerable to criticism of the deal, and he is vulnerable to criticisms for not having left the EU."
Johnson's predecessor as prime minister, Theresa May, made a similar bet by calling an early election in 2017. She fared poorly and ended up in a minority government propped up by the Democratic Unionists, severely limiting her room to maneuver on Brexit.
On Thursday, Johnson basked in the approval of the 27 other EU leaders, who gathered in Brussels for a two-day summit meeting to endorse the deal. That was less surprising than it seemed, given the significant concessions that Britain made in days of frantic negotiations, mainly over how to treat Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the agreement, Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, would remain legally part of its customs territory. But it would stay closely aligned with a maze of European rules and regulations, and there would be customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland. This would allow seamless trading to continue with Ireland, a member of the EU.
"I'm happy about the deal, but I'm sad about Brexit," said the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, appearing alongside Johnson at a news conference.
An ebullient Johnson said: "This deal represents a very good deal both for the EU and for the U.K. And it's a reasonable, fair outcome."
In terms of its potential negative impact on Britain's economy, analysts said Johnson's plan was not that different from a so-called no-deal Brexit, which he has repeatedly vowed to pursue if he could not reach an agreement.
The Johnson plan would reduce income per capita in Britain by an estimated 2.5%, relative to staying in the EU, according to U.K. in a Changing Europe, a research group that tracks Brexit issues. That compares to a 3.3% reduction if Britain left without any deal.
Leaving Europe without a deal, of course, would entail other potential dangers, including disruptions to trade, shortages of medicine, and unrest in Northern Ireland, not to mention a legacy of animosity with Europe.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Lizzo's breakthrough tune, "Truth Hurts," which spent six weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart this year, features the signature line: "I just took a DNA test/ Turns out I'm 100 percent that b----." The lyric originated from a 2017 tweet by singer Mina Lioness and was turned into a meme, which was then used in Lizzo's song "Healthy," created in 2017.
The songwriting brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who worked on "Healthy," claim say they deserve writing credit on "Truth Hurts" since the song borrows from "Healthy," a tune they co-wrote.
The songwriters credited on "Truth Hurts" are Lizzo, Ricky Reed, Tele and Jesse Saint John. "Truth Hurts" was originally released in September 2017 and got a boost this year after it was featured in the Netflix film "Someone Great."
"After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo's team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out," Justin Raisen wrote Tuesday on Instagram. "We've tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years ... but were shut down every time."
Lizzo's lawyer Cynthia Arato said in a statement: "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
The New York Times reported that the Raisens rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobalt.
"The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo's momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand," Justin Raisen wrote.

Ousted: Country music singer Gretchen Wilson, whose hit song, "Here for the Party," features the lyrics, "And I ain't leaving till they throw me out," was ousted from a New Mexico hotel last weekend over noise complaints. A Las Cruces police spokesman said Wilson, 46, and other guests had "worn out their welcome" at the Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces and they helped security remove them. The musician tweeted the hotel asked her to leave "in the middle of the night for no reason." She also called on Twitter followers to "band together to put Hotel Encanto out of business."
Podcastland: TV powerhouse Shonda Rhimes ("Grey's Anatomy," "Scandal") is moving aggressively into the burgeoning podcast world, inking a three-year deal between her company, Shondaland, and iHeartMedia. In a statement, Rhimes said she welcomed the opportunity to expand Shondaland's storytelling into the growing medium, which she praised for a unique sense of boldness and intimacy.
Homicide update: Former "Tarzan" actor Ron Ely's wife, Valerie Lundeen Ely, 62, was stabbed to death in their California home by their 30-year-old son, Cameron Ely, who was then shot and killed by sheriff's deputies, authorities said. Ron Ely, 81, played the title character on the NBC series "Tarzan" from 1966 to 1968.

Patchett's latest, 'The Dutch House' New York Times-bestselling author Ann Patchett's work has long been loved by readers and lauded by critics. Her latest novel, "The Dutch House," is no exception. Spanning several decades, it is the story of a house and the family who lives there. Intriguingly, "The Dutch House" has elements of the fairy tale, not least in its theme of motherless children being raised by their father with the help of a trusted servant. Add to this an unsympathetic stepmother and stepsisters, a mansion that "seems to float several inches above the hill it sat upon," and we have an engrossing story that is more incisive and elegant than this list of fanciful elements might at first suggest.
Near the end of the Second World War, Cyril Connolly surprises his wife, Elna, with a luxurious estate outside Philadelphia. The house is a symbol of the Conroy family's swift upward mobility, and comes fully furnished, down to the austere portraits of the prior owners, a Dutch family named VanHoebeek. Elna's reaction is unexpected: The grandeur of the house unnerves her (as does her family's newfound wealth). Her physical and emotional aversion to the house — she grows thin and pale, becoming "a ghost" — leads her, when her children, Danny and Maeve, are 3 and 10 years old, to escape the house and her family.
Patchett's gift for forging emotional intimacy between a novel's characters and its readers is evident in "The Dutch House." She does this artfully, in part through specificity of detail, skillful scene-setting, and deeply honest writing, but it's her compassion for the people she writes about that ultimately wins me over.
"The Dutch House" grapples with issues of memory and truth: is what Danny and Maeve recall as adults about their childhood happen as they remember it, or is it myth? Can we forgive today while remaining in thrall to the stories we've created about our past? Patchett suggests that these questions are as relevant to us as they are to her characters. "The Dutch House" is gorgeously written and constructed, and as generous as it is compelling.
Join us as Ann Patchett presents "The Dutch House" on at noon Oct. 26, at Jubilee! Community Church in downtown Asheville. Tickets are $32.50 and include a signed copy of the book and refreshments, starting at 11 a.m. Tickets may be purchased at malaprops.com.

NC moonshine In the 1650s, English Colonists brought the necessary accoutrements for distilling grains and fruits to the Albemarle Sound in what would later become North Carolina. Fast-forward to 1958, and the state had developed a storied reputation as "one of the top producers of illegal alcohol in the United States."
In "Tar Heel Lightnin': How Secret Stills and Fast Cars Made North Carolina the Moonshine Capital of the World," Daniel S. Pierce provides an overview of the history of moonshine production and distribution in the state between European settlement of the U.S. and today. His cast of characters is diverse: the moonshine business crossed gender, racial, class, religious and political lines.
After the Civil War, moonshine districts sprang up throughout the state as reformers, federal agents, and state and local law enforcement tried to disrupt, tax, and suppress the moonshine business. Illegal distilleries dotted the state. Violence haunted the trade like lingering shadows on the edges of the fires burning under stills. The tension made people jumpy. It wasn't unusual for newspapers to report on a shootout, like the one that happened in 1881 in Swain County when revenue agents captured the moonshine outlaw Lewis Redmond.
Popular culture reflected the elements of the moonshine trade: wealthy kingpins, gun-toting women, and banjo-playing singers appear in the ballads and legends of the Tar Heel State's history. Pierce has assembled them in a book that contains fascinating photos and stories of the people who evaded the law or colluded with it to make money. Consumer demand rarely dried up, and neither did the attempts to shut down the moonshine syndicate that depended on hot rods--or "booze buggies"--to transport the goods.
Pierce blends humor and admiration to link the moonshine state to the origins of NASCAR and the name of the soft drink Mountain Dew. Even television star Andy Griffith of Mayberry, R.F.D fame makes several appearances in the book. "Tar Heel Lightnin'" provides a rollicking history of illegal liquor in North Carolina that both informs and entertains.
Join Daniel S. Pierce as he presents his book, "Tar Heel Lightnin': How Secret Stills and Fast Cars Made North Carolina the Moonshine Capital of the World," at 6 p.m. Oct. 23, at 6pm, at Malaprop's Bookstore/Café.

Texto completo: I keep a file folder on my computer called "like/dislike," where I place reader email with praise and criticism of the Orlando Sentinel. I also add notes with my own thoughts, which I use to write my quarterly column giving thumbs up and thumbs down.
Last week's column included my views, so this week, I turn it (mostly) over to you.
So here goes; quotes are from reader emails:
Thumbs up to "all the Sentinel's investigative pieces local, state and national reporting."
Thumbs down for publishing a New York Times Crossword on Oct. 6 where the clues didn't make the grid. (I mentioned another thumbs down last week that many readers noted as well, a headline that labeled UCF as UFC.)
Several readers gave us a thumbs up for adding a How Congress Voted feature, which appears online Mondays and in print on Tuesdays - "Thank you all for your service in keeping Democracy alive."
I continue to get thumbs down from readers about delivery of the print newspaper, including many when Hurricane Dorian disrupted our delivery in September. (Note: People email me, but that's not always the fastest way to get circulation help. You should contact the Orlando Sentinel Customer Service Center at 407-420-5353. If you do email me, I pass it along to customer service managers in Orlando.)
Lauren Ritchie's column on Seminole Tax Collector Joel Greenberg drew several thumbs up, and one or two thumbs down. (I take columnist privilege here and give us a big thumbs up for doing what real newspapers do - devoting space to people who disagree with us. In this case, Greenberg wrote a guest column with his pointed comments about the column.)
The impeachment inquiry prompted more than the usual hate mail from readers about coverage of President Donald Trump. The volume is high, but often they come from the same small set of people.
I've stopped responding to a few - that includes the guy who enjoys addressing me as "Mr. Trusted and Balanced" and the one who slides in what I assume he thinks are funny sexual double entendres. (Note: They are not.)
But a thumbs up to those who do offer thoughtful criticism of Trump coverage without the insults, as many did about the media's - including our own - poor handling of a new but thinly supported allegation of sexual misconduct about Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Some more thumbs up you sent:
* To food reporter Amy Drew Thompson for being "an original stylist whose love for food drips off the page. A new star."
* For our ongoing coverage of problems with the board that oversees the Orlando International Airport: "This is why Orlando 'must' have journalists. Dig deeper, "60 Minutes"-wise. (Without) the Orlando Sentinel this story would go untold."
* Our Hurricane Dorian coverage: "Please thank your Orlando Sentinel team for a great job of keeping us informed during Dorian!"
With the good comes the bad, including these thumbs down from you:
* Complaints that our early print deadlines on Saturday (about 9:30 p.m.) mean readers in print miss some college game stories.
* Questions about why we published a photo with a boy giving the finger to the camera and a syndicated article on the HBO show "Silicon Valley" that included the word "bull----." Both violate our standards.
* An e-newspaper article about how to "winterize" your home.
* Lack of coverage of counties outside our core market, like Sumter and Brevard.
Keep them coming. I will gather more between now and end of the year, so email me at the address below.
That fake Trump attack video: I work for a company where four journalists and a media sales assistant were murdered in June 2018. They were Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters, who worked at the Capital Gazette in Maryland.
Please read their names, Google their lives, see their faces in photos.
Then imagine how vile you have to be to make a video showing a fake President Donald Trump massacring the media and political opponents.
As our editorial said, "Trump didn't tell someone to make this video. He didn't have to. His unceasing attacks on anyone who crosses him have granted soft permission for Americans to act on their worst impulses. When they do, the president makes a few perfunctory, half-hearted remarks, then returns to the attack mode that amuses and entertains so many of his supporters."
A thumbs up to that editorial.

Playing the long game

Texto completo: By most accounts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had a great debate Tuesday night. So did Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
But unlike Klobuchar and virtually all other Democratic presidential candidates, Buttigieg has built out a campaign infrastructure that could, in theory, help him sustain momentum from his highly praised performance.
Buttigieg has a large campaign presence in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire so he could quickly translate his star turn into something more tangible and lasting.
In raw terms, this means that Buttigieg has the money, the staff, the data, and the endorsements to rapidly expand his reach.
He had $23.4 million in the bank at the end of last month, more than twice what Biden did. He has hundreds of people on staff.
The 37-year-old's campaign offices have lists of potential supporters to reach out to, and can ask them to show up and make calls to other voters.
Klobuchar, by way of comparison, doesn't have any of this. It means whatever momentum she has could be fleeting.
Bolstered by his success in fund-raising in the first half of the year, Buttigieg spent the summer building out a campaign infrastructure.
In New Hampshire, for example, Buttigieg has 13 offices, more than any other campaign. (Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second with 10 offices.) In those Buttigieg offices, there are 64 staff members, with 57 of them slotted for direct voter contact, according to the campaign. A few campaigns have more staff on the ground in the state, but they tend to be in roles that are not in direct contact with voters.
Buttigieg also has the highest number of offices in Iowa, 22, again slightly edging out Warren, according to a recent New York Times analysis. Buttigieg's campaign says it has more than 100 staffers on the ground there. It has also been running television ads in the Hawkeye State for a month.
There is a reason why all of this matters.
History has shown that while it is easy for candidates to have “a moment," it is very hard for them to sustain the moment. In 2008 and 2012, Republicans Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum may have won the Iowa Caucuses, but they didn't have anything to help them in the following states to keep it going. This is where the spade work in the early primary states can help the most.
Just consider Senator Kamala Harris of California. She was riding high after her June debate performance. Polls quickly found her to be a top-tier candidate.
But Harris spent considerably less time in Iowa and New Hampshire than other major candidates and made building out her infrastructure, staff, and endorsements less of a priority. Within a month, she was fading.
As it stands, there are 19 Democratic presidential candidates running for president. On the ground in the early states, just a few candidates have built an infrastructure able to capitalize on any momentum. And among that group, no candidate is better built as a “growth stock" than Buttigieg, who has sat just outside of the top tier of candidates, including Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Tuesday's debate marks the second burst of momentum for Buttigieg. In March, he came out of obscurity during a CNN town hall in Texas where he attacked Vice President Mike Pence's views on homosexuality. Following that performance, Buttigieg was a hot ticket on the campaign trail, but his staff didn't yet have the capacity to grab personal data from the crowds swarming his events.
This time around, it's different. Buttigieg needs to find a way to get into the top tier and improve his standing among female voters and people of color. It's unclear if Team Buttigieg can pull that off. But they are uniquely set up to give it a shot.

Hunting for answers at a D.C. rally: Why would these women back Trump?

Texto completo: The women at the foot of the U.S. Capitol wore a smattering of red Make America Great Again hats.
Herds of school kids passing by, in their matching field-trip T-shirts, threatened to outnumber the few hundred or so rallygoers, described by one blogger as an "ocean of MAGA caps."
The March for Trump, organized by Women for Trump, was more like a puddle.
But I wanted to mingle with these folks.
I wanted to hear from the women waving the big pink "Women for Trump" flags or wearing the "Women for Trump" hats. They are the WFTs. And though others may assemble those three letters differently when describing their movement, I wanted to hear why they remain die-hards in a dwindling minority.
Because there was no denying it - the crowd was tiny. I've covered 20 years of marches in Washington - from the World Bank protests at the turn of the century to 2017's ocean-of-pink Women's March - and this gathering was barely there.
Brittany Sechrist, 30, a stay-at-home mom, had traveled from Lebanon County, Pa., to support President Trump.
"I like what he's doing," Sechrist said. She's been to other Trump rallies, but this one was important to her because she wants to stop the impeachment process.
I asked her why women should get behind Trump.
"Oh, for many, many reasons," she said.
And that was about all I could get.
But why?
I asked this again and again. I approached the women with the big signs and hats and goofy American-flag sunglasses. I asked the women in plain coats and sensible shoes. I wanted to hear from them all. Why would they support a serial adulterer who bragged about grabbing women's genitals and has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women?
Many women can't stomach Trump. A July Quinnipiac poll found that only 34 percent of women overall approved of the job Trump is doing, compared with 61 percent who disapproved.
In a Washington Post-Schar School poll taken this month, the gender gap is also wide when in comes to impeachment, with 65 percent of women saying they are in favor of the inquiry, compared with 51 percent of men.
The women on the Capitol lawn approving of him, for the most part, didn't want to talk to me once I introduced myself as a columnist with The Post, which Trump calls the Amazon Washington Post in his disparaging tweets.
"Um, no thanks."
"I'm not interested."
"Are you kidding?"
Come on! I'm not even the "Failing New York Times."
The ones who would talk to me said the same things:
"I want him to know I am here for him."
"We are standing by him."
"He needs to know women are here."
Tammy Wynette lives on.
"This man does not have to do what he is doing," Amy Kremer, the organizer of the event, said when she took the podium. She said Trump could be living a life of luxury, traveling the world and golfing.
(Wait. Isn't that what he's doing? And we're the ones paying for it.)
As Kremer spoke, dozens of women whooped and cheered and hollered, clearly grateful that Trump has left his reality-TV show, his failed casinos, his failed university and all his bankruptcies to run the United States.
But why, specifically, is he good for American women, I wanted to know.
Was there a woman who believes the Equal Rights Amendment is an old idea that's no longer relevant? Or a woman who believes it was Melania Trump who brought family values and Christmas back to the White House? Or a military mom who is so glad funding for military child care will instead be used to build the wall?
Maybe, because we're face-to-face and not anonymous and online, I could get to the bottom of this.
But in most cases (except for Sechrist - thank you for your civility), when I asked the women they responded with an attack on the media or the elected officials running the impeachment inquiry. They didn't need online anonymity to make their judgments, even though most of them didn't want to give me their names.
Same with the speakers, who talked about the deep state, about conspiracy theories and - don't worry, they didn't forget - Hillary Clinton's emails.
Rep. Steven Scalise (R-La.), was greeted like a hero when he took the podium and speculated that Clinton's server could be "at the bottom of the Potomac."
Each of the speakers looked upon the small crowd and marveled at its spirit.
The rally's size, though?
"There would be a lot more of us here if that didn't happen," a woman who drove in from Chantilly, Va., told me.
What happened? A conspiracy, natch.
Organizers said bus companies across the nation canceled the buses hired to bring supporters to the nation's capital.
"We feel this was done intentionally and will be issuing a statement at a later time," Kremer said in a statement posted on the March for Trump's Facebook page.
From bus stations in Pennsylvania to a Walmart parking lot in North Carolina, Trump supporters said they were left in the cold and dark early Thursday, waiting for buses that didn't show up.
The president they think they have - a man who will unite our country and treat everyone with respect - he hasn't shown up, either.

Author Talks Klinghoffer Facts, Myths

Texto completo: Headnote BOOKS
ON OCT. 8, 1985, aboard the cruise ship Achille Lauro, Leon Klinghoffer was shot and killed by a man named Youssef Majed Molqi, who belonged to the Palestine Liberation Front. Shortly afterward, Molqi forced two crew members to dump his body - still in his wheelchair - over the side of the ship.
In the decades since, there have been substantial ripples created by the hijacking of the Achille Lauro by four young Palestinian men and the subsequent murder of Klinghoffer. Information and misinformation about the motivations of the hijackers and the rescuers have been warped by time, and legal precedents for individuals and countries that were created by the handling of the Klinghoffer family's pursuit of justice have consequences that affect cases to this day.
In the Fitts Auditorium at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law on Oct. 10, journalist Julie Salamon, author of a new book about the affair called An Innocent Bystander, discussed the Klinghoffer case with Sean Carter, a Cozen O'Connor lawyer focusing on commercial and mass tort litigation.
The conversation, moderated by Professor Claire O. Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law, was attended by a couple dozen people, many of them old enough to have firsthand memories of Klinghoffer's murder. The event was put on by CERL, of which Carter is board member.
"The cases and incidents affect not only the direct victim of terrorism, but everyone around them, and have effects for their entire lives," Xander Meise, a CERL fellow, said in her introduction. "Whether or not a case is successful does not dictate how one is affected by the events that took place."
Agrande esta imagen.

Salamon, a veteran journalist and writer of fiction whose work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The New Yorker, first decided to embark on this project in 2015. Salamon happened to attend the same synagogue as Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer's daughters, and she was among a group invited to a 30th anniversary commemoration event.
It was a "riveting" evening, Salamon said, and as a journalist, she could not help but think about how to tell a story that seemed to offer up something new every time she heard it.
"The human side of the story is what attracted me initially," she said, an inclination reflected by the way her book is written.
An Innocent Bystander is not a simple recapitulation of the events, with new information added and old myths dispelled (though there is plenty of that, including substantial evidence that the reason for Klinghoffer's selection was due to his American passport rather than his Judaism).
Rather, Salamon's book explores a wide range of characters involved in the saga, some well-known - Oliver North, for example, who explicitly wrote that he needed a "win" with the Achille Lauro to distract from the Iran-Contra affair - and others who history has forgotten. It tells the story of the whole Klinghoffer family, as well as that of Abu al-Abbas, the PLF leader who masterminded the attack, and the ripple effects for his family. No stone goes unturned, no question unasked.
One point Salamon stressed about the hijacking was the "Keystone Cops" nature of the planning, as she put it. The idea that four young men, none of them particularly well-trained, were going to hijack a massive cruise ship and steer it to Ashdod, was ludicrous. It was also in the original plan to start shooting Israelis indiscriminately. Only after news of the ship's hijacking got them barred from most ports of entry did the plan known to most of us get hatched: to exchange the hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
Carter's relationship to the events of the Achille Lauro are quite different from Salamon's.
His work is largely on cases involving claims under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act. In other words, he works on behalf of families and commercial entities looking for damages from foreign entities that brought harm to them or their families - state sponsors of terror, typically. It's a complicated web of overlapping jurisdictions, with the added factor of international diplomacy that can affect the U.S. government's willingness to allow such cases to be brought. The Achille Lauro, and the Klinghoffer family's attempts to sue the Palestinian Authority for damages inform his work at every step.
"Many of the same problems that arose in the context of the Klinghoffer's case," he said, continue to hold relevance.
A Q&A occurred after the discussion, followed by a reception and a book signing. *

Texto completo: The SEAL admiral who oversaw the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Ladin claimed the American republic is "under attack" from President Trump.
William H. McRaven, 63, published an op-ed in the New York Times on Thursday titled, "Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President," the sub-headline of which reads, "If President Trump doesn't demonstrate the leadership that America needs, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office."
McRaven begins the piece by discussing two recent military events he attended, which he said "reminded me why we care so very much about this nation and why our future may be in peril."
One of the events he referenced, the O.S.S. Society dinner, had "films and testimonials to the valor of the men and women who had fought in Europe and the Pacific during World War II. We also celebrated the 75th anniversary of D-Day."
McRaven added that the United States sacrificed "so much to fight Nazism and fascism," but later added that current service members "have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen."
The piece concluded, "And if this president doesn’t understand their importance, if this president doesn’t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office — Republican, Democrat or independent — the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it."

Texto completo: Google and other Big Tech companies are rushing to establish a new protocol, called DNS over HTTPS ("DoH"), that could open the internet floodgates to child pornography, drugs, malware and other illegal activity and enable perpetrators to hide behind new privacy shields.
As a retired child safety and cybercrimes police detective, I have dedicated my career to helping children by pursuing, apprehending and prosecuting child predators. I am urging Google and the other proponents of this plan to slow down, think this through and respond to questions from law enforcement and federal authorities about the dangers of this plan.
Parents do not need dangerous new gateways through which their children can be exposed to predators, pornography, cyberbullies, school violence and drug dealers.
Already, as a recent New York Times investigation found, tech companies have reported 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused this year — more than double what they found the previous year. And the number keeps growing. Now is not the time to make it even easier to spread this filth and hide behind Google’s shield.
Child-safety experts at the internet Watch Foundation (IWF) are warning the so-called privacy changes could have a "catastrophic impact" by exposing child victims to some of the worst practices on the internet.
As the IWF notes, Google’s plan would mean that criminals could soon have countless new ways to bypass safeguards that child safety groups, cybersecurity experts, internet service providers and government agencies have developed. These changes could allow child predators to directly interact with children and then disappear, leaving law enforcement no means to find the offenders.
Antitrust investigators with the House Judiciary Committee have also sent a letter to Google asking the company to address serious concerns about the plan.
Specifically, the plan causing so much concern involves the internet Domain Name System (DNS), which makes the web work by connecting websites to unique addresses on the internet. Thanks to the DNS, which is often called "the phone book of the internet," a user can type in a website name and end up exactly where they want to go.
But the change could hide user requests, strengthen encryption, enable criminals to bypass essential filters like parental controls and make abusive material freely accessible. This would come at the same time that online child-abuse groups are sharing images of ever younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. We cannot afford to give them new tools for hiding out.
Three specific questions need to be addressed: How will law enforcement be able to track online predators who collaborate through private email services and meet at a website to sexually exploit our children?
Will law enforcement still be able to track domestic terrorists such as school shooters who collaborate on certain websites they visit to obtain their information?
With millions of schools using Google Chromebooks, will this new protocol enable bypassing school filters such as Go Guardian and Securely that help keep our children safe?
In the pursuit of greater privacy, we must not jeopardize safety. We must fully evaluate the dangerous impact these changes could introduce. We must ensure that tech companies are implementing well-informed, responsible updates that strengthen, not diminish our children’s interaction with the online world.
Detective Richard Wistocki (Ret.) was a law enforcement officer for 30 years, including over two decades as an internet crimes investigator with the Naperville Police Department. As a cybercrimes detective and child safety proponent, he educates law enforcement, parents and students on responsible digital activity.

Texto completo: Syndicated Columnist
Washington
For Elizabeth Warren, the hard part begins now.
The Massachusetts senator is unquestionably the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, which made her the focal point of attacks from her rivals in Tuesday’s Democratic debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden had an easier time of it, but this was not good news for him. At various points in the three-hour marathon, he faded away. His rivals no longer see him as the person to beat.
Beneath the jostling for position lay an important policy subtext. Warren was plainly far more comfortable defending her broader economic positions, particularly her proposed wealth tax, than she was in standing up for “Medicare for All.” The wealth on tax goes to the heart of her candidacy’s purposes. Medicare for All appears to be a position she adopted — belatedly — to fend off Sen. Bernie Sanders and attacks from her left. Her continued success depends on how she handles this tension.
Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., underscored the ongoing significance of the battle for the party’s progressive wing by endorsing Sanders, who strengthened his hand with a solid performance. Their decisions defined the difficult political terrain Warren faces. Her rise depended on her ability, simultaneously, to pull left-wing Democrats away from Sanders while also gaining new support from more moderate progressives. She made it look effortless. It will be effortless no longer.
The debate also marked a reconfiguration at the other end of the party. While Biden remains near (and, in some polls, still at) the top of the field, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sense it’s now or never for them to replace Biden as the moderate alternative to Warren.
Biden had his moments on Tuesday, and he was especially passionate when the conversation turned to foreign policy and President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, abandoning the United States’ Kurdish allies. “This is shameful, shameful what this man has done,” Biden declared.
Nonetheless, it was Buttigieg especially, but also Klobuchar, who dominated the discussion on the party’s center-left. Up to now, Buttigieg has prospered as a refreshing new voice in the party, but struggled to break out of single digits. He was earning more acclaim than support. On Tuesday, he played to win.
He was scalding in challenging Warren’s refusal to say whether she would have to raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare for All. “Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,” Buttigieg said. “No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”
Buttigieg shrewdly defined his space: bolder than Biden (“bold” was one of his favorite words), but with more practical, do-able ideas than Warren, and more of an “outsider” than the congressional veterans on the stage. Klobuchar was also forceful — particularly in discussing the opioid crisis — blending moderation with family anecdotes that brought home her Minnesota roots. Still, both Midwesterners need Biden to weaken substantially and rather quickly, and the former vice president may be doing well enough to keep that from happening.
But will Klobuchar and Buttigieg slow Warren’s rise? Perhaps surprisingly, the moderates and Sanders share an interest in pointing out that Warren has not always been as enthusiastic about Medicare for All as she is now. She was careful in a New York Times interview earlier this year to endorse it, but she stressed the goal of “moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost” and stressed “there are a lot of different ways to get there. ‘Medicare for All’ has a lot of different paths for how we get there.” One can imagine her returning to this more circumspect position in a general election campaign, made easier by her choice to avoid issuing a comprehensive health care proposal of her own.
On the other hand, Warren was unabashed and effective defending her wealth tax — “Taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does” — and she can already fairly claim that she has fundamentally altered the national conversation on taxing large fortunes.
“I have a plan for that” has been Warren’s iconic sound bite. To this point, her strategy has worked brilliantly. Going forward, she will need to confront challenges from both her left and her right. She needs a plan for that, too.

PA. MUST REFORM ITS VEHICLE EMISSIONS TESTING THE PROGRAM MUST BE BROUGHT INTO THE 21ST CENTURY

Texto completo: Millions of Pennsylvanians are paying for an outdated vehicle emissions testing program in counties that already meet federal air quality standards. As chair of the Pennsylvania Senate Transportation Committee, I believe the time to change that is long overdue.
Pennsylvania's federally sanctioned Vehicle Emissions Inspection and Maintenance program requires motorists in 25 counties to participate in annual vehicle emissions testing for vehicles such as gasoline-powered passenger cars, vans, and light-duty trucks with a model year of 1975 and newer. (Diesel-powered vehicles are federally exempt from an annual vehicle emissions testing, and other vehicles such as motorcycles are exempt in Pennsylvania.)
This I/M program was required by Congress in 1990 as part of the Clean Air Act amendments. After changes were implemented, the commonwealth finally became compliant in 2005. However, Pennsylvania motorists in affected counties are still mandated to receive an outdated vehicle emissions testing every year, at an average cost of $40 per test.
The commonwealth does not set the cost of vehicle emissions testing nor does it collect any fees to manage the I/M program. Instead, the nearly 8,000 official inspection stations across the state set a market-driven fee to account for the cost of the equipment, training, and related expenses.
There is compelling evidence that subject vehicles are continuously passing the annual vehicle emissions testing. Due to newer, more efficient vehicles entering the fleet, vehicle emission testing has become less effective at reducing air pollution.
In Pennsylvania, between 2011-2017, an average of 5.7 million subject vehicles were tested each year; less than 4% of all subject vehicles failed the testing (and only 2% of subject vehicles eight years old or newer failed). This demonstrates how annual vehicle emissions testing is ineffective and outdated. Although we are meeting or exceeding federal air quality standards and fewer subject vehicles are failing the vehicle emissions testing, there has not been any action in recent years to modernize the onerous, costly regulations of the I/M program.
In May, the Senate Transportation Committee held a public hearing and collected testimony from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Joint State Government Commission, the Pennsylvania AAA Federation and an inspection mechanic.
This hearing made it clear to me and many of my colleagues in the Senate of Pennsylvania that we can make meaningful changes to an unnecessary sanction created 30 years ago without putting air quality at risk.
In June, I sponsored and the Senate passed reform measures including Senate Bill 742 and Senate Bill 743.
Senate Bill 742 would exempt newer subject vehicles eight years old or newer from the annual vehicle emissions testing. This legislation requires the newer subject vehicles to receive an annual anti-tampering inspection from official inspection stations. The anti-tampering inspection is currently conducted on all non-subject vehicles during the annual safety inspection.
Senate Bill 743 would change the annual vehicle emissions testing to a two-year testing requirement for subject vehicles. Therefore, it will create a new testing program by requiring vehicles manufactured in an odd-numbered year to receive a vehicle emission inspection during an odd-numbered year and vehicles manufactured in an even-numbered year to receive the inspection during an even-numbered year.
Other reforms passed by the Senate of Pennsylvania in June would remove at least seven counties meeting or exceeding air quality standards from the testing requirement, replace the outdated tests in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia regions with modern methods, and extend the date for existing official inspection stations to obtain new vehicle emissions testing equipment to 2021.
Similar reforms have passed in other states. To illustrate, 21 states (or 72% of states requiring vehicle emissions testing) authorize an exemption for newer subject vehicles from vehicle emissions testing similar to Senate Bill 742. Nine states (or 65% of states requiring vehicle emissions testing) allow biennial vehicle emissions testing consistent with Senate Bill 743.
Pennsylvania is part of a federally mandated Northeast Ozone Transport Region, which sets stricter requirements for 12 states and the District of Columbia. However, five states (Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Virginia) permit exemptions for newer subject vehicles similar to Senate Bill 742, and seven jurisdictions (Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Virginia) allow biennial vehicle emissions testing consistent with Senate Bill 743.
These bills were sent to the House of Representatives for consideration. If signed into law, the DEP would be required to prepare a revised State Implementation Plan reflecting these reforms. The revised plan would require review and approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before the reform measures would take effect. This will ensure that Pennsylvania is not in jeopardy of advancing federally funded highway projects in Pennsylvania.
It is time to give over 5 million motorists a break and bring Pennsylvania's vehicle emissions testing program into the 21st century.
Sen. Kim Ward represents Pennsylvania's 39th Senatorial District, which covers most of Westmoreland County.

Texto completo: The 2020 men's and women's marathons and walking races are now scheduled to take place in Sapporo, 500 miles north of Tokyo.
Next year's Olympic marathons in Japan will be moved from Tokyo to Sapporo because of expected extreme heat, the International Olympic Committee said Wednesday.
The walking races are also expected to be moved to Sapporo, which is 500 miles north of Tokyo. Temperatures there in late July and early August are expected to be about 10 to 12 degrees cooler than in Tokyo.
Heat has been the biggest concern for the Games. At its latitude, Tokyo is one of the hottest cities in the world during the summer months in which the Olympics will be held; over the past 10 Augusts, the average daily temperature was 82 degrees, with higher temperatures and humidity making for difficult conditions for sports competition. Hundreds of people die each summer from the extreme heat.
The 1964 Olympics in Tokyo were held in October because of that heat. But primarily because the I.O.C. wants to maximize its television audience and the money it can collect from media fees, especially in America, which pays the biggest broadcast rights fee, the 2020 Games were scheduled in the traditional summer window. Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president, has said moving the games would create chaos in the international sport calendar and prevent top athletes from participating.
The last time the Summer Olympics were held outside the July-August window was in 2000, when the Sydney Games were staged in late September. They remain the least watched Summer Games in the United States over the past several decades.
Ever since, the Olympic committee has told candidate cities that the Summer Games must be scheduled between July 15 and Aug. 31, barring "exceptional circumstances."
The Olympic committee has made several other moves to deal with the expected heat in Tokyo. The longer track races will be run in the evenings, when it is cooler. Morning rugby games will end before noon. There could be further changes, the committee said.
There are also plans for tents, water misters, fans and sun visors for spectators.
Before the decision to move the marathons, organizers were resurfacing the course with a shimmery light gray material called Perfect Cool, which uses tiny ceramic beads to reflect heat. The races would also have started at dawn.
Researchers questioned its cooling effect, but Olympic organizers had decided to use it, anyway, despite its cost of 12,000 yen (about $ 110) per square meter (10.8 square feet), according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The total expense wasted on a discarded course snaking through central Tokyo, some of it six lanes wide, is unclear.
At a canoeing event in Tokyo in early September, organizers tried to cool spectators with shaved ice, but the experiment left fans soaked.
The men's marathon typically comes on the last day of the Games and is considered a signature event, with the finish or medal ceremony often taking place in the Olympic Stadium. With the event taking place far to the north, its impact will be lessened, though the medal ceremony could potentially still take place before the closing ceremony, in accordance with tradition.
"Athletes' health and well-being are always at the heart of our concerns," Bach said Wednesday in a statement. "The new far-reaching proposals to move the marathon and racewalking events show how seriously we take such concerns."
Bach attended what was widely seen as failed experiment at the track and field world championships in Doha earlier this month. Marathon runners crumbled in the heat, and while Qatar's much-vaunted air-cooling technology ensured athletes inside the Khalifa International Stadium remained comfortable, that raised a different set of questions about the environmental impact of air conditioning an open-air arena in a city where the haze of polluted air already hangs over an island of skyscrapers in the business district.
The marathons in Doha began at midnight to avoid the daytime heat, but by the time the women's race had finished, about 40 percent of the entrants had withdrawn -- overwhelmed by midnight temperatures of about 90 degrees and humidity levels of more than 70 percent.
Moving the races to Sapporo should allow the Olympic marathons to avoid a similar embarrassment.

Texto completo: The performer in chief is forcing us to live in a B-movie horror.
Readers of this page have every reason to be suspicious of the political musings of an actor. I'm suspicious of them myself. But consider this: Our politics and our press are completely dominated by an entertainer president. In recent weeks we've even read about our ex-reality-show host president discussing foreign policy over the phone with the ex-TV comedian president of Ukraine.
Entertainment and politics have become bizarrely intertwined. Perhaps it's time for a working entertainer to weigh in.
I call Donald Trump an "entertainer president" advisedly since he has proved himself to be such an inept public servant. Over the years, he has thrust himself into the public eye with the flamboyant histrionics of a latter-day P.T. Barnum. Part of this is the amoral tradecraft of a New York real estate developer, but a lot of it springs from the appetites of a voracious attention-getter.
Think of Mr. Trump preening at his beauty contests, body-slamming Vince McMahon at W.W.F. events or holding rallies that resemble the arena gigs of an insult comic. These are the antics of a showman, not a statesman.
Mind you, a flair for entertainment is not a bad thing in a leader. We can quote verbatim from performances on the world stage by Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Eloquence and wit like theirs have helped rally nations, defeat poverty and win wars. It took Ronald Reagan, an actual actor president, to put the perfect timing and emphasis on the simple sentence, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."
But Mr. Trump is something else again. Where Reagan was the product of the tight quality control of Hollywood's old studio system, Mr. Trump emerged from the curated chaos of reality TV. He even impersonated his own press agent over the telephone.
As bad a president as Mr. Trump has been, he's an even worse entertainer. He reads scripted lines like a panic-stricken schoolboy at a middle school assembly. He mangles every attempt at irony, self-mockery or, God forbid, an actual joke. He cravenly fills the hall for every rally with a hopped-up claque drawn from his hard-core base. And he can be grotesquely inappropriate at his public appearances, as when he babbled inanely about crowd size and margins of victory on recent condolence visits to Ohio and Texas after mass shootings in those states.
Pause for a moment and recall No-Drama Barack Obama. Remember when we would whine about how aloof and deliberative he was? Maybe there was some truth to that complaint but, wow, did that man know how to choose his moments.
Think about the time when, during his eulogy for the pastor Clementa Pinckney, slain in his Charleston, S.C., church in 2015, Mr. Obama began to softly sing "Amazing Grace." Can you imagine a greater contrast or a sterner rebuke to the broad grin and upturned thumb of our current president after the Walmart shooting this past summer in El Paso?
It is dispiriting to watch the wretched excesses of Mr. ­­­Trump's slapstick presidency and the rabid audience he commands. But there may be an upside to his crude performance art. His relentless lies, impulsive acts and gassy pronouncements have emboldened American journalists and quickened their senses.
And just as heartening, the Trump phenomenon has sharpened the wits of a whole new breed of entertainers. These are the daring TV comics who gleefully turn Mr. Trump's outrages against him every night of the week: Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Seth Meyers and others.
As entertainers, they are everything Mr. Trump is not. They're smart, informed, disciplined, self-aware and genuinely funny. Not a single item in the day's news goes unexamined by these warrior satirists, and unlike the late-night comfort food of days past, their comedy is heightened by the bright fire of their anger.
Entertainment, it turns out, ain't beanbag.
Everyone loves a good villain onscreen and onstage. Shakespeare himself must have especially relished writing lines for Macbeth, Iago and Richard III. But coldhearted monsters in movies and plays are the stuff of fantasy. When we're sitting in the audience, some part of us is reassured knowing that we are watching fiction.
Reality is a lot less entertaining and a lot more frightening. There has to be a way to rein in real-life villainy in public life. Our government of checks and balances has finally taken on that challenge. With House committees examining Mr. Trump's recent invitations to foreign governments to meddle in our elections, impeachment is not only possible but probable.
But it will be an uphill struggle. Impeachment would not necessarily close down this long-running freak show. Other forces need to be brought to bear.
Soon, with any luck, journalism and entertainment will act in concert with an energized voting public to bring an end to the Trump nightmare. If not, we'll have to wait a little longer for quality drama and accommodate ourselves to a continuing diet of B-movie horror.

What Was It About? About Three Hours

Texto completo: A maximalist marathon on CNN made room for a lot of moments, but it begged for some editing.
How was the Democratic debate Tuesday night in Ohio? To answer this question, we must first ask: Which debate are you talking about?
Let's do, to borrow a word from Andrew Yang's lapel pin, the math. There were 12 candidates onstage Tuesday, any of whom could have had exchanges with one or more of the others. That made for (counts on fingers) a lot of different interpersonal dynamics. The debate was scheduled for three hours, yet -- even with formal opening and closing statements dispensed with -- it still ran long.
So there was room for a great number of debates within this debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times. This debate had many rooms. It had geologic ages. I believe that somewhere in there, they awarded the Oscar for Best Picture. It is said that near its beginning, the candidates argued about the merits of Medicare for All and how to pay for it, but those are only rumors; no written records remain from that time.
This ultramegasupersized format was the product of the decisions, first, to re-loosen the qualifications that had been tightened for the September debate, where only 10 made the stage, and second, to hold it all on one night, at "Lord of the Rings" length, with as many participants as there are signs of the zodiac. (Everyone who qualified last month got into this debate, with two more joining them for good luck.)
So there was one debate, in which Elizabeth Warren -- perceived as the front-runner by the field if not by every poll -- fought off challenges from candidates trying to break into the top tier, on everything from health care to Senator Kamala Harris's demand that President Trump be kicked off Twitter. There was another debate, involving Ms. Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joseph Biden, in which the three leaders mostly seemed glad to speak next to rather than at one another.
There were also lonely, individual debates, starring Senator Cory Booker (did you know he's a vegan? Let him tell you about it), who debated against "tearing each other down" during a debate, and the businessman Tom Steyer, who seemed to share one of the viewing public's deeply held beliefs: He could hardly believe he was up there either.
The decision to make the early debates big and inclusive, of course, had a good intention, to avoid shutting out too many voices too early. But that also left little room for anyone besides the leaders to get real attention or lasting traction. (Even Marianne Williamson's becoming a meme in the early debates didn't carry her through to this still-generous round.)
The moderators, Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper of CNN and Marc Lacey of The Times, imposed a mostly minimalist structure on the maximalist event, readying short questions on topics -- automation, Syria, gun control -- and asking them of most or all of the field.
The trade-off, space and time being finite, was skipping over some subjects, like climate change, that are top of mind for many Democratic voters. There was, however, time for a closing question from Mr. Cooper that resurrected the recent debate over Ellen DeGeneres's palling around with former president George W. Bush at a football game.
If we were going to rehash that luxury-box problem, the question might have tried to tease out its moral complexities, like what is the point at which principle is more important than comity? Instead, we closed the debate with a dozen candidates each trying to prove their bonhomie bona fides by describing their "surprising" friends, an impressive number of whom were the late Sen. John McCain.
What we didn't get, though, were the sort of showy questions designed to goad the candidates into fights -- not necessary anyway, since so many participants came with fighting points prepared.
And late in the evening, one more debate-within-a-debate broke out, among Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, over who was more effective at getting big things done. After Mr. Biden pointed to his long record in Washington, Mr. Sanders added, "You got the disastrous war in Iraq done!" ("I say this as a friend.") And Ms. Warren responded to Mr. Biden's attempt to claim credit for helping her establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by thanking ... Barack Obama (whom you may have heard Mr. Biden mention once or twice).
It was a brief preview of the contrasts we might see when the debates actually get edited down to a manageable size. Then, the leaders might realize they need to engage one another and demonstrate how they'd handle a general-election face-off with a president who is not known for Ellen-esque comity or for politely waiting his turn to speak onstage.
So maybe the question isn't, have the Democratic debates been useful? Maybe it's, when will they start?

Warren needs a new plan - for being a front-runner

Texto completo: For Elizabeth Warren, the hard part begins now.
The Massachusetts senator is unquestionably the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, which made her the focal point of attacks from her rivals in Tuesday's Democratic debate. Former vice president Joe Biden had an easier time of it, but this was not good news for him. At various points during the three-hour marathon, he faded away. His rivals no longer see him as the person to beat.
Beneath the jostling for position lay an important policy subtext. Warren was plainly far more comfortable defending her broader economic positions, particularly her proposed wealth tax, than she was in standing up for Medicare-for-all. The tax on wealth goes to the heart of her candidacy's purposes. Medicare-for-all appears to be a position she adopted - somewhat belatedly - to fend off Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and attacks from her left. Her continued success depends on how she handles this tension.
Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) underscored the ongoing significance of the battle for the party's progressive wing by endorsing Sanders, who strengthened his hand with a solid performance. Their decisions defined the difficult political terrain Warren faces. Her rise depended on her ability, simultaneously, to pull left-wing Democrats away from Sanders while also gaining new support from more moderate progressives. She made it look effortless. It will be effortless no longer.
The debate also marked a reconfiguration at the other end of the party. While Biden remains near (and, in some polls, still at) the top of the field, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) sense it's now- or-never for them to replace Biden as the moderate alternative to Warren.
Biden had his moments Tuesday, and he was especially passionate when the conversation turned to foreign policy and President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, abandoning the United States' Kurdish allies. "This is shameful, shameful what this man has done," Biden declared.
Nonetheless, it was Buttigieg especially, but also Klobuchar, who dominated the discussion on the party's center-left. Up to now, Buttigieg has prospered as a refreshing new voice in the party, but struggled to break out of single digits. He was earning more acclaim than support. On Tuesday, he played to win.
He was scalding in challenging Warren's refusal to say whether she would have to raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all. "Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this," Buttigieg said. "No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi- trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare- for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in."
Buttigieg shrewdly defined his space: bolder than Biden ("bold" was one of his favorite words), but with more practical, doable ideas than Warren, and more of an "outsider" than the congressional veterans on the stage. Klobuchar was also forceful - particularly in discussing the opioid crisis - blending moderation with family anecdotes that brought home her Minnesota roots. Still, both Midwesterners need Biden to weaken substantially and rather quickly, and the former vice president may be doing well enough to keep that from happening.
But will Klobuchar and Buttigieg slow Warren's rise? Perhaps surprisingly, the moderates and Sanders share an interest in pointing out that Warren has not always been as enthusiastic about Medicare-for-all as she is now. She was careful in a New York Times interview earlier this year to endorse it, but she stressed the goal of "moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost" and stressed "there are a lot of different ways to get there. Medicare- for-all has a lot of different paths for how we get there." One can imagine her returning to this more circumspect position in a general election campaign, made easier by her choice to avoid issuing a comprehensive health-care proposal of her own.
On the other hand, Warren was unabashed and effective defending her wealth tax - "Taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does" - and she can already fairly claim that she has fundamentally altered the national conversation on taxing large fortunes.
"I have a plan for that" has been Warren's iconic sound bite. To this point, her strategy has worked brilliantly. Going forward, she will need to confront challenges from both her left and her right. She needs a plan for that, too.

Can we please stop talking about Medicare-for-all?

Texto completo: At Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, talking about health care pretty much meant talking about Medicare-for-all - again. The controversial idea of abolishing private insurance in favor of a single, government-run program certainly deserves some rigorous back-and-forth. But not at the expense of issues with a much greater impact on our health.
As an emergency physician, I can tell you that the best health insurance in the world means nothing if patients can't reach a hospital in their moment of need. But more than 100 hospitals in rural areas have closed since 2010, and hundreds more are at risk. When hospitals close, ambulance times can increase dramatically, and the additional wait often means the difference between life and death. Candidates, what do you think about that?
Many of the remaining hospitals have cut high-cost services such as obstetrics. Between 2004 and 2014, hospitals serving 179 rural counties stopped being able to care for pregnant women, directly resulting in increases in preterm births and births outside of hospitals. Today, fewer than half of rural counties have hospitals that provide obstetric care. When laboring women have to drive four hours to get to a hospital, it's not surprising that some deliver on the way and many women have to forgo prenatal care. Debate moderators, a question perhaps?
Health insurance also means nothing if there aren't enough doctors. In Texas, a span of 11,000 square miles is served by just one doctor. More than 60 percent of all U.S. counties - and 80 percent of rural counties - lack a single psychiatrist. Some 34 million Americans live in areas short on dental health professionals, and 19 million live in reproductive health-care deserts, without access to providers of basic services such as contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Voters, isn't this something you want to know more about?
To be fair, multiple candidates have proposals for stabilizing rural hospitals, funding community health centers, protecting women's health care and incentivizing health professionals to work in underserved areas. But you wouldn't know it from the substance of the campaign so far. The American people need to hear more about these ideas on how - literally - to access care, which is a prerequisite to discussion of how to pay for it.
And beyond that, we need to hear that candidates understand people's everyday health concerns. In the urgent-care clinic where I practice, patients routinely come to me with kidney damage and heart problems because of untreated high blood pressure. Even with insurance, they have to ration prescription medications. Two weeks ago, I treated a patient who cut her blood-pressure pills into halves, then quarters, before she stopped taking them altogether.
I know my patients would be eager to hear how those vying to be the next president would address their struggles to afford prescription drugs. Would they press Congress to allow the federal government to negotiate directly with drug companies? Would they use executive powers to force Big Pharma to cut prices of key life-sustaining medications, such as insulin for diabetes treatment and naloxone, the opioid antidote?
Speaking of the opioid epidemic, candidates must be hearing what I hear: the devastating toll that opioids wreak in rural and urban communities alike, compounded by the tragedy of limited treatment availability. Addiction is a disease for which treatment exists. Yet only 10 percent of Americans with addictions are getting the care they need. Imagine the outcry if only 10 percent of Americans who need chemotherapy were getting it.
Marc Lacey, national editor at the New York Times, did ask about the opioid crisis Tuesday. That's good. Many candidates have thoughtful proposals for addressing the crisis. Let's dig into this urgent, on-the-ground health-care issue to the same degree we've analyzed the high-altitude pros and cons of Medicare-for-all. More than 100 people die every day after overdosing on opioids. How will our next president save lives today?
Finally, we need to hear candidates talk about how to prevent illness in the first place. At the next debate, how refreshing would it be if someone answered a Medicare-for-all question with a quick pivot: "Let's talk about policies that keep people healthy instead." Prevent our children from getting lead- poisoned. Stop the release of pollutants that worsen asthma. Empower communities to provide healthy food options and walkable spaces. Invest in education, affordable housing and accessible transportation. All these things have as much of an effect on overall health as health-care services themselves.
Sound health policy is about so much more than the mechanics of insurance. Let's stop letting Medicare-for-all dominate the conversation. The United States' patients - the voters - expect much more.

Texto completo: Frederick Gevers and Elke Bynens have brought a taste of Belgium to Southwest Florida.
The husband-wife team, Gevers is 31 and Bynens is 30, opened Artanis Belgian Chocolatier at Coconut Point in Estero in early September. The shop offers Belgian chocolate flown in from Brussels, homemade waffles, Illy coffee and those delicious Belgium cookies served on airplanes (sold in the States as Biscoff but known in Belgium as speculoos).
"All the good stuff," Bynens said.
"Though it's not good for our diet, being there every day."
The shop offers an assortment of 40 different types of chocolates by Belgian brand Leonidas Chocolates, from truffles to caramels to butter creams. The caramels come in six flavors that include sea salt, pink Himalayan salt, and milk chocolate with orange and bergamot. The store also sells chocolate bars in milk, dark and white chocolate, plus it orders dark chocolate in 11-pound chunks that can be chipped into smaller pieces.
The chocolates are made in Belgian and shipped fresh to Southwest Florida. They're never frozen, which Bynens said is essential.
"When you freeze them, the flavor is not going to be the same once you defrost them."
The shop serves ice cream as well as a locally made vegan strawberry gelato.
"It tastes like you're eating a frozen strawberry," Bynens said.
"It's delicious."
In its small seating area, customers can take a break from shopping to sample a Liege-style waffle made in the store. The couple serves them up with a scoop of ice cream, whipped cream or melted dark chocolate (or all three, bless them).
Bynens and Gevers are both originally from Belgium, where Gevers had a previous career in the airline industry. The couple spent a lot of their early time together traveling, and they toured the United States. On one trip, they visited cities throughout Florida, which is how they discovered the Fort Myers area.
"We fell in love with this place," Bynens said.
They enjoyed the area so much they held their wedding on Sanibel in 2017, and soon afterward they started thinking about how they could make a life here. In their travels they met another Belgian couple in California who had launched their own Belgian chocolate and specialty item shop in Palm Springs.
"It was a great experience for them," Bynens said.
"Who doesn't love chocolate? We wanted a different challenge in our lives, so we decided to open a Belgian chocolate store."
They decided to go for it in May. They filed their paperwork for the E-2 investor visa, packed up their house and their cats and made the move to Southwest Florida. Soon they bought a home and launched Artanis. They chose Coconut Point for their shop because they liked its location between Fort Myers, Bonita Springs and Naples.
The store keeps them busy most days, but the pair find time to give back to their adopted community. They donate all the tips collected at Artanis to Haven on Earth Animal League, a no-kill, non-profit animal rescue group in Fort Myers, and they foster the shelter's kittens until they can be placed in permanent homes.
"We love animals," Bynens said.
As for their new life in Southwest Florida, the couple is happy they made the move.
"We love it here," Bynens said. "It's a totally different way of living than in Europe. Everything is new."
And if they ever get homesick, a little piece of Belgium is only a bite away.

Texto completo: Whether it was the best of times or the worst of times, Molly Ivins seemed to have a good time. The late syndicated columnist always had a twinkle in her eye and a putdown on her lips as she skewered a corrupt, cruel or just plain dumb politician. In her native Texas, and later the entire country during the George W. Bush years, she had what the military calls a target-rich environment.
The new documentary "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins" introduces her spirit to a younger generation of progressive activists who might not know enough about her (she died of cancer in 2007). For the rest of us, Janice Engel's film is a rollicking reacquaintance with Ivins' distinctive drawl, and we can't help but wonder what she'd say about our current ominous political climate. Likely, there would be some swearing involved.
"Raise Hell" gets its Madison premiere beginning Friday at Market Square Theatre.
The film opens with a rapid-fire montage of some of Ivins' greatest oneliners on politics, which she famously called "the finest form of free entertainment ever invented." Then Engel goes behind Ivins' larger-than-life persona or, at six feet tall, near enough to tell us about the real woman.
The daughter of a Texas oilman she nicknamed "the Colonel" for his autocratic parenting, Ivins was an avid reader who initially pursued a path in traditional journalism. But even that was a radical move. At a time when most female reporters were assigned to the features desk to write about fashion or gardening, she wanted to write about politics.
Her career included stints at the then-Minneapolis Tribune and six years as a one-person bureau in Colorado for the New York Times, but Texas kept calling her home. It was there, at the liberal Texas Observer, that she really found her voice covering the Texas legislature, using her wicked sense of humor to take on the corruption and venality she saw there.
Later, calling the now-defunct Dallas Times-Herald her home base, Ivins was syndicated in hundreds of papers (including, it will not surprise you to know, The Capital Times), which put her in a perfect position when Texas Gov. George W. Bush became President George W. Bush. She nicknamed him "Shrub" in her first book, and it stuck.
Because most of Ivins' best work was on the un-cinematic printed page, much of "Raise Hell" features clips from public appearances the CSPAN2 logo appears so often onscreen it should get a credit in the film. Fans from Texas and beyond, including Dan Rather, Rachel Maddow, Jim Hightower and Lou DuBose, sing her praises.
Every now and then, the film gives you the sense that it wasn't always fun to be Ivins, and that her brash public persona might have served as a shield for her private struggles, including with alcohol. Engel's interviews with Ivins' siblings and close friends adds a personal dimension to Ivins' life that you wouldn't guess, just knowing her from her writing.
Still, the emphasis in "Raise Hell" is on the joy she felt at speaking her mind and the acuity with which she did it, raising the spirits of the dispirited and championing the little guy against powerful interests. It is a little surprising, however, that Engel couldn't or didn't find a single one of Ivins' conservative targets to speak about her on camera.
Maybe, over a decade after she's gone, they're still afraid of her.

Amy Klobuchar beat Elizabeth Warren, but how come no one talked about black voters?

Texto completo: In the spirit of girl power, Sen. Amy Klobuchar did not allow her gender or the fear of feminists get in the way of her unapologetic efforts to take on Democratic front-runner Elizabeth Warren. Still, as the female candidates came out strong on the debate stage, black people remained alienated from the discussion.
As I sat on my couch, unenthused about another Democratic debate, I was pleasantly surprised to see Klobuchar armed with political darts for Warren. I'm not opposed to Warren, but I've been waiting to see someone point out the flaws in Warren’s solutions to everything. I've been wondering if those attacks would come from a woman, especially since the historic 2018 midterm election seemed to spread a spirit of sisterhood on Capitol Hill.
In the year of the woman, any visual of catfights on a national stage would be a political no-no. But clearly Klobuchar was unbothered. She questioned Warren’s vision and her policies, offering Warren a reality check on all of her perfectly imperfect plans.
But truth be told, I think the candidates need a reality check on the mindset of real voters — or maybe just voters that look like me.
As a registered independent who has voted for Republican governors and Democrat presidents, I found myself slightly annoyed with the debate.
Maybe it was my glass of sauvignon blanc that resulted in my vexation, or maybe it was the colorful cliches: Sen. Cory Booker reminding everyone, again, that he still lives in the "hood," Andrew Yang offering $1,000 a month as an economic breakthrough for middle-class people, Joe Biden's claims of being the only one who has ever done anything in life, the discussion of breaking up big tech companies, who is best friends with Republicans, and questions about which Democratic candidate would nominate Supreme Court justices that would protect Roe v. Wade — yes, that was really a question at the debate.
As a black woman, I often feel excluded from these debates. But come Sunday morning many of those on the debate stage will be in the first pew of a Baptist church discussing the maternal death rate of black women, criminal justice reform, and economic inequality in the black community. Churchgoers and ushers, dressed in all white, will nod in agreement.
But while the issues of black America are shared from the pulpit, these issues barely make it to the debate stage or receive the commitment of a four-hour town hall. Instead, our issues are wrapped up in 10-second soundbites in discussions on climate change, immigration, and prison reform (okay, maybe we do get a little more time on prison reform).
The problem with moderators consistently ignoring the status of and issues that affect black Americans is that the rest of the country ignores these injustices as well, resulting in a dismissive attitude towards police killings, environmental racism, and economic disparities that have resulted in high crime and poor education in marginalized communities. It took 90 minutes before any candidate mentioned Atatiana Jefferson, who was senselessly shot and killed by Fort Worth Police Officer Aaron Dean, who has since resigned and been charged with murder.
I am not inspired by any of the candidates at this point. Maybe because there are just too many candidates right now, or maybe because they aren't or haven't been given the opportunity to speak in-depth on issues in communities of color.
Members of Blexit may think I'm going through some sort of awakening and willing to leave what they call a blue plantation for a red one — the truth is I have been "woke," and most importantly I have been free, which is why I am an independent. However, despite my reservations and frustrations with the Democratic candidates and their oblivious attitude towards black America, I am not compelled by talks of historically low rates of unemployment for black Americans to jump on the Trump train — that's not enough to erase the insulting rhetoric coming from the Oval Office.
I am still waiting on that spark from a Democratic candidate that lights my torch for 2020. If not, I will sadly head to the polls, voting by default, just as I grudgingly did in 2016.

'She’s going to have to tell the truth': Biden says Warren must be honest about cost of healthcare plan

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – Former Vice President Joe Biden has questioned Sen. Elizabeth Warren's honesty about the costs of her healthcare plan.
“It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board. And you know, credibility matters. It matters," Biden told reporters on Wednesday.
Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, faced heavy criticism from her rivals on the Democratic presidential debate stage on Tuesday night for refusing to give a straight answer on whether her "Medicare for all" single-payer health care plan would raise taxes on middle-class Americans.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an architect of "Medicare for all," has admitted that taxes would go up for middle-class Americans, but Warren would only say that overall health care costs would decrease for that group.
"She’s going to have to tell the truth, or a question will be raised about whether she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people,” Biden said.
He added that Warren's proposed wealth tax on ultra-millionaires "doesn't even get close" to covering the cost of the proposal. "It's going to cost about $3.4 trillion a year. That's more than the entire federal budget," Biden said.
"Look the last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy," Biden said. "There’s nothing easy about it. If you’re going to do it, tell us how you’re going to do it. It’s called truth in speaking.”

At Democratic debate, notes of caution on impeachment

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio — In the most recent Quinnipiac national poll, 90% of Democratic voters approved of the party's impeachment inquiry targeting President Trump. So the candidates gathered here for the first debate since House Democrats officially announced an impeachment effort could not reasonably be expected to oppose it. But the presidential candidates have tended to lag behind the most aggressive impeachment advocates in the House, and what was notable Tuesday night was that lag still exists; if there is an impeachment enthusiasm scale running from cautious to gung-ho, some candidates took positions on the cautious end despite their party's headlong race toward impeachment on Capitol Hill.
Those candidates still seemed concerned that moderate Americans will see the party as so determined to pursue Trump that they ignore pressing national issues.
Of course, the most gung-ho said the usual things. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the president deserves to be impeached not only for the Ukraine affair but also for the Trump-Russia matter and even for alleged violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause. Sen. Kamala Harris said Trump is so guilty that impeachment should be a quick affair.
But others took a different tone. "First of all, we must be fair," said Sen. Cory Booker. "We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship."
"Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage," Booker continued. "I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart."
"I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016," said entrepreneur Andrew Yang. "Why did Donald Trump win [Ohio] by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns ... These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected ... and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office."
"We need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump."
Whenever Trump leaves office, and under whatever circumstances, said South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the country will be "vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process."
"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country," said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. "Unfortunately, this is what we have already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016."
Although she favors going forward with an impeachment inquiry, Gabbard was hesitant to take the next step. "If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump," she said, "He walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford."
Even Sanders, who can think of many reasons to remove the president, added a note of caution. "I hope that he is impeached," Sanders said. "But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck."
Perhaps Sanders was just worried that Democrats might have a communications problem, rather than a substance problem. But there was still a worry.
Party veterans noticed. "I think you saw two different approaches on how to talk about impeachment tonight," said former Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee. "They were all in agreement that the president should be impeached. But you had some candidates talk about it in a way that would fire up the Democratic base, and then you had a number of candidates who decided to speak beyond the base and tie it back to everyday people, tie it back to kitchen table issues ... and recognize that there are bigger challenges that we need to address beyond impeachment."
Tom Perez, the DNC chairman, rejected the suggestion of differences between the candidates. "I think there is an absolute understanding that this is a constitutional imperative," Perez said after the debate. "I heard that from every candidate. There's no joy taken in the moment and time we find ourselves."
Impeachment won't go away in the next Democratic debate or the one after that. If House Democrats move forward, one of the candidates — Gabbard — will have to vote on articles of impeachment. And if that happens, five candidates — Warren, Sanders, Booker, Harris, and Klobuchar — will have to vote in a Senate trial. And that means the concerns some of them voiced Tuesday night will be around for quite a while.

Texto completo: Kamala Harris is once again fundraising off a viral moment during the Democratic debates by emblazoning it on a shirt.
During Tuesday’s debate, Harris repeated a refrain about President Trump that she has used on the campaign trail, declaring of Trump: “Dude gotta go.” The phrase was one of the most tweeted about moments during the debate and is now featured on shirts available for purchase from the Harris campaign’s online store.
The black shirts are available in sizes ranging from extra small to 3XL and are being sold for $29.99. The front of the shirt shows the top of the White House with the phrase and her website printed below.

Harris, 54, has printed shirts based off of other viral debate moments in the past. During the June debate, Harris attacked front-runner Joe Biden’s past reticence about using busing to force integration of public schools.
“It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day,” Harris told Biden. “That little girl was me.”
As the debate was still going, her campaign tweeted out a photo of Harris as a young child in pigtails along with the caption, “That little girl was me.”
Just hours after the viral exchange between the two, the photo of Harris appeared on shirts in her campaign store for $30.

Texto completo: Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was glad to see Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders doing well after he suffered a heart attack earlier this month.
The South Carolina Republican said in a tweet that Sanders’ debate performance was well-done, despite Graham’s disagreement with all of his policy ideas.
“While I don’t agree with anything @BernieSanders said last night at the #DemDebate, I was glad to see him doing well and back on the campaign trail. He spoke with passion and energy for his causes,” Graham said.
Tweet
Earlier this month, doctors for the 78-year-old announced he had a heart attack. He spent three days in a Nevada hospital and received two stents, sparking renewed concern about his age and viability to lead the country.
“I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,” Sanders said at Tuesday’s debate when addressing the issue. “Let me invite you to a major rally in Queens, New York, and we are mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That’s how we are reassuring the American people.”
A RealClearPolitics national average of polls has Sanders in third place with 15.4% support behind Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are bringing in 29.4% and 23.4%, respectively.

House Republican donates to Steve King primary challenger

Texto completo: A House Republican colleague of Rep. Steve King contributed $2,000 to the Iowan's 2020 GOP primary challenger, a sign of deep unease about the incumbent returning to Congress amid a string of racist comments.
Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois gave the sum to King's chief primary rival in his northwest Iowa district, state Sen. Randy Feenstra. It's rare for sitting lawmakers to back primary challengers to a congressional colleague. But King, 70, is effectively an outcast in the House Republican Conference over comments about immigration, multiculturalism, and other topics. In January, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California stripped King of all committee assignments after he asked when "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" became offensive terms.
Kinzinger isn't the only Republican official to donate to King's primary challenger. U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa Republican Gov. Terry Branstad donated $1,000 to Feenstra's campaign.
Although members of his own party abandoned King, one Congressional Black Caucus member stood by him. Back in April, Missouri Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver said in an interview, "Steve King and I have a good relationship as far as I know. We talk and joke and. You know, I think a couple of years ago … he said I guess, somebody had called him a racist or something."
Cleaver added, "I can’t remember clearly, but I said, ‘Steve, I don’t call people racist. You know, I think we all have to be very careful about the words we use.’ But, I get along with him fine.’”
The Iowa Republican, who played a key role in helping President Trump win the state during the last Republican presidential primary, was summarily removed from his committee assignments, despite protestations he was misquoted by the New York Times reporter.
King has struggled with fundraising for his campaign since July but insists an internal poll last week showed him with a large lead over his four Republican primary challengers.

Bipartisan house majority condemns Trump for Syria withdrawal

Texto completo: Washington • The House on Wednesday delivered a bipartisan condemnation of President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces just inside Syria’s border, registering broad opposition in Congress to a move that has thrown the region into bloody chaos and unraveled Middle East policy.
Republicans and Democrats banded together to approve a resolution opposing Trump’s acquiescence to the Turkish assault against the Kurds, who have been crucial American allies in the fight against the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. The measure passed, 354-60, not long before a bipartisan group of congressional leaders was slated to meet with Trump to discuss the incursion, and hours before Vice President Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, were to travel to Ankara to call for a cease-fire in a battle the president appears to have greenlit.
“At President Trump’s hands, American leadership has been laid low, and American foreign policy has become nothing more than a tool to advance his own interests,” said Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee who introduced the measure. “Today we make clear that the Congress is a coequal branch of government and we want nothing to do with this disastrous policy.”
The resolution, which is largely symbolic, upbraids the withdrawal as “beneficial to adversaries of the United States government” including Russia, Syria and Iran, and calls on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to immediately end unilateral military action in northern Syria. A companion measure in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., was introduced on Tuesday.
It is the latest bipartisan rebuke by Congress of Trump’s mercurial approach to foreign policy. Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill have shown they are most comfortable criticizing the president on matters of international affairs, and have previously joined Democrats to denounce his administration’s unflagging support of Saudi Arabia after the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. And they declared their disapproval earlier this year of attempts to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria in a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader.
But Trump’s decision last week to essentially clear the way for a Turkish military operation against America’s Kurdish allies in northern Syria has provoked the strongest response yet from Republicans, including many of the president’s most reliable allies.
On Wednesday, after Trump said Turkey’s invasion into Syria is “not our problem” and that the Kurds “are no angels,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it “an astonishing statement which I completely and totally reject.”
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, wrote on Twitter that it is “Impossible to understand why @realDonaldTrump is leaving America’s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.”
Hawkish lawmakers like Cheney and Graham, as well as Democratic leaders in the House, are preparing additional legislative action to punish the Turks’ incursion. Graham introduced a sanctions package with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., last week, that would impose harsher sanctions on Turkey than the White House has levied, including the prohibition of U.S. military assistance and the freezing of the American assets of Erdogan and other Turkish leaders.
A small handful of libertarian-minded Republicans on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, have defended Trump’s decision as being consistent with the president’s campaign promise to end America’s intractable military conflicts.
“If we can save one American soldier from losing their life or limbs in another senseless Middle Eastern war, it is worthwhile,” Paul wrote on Twitter. “@realDonaldTrump knows this.”
It is unclear exactly how far congressional Republicans will go in their objections to Trump’s latest decision. Some of the president’s defenders who immediately vented their ire at the Syria withdrawal, including Graham, have since cooled their tone.
Graham, for example, released a long statement on Monday after meeting with Trump at the White House and joining a call with Erdogan.
“The president’s team has a plan and I intend to support them as strongly as possible, and to give them reasonable time and space to achieve our mutual goals,” Graham said.
Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., who had sharply criticized the withdrawal, emerged from a meeting with the White House on Tuesday sounding reassured.
“It was useful to see a lot of the promises that Erdogan made the president and to understand how forcefully the president, Secretary Esper, told the Turks across the board not to do this,” Waltz said in a brief interview, referring to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper. Waltz added that the White House was “livid” with Erdogan.
Pence and Pompeo are to meet with the Turkish president on Thursday to relay Trump’s demand that Erdogan negotiate a cease-fire, and to reiterate the president’s threat to impose economic sanctions if he does not.
Trump is also set to meet with Erdogan in November at the White House. But lawmakers on Wednesday called for the president to cancel the talks.
“Erdogan’s attack on our Kurdish partners has served to liberate ISIS prisoners, bolster the Assad regime, and strengthen Russia,” said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. “His invitation to the White House should be revoked.”

Texto completo: Former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman insinuated that President Donald Trump is worse than Adolf Hitler while tweeting a New York Times story Monday about a fake video of Trump killing members of the media.
"#Hitler has nothing on #Trump," Whitman wrote, with a link to the story.
The fake video was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, The New York Times reported. The video is an edited version of a scene from the movie "Kingsman: The Secret Service" and has Trump's face inserted over the face of a character from the film as he enters the "Church of Fake News." The character opens fire on the people inside, who have news organization logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed on their bodies.
Whitman has long been a critic of Trump, tweeting earlier this month: "This is NOT my Republican party." She added that Trump has done enough to warrant an impeachment inquiry, with several of her tweets ending with that or a similar hashtag, and that if the allegations are true he "has to go."

Texto completo: In an interview with ABC News, Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son rejected as "ridiculous" President Trump's suggestions that he and his father had engaged in wrongdoing.
WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son, said in an interview released on Tuesday that he probably would not have been named to the board of a foreign company if his last name weren't Biden and acknowledged "poor judgment," but he rejected suggestions by President Trump that he and his father had engaged in wrongdoing.
"Did I make a mistake? Well maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah," Mr. Biden said in an interview with ABC News. "But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not."
"I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden," he said.
The interview comes two days after Hunter Biden pledged that he would not work for foreign-owned companies if his father became president, and just hours before the CNN/New York Times Democratic debate held here in central Ohio, an appearance that is critical to his father's presidential hopes.
His sudden public comments signal the level of concern among Joseph Biden's allies that the overseas dealings of the younger Mr. Biden had become a potentially damaging liability to his father's campaign, and are the latest in a flurry of actions pro-Biden forces have taken to mitigate the issue this week ahead of the debate.
Mr. Trump has seized on Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China to initiate a series of unfounded attacks against the former vice president, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, over the past month. Mr. Trump also asked the government of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, helping to trigger an impeachment inquiry that Mr. Trump now faces in the House.
There is no evidence that the elder Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, improperly intervened to aid his son, but that has not stopped Mr. Trump and other Republicans from raising questions about possible conflicts of interest even as Mr. Biden has fiercely defended his son's integrity, and his own, over the last week.
Hunter Biden, who recently said he would resign from the board of a Chinese investment company, acknowledged his work abroad has become a "distraction, because I have to sit here and answer these questions. And so that's why I have committed that I won't serve on any boards or I won't work directly for any foreign entities when my dad becomes president."
Mr. Biden, 49, said he had exercised "poor judgment" by getting involved in a situation that he compared to a "swamp." But he blamed his father's opponents, including Mr. Trump, for spreading a "ridiculous conspiracy idea" involving his work, and repeatedly insisted that he did not discuss his business decisions with his father.
"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father," he said. "That's where I made the mistake. So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever."
Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.
"I'm never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him -- this is not a family business," Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on "Good Morning America" and was also excerpted online by the network. "Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it's a compliment that we're like the Kennedys or whether it's a, you know, backhanded compliment like you're the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump's kids and I never will, you know, that's not what Bidens do."
At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens.
"Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about," he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie "The Princess Bride."
In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.
"I'm taking it off the table," he said. "I'm making that commitment. Let's see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that's the commitment that I'm making."
A lawyer for Hunter Biden said Sunday in a statement that he planned to leave the board of the Chinese private equity company by the end of October, and that if the elder Mr. Biden were elected president, Hunter Biden would "agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies." Hunter Biden had previously served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, including during a time when his father was running American policy in that country, but he stepped down in April, the same month that the elder Mr. Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.
While the elder Mr. Biden said he learned of the Sunday statement from his son's lawyers, his campaign is taking steps to address the potential damage from Mr. Trump's unfounded claims of corruption by the Bidens. On Monday morning, Mr. Biden's campaign released a plan centered on promoting ethics in government. His campaign and his allies have said that Mr. Biden would both push back forcefully against Mr. Trump and continue to discuss policy matters, like health care, on the debate stage and on the campaign trail.
The Biden family has faced significant tragedy over the decades: Mr. Biden's first wife and a baby daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 that injured Hunter Biden and his brother, Beau. In 2015, Beau Biden died from brain cancer, influencing his father's decision not to seek the presidency that year. Hunter Biden has also struggled with addiction.
Asked if he was concerned that the "noise" associated with Mr. Trump's attacks could affect his sobriety, he replied, "of course."
"Look, you don't want to live in the worry of it," he added. "Because then you're feeding the beast. I have no answer other than this: You've got to live in the connections that you have to healthy things. And I have so many of them. And I've got to live there instead of living in fear like, 'Oh my God, the stress is going to make me drink, or the stress is going to make me use."'
He also grew emotional when discussing the presidency.
"I take no pleasure in this, watching, watching, this, this death spiral of this, this administration, this president, and the people that surround him," he said. "I hope that, that the history isn't fully written yet."

Sexual Abuse Cases Call U.S.A. Swimming's Oversight Into Question

Texto completo: A trial starting this week in California is expected to focus on U.S.A. Swimming's handling of sexual abuse cases at a time of intensifying scrutiny for Olympic sports.
For three and a half contentious hours last week in a downtown office in Denver, the chief executive of U.S.A. Swimming tried to distance himself and his organization from a lawsuit involving a California girl who was sexually abused by her club coach.
Tim Hinchey III, who took over the national governing body for swimming in 2017, said that he was not familiar with the details of the case and that he had not met the victim, according to a deposition reviewed by The New York Times. He also said he was not aware of any way of verifying that coaches, parents or children had been trained to deal with sexual abuse issues, even though his organization certifies coaches and oversees the sport at nearly every level.
"We can't be there, on the ground, to support that type of training every single day," Hinchey testified.
His testimony is central to the case, which was scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday in Stockton, Calif. The lawsuit will subject U.S.A. Swimming's governance to intense and possibly discomfiting scrutiny at a time when numerous sexual abuse lawsuits involving Olympic sports -- such as gymnastics, figure skating and taekwondo -- are winding through the courts. There are also multiple federal investigations of Olympic sports federations, looking into their business practices as well as into accusations of sexual misconduct, according to people with knowledge of the investigations. The investigations were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.
The attorney general in California has also requested files from U.S.A. Swimming on at least a dozen coaches, according to U.S.A. Swimming emails reviewed by The Times.
Robert Allard, a lawyer for the plaintiff in the Stockton case, has represented several other swimmers in abuse lawsuits against coaches and the federation. "I think this case is a microcosm for how U.S.A. Swimming has viewed this issue: 'I don't want to deal with this. It's dirty. It takes up too much of my time. I'd rather focus on other things,"' he said.
If Hinchey continues to be "indifferent and putting his hands to his ears and eyes," Allard continued, "then he will continue to leave children vulnerable to predators."
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Swimming, Isabelle McLemore, declined to comment directly on the case, citing the litigation. But she said: "We cannot stress enough that athletes' health and safety is U.S.A. Swimming's No. 1 priority. It has been, it continues to be and we work to improve it every single day. The athletes are the core of everything we do, and we take that very seriously."
A former swimmer at the University of California, Irvine, Hinchey worked as an executive in professional sports for two decades, including stops in the National Basketball Association, the English Football League and Major League Soccer, before joining U.S.A. Swimming in 2017.
He succeeded Chuck Wielgus, who died that year after a two-decade run during which he was credited with elevating the sport's profile but also criticized for overlooking allegations of sexual abuse. Hinchey has no choice but to confront the problem. In just the last month, he has been deposed in the California case and another one in North Carolina.
In the Stockton case, a coach named Shunichi Fujishima pleaded guilty this summer to sexually abusing the plaintiff starting in 2017, the year she turned 12.
"Despite red flags of Fujishima's predatory tendencies," the civil complaint said, the swimming authorities "turned a blind eye to his activities." Fujishima was sentenced last week to 12 years in prison, said Gilbert D. Somera, his lawyer.
During the investigation of Fujishima, documents surfaced indicating that senior U.S.A. Swimming officials, Hinchey included, had received copies of written accusations by a parent of another young swimmer against another coach with the same team, the Stockton Swim Club. The parent contended that the coach had committed statutory rape, and had sent sexually inappropriate messages.
In response, U.S.A. Swimming warned the coach in an email written by Susan Woessner, a senior executive, that "you agreed on the phone that your behavior could be perceived as inappropriate and told me that it won't happen again."
That coach has not been charged with a crime, and is not listed on the disciplinary database of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, an independent organization dedicated to investigating abuse and funded partly by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.
The Stockton lawsuit names Fujishima; the Stockton Swim Club; Pacific Swimming, the regional association; and U.S.A. Swimming as defendants.
Somera, who is also a longtime coach, questioned the plaintiffs' strategy in that case.
"How is the big body of U.S.A. Swimming responsible for something that happens on a small local level?" he said. "I get it that U.S.A. Swimming has the big, deep pockets, but what makes you believe you can just drop your kids off, without the checks and balances of being a parent?"
With a 100-person central staff and a $ 40 million annual budget, U.S.A. Swimming has 2,800 local teams and 400,000 members, the vast majority of whom are children. The organization also certifies coaches, who have to complete a series of courses, including one on protecting athletes from abuse, and submit to a background check. And while its main goals are to promote the sport and cultivate competitive success, the U.S.A. Swimming website says that "training our members in abuse prevention and mandatory reporting is just as important as creating policies."
When handling sexual abuse cases, U.S.A. Swimming has traditionally relied on several senior staff members, led by the general counsel, Lucinda McRoberts, to make group decisions, according to Woessner, who resigned last year and was deposed last week.
The accusations against the unidentified Stockton coach, for instance, were discussed at least a half-dozen times by senior staff members, Woessner said in her deposition.
Referring to the warning to that coach, Woessner testified that if Hinchey "disagreed with this course of action, he could let us know that and/or indicate that he, instead of the warning letter, wanted an investigation to go forward or voice any other concerns that he may have had."
But a lawyer for U.S.A. Swimming, William S. Kronenberg, said Hinchey had been on the job for only 23 days when that complaint was made, and therefore would have been unlikely to "override the recommendation made by this experienced group of people who had been running this program for seven years."
Hinchey's deposition was more combative. Kronenberg objected more than 70 times -- or once every three minutes.
In one exasperated exchange related to the unidentified coach, Allard said to Hinchey: "I don't mean to argue with you, sir, but you have admissions by a coach that he has discussed sexual activity with a minor, told her he needs a cuddle -- cuddle partner -- and suggested that he had a friend who wants to get laid. What more do you need to know to understand that a more severe punishment should have been imposed than merely the issuance of a warning letter?"
Hinchey responded: "Again, I would go back and rely on the folks that were doing this in the part of the process. I wasn't part of that case. So I would have to understand what my opportunities are, what my abilities would be, and I need to know what those are to be able to take action."

Once Loudest Optimists, Banks Are Getting Quieter

Texto completo: The heads of America's largest banks have been some of the country's most prominent optimists over the past two years, shooing away questions about the potential effects of President Trump's trade policies, cheering his tax cuts and offering periodic reassurances that things would all work out for the American economy.
But manufacturing activity and job growth are slowing, and trade talks with China have so far produced only an interim agreement that still has to be written and signed. And bankers are starting to worry.
"Of course there's a recession ahead -- what we don't know is if it's going to happen soon," Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said during a call on Tuesday with journalists to discuss the bank's third-quarter earnings.
Even as his bank announced record-high revenue, Mr. Dimon warned that the strong position of consumers in the United States had come under pressure from "increasingly complex geopolitical risks, including tensions in global trade."
The warning was new: Just six months ago, during another discussion of the bank's earnings, Mr. Dimon had predicted that United States economic growth "could go on for years."
"We'll just have to wait and see," he said on Tuesday.
JPMorgan's quarterly earnings were no worse for wear. The bank took in a record $ 29.3 billion during the third quarter and earned $ 2.68 per share, beating analysts' expectations by 23 cents. Its deposits grew by 3 percent compared with the same period last year.
The report from Goldman Sachs, which also announced third-quarter results, along with Citigroup and Wells Fargo, was less rosy. The bank's net earnings of just under $ 1.9 billion for the quarter were 26 percent lower than the same period last year and 22 percent lower than the second quarter of 2019. Goldman also announced that it had set aside $ 291 million for credit losses, a 67 percent increase from last year.
The bank's chief executive, David Solomon, shrugged off some of the recent turmoil on Wall Street, which has included disappointing debuts by tech companies like Uber and botched initial public offerings like WeWork, saying he believed the I.P.O. market was in fact healthy. But, he said, the bank is closely watching "where we are in the economic cycle" as it manages risks across the firm.
Citigroup's chief financial officer, Mark Mason, said on a call with journalists that the bank had begun making adjustments to its business operations to accommodate changing economic conditions.
"We've been very thoughtful about the pacing of our hiring," he said.
Citigroup's revenue was $ 18.6 billion, slightly lower than the previous quarter but a bit higher than its third-quarter revenue a year ago. But its corporate lending revenue decreased by 6 percent from a year earlier.
Citigroup's business customers have been showing "pause," Mr. Mason said, "in terms of whether they actually want to invest in building out facilities or operations, pause in terms of whether they want to consider entering into new markets."
That was a subtle but significant admission that the slowdown was affecting Citigroup's business.
The bank's chief executive, Michael Corbat, had been saying for months that its global footprint allowed it to take advantage of shifting trade routes so that the president's tariffs did not actually hurt the bank. He offered a more troubled view on Tuesday during a call with analysts.
"It has caused a slowdown in terms of trade," Mr. Corbat said of the trade war. "If we could start to get some clarity on some of these things, where I think businesses can have some more surety on the future, our trade business would definitely benefit from that."
Wells Fargo reported $ 22 billion in revenue for the quarter, slightly more than the $ 21.9 billion it generated in the same three months a year ago, and said it had $ 50 million left over from what it had set aside for loan losses in the most recent quarter.
And the bank's chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, pointed to a different concern that was closer to home for his business clients. "To date, while our customers are cautious, the most common concern they identify is their ability to hire enough qualified workers," he said on a call with analysts.
Wells Fargo, the country's fourth-largest bank, is still operating under growth restrictions imposed by its regulators, and its per-share earnings of 92 cents were lower than analysts' expectations because of expenses from legal woes stemming from a series of scandals that began to come to light in 2016.
The bank has continued to stumble lately. Its chief executive stepped down suddenly in March not long after lawmakers grilled him over lingering problems, and The New York Times reported in August that customers whose accounts had been closed were still being charged fees for activity after the closing date. The bank's interim chief executive, C. Allen Parker, told analysts that Wells Fargo was still looking into the matter.
The bank's new chief executive, Charles W. Scharf, starts next week.
Wells Fargo reported a $ 1.6 billion charge for legal expenses related to "one of the largest lingering issues related to sales practices," Mr. Shrewsberry said, but he declined to go into details.
Kate Kelly contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Readers discuss David Brooks's portrayal of a supporter of the president.
To the Editor:
Re "Why Trump Voters Stick With Him" (column, Oct. 4):
David Brooks unabashedly ignores differences among America's population in his imagined conversation between "Urban Guy" and "Flyover Man." Americans outside the Beltway aren't a homogeneous monolith. Lumping together Michigan factory workers, Arizona retirees, disenfranchised African-Americans, flood-ravaged Nebraska farmers and insolvent college students fails to reflect multiple differences of opinion and circumstance. These populations are far more disparate than Mr. Brooks's East Coast media cohort.
Trump voters also are not a monolithic group. Assuming they're all angry, underinformed bumpkins belies his support from greedy corporatists more concerned with personal wealth than national solutions. Where's the fictional conversation with the C.E.O. aware that Mr. Trump is a traitorous grifter but voting for him to maintain his favorable tax rate? Dark money enriching Mr. Trump affects our democracy more than flyover angst.
William J. Andres

To the Editor:
David Brooks's imagined conversation with Flyover Man was quite telling. Those of us who consider ourselves liberals or even moderates need to listen with open minds. Heeding the wisdom of Mr. Brooks's imaginings may be the only means of winning the election in 2020. We as liberals cannot continue to think (and act) as though we have all the answers. We simply do not! That kind of arrogance must end.
Jerry L. Simpson
West Thornton, Colo.
To the Editor:
David Brooks's characterizations of Trump supporters don't elicit my sympathy. Struggle and disappointment are not unique to white Americans in the middle of the country. People everywhere deal with job loss, family chaos and communities coming apart. One of the things that makes urban-me mad is the fact that my kids can't afford to live in this town where they -- and I -- grew up.
Whites in rural America have no special privilege to justify their nihilism. Life is difficult for everyone. Deal with it. Grow up.
Louise Specht
Berkeley, Calif.
To the Editor:
I grew up on a small farm in Canton, Miss. My family grew hay, raised cows and rode horses. We drove 20 miles to get to the nearest Kroger. My first car was a truck. My "Red America" is more nuanced and complicated than David Brooks cares to see.
My Republican father does watch NASCAR and S.E.C. football. He also took my family on vacations to Paris, Ontario and Mérida. My mother bought my sister and me clothes from Walmart. She also filled our shelves with books about art, history and religion. I was raised in flyover country, and I grew up to be a Democrat (as did, I presume, most of the 40 percent of Mississippians who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016).
There are plenty of non-Trump voters in "Trump country." There are plenty of Trump voters, too. I don't recognize any of them in Mr. Brooks's column.
Ashley Locke
Nashville
To the Editor:
Why is it always Flyover Man and Urban Guy? Doesn't this conversation just add to the polarization in our nation rather than explain it? How about a conversation between Moderate Meg and Fundamentalist Florence or between Small-Town Sam and Big-City Sarah? Let's hear some women's voices discuss the Trump impeachment.
Instead of stridency and grievance -- which we heard from David Brooks -- I bet there would be more and quieter expressions of sorrow, loss and concern as we each struggle with our humanity and with the pain of who we are as a nation.

Texto completo: So I watched the Democrats’ debate Tuesday night, all three hours of it, which probably makes me a loser. But here are some winners and losers, as I saw them.
Winners
Former Vice PresidentJoe Biden: He’s old, but he looked energetic and spoke clearly. He made a few errors — who’s “clipping coupons” in “the stock market”? But in general, he was forceful and seemed knowledgeable. In particular, he nailed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on how her health care plan would increase taxes on the middle class. And he was surprisingly sensible in dismissing “court packing” schemes. His final remarks were a bit over the top, but after three hours I’d probably have been raving, too.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii: When she challenged her colleagues who wanted an “end to endless wars” but who were also criticizing President Donald Trump from withdrawing troops from Syria, she didn’t back down, and blasted The New York Times and a CNN contributor for calling her a “Russian asset” for criticizing what she called the “regime change war” in Syria. She then challenged Warren, who says we shouldn’t have troops in the Middle East at all, on the issue. On this and other issues, she was firm, clear, and was willing to buck the herd. And in her closing remarks, quoting Lincoln, she said, “I don’t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans. ”
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana: He made mincemeat of former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who dodged a question from Anderson Cooper on how he would enforce a ban on assault weapons. Beto was left looking flustered and trying to claim that Mayor Pete was insensitive to victims of violence, which was a bad look for him.
A liberal's take: Bernie Sanders is big winner in Democratic debate: Scorecard from columnist Jason Sattler
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont: A guy who can have a heart attack and come back a few weeks later, yelling louder than anyone else for three hours, is winning. He was asked about his health, and he answered loudly, and then charmingly thanked his post-attack well-wishers. And he scored on Biden with his remarks about bipartisan support for the Iraq War.
Losers
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas: Numerous fellow candidates criticized him for his “hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15” remarks. Between that and the drubbing that Mayor Pete administered, he had a very bad night.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: Overall, her manner was noticeably stiffer and less comfortable than the other candidates, and O’Rourke, despite having a bad night, landed a telling shot when he accused her of “being punitive” and pitting one part of America against another. It was a fair charge, and it hurt; she looked flustered as she limply said she didn’t think she was punitive. Also, as several of her colleagues pointed out, she repeatedly dodged questions about whether she would increase taxes on the middle class. She also dodged Kamala Harris’ question about Trump and Twitter. And her delivery reminds me more and more of Hillary Clinton, which seems unpromising.
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro: Several times I forgot he was even on the stage for 30 minutes or more.
Tom Steyer: Everyone on the stage was hating on billionaires, and he was the only billionaire on stage.
Russian President Vladimir Putin: I don’t think this many Democrats have stood on a stage and promised to stand against Russian infiltration in my lifetime. Seriously, it’s a huge pivot from when President Barack Obama mocked Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 for calling Russia our "biggest geopolitical threat. "
Honorable mention
Andrew Yang: He responded to Sanders’ federal jobs program by noting that “most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. ” True!
Final observation: The crowd was surprisingly quiet, but all the biggest applause lines related to abortion.

Housing, human dignity and a ‘state of emergency’

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?
Graham Walker is executive director of the Independent Institute, based in Oakland.

'Completely despicable': Tulsi Gabbard rips CNN and New York Times during their presidential debate

Texto completo: Democratic Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ripped into the media outlets hosting Tuesday's Democratic primary debate for how they have covered her and other veterans.
Responding to a question about the conflict in Syria, the 38-year-old Iraq War veteran shamed both politicians and members of the media for promulgating "regime change war" in Syria, calling out CNN and the New York Times in particular.
"First of all," Gabbard began, "we've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria. Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war."
Gabbard then singled out the New York Times and CNN, saying, "Not only that, but, New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable."
Gabbard then pledged that, if elected president, she would put a stop to such wars by "ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege," pinpointing those leveled by Saudi Arabia against Yemen. She also said the United States must stop supporting terrorists like al Qaeda. She then called on the front-runner, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to join her in calling for an end to the Syrian war.

Biden, Warren, Sanders face scrutiny at Democratic debate

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- Joe Biden is facing baseless -- but persistent-- allegations of wrongdoing overseas that could undermine his argument that he's best positioned to defeat the president. Bernie Sanders is recovering from a heart attack that raised questions about his ability to withstand the vigor of a presidential campaign. And Elizabeth Warren is fending off new scrutiny of her biography.

A dozen Democratic presidential candidates will meet on Tuesday for the most crowded presidential debate in modern history. But it's the three leading candidates -- Biden, Sanders and Warren -- who face the most intense spotlight that could expose glaring liabilities in their quest for the White House.

The debate marks the first time the candidates will meet since the House moved forward with an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. While they are united on that issue, the debate will again expose a political party struggling to coalesce around a unifying message or messenger with the first primary contest just over three months away. The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, will be held in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

The White House hopefuls will represent the political and personal diversity that has come to define the Democratic Party of 2019: four women, four people of color, an openly gay man and an age range that spans four decades.

Sanders, a Vermont senator, will be under pressure to prove he has the physical and mental stamina to stand on a podium for three hours less than two weeks after suffering a heart

attack. Age was already a concern for the 78-year-old even before he was taken to a Nevada hospital earlier this month and had two stents put in to clear a clogged artery in his heart.

Sanders and his allies insist the health scare has only strengthened his commitment to the 2020 contest -- and his case for his signature health care plan, "Medicare for All." Sanders plans to note, as he has in recent days, that millions of Americans without health insurance could have been forced into bankruptcy -- or worse -- under the same circumstances.

"Bernie is a political marathon runner," said Sanders' confidante RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of National Nurses United. "I think the debate is going to be a great reassurance to the public."

The stakes are also high for Warren, Sanders' ideological ally, who stands on the debate stage for the first time as a front-runner, a status that makes her a top target of rivals in both political parties.

Biden, 76, and others have jabbed her intense focus on detailed liberal policies that may be difficult to implement with a divided Congress. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has highlighted the absence of a specific Warren health care plan; she has embraced Sanders' single-payer plan instead.

Republicans, meanwhile, have raised questions about whether Warren, 70, was actually forced from her teaching job because of a pregnancy nearly a half century ago, a claim that has become a core part of her personal message. Critics have pointed to past speeches and documents that suggest she left on her own. Warren is standing by her story.

The issue is particularly threatening because it's not the first time she has been accused of embellishing her biography. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, has already apologized for claiming Native American heritage decades ago. While it showed distant tribal ancestry, it also sparked a rebuke of Warren from some Native Americans for attributing tribal membership to genetics.

"The good news is that most attempts to attack Warren actually make her stronger," said Adam Green, a Warren supporter and co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. "Questioning whether she got fired for being pregnant ended up increasing her breadth and intensity of support, particularly among women."

Biden is no stranger to the pressure of front-runner status. But he enters his fourth debate under the weight of intensifying questions from Trump about his family's work overseas.

Without proof, Trump has repeatedly said that Biden's 49-year-old son, Hunter, improperly profited from work in Ukraine and China while the elder Biden was vice president. Trump also insists that Biden used his office to protect his son from allegations of wrongdoing.

There is no evidence to any of the claims, and some of Biden's Democratic rivals have defended him against Trump's baseless attacks. But he will almost certainly be asked by the debate moderators to defend himself.

Hunter Biden will participate in a series of interviews on ABC in the hours before the debate.

Biden addressed the situation over the weekend, promising to bar family members from occupying any office within the White House if elected. But he has yet to address Trump's allegations facing a national debate audience.

How he fares could determine whether he maintains his place atop the crowded field.

Many other candidates, meanwhile, are fighting for their very political survival.

Texto completo: Warren and Biden lead pack as Sanders slips, according to new Quinnipiac University Poll
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are deadlocked as the top challengers for the Democratic primary vote, according to a new poll released Monday by Quinnipiac University.
The poll, which was released the day before the next Democratic debate, found Warren in the lead, with 30% of the vote among Democratic and independent voters who lean Democratic, and Biden close behind at 27%. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.
Among other candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders lagged at just 11% of voters' support, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg had 8% and Sen. Kamala Harris was favored by 4% of voters surveyed.
"For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm," Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement. "Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate."
Warren also secured the lead for the candidate with the best policy ideas, receiving 40% of support among voters, compared to 16% of support for Biden's policy ideas and 12% for that of Sanders.
But despite Warren's seeming advantages, 48% of voters say that Biden has the best chance of beating President Donald Trump, compared to the 21% of voters who believe Warren is the most electable.
Favorability ratings for Biden and Warren among all registered voters continue to be mixed, according to the poll, though Sanders is "underwater" at 39% favorable and 47% unfavorable.
As the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine proceeds in the U.S. House of Representatives, a slim majority of registered voters (51% to 45%) approve of the investigation, though they are split on whether or not he should be impeached. Forty-six percent of voters support of impeachment while 49% are opposed.
The poll also found that while two-thirds of voters say that it is unacceptable for the president of the United States to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, only 44% believe that the action constitutes an impeachable offense.
The poll, which was conducted from Oct. 11-13, surveyed 1,195 self-identified registered voters.
The top 12 Democratic candidates will appear in the next party debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. The debate begins at 8 p.m. and is co-hosted by CNN and the New York Times. The debate will be broadcast by CNN and livestreamed by both CNN and the Times.

Democratic candidates focus on Trump, issues facing Ohio

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – It's debate week in Ohio. And national Democrats want you to know they're not going to abandon the state when it's over.
Today, 12 Democratic presidential hopefuls will debate in the Columbus suburb Westerville. The location is said to represent Democrats' inroads in the suburbs and its commitment to campaign in the state that Donald Trump won in 2016 by 8 points.
Issues such as Medicare for all and the Green New Deal have dominated the national narrative around the Democratic primary. But they were near absent during the Ohio Democratic Party's state dinner Sunday.
Instead, party officials and a handful of 2020 presidential candidates addressing the crowd spent much of their time attacking Trump, pledging to address climate change and urging action on gun control and the opiate addiction crisis.
The five candidates – who have polled in single digits in recent weeks – delivered messages tailored to Ohio.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar stressed her ability to win Republican-leaning areas. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg likened the Trump presidency to a TV show, and in a few short months, "You get to pick up the remote and change the channel to something better."
Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan said Democrats shouldn't be afraid to voice support for labor unions. Businessman Tom Steyer noted a recent spate of overdose deaths in the county. Businessman Andrew Yang started his speech with a stat about manufacturing automation correlating with support for Trump.
"It's been an interesting campaign to be a candidate from Ohio because it seems like it's all happening here," said Ryan, the only candidate of the five who won't be on the debate stage Tuesday.
More than 25,000 people requested free tickets to the debate from the party; only a few hundred were available.
The state and national party organized events across the state before and after the debate. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez will meet General Motors workers on strike in West Chester, farmers in central Ohio and gun violence survivors in Dayton. Candidates extended their stay by a few days to campaign here.
Republicans have painted the Democratic field as too far left and out-of-touch with most voters, especially Ohioans who elected Trump in 2016.
"From supporting a bogus impeachment witch hunt, to advocating for failed socialist policies, the Democrats' radical agenda is taking center stage in Ohio," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said in a statement. "But no matter the candidate, not one 2020 wannabe will stack up to President Trump's record of success in the Buckeye State."
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper refuted that idea, saying Democrats are with the mainstream on big issues such as health care, guns and climate change.
"They want to keep the Affordable Care Act, expand it, do better – others want to go further. It's a debate between how do we broaden access," Pepper told reporters before the dinner.
"Donald Trump and the Republicans want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act entirely."
Perez said the party will invest in Ohio because he thinks Democrats can win here. The message, he said, is simple: "We have your back on the issues that matter most."
CNN will host the Oct. 15 debate with The New York Times.

A Dozen Debaters: The Biggest Stage Yet

Texto completo: Tuesday will be the biggest presidential primary debate in history. Twelve Democratic candidates will be stuffed on stage with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts again at the center. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will be scrutinized following his heart attack. Senator Kamala Harris of California will try to reverse her fortunes. And second-tier candidates will seek to do something, anything to ensure a November debate spot. But being the aggressor has yet to pay off in the primary debates. Ms. Harris's June confrontation with Mr. Biden resulted in a temporary high. Former housing secretary Julián Castro's September attack on Mr. Biden's memory seemed to backfire. The question headed into the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night: Can anyone make a splash without being the one who ends up soaked? SHANE GOLDMACHER and ADRIANA RAMIĆ
Dynamics to Watch
The Leading Candidates
For the second straight time, these two will be standing side-by-side, and there is some political incentive for Mr. Biden to take on Ms. Warren more assertively and try to slow her steady momentum in the polls. In the opening minutes of last month's debate, Mr. Biden tried to frame their disagreements -- "she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack" -- but he did not press the point.
Buttigieg's Sharper Edge
So far, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., has mostly been Mr. Nice Guy on stage, satisfied with delivering set pieces and soliloques that would fit nicely in the scripts of "The West Wing." But he has sharpened his tone of late to sell himself as a leading moderate alternative to Mr. Biden. Most notably, he has called Ms. Warren "evasive" on health care -- one of the central issues of the primary. Remarkably few Democrats have confronted Ms. Warren so far. Will Mr. Buttigieg buck the trend?
From Antagonist to Defender
Ms. Harris was Mr. Biden's fiercest antagonist at the first debate. Of late, she has turned into something of a defender. "Leave Joe Biden alone" has become her mantra when asked about his son Hunter's business in Ukraine. Last debate, Ms. Harris tried to focus on President Trump. Yet her performance did not arrest her decline and now she has retrenched to Iowa. How will she seek advantage this time?
Billionaire vs. the Anti-Billionaires
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have built their populist campaigns running against the billionaire class. Now they get to run against an actual billionaire in Tom Steyer, who has been practicing for the debate in theaters he has rented out in San Francisco. The twist here is that Mr. Steyer is actually aligned with the progressive wing of the party on many issues -- he was an early champion of impeachment, for instance -- and is as likely to focus on Mr. Biden as the leaders on the left.
The Unqualified
(For Next Debate)
The criteria for November's stage are stricter than October and these four candidates need a big polling bump to qualify: Mr. Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas. For the top-tier candidates, it may make more sense to hold their fire until the stage is less crowded. But for this set, it may be now or never. Because of that, this grouping is expected to be the most aggressive candidates onstage.
A Moderate's Moment?
In the last two debates, Ms. Klobuchar has taken a pass on directly confronting her more liberal rivals, despite being given ample opportunity by the moderators. Now that she is far from guaranteed to make the next debate, this would seem like the moment for Ms. Klobuchar to enunciate who the "extremes" are that she often refers to in politics.
Guns and Young Guns
Last debate, Mr. O'Rourke made an impression with his impassioned pitch that, "Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15." Mr. Buttigieg said on CNN that the clip would play into the hands of Republicans. Mr. O'Rourke shot back on Twitter, "Let's have the courage to say what we believe." Now they can debate in person.
The Wait and See
Both Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and businessman Andrew Yang punched their tickets to the November debate in recent days, lessening the pressure to perform this time. Mr. Booker's debate showings have been well-reviewed, but he has neither popped in the polls nor shown the steady upward momentum of Ms. Warren. Mr. Yang has found a following -- he outraised Mr. Booker by $ 4 million in the last quarter -- but has yet to prove he is a viable option.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Readers react to Senator Elizabeth Warren's account of the loss of a teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant.
To the Editor:
Re "Warren Details Account of Losing Teaching Job Because of a Pregnancy" (news article, Oct. 9):
The women nodding and wincing at Elizabeth Warren's account of losing her teaching job because of pregnancy aren't just those of us who remember when it was perfectly legal to say the children/passengers/customers/clients will be uncomfortable having to look at you in your "condition."
Joining us are all the pregnant employees today who find out that their employers break the law with impunity, or that the law doesn't cover them. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act applies only to businesses with 15 or more employees, and the Family and Medical Leave Act to those with at least 50.
And the problem isn't just job loss. Half of female workers don't get any pay while they are out having the baby. Not surprisingly, nearly one in four go back to work within two weeks.
As for paternity leave, most companies don't offer it. Adoption leave is spotty. Barriers for same-sex couples include legal parental status if they are not married.
And did I mention that child care often costs more than college tuition?
Fortunately, women don't just nod and wince. We organize and we vote.

To the Editor:
I was an elementary-school teacher in Michigan in 1969 (two years before Elizabeth Warren's experience) when I became pregnant with my second child, who was due July 1. I avoided discussing my pregnancy and did not reveal the due date, saying I would have to check with the doctor.
I knew that in those days I would be forced to leave my teaching position if I were visibly pregnant. I also sewed my own clothes in a larger than normal size to conceal my pregnancy.
It may be hard to imagine being threatened with loss of a teaching position because you "showed," but that is how it was in 1969.

To the Editor:
For my first teaching job for the 1970-71 school year, I was asked by a male administrator, "What form of birth control do you use?" Deeply embarrassed, but desperate to be hired, I answered, "Birth control pills." I was given the job.

Texto completo: President Trump "strongly" condemned the fake video of him killing members of the media and his critics that aired at a pro-Trump conference before seeing the video in question.
America Priority, a pro-Trump group, hosted a three-day conference at Trump National Doral Miami last week. A video was played during the conference that featured Trump's head superimposed on the body of a person opening fire in the "Church of Fake News," in which he can be seen shooting media outlets and specific political opponents.
"Re: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham stated on Twitter Monday morning.
Tweet
America Priority released a statement Monday morning claiming that "an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19. This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers." It goes on to criticize the New York Times for "not reporting[ing] on any of the sanctioned events in the article."
Both Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, and CNN, one of the networks that was featured in the video, called on the president to denounce it.
Tweet
The Trump campaign also distanced themselves from the video saying that they "do not condone violence."

Fusion GPS to publish book on Steele dossier

Texto completo: Fusion GPS announced the November release date of a book on its 2016 investigation into Donald Trump's ties to Russia, promising to shed new light on British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier about the future president.
The Washington, D.C.-based opposition research firm's book, announced Monday, is expected to come a few weeks after release of a report into the origins of the investigation into Trump and Russia, which has shadowed his presidency since taking office in January 2017. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report is expected to cover allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the FBI and the Department of Justice — including the government’s reliance on Steele’s dossier to obtain surveillance warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor Trump campaign associate Carter Page.
Random House, publisher of Crime in Progress: Inside the Steele Dossier and the Fusion GPS Investigation of Donald Trump, promised the book would illustrate “the never-before-told inside story of the high-stakes, four-year-long investigation into Donald Trump’s Russia ties — culminating in the Steele dossier, and sparking the Mueller report — from the founders of political opposition research company Fusion GPS.”
Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, the book’s co-authors, are former Wall Street Journal reporters who co-founded the firm. The duo has been largely silent over the past couple years, with the exception of occasional interviews and New York Times op-eds condemning “Republicans’ fake investigations.”
The Steele dossier, which included salacious descriptions of Trump's activities in Moscow as a businessman before he became president, has been a political rorschach test into views of the Russia investigation. Trump supporters largely view it as an unverified raw file of information aimed at undermining the legitimacy of his presidency, while critics contend its main assertions have stood up well over time.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier. Fusion GPS was hired by Clinton's campaign and the DNC through the Perkins Coie law firm. Fusion GPS then hired Steele, who allegedly reached out to Russian sources to put together his dossier.
Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook said they received briefings about Fusion GPS's findings during 2016. But watchdog groups allege the Clinton campaign purposely concealed the hiring of Fusion GPS and Steele by reporting the payments it made to Perkins Coie as “legal services” without mentioning opposition research. Perkins Coie was paid over $12 million between 2016 and 2017 for its work representing Clinton and the DNC. According to congressional testimony from Simpson, Fusion GPS was paid $50,000 per month from Perkins Coie, and Steele was paid roughly $168,000 by Fusion GPS.

David Leonhardt: Impeaching Clinton didn’t hurt Republicans

Texto completo: Conventional wisdom holds that the Republican Party suffered a big political penalty for impeaching Bill Clinton in 1998. But that’s not quite right. Republicans paid a modest, short-term penalty, while the costs to the Democratic Party appear to have been larger and longer-lasting.
This history has obvious relevance today. As in the 1990s, the economy is growing, yet many Americans are uncomfortable with the president’s behavior. And although the actions of Clinton and President Donald Trump are far from equivalent, there are similarities: Both men acted inappropriately (being dishonest under oath about an Oval Office affair with a 22-year-old subordinate; seeking foreign interference to benefit a reelection campaign), and most Americans disapprove of both forms of misbehavior.
Two decades ago, the Republicans’ decision to impeach Clinton focused the country’s attention on his behavior rather than on the economy or their own unpopular policies. The same dynamic could easily repeat itself in the coming months: Talking about Trump and Ukraine is certainly better for Democrats than talking about a ban on private health insurance.
Since House Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry three weeks ago, there has been a lot of hand-wringing about the potential downsides. But Democrats should move forward with confidence. They are doing the right thing on principle — as well as following the path that has the best chance of political success.
It’s worth taking a few minutes to look back at the Clinton case. House Republicans began impeachment proceedings in October 1998, a few weeks before midterm elections. Republicans expected to make major gains in those midterms, thanks partly to the scandal, and failed to do so. In response, Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the House, resigned, and the conventional wisdom was born.
But talk of impeachment probably wasn’t the main reason for the Republican disappointment. The economy was booming, and polls throughout 1998 showed a tight race, not a wave, as Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia has noted. On Election Day, Republicans did perfectly fine. They won the national popular vote and kept House control. Their Senate majority was unchanged.
Afterward, at the insistence of Tom DeLay, a Republican leader, the House impeached Clinton. Doing so ensured that the affair and his efforts to cover it up — like the angry “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky” line that he delivered with Al Gore by his side — dominated the news for months.
While the Senate acquitted Clinton, impeachment became its own stain on him, much worse than the vague “censure” many Democrats preferred. He was only the third president to endure an impeachment inquiry, ignominiously joining Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. Impeachment, as schoolchildren learn, is what happens when a president behaves very badly.
Americans continued to approve of Clinton’s job performance, polls showed, but many also said they disapproved of him personally. The discomfort helped define the 2000 presidential race, in the views of both Gore’s campaign and George W. Bush’s.
Bush made it his mantra to “restore honor and dignity” to the White House. Gore chose Joe Lieberman, arguably Clinton’s highest-profile Democratic critic, as a running mate. “Everybody who said the economy was so good, you should just run on Clinton’s record — they weren’t sitting in focus groups in swing states, listening to these swing voters who were concerned there would be a continuation” of unethical behavior, Tad Devine, a Gore adviser, recently said to The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein.
Shortly after the election, Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution wrote: “Most Americans were appalled by his behavior; he never regained the personal standing he enjoyed before the scandal.” Had Clinton campaigned heavily in the 2000 race, Mann added, “The evidence was overwhelming that he would have done more harm than good with swing voters in battleground states.”
True, Gore was a flawed candidate, and a stronger one may well have overcome the scandal. But it did make his job harder. He lost a large share of voters who approved of Clinton’s performance but disapproved of Clinton personally, as Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg told me. And loyal Republican voters, frustrated by Clinton’s acquittal, turned out in big numbers, Matthew Dowd, a top Bush adviser, has said. In the end, Gore won the popular vote only narrowly, despite the strongest economy in decades, and lost the election.
Over the next eight years, Republicans continued to hold the White House and usually controlled Congress. Only Bush’s unpopular presidency — Hurricane Katrina, the Iraq War, the financial crisis — delivered control back to the Democrats. It’s impossible to know how things would have played out if Republicans had skipped impeaching Clinton, of course, but there is little sign they paid much of a price, if any, for doing so.
Today, every argument for impeachment is stronger than in 1998. On the politics, a greater share of Americans already support impeachment than ever did in 1998, while Trump’s approval rating is a meager 42%. On the substance, I think that Clinton’s behavior was in a gray area of “high crimes and misdemeanors”: odious, illegal but largely personal. Trump’s behavior is spectacularly impeachable, involving one of the founders’ central justifications: foreign interference.
Trump deserves to be impeached on the merits, and, if he is, it will probably further sully him in the eyes of swing voters, much as it did to Clinton. The big question now is how well will Democrats handle the process. They should move quickly to hold more public hearings, rather than the private sessions they held last week, so Americans can better understand how Trump has perverted American foreign policy and national security for his own benefit.
Ultimately, impeachment may well hurt some Democrats from Trump-friendly districts, much as it hurt several Republicans 20 years ago. But it is also very likely to damage Trump — as his own sullen reaction suggests that he realizes. That’s a trade-off worth making.

Texto completo: En 2020, la comunidad latina romperá un nuevo récord y liderará a los grupos minoritarios con mayor poder electoral al sumar más de 32 millones de posibles votantes . A todos ellos, el único candidato de este grupo social, Julián Castro , les tiene un mensaje claro: registrarse e ir a votar.
En entrevista, Castro destaca el valor de los hispanos en los Estados Unidos y cómo esa fuerza electoral puede inclinar la balanza. Según los últimos datos del Pew Research Center, de 2016 a 2020, el número de votantes latinos aumentaría alrededor de cinco millones, lo que representará el 13% de los sufragios para elegir al nuevo presidente.
“La comunidad latina debe participar en la elección, no hay momento más importante que ahora” , expresó Castro. “Es claro que necesitamos reemplazar a este presidente, por un presidente que realmente considere la necesidad de crear oportunidades para todos, en un Estados Unidos que pertenece a todos”.
El exfuncionario de la administración de Barack Obama , tiene 45 años y expresa con claridad que una de sus prioridades –aunque no la única– son los inmigrantes en este país, considerando su propia historia, mejor dicho, la historia de su abuela, Victoria , quien migró de México a los siete años como indocumentada. La suya es la historia de millones de personas. Castro lo tiene claro y siente que tiene una deuda con ellos como político, pero sin dejar de lado que necesita convencer al electorado de que no solamente lucharía por ellos. No es un reto sencillo.
“Quiero representar a todos los estadounidenses, pero al mismo tiempo, considerando mi origen, me he dado cuenta de que… en este momento, muchos los latinos hemos sido objetivo de esta Administración y tenemos que hacer grandes cambios para asegurarnos, todos puedan encontrar sus oportunidades y alcanzar sus sueños”, expresó. “He estado enfocado particularmente en la visión de que en Estados Unidos todos cuentan y cada quien puede ser exitoso por su trabajo”.
La pregunta es obligada, quizá incómoda, pero obligada. ¿No cree que puedan verlo como un aspirante enfocado solamente en inmigración? En el diálogo que se desarrolla vía telefónica desde Texas, el demócrata respira, pero es contundente.
“No”, expresa escuetamente, para luego acotar: “He hablado de otros aspectos con el mismo énfasis que éste, he hablado de educación, de economía, del plan de salud, reforma policiaca… en los medios me enfocan como que estoy enfocado en inmigración, pero no es el caso” .
Su plataforma electoral es amplia y no comienza con inmigración, sino con un programa para protección de niños sin familia y sigue con el empoderamiento de los sindicatos , plan de justicia para granjeros , proyecto para proteger a las empleadas domésticas , plan económico para las familias trabajadoras , plan ambiental contra cambio climático y protección de especies, lucha contra terrorismo doméstico (como grupos supremacistas), atender a comunidades indígenas , reformar el sistema judicial , mejorar la educación y asegurar el derecho a la vivienda .
Castro cree que puede lograr un gran cambio para este país y pone su historia personal y política como ejemplo.
“He demostrado en toda mi carrera que soy ese tipo de líder y que tengo un gran plan” , insistió. “La comunidad latina es parte de esta dinámica y de las posibilidades de este país”.
Tras conseguir donaciones de 130,000 personas y obtener un apoyo del 2 por ciento en cuatro encuestas aprobadas por la Convención Nacional Demócrata entre el 28 de junio y el 1 de octubre, Castro logró su pase al cuarto debate, que será este martes 15 de octubre a las 8:00 p.m. del Este desde la Universidad de Otterbein, Columbus, Ohio, y será transmitido por CNN y The New York Times.
Es la gran oportunidad para este aspirante latino para convencer a más votantes de las primarias que debe ser el candidato presidencial en 2020, pero el reto es complicado, considerando que en las encuestas de intención de votos está lejos de los líderes: el exvicepresidente Biden, la senadora Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) –cada vez más cercana al puntero– y el senador Bernie Sanders .
Los esfuerzos de Castro y su equipo de campaña están enfocados no solamente en el evento de este martes, sino también en el próximo debate que será transmitido por MSNBC, en colaboración con The Washington Post, el 20 de noviembre desde Georgia.
Aquellos que ya tienen casi asegurado su pase son el exvicepresidente Biden, el alcalde de Indiana, Pete Buttigieg , la senadora Warren y el senador Sanders.
Los demás deben lograr 165,000 donantes únicos, incluidos 600 repartidos en 20 estados, y alcanzar el 3 por ciento en cuatro encuestas estatales o nacionales calificadas, además de lograr un 5 por ciento en dos encuestas estatales calificadas. Castro lucha por mantenerse en la carrera.
“Nuestra confianza es que mi campaña lo logre, tenemos hasta noviembre 12, es un gran desafío para todos los candidatos” , expresó.

“I will be attending the debate,” Gabbard posted today on Twitter, without offering further explanation.
Last week, Gabbard had posted a video message to social media in which she accused the the Democratic National Committee and corporate media of trying to rig the primary election “against the American people” in early voting states.

Texto completo: A Fort Worth police officer who fatally shot a black woman in her home while she played video games with her 8-year-old nephew was charged with murder Monday, just hours after he resigned from the force.
Aaron Dean, who is white, was booked into Tarrant County Jail on a $200,000 bond.
Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus said Dean would have been fired and is considered dishonorably discharged from the department. Kraus said the U. S. Justice Department will examine the case for possible civil rights violations.
Atatiana "Tay" Jefferson, 28, was shot through her bedroom window early Saturday by an officer responding to a call from a neighbor who was concerned because her doors were open.
Her family was relieved by Dean's arrest, said S. Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Jeffersons. He added the family "needs to see this through to a vigorous prosecution and appropriate sentencing. "
Who was Atatiana 'Tay' Jefferson: Fort Worth woman killed by cop represented 'honor, integrity'
Earlier Monday, family members held a news conference demanding that the officer be fired and criminally charged. Ashley Carr said her sister was killed by the officer's "reckless act," and the federal government should take over the investigation.
"There is simply no justification for his actions," she said. "We demand justice for Atatiana through an independent and thorough investigation. "
Jefferson's brother, Adarius Carr, said: "This man murdered someone. He should be arrested. "
Authorities arrested Dean at about 6 p. m. , Sgt. Chris Daniels said at a news conference on Monday night. Police are "diligently" conducting a criminal investigation of the incident, Daniels added, and are working with the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office.
"We understand that this is a tough and tragic event, not only for her family but for the community," Daniels said. "We value the trust that we've had with our community. We will continue to build that trust. "
Dean posted bail late Monday, CNN and the New York Times reported.
Investigators were scheduled to interview him Monday, police Lt. Brandon O’Neil said. Police also released audio of a neighbor's call to a nonemergency phone number that sent officers to the home.
Jefferson worked as a pharmaceutical sales representative. The officer had served on the force for 18 months. The shooting took place less than two weeks after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was convicted of murdering Botham Jean, a black man shot in 2018 as he ate ice cream in his home.
Merritt said police not only violated Jefferson's rights but also made "common sense" mistakes. He called release of a photo of a gun found in the bedroom "obscene," saying no connection had been made between the gun and the shooting.
Mayor Betsy Price agreed Monday that the gun found in Jefferson's home was "irrelevant. "
"Atatiana was a victim . . . unjustly taken from her family," Price said.
Merritt said the victim's nephew told him the duo had been up late playing "Halo" – with the doors open to enjoy the cool fall breeze – when they heard noise outside her bedroom window.
"They looked at each other and listened more intently when they heard it again," Merritt said in a social media post. "Someone was outside. "
Merritt said the nephew described how his aunt went to the window to see who was there.
"Suddenly a man's voice was screaming something he couldn't make out, and then 'bang,' " Merritt said. Jefferson fell to the floor. Merritt said he didn't ask the child what he saw next because he didn't want him "to have to relive that. "
"I’m hurt. I’m angry. I’m a little afraid when I’m honest," Merritt said. "I hate this happened to (the nephew). I hate it happened to Tay and her beautiful family. This has to stop now. Enough. "
O'Neil said neighbor James Smith called police at 2:23 a. m. Saturday, telling the dispatcher it was "not normal" for his neighbors to have the doors open and lights on at that hour.
Two officers arrived six minutes later. They did not park in front of the house, O'Neil said. Body camera video released by police shows officers, armed with guns and flashlights, circling the home. An officer stops at a window.
The video ends with an officer shouting, "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before the sound of one gunshot. Jefferson was killed with a bullet fired through her bedroom window.
O'Neil confirmed what the video appeared to show – that the officer never identified himself as police. He also confirmed that Jefferson's nephew was in the room.
Activist Cory Hughes said the community wanted more than a suspension for the officer.
"What we are looking for is for this officer not only to be fired but we are demanding that this officer be charged as well, like the criminal that he is," Hughes said. "This life mattered. This family matters. "

Age, health and impeachment: What to watch for in this week's Democratic debate

Texto completo: With the help of friends in four states — California, Iowa, New York and Massachusetts — I've been conducting a highly unscientific coffee shop poll of Democratic voters during the presidential campaign. Here's what I've heard lately: very little.
Despite a crush of news that would seem to affect the race, the candidates appear to be running in place. The buzz is fading. Yes, Sen. Elizabeth Warren inched up in the polls, and a few marginal candidates have dropped out, but for the most part, little has changed since Iowa farmers planted their corn last spring.
Three Democratic debates have not changed the big picture, but with actual primary voting beginning just 111 days after the next debate, and with many new topics to discuss, things could play differently on Tuesday on CNN.
Impeachment frenzy
Hard as it is to believe, the word "impeachment" was never spoken in the Democratic debate on Sept. 12. This time, it's likely to be the first topic brought up.
Of course, all the Democrats who will be on stage in Westerville, Ohio, now support the impeachment effort — with former Vice President Joe Biden adding his voice last week. “To preserve our Constitution, our democracy and our basic integrity,” Biden said, Trump “should be impeached. ” He added that the president has basically “indicted himself. ”
Democratic debate: Time for 2020 presidential candidates to get real on health care
But it won’t do any good to hear everyone echo Biden’s words and pledge support for the House’s impeachment investigation, nor will it help voters to hear each candidate blast the bad behavior of President Donald Trump and his henchmen. It would, however, be meaningful to find out which candidates favor prosecuting Trump after he leaves office, and who among them believes guidelines that prohibit indicting a sitting president should be changed. It might be worthwhile to ask candidates whether they fear that a party-line impeachment vote will energize Republicans in the 2020 campaign.
Biden and his son
The impeachment issue will open the door to questions about Biden’s son Hunter and the large sums he earned serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. To be clear, no matter how many ugly tweets Trump sends out, there is no proof whatsoever that Joe Biden or his son broke any laws. Yet, the cosmetics of Hunter Biden’s business dealings are unattractive. Will anyone on the debate stage go after the former vice president’s son? In previous debates, some have attacked Biden’s record concerning civil rights. Will Hunter’s situation be off limits? How will moderators from CNN and The New York Times handle this highly delicate matter?
Bernie Sanders' health
Sen. Bernie Sanders, 78, will take his place on the debate stage, presumably looking no worse for the wear after suffering a heart attack Oct. 1. The other candidates and moderators will immediately face a predicament similar to that involving Joe Biden’s son: Is Sanders’ health and age fair game?
In fact, Sanders will undoubtedly address his health whether asked about it or not. In a seven-minute video statement last Thursday, Sanders wisely sought to turn the negative of his heart condition into a positive regarding the importance, as he sees it, of "Medicare for All. " He said that lying in a Las Vegas hospital “made me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system. ”
Dear news media: Don't turn the Democratic debates into Trump-like Twitter fodder
Medical care and insurance aside, Sanders’ health emergency has reopened discussion about his fitness to serve as president well into his 80s, as well as the broader question of age for all the septuagenarian candidates — Warren (70), Trump (73), Biden (76), and Sanders (78). Fact is, it was a legitimate issue even before Sanders was stricken. Voters and commentators tend to dwell on how vigorous and fit a candidate seems rather than focusing on the odds of medical complications and diminished faculties that are simply a part of aging. Will moderators challenge the older candidates on the age issue? And will any of the younger candidates dare to make age part of the debate?
Elizabeth Warren's Rise
Since the last debate, Warren has improved her position in most national polls and now finds herself neck and neck with Biden. To date, the top three Democrats — Warren, Biden and Sanders — have been gentle with each other on the debate stage. Is Biden’s slump in both polling and fundraising enough to make him more aggressive this time? And will other candidates now go after Warren as she nears front-runner status?
The president's collapse
Although Trump's base — energized by prime-time hosts on Fox News — won’t concede it, his presidency is unraveling. Whether that results in impeachment by the House and a trial in the Senate, it is damaging Trump’s reelection prospects. At what point does that necessitate a shift by Democratic candidates? The more Trump does to defeat himself, the less Democrats need to flog an anti-Trump theme and the more they will need to find the best candidate to bring the nation together.
The early months of the campaign were focused on finding a fighter — someone who could go toe-to-toe with Trump. The greater need now might be to elect a healer — a new president who can somehow repair the political and social disagreements that are ripping the nation apart. Will that Democrat emerge on the stage in Ohio? My fear is no, but my hope is yes.

U.S. Learns Price of Access to Chinese Consumers

Texto completo: American tech companies want access to customers in China. But they're learning that can come with a lot of baggage.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hello, Bits readers, I'm Erin Griffith, a tech reporter filling in from New York. Here's what happened this past week in tech:
The Chinese government has increased pressure on foreign companies that don't toe the party line on protests in Hong Kong. That has created a minefield for American companies, Amy Qin and Julie Creswell wrote. First, the National Basketball Association apologized to China after a team executive tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters. Despite the apology, some Chinese sponsorships, broadcasts and preseason games were canceled.
Then Activision Blizzard, the gaming company, suspended a professional e-sports player for voicing his support for the protesters, saying it damaged the company's image. The move prompted a vigorous backlash from fans and lawmakers. And a group of Blizzard employees staged a walkout to protest the company's move.
Chinese media also attacked Apple for approving an app that lets Hong Kong protesters track police officers, leading to calls for a boycott of its products in China. On Wednesday night, Apple said it was withdrawing the app, HKmap.live, from its App Store just days after approving it because the authorities in Hong Kong said protesters were using it to attack the police.
That's all in just one week. Nike, Tiffany, Riot Games, Marriott, Zara, Delta and many others have also complied with China's requests.
I should note that one American group was defiant. The television show "South Park" issued a searing mock apology last Monday after it was banned from the country: "Like the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy." Ouch.
The escalation is set to the backdrop of an increasingly tense trade war. Writing for Opinion, Farhad Manjoo argued in a column that dealing with China wasn't worth the moral cost.
Facebook's political ad conundrum
Facebook's decision to not ban ads that spread political lies set off a fiery debate about whether the social media giant is shirking its democratic responsibilities.
The company gave the O.K. to an ad from the Trump campaign that falsely claimed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. offered Ukraine $ 1 billion in aid if the country pushed out the man investigating a company tied to Mr. Biden's son.
Cecilia Kang wrote that Facebook's decision, which was criticized in many circles, was further evidence that the company did not want to weigh in on political fights that would make it look like it was siding with one party.
Facebook isn't the only company to agree to run the ad. Twitter and YouTube also said it did not violate their policies.
Some observers supported the move, arguing that making political ads available to public dissection was more democratic than censorship. But others said it was "empowering propaganda," a craven play for ad dollars, bad for democracy and "toxic." Some called for regulation, and others pointed out contradictions in Facebook's policies. Chris Hughes, Facebook's co-founder, said the policy was the equivalent of siding with President Trump.
People haven't been willing to give Facebook the benefit of the doubt for years now. That doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon.
Start-up change of heart
In light of weak receptions for the initial public offerings of the highest-profile start-ups this year, a new gospel is spreading among Silicon Valley start-ups: Profits are cool!
In a novel shift, venture capitalists and start-ups are beginning to focus more on business fundamentals over cash-burning, top-line growth. It's especially true for companies with untested business models, including gig economy start-ups or those disrupting old-line industries like real estate, orthodontics and exercise bikes.
If this feels a bit familiar, it's because start-ups have undergone a "pivot to profit" moment every few years for more than a decade. In 2014, there were predictions of "dead unicorns" and markdowns from mutual fund investors. In 2016, venture investors warned start-ups to raise money before the market closed. And most famously, in 2008, Sequoia Capital presented a dire slide deck, titled "R.I.P. Good Times," designed to scare founders into preparing for the recession.
But despite a few blips along the way, things have gotten only bigger and more bubbly in the enchanted forest of start-up unicorns. Even the recession of 2008 didn't hit the tech industry that hard. Will this moment of austerity last? Investors are hopeful. But if recent history is a guide, I'm not holding my breath.

Texto completo: Anne Sacoolas fled Britain after she was suspected of being involved in a road crash that killed Harry Dunn, a British teenager.
LONDON -- The diplomatic immunity of Anne Sacoolas, the American woman who is a suspect in a road crash that killed Harry Dunn, a British teenager, is "no longer relevant" in the case, Britain's foreign secretary has said.
Ms. Sacoolas, the 42-year-old wife of a diplomat, fled Britain using diplomatic immunity after the police in Northamptonshire, England, suspected her of being the driver of a car that they say had been traveling on the wrong side of the road when it collided with a motorcycle ridden by Mr. Dunn, 19, in August.
Britain and the United States have been involved in a diplomatic tug-of-war over the case, but Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said in a letter to the Dunn family on Saturday that Ms. Sacoolas's immunity no longer applied because she had gone back to the United States.
"The U.K. Government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs. Sacoolas's case, because she has returned home," Mr. Raab said in the letter that was shared with The New York Times on Sunday.
"The U.S. have now informed us that they, too, consider that immunity is no longer pertinent," Mr. Raab said.
He added that the matter was now in the hands of the Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.
The news came as a spokesman for the Dunn family, Radd Seiger, said Ms. Sacoolas's lawyer had also been in touch and said she wanted to meet.
"She reached out to me yesterday and we've agreed that she and I will get together at the earliest possible convenience," Mr. Seiger said by phone on Sunday.
Ms. Sacoolas was said to be "devastated by this tragic incident," according to a statement made on her behalf by her lawyer, Amy Jeffress. "No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn's family," the statement said.
Ms. Jeffress was not immediately available for comment on Sunday.
Charlotte Charles, Harry Dunn's mother, told Sky News on Sunday that the apology was "the start of some closure" for the family.
"Having said that, as it's nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn't cut it," said Ms. Charles, who along with Tim Dunn, Harry Dunn's father, was traveling to the United States on Sunday.
Commenting on Mr. Raab's letter, Mr. Dunn said that "obviously we were right from the start." Harry Dunn's parents said this month that they would continue fighting to get justice in the case.
The crash occurred on Aug. 27 in Brackley, a town in Northamptonshire about 60 miles northwest of London and near a Royal Air Force base that hosts a United States Air Force communication station.
After the accident, Ms. Sacoolas told officers that she had no plans to travel, the police said, but her sudden departure prompted a diplomatic push-and-pull.
Britain made a formal request for a waiver of diplomatic immunity to the United States Embassy in London on Sept. 5. It was declined eight days later.
Saoirse Townshend, a London-based lawyer who specializes on extraditions, said in an email on Sunday that Britain could seek Ms. Sacoolas's extradition, but in order to do so, the Crown Prosecution Service would have to formally charge Ms. Sacoolas with a crime first.
Nick Vamos, another extradition lawyer, said by email that "it's not clear whether a U.S. court would extradite in these circumstances."
"However," he added, "Mrs. Sacoolas says she will voluntarily cooperate with the U.K. investigation, so extradition is unlikely to be needed."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said that he would appeal directly to President Trump for Ms. Sacoolas's return, and he raised the case in a phone call with Mr. Trump on Wednesday, according to a statement from the prime minister's office.
Mr. Trump expressed his condolences to Mr. Dunn's family and "agreed to work together to find a way forward."
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described the death as "a terrible accident," adding that it was "a very, very complex issue because we're talking about diplomatic immunity."
But he also expressed understanding for Ms. Sacoolas, suggesting that he had himself driven on the wrong side of the road in Britain.
"You know those are the opposite roads; that happens," he said. "I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did."
Priti Patel, the British home secretary, was criticized on social media on Sunday after she avoided answering whether Britain would push for Ms. Sacoolas's extradition.
Speaking to Andrew Marr on the BBC, Ms. Patel said that "this is an incredibly tragic case." She added that, "the fact of the matter is right now it very much seems that the lady in question wants to start cooperating with the discussions and obviously the investigations, and I think we should support that."
That apparent equivocation drew ire on Twitter. "Was that a yes or a no?" one user, Karen Law, wrote.
Another, Matthew Fraser, posted a question. "Ask Priti Patel how this American woman managed to get out of the UK in the first place," he said.

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the Olympics? July 24 to Aug. 9. U.S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U.S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list.Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471.50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics? There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U.S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends flying into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U.S.
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10- to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay? Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling." Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o.d.o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, recommends a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo? Shibuya Crossing Who knew a crosswalk could double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails from early July to early September.
Animal cafes Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
Other notable sights Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do? Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Getting around The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says. "It's just really expensive to take a taxi to transfer between distant regions."

Jennifer Aniston, Mariah Carey honored at women’s event BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. | Jennifer Aniston, Ellen DeGeneres, Awkwafina and more stars overcame a dysfunctional teleprompter to toast one another and their charities at a women’s luncheon Friday in Beverly Hills.
“I’m fine but Jen (Aniston) is freaking it back there,” DeGeneres said as harried staff struggled to fix the broken screens that just a few minutes earlier had Awkwafina nervously winging it (“I can do a little tech support,” she offered) before calling someone to just bring up her phone so she could read her speech manually.
But there’s nothing like a few comedians to handle technological issues with grace and humor. Both had the crowd in stiches despite the minor chaos happening around them.
Scorsese says he’s open-minded about Netflix film revolution
LONDON | Martin Scorsese said Sunday he’s keeping an open mind about the cinema “revolution” sparked by the rise of video streaming services, as his Netflix-backed mafia epic “The Irishman” closed the London Film Festival.
The director said the rise of streaming platforms was “an even bigger revolution than sound brought to cinema” because it “opens up the original conception of what a film is” and how it should be seen.
5 rappers removed from NYC festival at request of police
NEW YORK | Organizers of a hip-hop festival taking place in New York this weekend said Saturday they have dropped five rappers from the lineup at the request of police.
The New York Times reported that the performers were removed from the Rolling Loud festival after a New York Police Department official sent the organizers a letter citing safety concerns if the rappers took the stage.
The traveling Rolling Loud festival was scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at Citi Field in Queens on Saturday and Sunday and included major acts like Wu-Tang Clan and Meek Mill.
Big Sean’s foundation helps tackle student homelessness
DETROIT | Rapper Big Sean’s philanthropic foundation continues to support a program created to deal with student homelessness at Detroit’s Wayne State University.
The school recently announced a gift of $10,000 from Sean Anderson Foundation to the HIGH (Helping Individuals Go Higher) Program. The foundation created a $25,000 endowment for the program in 2016 and followed with financial gifts in 2017 and last year.
The HIGH Program, created in 2013, provides short-term help to students in need to provide some stability and help them complete their degree.
Big Sean , a Detroit native, formed the foundation in 2012 to help improve the quality of life for young people and their families.

Texto completo: The ivory gull is the only pure white gull. Small and stocky, it still sends a high whistle across the Arctic.
The polar bear is its best friend.
Likely, the gull will be extinct in 25 years. The polar bear may hold out a little longer.
Climate researcher Terry Root explained how both species are affected by climate change -- the polar bear directly and the ivory gull indirectly. Theirs is a story of what climate scientists call "cascading ecosystem collapse."
Root described the sequence of interdependent systems in a graphic way: "The gull made its living by cleaning up after polar bears. Polar bears would go out on the ice and they would kill a seal and they would fling the blood and guts everywhere.
"And ivory gull would go and clean up the blood and guts."
But as global temperatures rise, sea ice melts. Polar bears can't hunt on ice that's not there. If they can't hunt, they can't kill seals. Ivory gulls starve.
"It's devastating to the ivory gull," said Root.
It's not easy on polar bears either, of course, and they often have to choose between starvation or making dangerous treks swimming across many miles of open ocean in a mad search for ice and seals.
Root, a professor emerita at Stanford University, is a lead author of the "Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change 4th Assessment Report."
Together with the research team for that report, she was co-awarded the Nobel Prize with vice-president Al Gore in 2007. She was awarded the Spirit of Defenders Award for Science by Defenders of Wildlife in 2010 and has served on the National Audubon board of directors since 2010.
Root will give a talk on climate change at Randall Davey Audubon Center and Sanctuary in Santa Fe on Thursday (Oct. 10), 6 p.m. Her presentation, "Survival by Degrees: 389 Bird Species on the Brink," is sponsored by Audubon New Mexico.
Root's talk comes on the heels of devastating news. Blasting across media outlets in mid-September - from National Geographic to Scientific American and from The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio - came a bombshell: Since the '50s the population of birds has plummeted by nearly three billion across the United States and Canada.
That's a loss of three billion birds.
The New York Times science writer Carl Zimmer put it this way: "The results have shocked researchers and conservation organizations." The study was first published in the journal Science .
Habitat loss and pesticide use are the biggest culprits. In the report, common birds like sparrows, meadowlarks and robins are most at risk.
Echoing the theme of interconnected ecosystems, Zimmer summed up the role common birds play in nature. "Common bird species are vital to ecosystems, controlling pests, pollinating flowers, spreading seeds and regenerating forests," he wrote in his column, Matter.
"When these birds disappear, their former habitats often are not the same."
Root's Oct. 10 presentation will delve into the causes of climate change and also what we can do about it.
Solutions are what humans need most. We're already on track to surpass the Paris Agreement limited-warming threshold target of 2.7 degrees F (1.5 degrees C) by 2030.
"We know how temperature has changed since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and how that has affected sea level rise, drought and massive rainstorms," she said. "I talk about how it matches our models, exactly what we thought.
"I show how the model shows us completely, conclusively that what is happening [is] due to humans putting emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. They let sunlight pass through but prevent heat from leaving the atmosphere.
The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions reports on the sources and concentrations of seven major greenhouse gasses. Carbon dioxide (from natural sources, fossil fuel combustion and deforestation) and methane (from fossil fuel production, agriculture and landfills) are principal contributors to warming.
Root remains hopeful that humans can turn things around. And that actions like those of Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old activist who inspired the recent climate strikes across the globe, provide an example.
"I think we need to think outside the box like Greta has done. We need to get people to understand how important this is. Here is a woman that sailed instead of taking an airplane. And it made people stop and think. That's what I feel we need to do. We need to get people to stop and think."
Root shared some of the simple things individuals can do.
"It sounds trivial, I know, but if we start having Meatless Mondays, it starts people thinking about not eating beef. Livestock puts so many greenhouse gasses into the air."
She believes small actions add up. "Throw out all your incandescent light bulbs," she said. "Even Christmas lights. And make a pact that the very next car you buy is a plug-in or a hybrid."
"All of us can do things. Each of us can make a huge difference."

"Yes, we have them." This from the third place I tried. "Right here," he said, walking me to the pet section, pointing to an actual fuzzy yellow tennis ball wrapped in plastic. "My dog loves them."
What planet are we on?
If shopping doesn't amuse you there's always the joy of finding old words in new settings. Take the word curator, as in so-and-so is scheduled to curate an art show. Only now this familiar verb has gone viral. Lately, I've seen it used to describe someone who is curating one's life, one's memories, one's regrets, as in this sentence, which I found in a book review, "She had started to curate her mind." Originally, I spotted it in a news story about 42 priests in Buffalo who were accused of sexual abuse. The original list had names of 117 priests, but, as the Bishop's administrative assistant explained, "The list was curated to deceive the public."
"To curate" is the new "to obfuscate."
On a lighter note, what about the term "smart casual"? In case you've been reading Proust and hadn't noticed the change in language or appropriate behavior, this is a thing. I was invited to a party this summer where the invitation offered this as the suggested dress. "Smart casual" is "polished yet relaxed, garments that are elegant and comfortable," as opposed to "business casual" (that's a thing, too), without the suit and tie.
Then there's the word "literally." This used to be reserved for people of a certain sophistication, a certain élan. Now it's coming from the mouths of 7-year-olds. Or younger. "I
literally almost choked when I tasted almond butter," said one 5-year-old I know, so accustomed was he to peanut butter.
Where is this coming from? I assumed from the parents of said 5- and 7-year-old.
Maybe. But when did they - and the rest of us - start using it as a fill in for "figuratively"?
There's an answer, a 30-something told me the other day. It comes from a TV series from 2009 - "Parks and Recreation" - when Rob Lowe, playing Chris Taeger, used this word in an exaggerated form hundreds of times. There's even a T-shirt with the term. You can literally order and receive it in 24 hours.
Then there's the term for when you try to unsubscribe or get yourself off some email that just won't stop following you around. "You have been added to our suppression list," the response goes. I don't know about you but I've never had a good feeling about the word "suppression." I associate it with to quell or crush, as in liberal or communist activities.
Same with the word "misuse." Is this really what Thunderbolt wanted when they posted this note on the men's room in the W.E. Honey Park: "Closed due to misuse"?
Occasionally I'll read the wedding announcements in the New York Times. Lots of second marriages, lots of people in professions I never heard of. But many, it seems, are tying the knot in "self-uniting" ceremonies. Right under our noses, this too has become a thing: couples getting married without the presence of a third-party officiant. It's non-denominational, a method, so says Wikipedia, referred to as a Quaker marriage. Some states allow this. Some don't.
I tried using a colloquial like that with the police officer who stopped me a week ago when I failed to make a complete stop on Montgomery before turning right.
"I guess I did a rolling stop," I said, trying to break the ice.
"Or a California stop," he answered.
We were connecting. I was on a roll.
"Are you liking this police work?" I asked the oh-so-serious officer who looked to be 12.
"Yeah," he said.
"New on the force?"
"Yep."
"What? A week?" I pushed.
"A month," he said.
He gave me a warning.
I literally almost hugged him.

Texto completo: APPLETON – While attending Appleton West High School, Brad Smith never imagined he'd work for a big company. He thought he'd be a lawyer, a politician or a diplomat.
"I sometimes joke that, in fact, my job involves all three," Smith told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in a phone interview to promote an upcoming book-release event at Lawrence University.
Now 60, Smith is president of a little outfit — you might have heard of it — called Microsoft.
He's been described by The New York Times as the tech giant's "elder statesman" and "a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large." He oversees more than 1,400 executive staff in 56 countries, and has testified before Congress.
But it all started, he said, with the lessons and experiences he collected as an idealistic Appleton teenager.
"I've always felt that way," said Smith, a student body president, newspaper editor and school-play pig wrangler at Appleton West who moved from Racine in eighth grade.
"I always thought of Appleton as my hometown."
Agitating and advocating The teenage Smith took a keen interest in the issues facing Appleton, Wisconsin and the wider world, and he debated everything — who should be president or what state policy should be on the ballot — with his mom, Barbara.
"My younger brother in particular ... would always say, 'Stop arguing with mom!'" he said. "And mother would say, 'We're not arguing. We're debating.'"
He brought that love for policy with him to school at Appleton West, where he was co-editor-in-chief of the newspaper, The Talisman, and student body president in his junior and senior years.
As a sophomore running to become student body president as a junior, Smith's chances seemed slim. His parents were "very, very supportive of everything I did," he said, but they "were really downplaying the whole election," because they didn't want to get his hopes up.
The evening the votes were counted, in spring 1975, Smith stayed out at the YMCA until 8 p.m. When he got home and told his parents he won — "I still remember, I got 61 percent of the vote," he said — they asked why he hadn't called them earlier with the good news.
"And I said, 'Gee I didn't think that you were that interested in the election,'" he said.
Smith was also part of a student-faculty council that included five faculty members and an administrator, working to improve school policies like the way the National Honor Society selected students or who had access to the hallway.
"I was always agitating or advocating for some kind of change in the local high school," he said.
Smith worked three evenings a week at Shopko his junior year, and later at Fleet Farm in the summer after his senior year. There, "I managed to drive a forklift into a ditch," he said, "but happily survived."
During his junior year, he made what he jokes was his "great theatrical debut" as the props director for the play "Li'l Abner."
"My job was to — among other things — drive to a farm near Hortonville and pick up a little piglet and bring it to the high school theater every evening, so it could appear in the play."
'Values that I grew up with' Part of growing up in Appleton, Smith said, was that you could hop on your bike and get anywhere in town.
"Your parents never worried about you," he said. "That was sort of the slice of middle America that Appleton embodied in the 1970s."
He remembers, as an eighth-grader, a summer of pedaling off to catch Appleton Foxes baseball games. In high school, the social scene was the Friday night basketball game and the dance afterward in the Appleton West gym.
If it was warm, you'd end up at Dairy Queen. If it was cold, Burger King.
"Maybe McDonald's, if you wanted diversity and you wanted to go to a third place," he joked. "But that was pretty much the range of places that we would go."
Smith said he's delighted by how much Appleton has grown, with restaurants and retail by the riverfront — which was "not ... a place where people went for anything." And he's happily noticed how much more ethnically and racially diverse it's become.
His parents moved away the summer after he graduated high school, he said, but he gets back about once a year for Microsoft's TechSpark program, which includes job skills training and computer science education in Brown and Outagamie County schools. Microsoft also partnered with the Green Bay Packers for TitletownTech, a startup and tech innovation lab.
And Smith has donated money to the Appleton Education Foundation and a fund for special projects at Appleton West. Part of his donations were used last year to enable the witch to fly in the "Wizard of Oz" musical production by Appleton West and Wilson Middle School.
"There's little things like that that I like to get back and see," he said.
He still keeps in touch, 42 years after graduating, with two of his former teachers at Appleton West: English teacher Vira Stoner and history teacher Thomas Fanning.
He credits Stoner's contemporary composition class for helping him place among the 10 percent of incoming freshmen at Princeton who tested out of the English requirement. And Fanning, who taught Smith constitutional and diplomatic history and was co-executive secretary of the student-faculty council Smith's senior year, "really encouraged all of us to think very broadly about what was going on around the world and learn from history," Smith said.
Stoner recalled to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin that Smith was a force within the student body, "immediately very successful" in student government and debate club.
Fanning described Smith as intellectually curious and "very much student-minded, as far as the rights of students," he said.
"I taught for 32 years. Over a lifetime of teaching, you're blessed when you have students that just stand out," he said.
Smith's ongoing support of Appleton is "a small repayment on such a large debt," Smith said, to the place where he was exposed to the idea that you could accomplish anything if you were ethically grounded and worked hard enough.
"When I think of Midwestern values the way I was exposed to them in Appleton, I think of being friendly and outgoing. I think about being honest above all else. I think about showing respect for other people. I think of being plainspoken. And I think you find those values in other places too, but they are all values — those were the values that I grew up with."
'Tools and Weapons' Although Smith might have never imagined himself working for one of the most valuable companies in the world by stock market value, his life at Microsoft isn't too far from what he dreamed of as a kid: lawyer, politician or diplomat.
He quite literally is a lawyer, serving as Microsoft's chief legal officer, in addition to being president, since his appointment by CEO Satya Nadella in September 2015.
And Smith also travels around the world as a kind of politician or diplomat for Microsoft on the world stage, like attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or meeting with government leaders to advocate for changes or defend Microsoft.
Smith recounts those experiences as a lawyer, politician and diplomat in the book he co-authored with Carol Ann Browne, Microsoft director of executive communications, "Tools and Weapons."
It's about the tech industry's responsibility to make sure technology like social media and AI is regulated and fostered to benefit people, instead of just pursuing growth at all costs.
Each chapter is rooted in a story — not just stories from Smith and Browne's advocacy around the world, but from history, as well.
"I think I learned at a relatively young age that people don't necessarily like to listen to a lecture but they love to listen to a story," Smith said. "I think this is something I learned in school. I think it's something that I learned going to church as a teenager. You could just watch the reactions of people around you, and you could see when people would sit up straight, perk up, and actually follow what you're saying."
You can see Smith speak about "Tools and Weapons" at the Lawrence University Music-Drama Center, 420 E. College Ave., from 9-10 a.m. Friday. Admission is free.

Texto completo: She may not run the church. But she can still rule the kingdom.
Women like Victoria Osteen live their entire ministerial careers under megaministry's bright spotlight. To America's largest house of worship, the 40,000-member Lakewood Church, she is the statuesque blonde who spearheaded the megachurch's ministry for women and preached weekly sermonettes about the divine good life. To the seven million weekly viewers of the television show she does with Lakewood's pastor, Joel Osteen, she is a celebrity and life coach, the author of spiritual chick lit like her New York Times best-selling "Love Your Life." Blogs debate everything from her likability to the height of her heels. When she sat down for an interview with Oprah in the Osteen family's Texas mansion, there was little doubt that, loved or hated, she was a new kind of pastor's wife. Tucked into Joel's arm, she rules as one of evangelicalism's first ladies. This is the presumed order of Christian megaministry, the Adam and the Eve.
In almost every spiritual empire, there is a "she." Her hair is big. Her smile is bigger. She is standing by her man, and if he is preaching, she is always ready with a confirming nod. Skeptics dismiss her as evangelical arm candy or, worse, more fodder for a Margaret Atwood sequel. Yet despite their influence and wealth, these women are, in the main, denied the most important symbol of spiritual power -- the pulpit.
I expected to write the history of these evangelical celebrity women on my ascent into scholarly glory, securing a place in academic Valhalla (and tenure at Duke Divinity School). Instead, I studied these leading ladies in the infusion center at Duke Hospital, a short walk away from my quiet office, where I had first learned the news that I had Stage 4 cancer. Tumors that bloomed in my colon and liver, in a moment, erased every cheerful ambition and casual plan. And all I could see was my husband and my toddler, Zach, who loves me more than dinosaurs.
In an effort to manage my fear, I distracted myself by inviting the famous women of televangelism to stop by the hospital for an interview. As I was struggling against my own limitations, I discovered that most of these people were quite willing to admit their own. Together, we spent hundreds of hours discussing the narrow and precarious paths of power that women tread. We were all hanging by a thread.
Though the most common role in this universe is that of pastor's wife, what I learned was that the women of evangelical megaministry have achieved many types of power. They populate network television lineups, megachurch main stages, SiriusXM radio stations, Target bookshelves, and stadium events in every major city. (Though the term "evangelicalism" conjures up a white stereotype, a quarter of these leaders were African-American, Asian or Latina.) To the average American, these stars were almost invisible. Being an evangelical celebrity was maybe a little bit like being a championship NASCAR driver, a winner in a regional and specialized market with millions of devoted followers -- not a national and omnipresent attraction like LeBron James. And yet the stars of women's ministry top the best-seller lists and garner some of the highest rates of Christian television viewership in the world. Some grow so famous that they, like Oprah, need only one name. Beth. Joyce. Serita. Jen. Almost any megachurchgoing woman in America would call them celebrities.
In 2018, fewer than 1 percent of American megachurches were led by a female senior pastor. This lack of women in formal leadership comes as no surprise. There is a long history of theological objection to women preaching and teaching. Conservative women must build their careers without the educational and institutional advantages of their male counterparts. Diplomas do little to change that.
By contrast, liberal women -- defined in my research as those in traditions like Episcopalianism and (most) Lutheranism that officially affirmed female leadership -- fought for denominational policies that gave them standing in the pulpit. And yet there are few progressive female celebrities. Ordained progressive women secure a measure of institutional sway, but they lack the cultural capital of their conservative counterparts. My research shows that conservative women gain considerable influence without institutional power, and liberal women gain institutional power without considerable influence.
Without traditional credentials, conservative women are forced to rely on their personal connections or an authority of charisma, building brands based on experience or, worse, tragedies.
The unexpected twist of my post-diagnosis life was that the publication of my own memoir occasionally put me on the same stage as the women I was researching. In fact, at my first public event another speaker sidled up to me and said:
"So you're only famous because you're dying, right?"
"Actually, it's because I have something to say," I retorted, but she had touched a nerve.
In this world of Christian celebrity, a tragedy could be an opportunity for a new brand, a wider platform and a new set of credentials, and it took me a full minute of glaring at her to remind myself that this was simply the dark logic of the marketplace. She had her own book to sell, and the capitalist ethos of this limited spiritual economy made competitors out of friends and resentment a natural response to meeting a woman with Stage 4 cancer.
Almost every popular Christian speaker has a story of walking through fire. The death of a child. An abusive childhood. A critical illness. Unless someone finds fame by relation (a pastor's wife or daughter), it is otherwise nearly impossible to find a niche in this crowded industry. Formal qualifications matter little in a world in which a woman's authority is found by turning her insides out.
The most successful careers transform the course of a human life into a long string of revelations. I once joked with an ambitious young speaker about how many tragedies she could hope for in her career and she answered quickly, without irony: "Four."
A female Christian celebrity is part of a greater industry of disclosure. She must give something away, but not too much. For this reason, women usually "confess" to almost nothing at all, offering the appearance of vulnerability without the substance. A woman who is a "slave" to eating too much bread or "convicted" of sniping at her husband surrenders little and gains much. Despite her perceived flaws, she must remain a Christian Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way. Missing are those deemed too fat, old, gay, ugly, sick, single, childless or liberal to stand in the spotlight. The world of megaministry is a fragile enterprise with careers that hang like a spider on a web of thousands of filaments. These women's power is relational, conditional and unofficial, requiring a monetization of their private and public lives. Every step of their rise has to be carefully planned and perilously maintained.
The history of evangelical women celebrities is an account of limited agency, women confined by theology and custom who nonetheless carved out influence from the hardwood of American conservatism. And perhaps also the story I needed as I came to terms with my own precarious situation. Facing down a dangerous surgery to cut out more compromised organs, the doctors didn't speak about my prognosis in certainties and offered little optimism beyond "wait and see." I needed to make pragmatic decisions about whether I would continue to believe I would live -- and perhaps continue to reach for tenure -- or give up altogether.
Knowing that I would never be cured, I stewed about what to do with what remained of my life. Was it worth spending hundreds of hours to transform this research into a book? Should I go see the pyramids? With so little I could control, I borrowed a page from the playbook of the women I had interviewed. I abandoned what was ideal and reached for what was possible instead. I put the final touches on the manuscript and submitted it the day before I was rolled into surgery with the pleasant exhaustion of deep work. After all, who doesn't hope to spin the straw of their lives into gold? Or at least nicer straw.

Texto completo: KIEV, Ukraine -- In 2014, Ukraine's wildly corrupt president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia after mass protests on the Maidan, Kiev's central square. During what Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignity, police snipers killed dozens of demonstrators. In the revolution's aftermath, a number of young idealists decided to plunge into politics, hoping to reform their troubled country from the inside. One of them was Serhiy Leshchenko, at the time perhaps the country's most famous investigative journalist.
The American political scientist Francis Fukuyama had encouraged Leshchenko and some of his friends to run for Parliament. He'd met Leshchenko in 2013, when the journalist took part in a three-week summer course run by Fukuyama at Stanford that aims to teach activists from around the world about building democratic institutions. "After the Maidan revolution, I thought that it was particularly important that all these people in civil society actually go into the government," Fukuyama said.
Many of them did. That October, Leshchenko, a lanky, bearded hipster with a passion for rave culture, became part of a cadre of Western-oriented newcomers elected to Parliament, even as he continued to work as a journalist exposing corruption. This year, after Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidential election, Leshchenko advised him during the transition.
Then Rudy Giuliani began attacking Leshchenko as a conspirator against America.
In 2016, Leshchenko had helped expose the "black ledger," an accounting book of hundreds of pages found in Yanukovych's former party headquarters. Among its many entries, it showed $ 12.7 million in secret payments to Paul Manafort. At the time, Manafort was running Donald Trump's presidential campaign, but before that, he was one of Yanukovych's most important advisers.
One of the reasons Manafort is in federal prison is that he failed to disclose or pay taxes on millions of dollars from Ukraine. But if you believe Giuliani, the black ledger was part of a plot to damage Trump.
During a Fox News appearance on May 10, Giuliani described the ledger as a "falsely created book" and Leshchenko as part of a group of "enemies of the president, in some cases enemies of the United States." Last month, in an epic, ranting interview on CNN, he accused Ukraine's leading anti-corruption organization, the Anti-Corruption Action Center, or AntAC, of developing "all of the dirty information that ended up being a false document that was created in order to incriminate Manafort."
In Giuliani's fevered alternative reality, Ukraine's most stalwart foes of corruption are actually corruption's embodiment. Deeply compromised figures with vendettas against the activists -- particularly the ex-prosecutors Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko -- are transformed into heroes.
This addled, through-the-looking glass fantasy came to drive American foreign policy in Ukraine. Trump withdrew the American ambassador to the country, Marie Yovanovitch, whom reformers saw as their champion. He withheld military aid that Ukraine desperately needed, while asking Zelensky to do him a "favor" and investigate deranged fictions about Ukrainian interference in American elections, as well as Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
Given how much Ukraine depends on American support, Giuliani's smears made it politically impossible for Leshchenko, who left Parliament in August, to continue advising Zelensky. Now, with Ukraine at the center of a world-historical international scandal, he is stupefied to find himself defamed by powerful forces in the United States, once the world's strongest backer of those fighting for democracy in his country.
"I could imagine that maybe some Ukrainian prosecutors will create a fake case against me, or some criminals will attack me, or I could be attacked by trolls on social media," Leshchenko told me when I met him in a Kiev cafe. "But I never imagined before that my real problems will appear because of the statement of the personal attorney of the American president."
If America can be said to have a foreign policy at this debased stage of the Trump administration, it mostly consists of sucking up to strongmen while betraying everyone who ever believed in America's putative ideals. Trump has given Turkey his blessing to assault the Syrian Kurds, America's crucial allies against ISIS. In June, he reportedly promised China that he wouldn't speak out in favor of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, some of whom have been carrying American flags, as long as trade talks progressed.
Here in Ukraine, a country locked in a proxy war with Russia, coping with a deluge of disinformation and propaganda and struggling to transcend a history of corruption, reformers are trying to figure out what it means when the American president sides against them.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
Pro-Western reformers, the Ukrainian philosopher Volodymyr Yermolenko told me, had seen the United States as a "a perfect democracy functioning very well," with an admirable system of checks and balances. "And now this image is crumbling and that's very dangerous."
The Ukrainians I spoke to aren't naïve; they understand that America, like any other country, generally acts from self-interest rather than high principle. But there was a time when America at least viewed the projection of democratic values as being in its self-interest. That gave liberals in countries like Ukraine leverage against recalcitrant officials.
"The majority of the reforms, especially on anti-corruption, were passed because there was a very strong demand from civil society, and there was the I.M.F. and the U.S. Embassy pushing it hard," said Oleksandra Ustinova, a former board member of AntAC who was elected to Parliament this year.
The U.S. also provided a degree of protection to local activists and journalists. When Lutsenko was prosecutor general in Ukraine -- a position roughly equivalent to our attorney general -- he would, said Ustinova, harass anti-corruption campaigners with spurious criminal investigations. "The U.S. ambassador and the E.U. ambassador were going out publicly saying you cannot do this," Ustinova said.
Now that's all changed. As The New York Times reported, after Trump recalled the U.S. ambassador, Lutsenko gloated to the head of AntAC that he had "eliminated your roof," using Russian mafia slang for guardian.
"We've been exporting our corruption to them, rather than trying to export good governance," said Fukuyama.
When he said that, Fukuyama may not have known how right he was. A few hours after I met Leshchenko, news broke that two Ukrainian-born clients of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had been arrested on charges of campaign finance crimes as they were preparing to leave the United States with one-way tickets.
According to an indictment, the two "sought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working." (In one of those preposterously on-the-nose details that make the Trump era feel like a computer simulation on the fritz, Parnas had a company called Fraud Guarantee.)
As soon as news of the indictment broke, I messaged Leshchenko, who guessed that the unnamed Ukrainian official was Lutsenko. It was a natural assumption; it had already been reported that Parnas and Fruman connected Giuliani with Lutsenko, who had been feeding Trump's lawyer conspiracy theories about the journalist, the former American ambassador and Joe Biden.
Sure enough, on Saturday NBC News reported that Lutsenko was the official in the indictment. Yovanovitch might have been referring to Lutsenko when she said, in her Friday congressional testimony, that "individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine."
Thanks to Giuliani's escapades, the domestic grudges of a crooked Ukrainian prosecutor have blossomed into a scandal that's likely to lead to the impeachment of an American president. Federal prosecutors are now investigating whether Giuliani himself broke the law.
Lutsenko has since left Ukraine for London, and Ukrainian authorities have opened a criminal case against him for allegedly abusing his authority in an unrelated matter. In a recent interview, he told reporters for The Times that in speaking to Giuliani, he sought to tell Trump's lawyer what he wanted to hear. "I understood very well what would interest them," Lutsenko said, adding, "I have 23 years in politics."
He should be seen as wholly discredited, but in our polarized, frenzied media environment, lies never really go away. Trump's defenders will continue to take Lutsenko's stories at face value. Worse, long after America has forgotten them, these slanders, which Trump and Giuliani magnified to gargantuan scale, will linger in Ukraine, undermining the people our country once sought to help.
"This smear campaign circulates everywhere: in American media, then in Ukrainian media," said Leshchenko. Those in Ukraine who want impunity for corruption, he said, can now say, "Look at these anti-corruption activists and journalists and members of Parliament. They are not welcome in the U.S., so don't listen to them. So it suppresses our reputation here in Ukraine as well."
Ukrainians are no strangers to post-truth politics. The first time I ever heard the term "fake news" was in 2015, when I learned about the Ukrainian fact-checking organization StopFake. It was created by a group of journalists to push back against the torrents of Russian disinformation sowing chaos in the country's politics. At the time, it would have been hard to imagine that the United States would soon join Russia as a source of weaponized untruth in Ukraine.
"This is very new, because now it seems it's not only Russia influencing Ukrainian politics, but Ukraine is also influencing the U.S., and things happening in the U.S. are greatly influencing Ukraine," Yevhen Fedchenko, one of StopFake's founders, told me. "So it becomes much more complicated."
Here's what's not complicated. Throughout our history, America has committed many sins against democracy around the world, but we used to be on the right side in Ukraine. Not anymore. As one former U.S. diplomat said to me recently, "The beacon has gone out." We're with the oligarchs now.

Texto completo: Readers discuss a writer's portrayal of political attitudes of residents in her Arkansas hometown.
To the Editor:
Re "In the Land of Self-Defeat," by Monica Potts (Sunday Review, Oct. 6):
Ms. Potts's article about her small town in Arkansas fits into a genre of reporting that has flourished since the 2016 election in which sympathetic writers, often raised in Trump country, attempt to explain why people in rural America vote against their interests. Often these are written by people who themselves left these places because they were too small, too conservative and too narrow-minded.
In her effort to elicit an empathetic response from readers, Ms. Potts focuses on her subjects' belief in self-reliance, hostility toward the city and conviction that they have to rely on themselves. Yet she neglects a very important fact. The rural conservative white voters who support Mr. Trump and are so opposed to federal spending often live in states that receive far more than their share of federal funds, especially in relation to those states with larger urban populations.
They don't really oppose federal spending. They oppose federal funding for black people and others in cities. Perhaps if they were serious in their belief in self-reliance, they would vote to reject the federal funds that come to their state, and it could be used better in states that want it.

To the Editor:
Monica Potts, thank you! This was an excellent piece with good depth of cultural context.
Some towns exude an enthusiasm, a "can do" sense of gratitude, a belief that their cup is at least "half full" and a welcome to all people of their town to share in that "half-full" abundance. They remind me of an old Danish proverb, "Where there is heart space there is house space."
Other communities are notable for complaining of cups "half empty," and it's someone else's fault. People in such communities exhibit an almost bubbling anger, chips on their shoulders and deep rivers of blame or exclusion.
Our entire nation is being bullied by our president into a sense of "half empty," with so many points of blame. This article will hopefully lead some readers to recognize their lack of gratitude and their responsibilities in a democracy.

To the Editor:
I've been earnestly trying to understand the Trump supporter ever since Donald Trump announced his candidacy. I've heard all the theories -- people were hurting, they thought he would help them -- but I never really "got it" until I read Monica Potts's article.
I felt very depressed by the time I finished it because I now feel that Mr. Trump will win again. At least I now know why.
Audrey Tillmans
St. Charles, Ill.
To the Editor:
Opinion pieces such as "In the Land of Self-Defeat" attempting to paint a description of the urban-rural divide do nothing more than increase that divide. In the past 10 years I have lived in five states, in cities, towns and now finally a rural county of about 15,000. Now that I live in a rural county, I am more curious to understand how people view areas such as mine.
The New York Times has a responsibility to report the truth accurately. While some people do hold such thoughts as those described in the article, running articles on this divide every few months describing a new rural location with the same "backward beliefs" does a disservice to all Americans. People in rural areas feel they are being misrepresented.
For urbanites who will never visit rural areas, such articles are their only exposure, and they're not a complete picture.
Kjersten Oudman
Mineral Point, Wis.
To the Editor:
Monica Potts's article about Clinton, Ark., was outstanding. It managed to evoke a clear sense of the attitudes among the people there who voted for Donald Trump. I could not help but make the connection with the piece written by Richard V. Reeves, "Now the Rich Want Your Pity, Too," on the same page. Rich, poor and even those in between, so many Americans express self-pity rather than a sense of optimism and ambition.
My grandfather, who came to this continent on a boat, alone, from Liverpool, England, at the age of 9, and my father, who studied at night and worked so hard to escape the shoe factory system of mid-20th-century America, would both not understand such self-pity.
I want to thank these two writers for helping me understand why the supreme crybaby of them all is now in the White House.
Jim Sutton

The writer is a retired librarian.
To the Editor:
In one important aspect people in rural America are no different than those in urban America. We all tend to react to events and elections as positive or negative depending on how we think they affect us, particularly financially. I'm sure the article accurately depicts what is happening in rural America, and it's unfortunate, even sad. I think the bigger question is: "Does anyone care, and how do we fix the problem?" Do we want rural America to continue to die?
I believe that the answer is a Marshall Plan to bring jobs and higher education to rural America. I'd like to see each of the Fortune 500 companies incentivized to adopt a few rural counties. This would include putting new offices or manufacturing in the county, plus a junior college extension with the goal of developing and employing local talent. To encourage the Fortune 500 to take this action, the federal and local governments could offer tax incentives and donated land.
Do we want to save rural America or not?
Larry Page
Sonoma, Calif.
The writer is not the co-founder of Google who shares his name.
To the Editor:
Monica Potts's ultimately very sad article is clear proof that we should stop trying to win over (or perhaps even empathize with) the Trump voters in her hometown. We must stop obsessing over them and simply defeat them.
Why try to win over people who believe that urban professionals (many of whom work over 60 hours a week) are lazy, people who disdain values like education that improve all our lives?
We cannot allow such people to distract the rest of us from building a better future. They will not determine the next election unless we, who are the majority of Americans, allow ourselves to be misled. We can only hope that their children or grandchildren, for their own sake, will eventually join us.
Gail Goldey
Santa Fe, N.M.
To the Editor:
I also grew up in a small town. My elementary school was just down the hill from the red brick public library. We went there once a week and were given time to choose three books to take home until the next visit. These trips delighted us. They opened our eyes, our minds and our souls.
I was saddened by the views related in Monica Potts's article. Reading it, I was reminded of Toni Morrison's beautifully written novel "Home," in which she describes a fictional town with "its unforgiving population, its isolation and especially its indifference to the future."
Adults who love books were once children who were allowed to discover them. This is as indispensable to the health of our country as good nutrition. It is not a luxury.
Maria T. von Waldow
Vienna
To the Editor:
This article cut to the heart of the conundrum that exists in rural America. As Monica Potts writes, rural Southerners in particular reject government policies and programs that would benefit them. It brings to mind the tense and often violent clashes between the black and white tenant farmers in the Jim Crow era. These two groups had the same needs, but the white landowners did all they could to drive them apart.
President Trump's policies likewise encourage antagonism, anger and divisiveness in rural communities, making it difficult for productive conversations to take place between the even moderate Democrats and these staunch Trump supporters.

Texto completo: JAMESBURG — Murder? Mayhem? Malice? All the better for this group.
On the fourth Saturday of every month, you will find like-minded women and men chatting about poisons and plots in the Jamesburg Senior Center.
A support group for potential serial killers? Nah....it's just the monthly meeting for Sisters In Crime Central Jersey, the state chapter for an international organization (SinC) with more than 51 chapters worldwide for those in the mystery/crime writing genre.
Seeking equality A precursor to the "#MeToo" movement, the women crime writers wanted to "be treated as equally as male writers" and to "have equality and recognition in the field," said Linda Rawlins, president of the SinC Central Jersey chapter, which has about 40 members.
"They weren't getting as many contracts from agents," she said. "Even when they did get contracts, they didn't get paid the same."
The initial members had some heavy hitters among them, including Sara Paretsky and Nancy Pickard, who served as the first and second presidents of the organization. Other founding members included Phyllis Whitney and Mary Higgins Clark.
Now with about 4,000 members, SinC offers networking, advice and support to mystery authors — both men and women published and unpublished. The membership is a mix of authors, readers, publishers, editors, agents, booksellers and librarians all connected through their love of the mystery genre and support of women who write them.
Around for more than 20 years, Rawlins said the Jersey group is a mix, with about 75 percent of the members being writers. Most others are readers and former librarians. They also come from all over the state, as SinC Central Jersey is the only New Jersey chapter.
"It's all about inclusivity now. Our group, we tease — we call it sisters and misters," said Rawlins, who joined SinC three years ago. "Now, everybody is allowed. Anybody who is interested in being in the organization."
A published author Rawlins, a published author, started writing seriously in 2010 and her first book came out in 2011. She has now published seven books and expects an eighth come out soon.
"One thing you learn about writing books is that you really need a good network — a good community," said Rawlins, who lives in Fairfield. "And you need to speak to other writers. Being a writer can be sort of an isolating position. I wanted to join a networking community and I love mysteries, so I joined Sisters in Crime nationally and then the local chapter."
Her popular "Misty" series has four books out — "Misty Manor," "Misty Point," "Misty Winter" and "Misty Treasure" — with a fifth, as yet untitled, on the way. All center around journalist Megan Stanford who comes home to the Jersey Shore when her grandmother becomes ill — then the mayhem begins and the dead bodies pile up.
"I love mysteries and I personally — and most everybody in the group — grew up on mysteries," she said. "The reason that we are drawn to SinC is that we love some sort of crime fiction."
Crime comes to Central Jersey Rawlins said she has tried to "modernize" the group. Often, they schedule Skype meetings with authors and experts in the field such as New York Times bestselling author Tosca Lee and ThrillerFest organizer Kimberly Howe. Handwriting analyst Terry Antoniewicz and Wendy Corsi Staub, bestselling author of the Lily Dale and The Foundling series, also recently came in person to a meeting.
"It gives us a much broader availability of writers to mentor us," Rawlins said. "We always try to have a speaker come in to look at some facet of your writing career. One month we may be talking about social media and marketing and the next month, we could be having the FBI or police or firemen come in to help us with the reality of our work."
Another new thing Rawlins started was an open mic session where writers can get up in front of a group audience. The group also has fun on their agenda as they celebrate literary birthdays and holidays together.
The group is looking to attract new members and Rawlins noted many younger members grew up with J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter series as their main inspiration as opposed to Agatha Christie, Nancy Drew or Phyllis Whitney. They are "big into advocacy" for writers of all levels," she said.
"We have been working more on the business end of it — how to write, how to edit, how to polish a query letter, how to approach a publisher, how to self publish, how to market — those kind of nuts and bolts," she said. "I think part of the advocacy is to go back to the nuts and bolts of how to be a writer."
While the mystery genre goes through phases, cozy and young adult fiction are currently topping the popularity charts, Rawlins said
"Personally I'm happy to see, despite what we hear about cell phones and such, that reading is still very very strong," she said. "I think anytime we can advocate for literacy, we need to do that. It is so important for our society. But it's nice to see a lot of people reading out there — of all ages. I still feel reading is so important in every aspect of life."
The SinC Central Jersey will be appearing at the Old Bridge Public Library, One Old Bridge Plaza, from 2 to 4 p.m. Oct. 19. Also on Oct. 19, SinC Central Jersey writers will appear at the Jamesburg Street Fair. For their monthly meeting, the group will gather at 10 a.m. Oct. 26 for their annual Edgar Allan Poe Party. Special guest Irene Curran will discuss Poe's life. The Boucheron Conference will take place From Oct. 31 to Nov. 3 in Texas and from Nov. 7 to 10, the Crime Bake Mystery Conference will be held in Boston, Massachusetts. On Dec. 7, SinC Central Jersey will host their annual Holiday Party at 10 a.m.

Heirs of omission: Who’s in, and not in, a will

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Texto completo: October is not only National Domestic Violence Awareness Month but it's also Breast Cancer Awareness Month. October: A reminder of how — despite the clarion call to close the gender gap in research — there are still not enough resources devoted to women's health.
It happens every year right around Oct. 1. I'm inundated with pink and purple ribbons, emails and texts to contribute to very worthy causes. And then there are the stories — too many stories.
Welcome to October, the month when women are constantly reminded of how hard it is to be ... a woman.
October is not only National Domestic Violence Awareness Month but it's also Breast Cancer Awareness Month. October: A reminder of how — despite the clarion call to close the gender gap in research — there are still not enough resources devoted to women's health.
October: A reminder of how many women suffer at the hands of others and from a system that does not always serve them when it's needed most.
How about a new awareness in October. Instead of seeing ourselves and our issues as victim's issues, let's switch the narrative to make October Women Warriors Month.
Because for every pink or purple ribbon and sad story, I also see women fighting for resources for research and health care — and their lives. I see women fighting to be treated with respect and celebrated for what they bring to the world.
And I see other women fighting on their behalf.
Most important, I see women warrior leaders making a difference in business, nonprofits and in their communities. In October, we should celebrate those companies, organizations and women who are leading the way, as well as leading a battle cry for all women with grit and grace.
Women like Elaine Spaull and Meghan Mundy, who partner together to produce Fashion Week of Rochester to benefit the Center for Youth for 10 years running — proving that two women can lead and work together for years and not only thrive in their leadership but love their cause, their creativity, and each other.
Women like Sharon Napier and Courtney Cotrupe, who just announced their new roles at the advertising agency, Partners + Napier, as chairman and CEO — proving that women can lead and grow great companies and support each other to create great possibilities for continued growth not only for their organization but for their community.
And women like Jaime Saunders, who leads the United Way of Rochester and before that Willow Domestic Violence Center — proving that women can grow their own leadership to have an even greater impact on an entire community.
For companies that focus on women's health, October is like Christmas for retailers. Jane Mazur, vice president of communications at Hologic Inc., a medical device company focused on women's health, says she wants to make sure that what breaks through all the clutter is the importance of hearing from those who are actively trying to change the dialogue and make a difference.
She wants the message of prevention to be heard: "I would love for everyone to make their annual mammogram appointments in October, but there's only 31 days in the month — so, I spend my whole year highlighting and working for women to pay attention to their health every day."
I asked Leslie Morgan Steiner, New York Times best-selling author of "Crazy Love and The Naked Truth," for her take. She wrote, "I love being a woman, but the deck of life is stacked against us in so many ways, largely due to widespread cultural pressures and ignorance of problems women face. October is an 'awareness month' that provides a great example of challenges (and gross underinvestment in solutions) disproportionately facing women — breast cancer, domestic violence, SIDS, pregnancy loss, and more. Why not just rename October 'I Women' and turn all these negatives into positives?"
Exactly. Declare it in October and continue to live it every month. #WomenWarriors.
October is not only National Domestic Violence Awareness Month but it's also Breast Cancer Awareness Month. October: A reminder of how — despite the clarion call to close the gender gap in research — there are still not enough resources devoted to women's health.

Botched Medical Care May Have Led to Death

Texto completo: A complex and difficult medical procedure that ultimately failed might have contributed to the death of an American Special Forces soldier killed last year in a firefight in Somalia, according to an investigation into the episode obtained by The New York Times.
The redacted Army investigation illustrates the intense violence that can accompany the Pentagon's quiet "train, advise and assist" missions in distant corners of the globe, and the limitations of the American military despite its ambitious reach, vast resources and extensive training.
Staff Sgt. Alex Conrad, 26, died from wounds he received during an attack on June 8, 2018, at a small outpost near the town of Jamaame, about 200 miles southwest of Mogadishu, the capital. He was hit with shrapnel from a mortar round, peppering his face, neck, stomach and legs, starting an hourlong effort to save his life. Three other Americans and a Somali soldier were wounded in the attack by militants from al Shabab.
The investigation's documents also highlight the disparity in resources between different countries overseen by the American military command in Africa. Failures from the Oct. 4, 2017, ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers and five Nigeriens dead pointed to a lack of medical evacuation support, overhead surveillance and intelligence about their enemy.
But despite the influx of resources in Somalia, where troops there had medical helicopters minutes away and drones orbiting above them, the Shabab militants still managed to organize a rapid and deadly attack that killed Sergeant Conrad before they quickly disappeared back into the underbrush without detection.
Around 2:45 that afternoon, minutes after small-arms fire was directed at the American and Somali outpost, mortar fire landed within the position. The firefight was fast and intense. The blasts from the mortars immediately wounded Sergeant Conrad and the three other Americans.
As the Americans scurried to tend to the wounded, Sergeant Conrad complained about the pain from the injury in his left leg, the documents say. Although he was still alert, blood from the wound in his jaw was slowly suffocating him. Ultimately, the team's medic performed a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which he would cut into Sergeant Conrad's neck -- at his cricoid membrane -- before inserting a tube that would allow unobstructed air to flow into his lungs.
The medic, whose name was redacted in the report, noted the spot with a marker before making a vertical, then horizontal, incision. Sergeant Conrad twice dislodged the tube, labeled in the report as a Shiley tube. The team's medic tried at least once to make his initial incision longer in an effort to open the newly made airway.
Sergeant Conrad was still breathing when he was loaded in a truck to rush him to the landing zone. Two HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters, crewed by elite Air Force pararescue medics, were racing from a larger American base outside the town of Kismayo, roughly 40 miles away. The helicopters arrived about 15 minutes after the Americans called for the medical evacuation.
Three of the wounded Americans, including Sergeant Conrad, were loaded onto one of the Pave Hawks, where those aboard began their own assessment. One of the pararescue team members started using a bag valve mask to push air into a newly inserted tube that was placed in the same incision made by the Green Beret's medic. The Air Force medic noted that "the compression of the bag valve mask had become more difficult."
At around 3:15, the flight arrived back at Kismayo, where a surgical team was waiting. Sergeant Conrad was pronounced dead about 15 minutes later.
The investigation found that "although fully qualified medical personnel made multiple attempts to establish an airway via surgical cricothyrotomy" on Sergeant Conrad "after he received his injuries, no incision was made through the tissue plane into his airway. This might have contributed to SSG Conrad succumbing to his injuries."
To be sure, a cricothyrotomy in a combat zone is fraught with hazard and is often a last-ditch effort to help someone's breathing. Even in a controlled environment, such as a hospital, the procedure is extremely challenging.
"The attempted procedure under the conditions that existed on June 8, 2018, was extraordinary in itself," the report says. An addendum to the investigation stated that the Special Operations Command that oversees operations in Africa, and subsequent units, had already moved to review medical training related to the procedure.
Ultimately, the investigating officer concluded that no "individual, unit or organization acted in a negligent manner" during the operation and ensuing medical care.
The American military's Africa Command had no immediate comment on the investigation.
The Green Beret team's mission on June 8, alongside their Somali counterparts, was to push into Shabab-held territory, where the militants had been instigating attacks from, and build the small base that would later be renamed after Sergeant Conrad.
Sergeant Conrad, from Chandler, Ariz., joined the Army in 2010 and was trained to interact with local populations to glean information about militant groups. He had been to Afghanistan twice before finding himself attached to a Green Beret team from Third Special Forces Group in Somalia. When he was killed, his team had less than a month left on their deployment. He was posthumously awarded a Bronze Star with valor for running out in the early minutes of the firefight on June 8 and ushering a civilian linguist to safety.
The Shabab, an extremist group that has long tried to overthrow Somalia's Western-backed government, has lost much of the territory it once controlled, but Pentagon officials fear the group still might be growing in Somalia and elsewhere in East Africa. Last month, Shabaab militants attacked a Somali air base used by American forces with multiple car bombs, injuring civilians there.
About 500 American troops are in Somalia, and they are mostly Special Operations units. Last year, after a broad review under Jim Mattis, the defense secretary at the time, the Pentagon announced that it was reducing the number of troops on the continent. In 2017, a member of the Navy SEALs, Senior Chief Petty Officer Kyle Milliken, was killed and two other American troops were wounded in a raid 40 miles west of Mogadishu.
The focus on providing emergency medical care to wounded troops in what is called "the golden hour" has long been a concern of Defense Department officials, especially during the height of combat in the wars that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. As defense secretary in 2009, Robert M. Gates became concerned that the rugged terrain and vast distances of the Afghanistan war zone were keeping wounded troops from reaching hospital care within 60 minutes.
Mr. Gates ordered more helicopters to Afghanistan to evacuate wounded troops, and directed that helicopters previously set aside for rescuing downed pilots be reassigned to medical evacuation. Mr. Gates also increased the number of field hospitals.
A peer-reviewed medical study published in 2015 found that those initiatives saved an estimated 359 lives from June 2009 to March 2014. Applying the same standard to operations elsewhere has proved difficult, as was evident in the ambush in Niger.

Texto completo: The presidential debates will be held in Indiana, Michigan and Tennessee, and a vice-presidential debate will be held in Utah.
The nonpartisan commission that governs presidential debates announced on Friday the dates and sites for the three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate during the 2020 general election.
All four debates will be held at universities, as has been recent custom.
The presidential debates will kick off Sept. 29 at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates. (The campus is adjacent to South Bend, Ind., where Pete Buttigieg, one of the candidates for the Democratic nomination, is mayor.)
The others will be held Oct. 15 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Oct. 22 at Belmont University in Nashville.
The lone vice-presidential debate is scheduled for Oct. 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. President Trump won Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee and Utah in 2016, three of them handily. In Michigan, which will most likely be a battleground state in 2020, he beat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 11,000 votes.
The debates will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruption, the commission said. The moderators and format will be announced later.
The commission has sponsored and produced the general election debates since the 1988 campaign.
Not only do general election debates attract more viewers than any other campaign event; historically, these matchups have ranked among television's most-watched broadcasts, political or otherwise.
In 2016, the first debate between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton was seen by 84 million live television viewers, the biggest audience since television debates started in 1960.
Roughly 18 million people watched the first Democratic presidential debate this year on live television, a record for a Democratic primary matchup.
The next Democratic primary debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is scheduled for this Tuesday night.
Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.

Texto completo: The mother of James Foley, the war correspondent from New Hampshire beheaded by ISIS in 2014 after being kidnapped about two years earlier in Syria, said Thursday that she's “grateful" two of her son's alleged captors have been moved from a Syrian prison to Iraqi custody following Turkey's incursion into northern Syria.
However, Diane Foley said in a telephone interview, she's concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Syria that prompted the removal of the suspects, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Amon Kotey.
Two Iraqi intelligence officials told the Associated Press Thursday that the United States will hand over to Iraqi authorities nearly 50 Islamic State members who were transferred from Syria in recent days, after Turkey began a military offensive into northern Syria against US-backed Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The Kurds are holding more than 10,000 ISIS members, but concerns have been raised about possible escapes as the Kurds turn their attention to the advancing Turks.
“We have been awaiting extradition of [Elsheikh and Kotey]" to face charges in the American civilian courts, Diane Foley said. “We think they've been moved to Iraq, which is a good step since we can watch to make sure they're in secure custody."
Foley continued, “The hard part to watch is the other 10,000 ISIS fighters and 70,000 ISIS family members who are now not being guarded" because the Kurds “have to defend themselves." She said it's “very concerning" that so many ISIS fighters “have the opportunity to escape and infiltrate our country."
Foley also lamented the plight of the Kurds now confronted by Turkish military aggression. “Our allies, the Kurds, who have fought beside us and with our allies to contain ISIS, how awful now to allow them to be assaulted," she said.
As for Elsheikh and Kotey, Foley said, “I really hope that they are not held indefinitely [without trial] because that is just not fair to anybody. . . . Obviously, they treated our American citizens deplorably, but we need to bring them to trial to see if they're the actual perpetrators of the horrific crimes they're accused of."
Elsheikh and Kotey were part of a four-member British cell that the Islamic State put in charge of Western hostages, who nicknamed them the “Beatles" because of their accents. In 2014 and 2015, the militants held more than 20 Western hostages in Syria and tortured many of them. The group beheaded seven American, British, and Japanese journalists and aid workers and a group of Syrian soldiers, broadcasting the atrocities in videos released to the world.
Another member of the cell, Mohammed Emwazi, or “Jihadi John," is believed to have killed James Foley. Emwazi was later killed in a drone strike.
Diane Foley said Thursday that she hoped to see Elsheikh and Kotey tried in US civilian courts so her family can deliver victim-impact statements, and so the public can obtain crucial information about ISIS leadership and about citizens of the United States and other countries who have been “lost in this conflict."
She also reflected on the state of Syria, which has been mired in a bloody civil war that began in 2011 and that her son doggedly covered until his abduction and eventual execution.
“It's just so tragic," Foley said. “Such a loss of life, for what? For what? What has been gained? . . . It's very sad to me, this whole thing."

Fact-checking Trump on Syria, US troop withdrawal

Texto completo: President Donald Trump shocked lawmakers from both parties recently when he announced the United States would be withdrawing troops from the Syrian border with Turkey.
Political leaders and military officials said the U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria helps keep Islamic State terrorists in check and prevents Iranian and Russian aggression. And they worried about the Turkish military retaliating against Kurdish U.S. allies in the region.
Facing a bipartisan backlash, Trump defended his thinking on Twitter and at an Oct. 7 press conference. He made a number of claims that needed a fact-check.
“The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight.”
Trump’s claim about an early timeline is wrong.
Multiple experts told us that they had never heard of a specific timeline for the U.S. involvement in Syria, which started in late 2015 under former President Barack Obama. And Brett McGurk, Trump’s former special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, responded to Trump on Twitter, saying “none of this is true.”
“I’m not aware of a commitment to only have U.S. troops in Syria for 30 days that was made ‘many years ago,’” said Will Todman, associate fellow in the Middle East program and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Trump could have been referring back to when he first ordered the removal of U.S. troops from Syria in December 2018. He gave the Defense Department a 30-day timeline for withdrawal. Trump backtracked shortly after, saying the military could take a few months to get out of Syria.
“When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.”
This claim is misleading. While ISIS’s land holdings have been depleted, the group still poses a legitimate threat.
According to data we have analyzed, ISIS controlled about 89% less territory at the start of 2018 as compared with the beginning of Trump’s presidency. This map from the Congressional Research Service shows the extent of lost ISIS territory through August 2018.
But it’s a far cry to say ISIS has been defeated — even if its physical land holdings have been largely dismantled. Experts told us ISIS is still capable of carrying out attacks across the globe. The New York Times reported that as many as 18,000 fighters remain in Iraq and Syria.
“When I took over our military, we didn’t have ammunition. I was told by a top general — maybe the top of them all — ‘Sir, I’m sorry. Sir, we don’t have ammunition.’ “
This exchange is unconfirmed. Trump made a similar claim in September, identifying former Defense Secretary James Mattis as the source of the ammunition comment.
According to Trump, Mattis told him early in Trump’s administration the military was “very low on ammunition” when they were at a position “with a certain country” and “may have had a conflict.”
“And he said to me, ‘Sir, if you could, delay it, because we’re very low on ammunition’,” Trump said in September.
We did not find public confirmation from Mattis that such a conversation took place. Trump could be talking about the Defense Department’s shortage and redistribution of weapons around the time he became president.
“The president appears to be exaggerating ordnance shortfalls for ISIS operations around the time he took office,” tweeted Paul D. Shinkman, a national security correspondent who wrote a related February 2017 U.S. News & World Report article.
“Shortages of bombs and other munitions” forced the military to get weapons from its headquarters in other parts of the world in order to carry out its air campaign against the Islamic State, said U.S. News & World Report’s article.
In February 2016, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter raised concern about the weapons shortages and asked Congress for $2 billion more to increase bomb production. By March, the article said, manufacturers began to significantly increase their output.
U.S. News & World Report quoted a spokesman for the Joint Staff, Air Force Col. Randall Ackerman, as saying that a shortage problem persisted in early 2017 and that they were determining if existing munitions within one combatant command could be redistributed to replenish shortfalls in munitions in another.
The story reported that officials for the campaign against ISIS said that the U.S.-led coalition had enough weapons to carry out its mission. It quoted an unnamed spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve as saying that their fight was “not affected because of a lack of munitions.”

Lawmakers call for probe of College Board data sales

Resumen: SPRINGFIELD — Nine Democratic lawmakers are calling on Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to investigate the business practices of the College Board and sale of data it collects from students who take the SAT and PSAT. The College Board’s practice of selling student data through its program called Student Search Service was the subject of national news reports by the New York Times and Washington Post, among others. The lawmakers said the practice of selling student data might violate at least two state laws, the Student Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits businesses that provide online services to schools from selling or leasing student data, and the Children’s Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act, which bars sale of data of children under 16 without parental consent.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Nine Democratic lawmakers are calling on Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to investigate the business practices of the College Board and sale of data it collects from students who take the SAT and PSAT.
The action comes about a week before high school students throughout the state are due to take the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, which among other things is used to determine eligibility for National Merit Scholarships.
Next spring, high school juniors throughout the state will take the SAT, a college entrance exam that the state mandates as part of its school accountability program.
The College Board’s practice of selling student data through its program called Student Search Service was the subject of national news reports by the New York Times and Washington Post, among others.
In May, a representative from the College Board, Todd Iverson, confirmed to the state Senate Judiciary Committee that the company sells access to data from Illinois students for 45 cents per student. That testimony came as the panel was considering legislation to strengthen the state’s Student Online Personal Protection Act.
But Sara Sympson, a spokeswoman for the College Board, said in an email Thursday the nonprofit company does not "sell" the data but, rather, makes the information available "under strict licensing agreements with colleges, scholarship partners and nonprofit organizations."
The program is voluntary, she said, and students must "affirmatively declare" they want to have conversations with schools and scholarship providers.
Those who access the data, she said, must adhere to precise rules that require the data be used for only noncommercial, education-related purposes. They also must agree not to share student information with third parties, other than mail service providers and other contractors, and they must destroy the data once their agreement expires.
"Students and their families need information to help them navigate the winding and complicated path to college and career," Sympson said. "Student Search fills that need, providing information that can support their transition to college, particularly for historically underrepresented student populations who are already disproportionately unlikely to apply, enroll, and graduate from college."
But the group of lawmakers urging Raoul to investigate argued that the College Board is less than transparent about the program.
"Although the College Board asks students for their consent (including those under age 18) for disclosing their data to colleges, universities and scholarship providers, they do not inform either students or parents that they will be providing the data to these organizations in exchange for a monetary payment," the lawmakers said in a letter to Raoul.
The data involved in the program includes not just students’ test scores, but also information they provide on survey questionnaires that accompany those exams, such as their academic interests and their activities in high school. Colleges, universities and scholarship programs buy the data to identify prospective students.
The lawmakers also noted the College Board is a significant vendor for the state. It has a $29 million contract with the Illinois State Board of Education for the SAT and PSAT exams, and last year it was paid more than $2 million to cover fees for Advanced Placement Tests for low-income students.
The lawmakers said the practice of selling student data might violate at least two state laws, the Student Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits businesses that provide online services to schools from selling or leasing student data, and the Children’s Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act, which bars sale of data of children under 16 without parental consent.
The letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Cristina Castro of Elgin, Robert Martwick of Chicago, Laura Murphy of Des Plaines, and Robert Peters of Chicago. Democratic Reps. Robyn Gabel of Evanston and Will Guzzardi, Lindsey LaPointe, Aaron Ortiz and Ann Williams, all of Chicago, also signed on.
A spokeswoman for Raoul said in an email the office is aware of the lawmakers’ concerns and is looking into the matter.
Cassie Creswell, who heads the advocacy group Illinois Families for Public Schools, said in an interview that Raoul’s office has worked with students and parents to fill out consumer complaint forms so the office can begin an investigation.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Marie Yovanovitch, the former U. S. ambassador to Ukraine, said the State Department removed her from the diplomatic post earlier this year after being pressured by President Donald Trump, according to her opening statement in a closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill with lawmakers Friday.
In her remarks, Yovanovitch said she was told by a high-ranking agency official "that the President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. "
The State Department official "added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the Summer of 2018," according to her statement. "He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past May. "
During a marathon session that last nearly 10 hours, lawmakers questioned Yovanovitch, a key player in the House impeachment probe, on what she knew about efforts by Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.
When it was over, lawmakers declined to discuss any of the specific testimony she offered.
“We are deeply grateful for her decades of service to the country,” said House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , who led the hearing. "I think she has been a model diplomat and deserved better than the shabby treatment she received from this president and the Secretary of State. ”
Trump called her 'bad news. 'Now, the ousted Ukraine ambassador is a key impeachment witness
Republicans who attended denounced the impeachment process.
“For goodness sake, now we've got almost 20 hours of testimony from two ambassadors and the American people don't know what happened in those closed-door sessions, other than what the majority has selectively and cherry picked and leaked out,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee.
Jordan and a group of some of the president’s most vocal defenders demanded that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi call for a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry, saying they believed the process was illegitimate.
“Put your money where your mouth is,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N. Y. said in reference to Pelosi. “Create a process, have a vote, let us know where you stand and let's follow rules. ”
Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry last month after the White House released the details of a July 25 phone conversation Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The inquiry is looking into Trump's efforts to pressure Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.
Yovanovitch, 60, is one of five State Department officials who Democrats have called to Capitol Hill for depositions as they investigate allegations that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.
House Democrats leading the inquiry said the administration tried to keep Yovanovitch silent.

The State Department, at the direction of the White House, directed the ambassador not to appear for her interview Friday, according to a statement from Schiff, Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N. Y.
In response, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to compel her testimony this morning, according to the statement.
"This is the latest example of the Administration’s efforts to conceal the facts from the American people and obstruct our lawful and constitutionally-authorized impeachment inquiry," the statement said. “Any efforts by Trump Administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the Committees will be deemed obstruction of a co-equal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and coverup. ”
Neither the White House nor the State Department responded immediately to a request for comment Friday afternoon.
But Trump, who once described Yovanovitch as "bad news," appeared irritated Thursday about the number of witnesses the House committees are trying to summon.
"How many people can they talk to?," the president said. "We had a simple conversation (with Zelensky). Everybody knows what the conversation was because I gave it immediately when I heard about it . . . I don't know why they'd be calling all these people. It's a very bad situation for our country. "
Lawmakers filtered in and out of the basement hearing room, which was behind two oak doors with red warning signs reading, “Restricted Area,” but most declined to answer questions about the contents of Yovanovitch’s testimony.
One of the few who did was Rep. Stacey Plaskett, D-Virgin Islands, a member of House Oversight and Reform Committee, who said during a lunch break that Yovanovitch seems like a "very credible witness. "
On Thursday, federal prosecutors revealed a plot by two Ukrainian-born business partners to enlist the help of a GOP congressman for the purpose of pressuring the Trump administration to remove Yovanovitch from her post as ambassador to Ukraine.
Yovanovitch remains a State Department employee but is temporarily serving as a fellow at Georgetown University in Washington.
She said in her prepared remarks that while she understands she serves at the pleasure of the president, she was "incredulous that the U. S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives. "
Key testimony: US Ambassador to EU Gordon Sondland, key impeachment witness, will testify
"To make matters worse, all of this occurred during an especially challenging time in bilateral relations with a newly elected Ukrainian president," according to her remarks. "This was precisely the time when continuity in the Embassy in Ukraine was most needed. "
Yovanovitch's decision to testify comes on the same day that another key witness plans to come forward.
Days after being blocked by the Trump administration from testifying before congressional committees, U. S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland says that he will testify.
In a statement sent through his attorneys, Sondland said he "looks forward to testifying on Thursday. "
Nixonian: Trump's Ukraine call and Nixon's Watergate increasingly drawing parallels as scandal erupts
"Notwithstanding the State Department’s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees’ subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday," wrote his attorneys. "Ambassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees’ questions fully and truthfully. "

Texto completo: Vermont fall leaves little room for doubt: It's flannel season. Take a walk around the Green Mountain State this time of year and you're sure to see everything from flannel shirts to plaid-patterned scarves.
So how did flannel become so popular here? You might glean some answers by a quick look at the fabric's origins.
According to a history compiled by Gear Patrol, flannel emerged in Wales, where an abundance of sheep provided a wool fabric particularly suited to their climate, which is quite similar to Vermont's — cold and wet.
In the United States, the fabric was used in the Civil War to keep soldiers warm and dry. Flannel earned its blue-collar reputation during the construction of the country's first railroads, when workers wore flannel long-underwear and overalls.
Paul Bunyan gets credit When did flannel become iconic? Some signs point to Paul Bunyan, when fables and folklore about the giant lumberjack were woven into the fabric of American folklore.
According to the Paul Bunyan Scenic Highway Association in Minnesota, pamphlets distributed nationally at the turn of the 20th century by the Red River Lumber Co. were some of the first to depict Bunyan in flannel, solidifying its reputation as the go-to shirt for the outdoor working class.
The flannel cause was furthered by U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee who, according to the New York Times, famously walked over 1,000 miles across the state in a red-and-black flannel shirt during his gubernatorial campaign.
Then, of course, grunge happened: '90s chart-toppers like Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder and their bandmates started wearing plaid-patterned flannel on tour.
The style was so popular that it even inspired fashion designer Marc Jacobs, who in 1993 released a collection of grunge-inspired clothing for women, replete with flannel dresses and plaid-patterned shirts (the collection was poorly-received and, according to Vogue, got the designer fired from Perry Ellis).
So, why Vermont? So why do Vermonters love flannel so much? In an interview with American Manufacturing, Mark Baker, owner of Vermont Flannel Co., said the style is inextricable from the Green Mountain State.
"It's part of our life up here in Vermont," Baker said in the interview. "It's part of our heritage. Flannel has been part of the landscape of farmers and the people out tapping the maple syrup trees. They wear those flannels. It represents an area that is beautiful and has a lot of hard-working people that know how to survive winters."
Baker said his claim-to-fame is the invention of flannel lounge pants. "I was the first person in the world to make them," Baker said.
If you want to celebrate Vermont's fastidious flannel love, visit Baker's Vermont Flannel Co., a family-operated store that's been in business since 1991. They even have a photo booth where customers can don their new purchase and celebrate the fabric's peak season.
And don't forget to mark Flannel Day on your calendar, celebrated annually by retailers and enthusiasts on Feb. 10.

'She Is His Engine': What Jane Sanders Is Telling Her Husband About 2020

Texto completo: Jane Sanders, long an influential force in her husband's political life, has recently been instrumental in shaping decisions about his health issues, his campaign and the flow of information to the public.
BURLINGTON, Vt. -- When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders.
It was Ms. Sanders who provided a medical update after her husband was hospitalized in Las Vegas last week and had two stents inserted into an artery -- issuing a statement and speaking to reporters outside the hospital. When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information.
And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders -- who has effectively been running the campaign's external communications in Vermont this week -- stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, "especially me," had told him to slow down.
Ms. Sanders has played a central role in her husband's political life for decades, acting as his confidante and his closest adviser. Yet as Mr. Sanders weighs the future of his candidacy, never has it been clearer that the two of them are primarily making the calls for his campaign.
"He'll often say, 'Let's talk to Jane,"' said Representative Ro Khanna of California, one of Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chairs.
"She's the one person Senator Sanders listens to above everybody else -- by an order of magnitude," Mr. Khanna said. "There's no one whose political judgment he trusts more."
In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be "egotistical" to call herself Mr. Sanders's top adviser but allowed that she was "very much a close adviser." Above all, she said, she was "his wife."
"We share a life, and his life is of public service," she said. "So I need to be part of that in order to have a wonderful marriage. It's necessary for us to work together because he works a lot."
Mr. Sanders said in an interview with NBC News Wednesday that he learned he had suffered a heart attack on the night he entered the hospital last week with chest pains. Ms. Sanders, in the interview with The New York Times shortly afterward, said she only learned of it two days later, last Thursday.
Ms. Sanders said the decision not to reveal her husband's heart attack until the next day was motivated by another crisis in her family occurring at the same time: the sudden cancer diagnosis of her daughter-in-law, Rainè Riggs, the wife of Mr. Sanders's son, Levi Sanders. Ms. Riggs died this weekend, at age 46.
"I heard it on Thursday," Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband's heart attack. "But frankly, I wasn't thinking about the campaign."
Ms. Sanders's significant role in her husband's presidential run recalls the close involvement of other political spouses, including Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Nancy Reagan. They had other trusted aides, and Ms. Sanders said her husband does too, listing Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager who has been by his side for decades; Faiz Shakir, his 2020 campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager.
But if most politicians typically rely on their spouses as part of a larger group of consultants and close friends, Mr. Sanders maintains only a small inner circle and has long leaned primarily on his wife, who operates as something of a co-strategist for the Sanders brand.
"Where Jane goes, Bernie goes," said Michael Ceraso, a high-ranking aide on Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign in New Hampshire and California. "She is his engine."
She is also fiercely protective of her husband's image.
When Mr. Sanders had elective hernia surgery in 2015, for example, her preference was not to tell the media, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversations at the time. But other advisers convinced her and Mr. Sanders that if they did not disclose the operation and it was later revealed, their secrecy would create a firestorm in the press. Much like with his heart attack last month, the campaign initially only released a statement with spare details.
The Sanders partnership formed soon after the two met at a political event during his first campaign for mayor in 1981. When he was in City Hall, she ran his youth office. They married in 1988.
When Mr. Sanders was elected to Congress in 1990, Jane Sanders served as his unpaid chief of staff, vetting potential staff members and writing dozens of pieces of legislation. She helped him form the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991, worked on his re-election ads and liaised with reporters.
Those who have worked with Mr. Sanders say his wife has extraordinary influence over his decisions. If they want him to sign off on something, one way to ensure it happens is to get her buy-in first.
That level of trust has made her one of Mr. Sanders's most important assets. During the 2016 campaign, she was credited with helping to humanize her husband, who can come across as gruff and impersonal, offering a tour of their Burlington home and even showing reporters pictures of their wedding day from a photo album.
But she has also complicated his presidential bid: A federal investigation into her role in a 2010 land deal as president of a Vermont college threatened to undercut his populist appeal. (Ms. Sanders's lawyer said last year that he had been told the investigation had been closed.)
She also started a public policy group, the Sanders Institute, that attracted scrutiny because her son served as executive director and drew a salary of $ 100,000 last year. She suspended its operations in March soon after Mr. Sanders announced his run.
And at times, her influence has also frustrated advisers.
Some people familiar with the campaign said she would get annoyed when it appeared that decisions were being made without her input, often prompting her to try to reassert control.
When Mr. Sanders's aides were finalizing plans for the campaign announcement earlier this year, for instance, Ms. Sanders questioned whether it was wise to start the race in Brooklyn: Some observers, she warned, might note that Hillary Clinton had located her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn in 2016.
Her concern perplexed some Sanders advisers who wondered why that was relevant, according to one Democratic official familiar with the discussion, making the case that it was important to set the announcement in the city where Mr. Sanders and President Trump both grew up, to draw a contrast between their values. (Mr. Sanders ultimately did kick off his candidacy in Brooklyn, with a big rally that drew thousands of supporters.)
Mr. Shakir, the campaign manager, said he never heard Ms. Sanders express any concern about the announcement decision.
In another instance, Ms. Sanders was unhappy with one of the commercials Mr. Sanders's consulting team devised for his campaign kickoff earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said. Without discussing their plans with the consultants, the Sanderses decided that he would record a different, more unadorned advertisement from a Burlington studio -- and he ultimately shared that version widely with supporters. But the move prompted the advisers, who played a central role in his 2016 bid, to abruptly quit the campaign.
People who know her say Ms. Sanders's intense involvement stems both from her commitment to changing the world with progressive ideas and from her deep love for her husband.
"It's a critical relationship for both of them," said Jim Rader, a Sanders confidant who officiated their wedding. "I think she's just been a very crucial part of obviously his personal life, but also his professional life."
In the interview, Ms. Sanders said she was most concerned now about getting Mr. Sanders back in good health, including changing his diet to incorporate more vegetables, especially while on the campaign trail. And though she admitted to being worried after his heart scare, she said it had not prompted them to consider dropping out of the race.
"That's been his entire life -- fighting for the average working people in this country, and this is not the time to stop when it feels like things can really change," she said.
"If it was more serious," she added, "I'm sure we would have thought about it."

Deutsche Doesn't Have Trump's Returns, Court Says

Texto completo: If investigators are going to get their hands on President Trump's tax returns, they will have to find them somewhere other than Deutsche Bank.
The German bank -- which for nearly two decades was the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to lend money to Mr. Trump -- has told a federal appeals court that it does not have the president's personal tax returns, the court said on Thursday.
Democratic-controlled congressional committees issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank this year for financial records related to the president, his companies and his family. Mr. Trump sued the bank, which became his main lender after a string of bankruptcies cost other banks hundreds of millions of dollars, to block it from complying.
That litigation is working its way through the federal courts. Last month, The New York Times and other media outlets asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York to unseal a letter from Deutsche Bank that identified two members of the Trump family whose tax returns the bank possesses.
On Thursday, the court rejected the request. Part of the reason, it said, was that Deutsche Bank had informed the court that "the only tax returns it has for individuals and entities named in the subpoenas are not those of the president."
Current and former bank officials previously told The Times that Deutsche Bank had portions of Mr. Trump's personal and corporate tax returns. The bank collected at least some of those tax records in 2011, when Deutsche Bank's private-banking arm -- which caters to the ultra-wealthy -- took on Mr. Trump as a client. The returns and other financial documents were reviewed by a number of bank executives, according to the current and former officials.
Deutsche Bank relied on the information provided in the tax returns and other financial documents to approve a series of loans to Mr. Trump in early 2012 in connection with his Doral golf resort in Florida and his Chicago skyscraper.
Over the ensuing years, Deutsche Bank's private-banking arm continued lending to Mr. Trump, including $ 170 million in 2014 to convert the Old Post Office building, a few blocks from the White House, into a hotel. By the time Mr. Trump was sworn in as president, he owed the bank more than $ 300 million, making it his largest creditor.
It is unclear when Deutsche Bank stopped retaining Mr. Trump's tax returns. A former senior bank executive, who said he had seen the returns, said the normal practice was for Deutsche Bank to keep such materials on file.
Troy Gravitt, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, said the bank was "committed to cooperating with authorized investigations."
Breaking with decades of presidential precedent, Mr. Trump has refused to publicly disclose his federal tax returns, and Democrats are keen to obtain the documents, believing they are crucial to unlocking his closely guarded financial secrets. Mr. Trump is fighting those efforts.
Mr. Trump's lawyers sued Deutsche Bank and another lender, Capital One, to block them from complying with subpoenas that were issued in April by the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees.
The Financial Services Committee has said it wants to know whether Mr. Trump helped Russians and other foreign real estate buyers launder money through his properties, and the Intelligence Committee is trying to determine whether Mr. Trump's financial dealings made him subject to foreign influence. Mr. Trump's lawyers have argued the subpoenas have no legitimate legislative purpose.
During one hearing, judges from the appeals court asked the banks' lawyers whether they had copies of Mr. Trump's returns, and requested a written answer. Deutsche Bank released a partly redacted letter saying it did have at least draft versions of some returns covered by the subpoenas, prompting the news media requests for the information to be unsealed.
Investigators seeking Mr. Trump's tax returns have other avenues to pursue.
Another congressional committee and the Manhattan district attorney have subpoenaed Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his tax returns. Mr. Trump has sued to block those subpoenas as well; on Monday, a federal judge sided with the Manhattan district attorney's office, but Mr. Trump's lawyers quickly appealed.
The House Ways and Means Committee asked the I.R.S. this year to hand over six years of Mr. Trump's returns. The Treasury Department has refused that request.

Texto completo: In a newly published guide, federal health officials say doctors "should never abandon" pain patients and warn of acute withdrawal and other risks.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Thursday instructed doctors to use more caution when taking chronic pain patients off opioid medications, a response to reports that many have been cutting off prescriptions too quickly, in some cases even dismissing patients from their practice.
The Department of Health and Human Services published a guide intended to be a course correction of sorts. In 2016, after years of rising addiction rates and deaths from prescription painkiller overdoses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued nonbinding guidelines for primary care doctors that urged more cautious prescribing. A backlash ensued, particularly from some doctor and patient groups who said the guidelines were hurting people with severe chronic pain, many of whom had been on high doses of opioids for years without becoming addicted.
After more than 300 medical providers, pharmacists, patient advocates and others emphasized these concerns in a letter to the C.D.C. earlier this year, the agency put out a clarifying statement saying the guidelines did not "support abrupt tapering or sudden discontinuation of opioids," and warning doctors not to misapply them.
The new tapering guide goes deeper, detailing the potential harms to patients who abruptly stop taking opioids and laying out factors to consider and steps to take before starting a taper. It includes several examples of tapering protocols.
"We need to maintain a balance," said Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the department's assistant secretary for health, adding that "it is a false choice to say we could only limit opioid use disorder or addiction or have pain control."
Annual opioid prescriptions in the United State peaked at 255 million in 2012 after increasing every year for more than a decade -- a rise that fueled the epidemic of overdose deaths that continues to plague the nation. But by 2017, the number of opioid prescriptions had fallen to 191 million, a drop that President Trump has pointed to as a victory, even as his administration has begun responding to chronic pain patients angry about being forced off the drugs.
While deaths from prescription opioids have fallen -- they are the main reason why fatal overdoses dipped slightly overall last year for the first time since 1990 -- the number of people dying from illicit fentanyl, another opioid, continues to rise. Prescription painkillers were the main cause of overdose deaths until heroin, and then fentanyl, surpassed them over the last decade. Critics have argued that curbing prescriptions for legal painkillers drove some people to seek illegal opioids, like heroin and fentanyl.
The tapering guide was written by a work group led by Admiral Giroir, with members from the C.D.C., the National Institutes of Health, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and other federal agencies that fall under the health and human services department. Admiral Giroir and two others who helped lead the group -- including Dr. Deborah Dowell of the C.D.C., the lead author of the 2016 guidelines -- also published an article about the guide Thursday in the medical journal JAMA. The C.D.C. had already published its own "pocket guide" for doctors on tapering.
The new guide states that doctors "should never abandon" pain patients, and warns of risks including "acute withdrawal, pain exacerbation, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, self-harm, ruptured trust, and patients seeking opioids from high-risk sources."
It says that opioid doses are typically reduced by between 5 and 20 percent a week, but that slower tapers are often better tolerated, partly because they are less likely to trigger withdrawal symptoms.
But the guide also lays out reasons to consider tapering patients off opioids, stressing that the benefits of staying on the drugs need to outweigh the risks. Those risks are substantial, including addiction and overdose, but many chronic pain patients and their doctors say they have been able to stay on high doses of opioids and function competently.
A growing body of research has found that opioids are usually not the best treatment for long-term pain other than from cancer and certain other conditions, and that over-the-counter ibuprofen, physical therapy and other approaches may work better, with far fewer risks.
Salimah Meghani, an associate professor of nursing and a pain researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who has criticized the C.D.C. prescribing guidelines, said the new guide "provides important and much-needed clarification."
But she added that state-level crackdowns on opioid prescribing also need to be reconsidered, particularly those that limit daily opioid doses to below 90 morphine milligram equivalents. The 2016 guidelines advised not to increase doses above that level, but that prompted many states and insurers to set it as a limit for all non-cancer patients, including those who were already taking more.
That, Ms. Meghani said, has "led to wide scale inappropriate opioid tapering or simply dumping of complex pain patients."

Texto completo: ESPN tapped senior writer Mina Kimes to host the network's new daily morning podcast that will debut this month. "ESPN Daily" will premiere Oct. 21, with each approximately 20-minute episode focusing on a single big story - an investigation, a big game from the night before or a larger trend.
Daily news podcasts have become a crowded space on the news side. The New York Times launched "The Daily" in 2017, NPR's "Up First" and Slate's "What Next" come out every weekday morning, and The Washington Post's "Post Reports" delivers new episodes each weekday afternoon. Last month, subscription sports media company the Athletic launched "The Lead" with host Kavitha Davidson. As other shows have pioneered, the idea behind ESPN's offering is to harness the power of a large newsroom's reporting and analysis with a prominent host for an increasingly popular format.
"First and foremost this is about sports, and sports are fun and sports are exciting," Kimes said in an interview. "They can be serious, and they delve into social and cultural issues - we're going to do investigative stories - but there should be room for joy and passion, and I think that's what makes sports different generally and also the podcast."
As for what an episode might sound like, Kimes cited exploring big stories such as a July piece by NBA reporter Ramona Shelburne on how Kawhi Leonard lured Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers.
"All I wanted to do when I was reading that story was to find out how Ramona got wind of that story and how she reported it," she said. "It's the perfect 20-minute conversation."
The show also will have room to highlight less high-profile stories, for instance a piece by Aishwarya Kumar about how elite chess players physically train for their matches, Kimes said. Other episodes could be more timely and feature a close examination of a big playoff game, for example. ESPN's reporters are regularly talking about their reporting on a bevy of ESPN's platforms, but Kimes said the podcast is set up to probe deeper and illuminate both the reporting process and new layers to big stories.
Based in Los Angeles, Kimes will work with a team of five recently hired audio producers to create episodes that will be ready every Monday through Friday in time for the morning commute on the East Coast.
Kimes will continue to host her podcast "The Mina Kimes Show" and said she would eventually be back on TV, appearing on afternoon opinion shows such as "Highly Questionable" and "Around the Horn."

Texto completo: Although she was considered one of her accounting firm's top management consultants, much of the company's leadership was not particularly fond of Ann Hopkins in 1982.
The overwhelmingly male partners at accounting firm Price Waterhouse - now PwC - had given feedback that the company considered when it denied her a partnership that year. Their criticisms were stinging:
"Needs a course in charm school."
"Overly aggressive."
"Matured from a tough-talking, somewhat masculine, hard-nosed manager to an authoritative, formidable, but much more appealing lady partner candidate."
When Hopkins was told the next year that she would never make partner at the firm, she filed a lawsuit that rose to the Supreme Court and set a precedent about workplace sex discrimination.
"I think of myself as tough-minded, which is different than tough," she told the New York Times in 1988. "To be tough-minded is to challenge whatever the assertions are."
Three decades later, the nation's highest court is again considering whether discrimination laws protect freedom of gender expression - this time, allowing a worker to marry a person of the same sex or to display a different gender from their biological sex without negative employment repercussions.
The court on Tuesday considered whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination "because of sex" and on the basis of other characteristics, protects gay and transgender workers. More than one attorney for the two cases invoked Hopkins's 1988 case during oral arguments.
As in Hopkins's case, the contemporary cases hinge on how broadly the justices define gender stereotyping, said Deborah Dinner, a law professor at Emory University who specializes in the legal history of gender and work.
"The stereotype is that a male should dress in a certain way or perform his gender identity in a particular way or should have romantic relationships with women and not men," Dinner said. "And so by discriminating on the basis of somebody's gender identity or on the basis of their sexual orientation, what an employer in fact is doing is discriminating on the basis of a gender stereotype."
Attorneys for Hopkins told the Supreme Court that she had been the only woman out of 88 candidates for partner in 1982. Supporters of her candidacy had highlighted that she secured the firm's most valuable contract, a multimillion-dollar project with the State Department.
Some of Price Waterhouse's partners, however, described her as "overcompensated for being a woman" and criticized her use of profanity. The male boss who told Hopkins her candidacy was on hold suggested that she "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup, have her hair styled and wear jewelry."
Hopkins resigned from the Washington office of Price Waterhouse and started working at the World Bank. Attorneys for Price Waterhouse told the Supreme Court that the company had passed over her for partner because she had poor interpersonal skills, including being abrasive with office staff.
The court ruled 6 to 3 that an employer had to show its hiring decisions were not based on sex stereotyping. A company that takes adverse employment action against a woman because of the belief that women should not be aggressive, for example, has inappropriately used gender to motivate its decision.
Federal laws forbidding employers from discriminating against people because of their sex also are meant to ban treating men and women differently based on sex stereotypes, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in the majority opinion, quoting an earlier case.
"An employer who objects to aggressiveness in women but whose positions require this trait places women in an intolerable and impermissible Catch-22: out of a job if they behave aggressively and out of a job if they do not," Brennan wrote. "Title VII lifts women out of this bind."
A subsequent decision by a lower-court judge forced Price Waterhouse to make Hopkins a partner and give her more than $370,000 in back pay. She rejoined the company and worked there until 2002. In other people's employment disputes, companies now needed to be able to show that they would have made the same decision about a worker if gender had not been a factor.
"I had no choice but to sue," Hopkins told The Washington Post in 1988. "I had to do this as a matter of principle. It was inevitable and predictable. I did not set out to be a leader."
The Price Waterhouse ruling created a foundation for future court cases, said Katherine Turk, a history and gender studies professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Transgender and non-binary people had a new basis to argue that discriminating based on sexual identity is just another way to enforce the display of gender stereotypes at work.
David Cole, an attorney for a woman who says she was fired from a funeral home because she told the owners she was transgender and would transition, told the Supreme Court justices Tuesday that his client's case addressed the same issue as Hopkins's case and should be resolved the same way.
"In firing her for failing to conform to its owner's explicitly stated stereotypes about how men and women should behave, it discriminated against her in the same way that Price Waterhouse discriminated against Ann Hopkins for failing to walk and talk more femininely," Cole said.
Hopkins, who died last year, wrote in her 1996 memoir "So Ordered: Making Partner the Hard Way" that she wondered how her career would have been different had she been a partner at Price Waterhouse before a court ordered it.
"Would I have risen higher in the ranks to a position where I could have more effectively influenced the firm to cherish diversity?" she wrote. "Would some of the men I worked for have been working for me? I don't know. What I do know is I never compromised on what I valued or believed."

Tulsi Gabbard 'seriously considering' boycotting 'undemocratic' October debate

Texto completo: Tulsi Gabbard said she is weighing sitting out of Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate in order to bring attention to a debate process that she argues is undemocratic.
"The DNC and the corporate media are essentially trying to usurp your role as voters in choosing who our Democratic nominee will be," Gabbard said in a video released Thursday. "They are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic, and they're holding so-called debates which really are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, rather than to inform or enlighten."
The Hawaii congresswoman and Iraq veteran is 1 of 12 Democratic presidential hopefuls slated to appear in Ohio on Tuesday for a debate hosted by CNN and the New York Times.
"In order to bring attention to this serious threat to our democracy and to ensure that your voice is heard, I'm seriously considering boycotting the next debate on October 15th," Gabbard said. "I'm going to announce my decision within the next few days."
[Related: DNC plans to limit debate stage curbed as Tulsi Gabbard qualifies for October debate]
Tweet
She qualified for the October debate after missing the mark for the September round, which had the same standards of 130,000 individual donors plus 2% support in at least three Democratic National Committee-approved polls. The DNC did not count many polls showing Gabbard at 2% support toward the qualifying threshold, causing her campaign in August to call on the DNC to "make adjustments to the process now to ensure transparency and fairness."
Gabbard, who resigned from her post as the DNC vice chairwoman in 2016 so she could endorse Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton, pointed to the last Democratic presidential primary cycle as evidence of a corrupt system.
"The 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders," she said. "In this 2020 election, the DNC and the corporate media are rigging the election again."
Critics wondered whether Gabbard's threat is serious or whether she may have other motives for skipping the debate.
"Some Democrats have been saying all along Gabbard's plan was to divide the party and help Trump. This evidence strengthens that case," New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait said in a tweet.
"This is a pathetic and desperate gambit, but she is correct that the debates are reality TV meant to entertain more than inform," said writer Gary Legum.
President Trump skipped a Republican presidential primary debate during the 2016 cycle, an escalation of his feud with then-Fox News host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly.
Gabbard was the most-searched candidate after debates in June and July. She tore into competitor Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan during the June round for incorrectly saying that the Taliban attacked the United States on 9/11. In the July round, she accused California Sen. Kamala Harris of keeping innocent people on death row.
Gabbard has crossed the 165,000 donor threshold for the November debate but has not received any qualifying polls for that round, which requires 3% in at least four polls or 5% support in two early state polls.

Joe Biden worked with whistleblower when he was vice president, officials reveal

Texto completo: The 2020 Democratic candidate with whom the CIA whistleblower had a "professional" tie is Joe Biden, according to intelligence officers and former White House officials.
Lawyers for the whistleblower said he had worked only "in the executive branch." The Washington Examiner has established that he is a career CIA analyst who was detailed to the National Security Council at the White House and has since left. On Sept. 26, the New York Times reported that he was a CIA officer. On Oct. 4, the newspaper added that he "was detailed to the National Security Council at one point."
Michael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community's inspector general, told members of Congress that the whistleblower had a "professional tie" to a 2020 Democratic candidate. He had written earlier that while the whistleblower's complaint was credible, he had shown "some indicia of an arguable political bias ... in favor of a rival political candidate."
A retired CIA officer told the Washington Examiner, “From everything we know about the whistleblower and his work in the executive branch then, there is absolutely no doubt he would have been working with Biden when he was vice president."
As an experienced CIA official on the NSC with the deep knowledge of Ukraine that he demonstrated in his complaint, it is probable that the whistleblower briefed Biden and likely that he accompanied him on Air Force Two during at least one of the six visits the 2020 candidate made to the country.
A former Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said Biden’s work on foreign affairs brought him into close proximity with the whistleblower either at the CIA or when he was detailed to the White House.
“This person, after working with Biden, may feel defensive towards him because he feels [Biden] is being falsely attacked. Maybe he is even talking to Biden’s staff,” the former official said. “Maybe it is innocent, maybe not.”
Last month, the whistleblower accused President Trump of abusing his position by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. His complaint is now at the center of a Democrat-led impeachment inquiry, prompting Trump and his allies to cry foul.
Biden was President Barack Obama’s "point man" on Ukraine, making a half dozen trips there in his eight years as vice president. Those trips involved briefings from senior intelligence officials and NSC officers, some of whom traveled with him to Kyiv and elsewhere.
“The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS,” tweeted Trump, after the "professional" link was revealed by the Washington Examiner. “Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?”
Tweet
Trump said Thursday he did not know the identity of the whistleblower.
The connection to Biden has emerged a week after Atkinson, the Intelligence Community's inspector general, briefed the House Intelligence Committee on the whistleblower’s complaint.
After the report on what Atkinson said, lawyers for the whistleblower immediately insisted their client was not motivated by political considerations, but their cryptic comment fueled speculation about his identity. The careful statement did not rule out that the whistleblower worked with one of the candidates before they started running for president.
"First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party," said Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid. "Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch."

Glenn Carle, a former CIA officer who himself blew the whistle on George W. Bush administration efforts to collect intelligence on an American citizen, said the distinction was crucial. “The truth is that the whistleblower would have worked with Biden not in some partisan political sense but as a member of the government,” he said. “It is scurrilous to suppose there was a political motivation.”
He added that it was possible that the CIA officer briefed senators or representatives who were now running for president.

Texto completo: HELENA, Mont. - The death of a ranger, Brad Treat, in 2016 was a wake-up call for grizzly bear biologists.
Treat, an avid mountain biker, was zipping along at about 25 mph through dense forest near Glacier National Park on a summer afternoon when he collided with a large male grizzly bear.
Apparently startled, the bear reacted defensively and quickly killed him. A witness couldn’t see what happened but could hear it. “I heard a thud and an ‘argh,’ ” the unnamed witness told investigators. Then the bear made a noise “like it was hurt.” The bear disappeared before emergency responders arrived.
Dr. Christopher Servheen, who led the committee that investigated Treat’s death, said the accident prompted him to speak out publicly against recreational sports in the areas where grizzlies live.
This summer, he tried to stop two ultramarathons in Flathead National Forest, but the Forest Service approved the contests anyway. One was held last weekend, at a time when bears are particularly active in foraging for food before their hibernating season begins later this year.
“We tell people not to run in grizzly bear habitat, to make noise and to be aware of their surroundings,” said Servheen, who has retired from his post as coordinator for the grizzly bear recovery program of the Fish and Wildlife Service. “Agencies are permitting the very activities we are telling people not to do.”
Vast tracts of public land in the West have become favorite haunts of a growing number of mountain bikers, exploring wild areas for recreation. The Trump administration recently allowed e-bikes, or electric bikes, to be used on all federal trails where bicycles are allowed.
The increasing popularity of trail biking has brought to the fore some of the inherent conflicts in the uses of public land - natural regions or playgrounds. And while the growth of tourism may help local businesses, the forays into deeper parts of the forests by more and more people are encroaching on wildlife.
Mechanized mountain bikes and e-bikes, especially at higher speeds, are incompatible with hiking, hunting, and bird and wildlife watching, some argue. Safety is a concern. Some mountain bikers revel at bombing through the woods at 20 or 30 mph on single-track trails that hikers also frequent.
And biologists like Servheen who have spent decades studying grizzlies offer reminders about protecting the bears and other wildlife that unwittingly share their territory with more people and more mechanized vehicles.
Dr. Stephen Herrero, a professor emeritus of ecology at the University of Calgary, spent much of his career studying grizzlies, and is the author of “Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance.” An avid mountain bike rider, he shares Servheen’s concerns.
“Bears respond to surprises usually by fleeing, but sometimes by attacking whatever it is that is surprising them,” Herrero said. “Events like runners and bike riders and anything else that suddenly thrusts a disturbance or surprise into their environment, they sometimes respond by attacking.
“I try to avoid mountain biking in any area that is grizzly bear habitat,” he said. “There are plenty of areas that aren’t.”
Bikers tend to play down the risks. Rebecca Briber, executive director of the Flathead Area Mountain Bikers, said she always carried bear spray with her on rides. “We’re always aware we are recreating in bear country,” she said. “Mountain bike-grizzly bear interactions are rare. It’s more common for hikers to be attacked.”
Other concerns include whether the increase in biking in natural areas could do more to displace grizzlies and other wildlife than hiking, because bikes cover so much more ground, Servheen said.
Because the popularity of biking in these areas has grown rapidly, there is little research on its effects on wildlife. But there is a growing body of evidence that outdoor recreation of all kinds has serious consequences for wildlife.
“Overall, we found a moderate to strong effect of recreation on wildlife across the board,” said Courtney Larson, who published a literature review of 274 studies in 2016 for her doctorate at Colorado State University and has just completed a meta-analysis on the effects of recreation.
The singular influence that mountain biking might have on the surrounding environment is not known, she said. “It’s a little difficult to tease out on its own because most of the time, mountain bike use occurs on multiple-use trails with hiking, mountain biking, dogs and horseback riders on the same trails,” Larson said.
But the effect of humans touring through wildlife habitats should be taken seriously, she said. “We can’t make an assumption that recreation is a benign use of conserved lands,” she added.
Wildlife needs to feel secure and animals can be stressed by the presence of people. Startling elk, deer or any other animal causes them to flee, to use up energy and avoid areas where they are surprised but that they might need for feeding.
Enough pressure from people may interrupt an elk’s feeding habits and have long-term implications for a herd. “If a female doesn’t put on enough body fat, she might not be able to conceive the next year,” said Michael Wisdom, a researcher with the Pacific Northwest Research Station, part of the Forest Service, and an author of the study. “An increase in time running reduces time foraging.”
To complicate matters, advanced technologies for mountain biking contribute to deeper exploration of natural areas. Mountain bikes with snow tires, for example, expand the season of riding to winter, when wildlife are most vulnerable.
Solutions include better management of trails used by mountain bikes, as well as restricting use on some trails, lowering any speed limits and permitting bike riders only on dirt roads.
One solution “is careful planning of the trail corridor and the design,” said David Wiens, executive director of the International Mountain Bicycling Association in Gunnison, Colorado. “That’s where the agencies get involved and the wildlife specialists, who can come up with the proper location of the trail based on their expertise. In certain cases, there are seasonal closures for wildlife.”
Some mountain biking groups, though, continue to fight for access to excluded wilderness areas. A bill titled the Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act, introduced this year by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, would allow local managers to decide if mountain bikes are appropriate in designated wilderness.
“What should keep people from doing it,” Servheen said, “is common sense and the belief that grizzly bears have a reason to be here and I have lots of other places to recreate.”
“I am not against mountain biking,” he said. “But we need to understand grizzlies don’t have any other place to go. It’s their living room.”

China isn't the only country trying to stifle our free speech

Texto completo: A bunch of foreigners are deciding what we Americans can read online.
Outrageous. Who do those Austrians think they are, anyway?
No, I didn't get the country wrong. I'm talking about Austria, a liberal democracy and member of the European Union. Last week, one of its politicians won a court case that ought to alarm all free-speaking Americans.
You might have thought I was going after China, which is using its economic might to punish the National Basketball Association, just because the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Remember that Twitter is banned in China, so hardly anyone there ever saw the message. This wasn't about stifling domestic protests, but silencing criticism everywhere else in the world.
While the NBA belatedly stood behind the free-speech rights of its personnel, some of its fans who attended an exhibition game of a Chinese team in Philadelphia this week said they were ejected for showing solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. Meanwhile, even mighty Apple has been cowed; it pulled an app from its online store at China's behest that pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong used to track the movements of police. And Google has stopped distributing a game for Android phones that let users pretend to be a protester in Hong Kong.
The news from Europe isn't nearly as bad as the bullying from Beijing. But precisely because it's a matter of law rather than a dictator's whim, the Case of the Irritated Austrian may pose a worrisome threat to online freedom for years to come.
The ruling arose out of an incident in 2016, when someone on Facebook wrote that Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, head of the Austrian Green Party, was a “lousy traitor" and a “corrupt bumpkin" who belonged to a “fascist party." That kind of babble happens in the United States every day and barely merits a shrug, or maybe just a holla-back — “I'm no traitor! You're a traitor!" But in Austria, such words may be sanctioned as illegal defamation.
Glawischnig-Piesczek sued in an Austrian court and won an order that Facebook must take down the offending words. But the court wasn't content with riding herd on the reading habits of people in Austria. It held that Facebook had to take the message down around the world, so that absolutely nobody could read it.
I'd thought the United States had dodged this particular bullet. In 2014, the European Union's highest court declared that citizens of the EU had the right to demand that search services like Google must take down embarrassing information about them if it was no longer relevant — being fired from a job 20 years earlier, for instance. Google begrudgingly complied. Since then, it's received nearly 846,000 takedown requests from Europeans and removed 1.3 million webpages. But since the law applied to the EU, Google didn't delist the pages elsewhere in the world.
In 2016, France fined Google for refusing to delete the disputed information beyond the EU. After all, someone in France could still access that information, simply by going to the American version at Google.com instead of the French edition at Google.fr. But in September, the EU's supreme court disagreed, ruling that Europe's “right to be forgotten" can be enforced only against Google's European sites.
Case closed? Not so fast.
On Oct. 3, the same court, ruling in the Glawischnig-Piesczek case, said that if the message in question is defamatory, the ban can be enforced worldwide. Facebook has to delete the disputed insults against her from its entire network, or it could face sanctions in the European Union, where the company generated about $14 billion in revenue last year. Worse yet, the court ruled that Facebook must also take down “equivalent content" — in other words, posts that say essentially the same thing.
Now, how to enforce such a ruling? Automate the process, the EU court says. Surely Facebook's computers can ferret out every instance of the insults in question. That might work for exact copies of the original post. But Facebook must also ban messages that say roughly the same thing. But what if the words are used in a message that supports Glawischnig-Piesczek, or a news story that merely describes the affair?
Facebook must sort it all out on a global scale, every time an EU court demands a new takedown. That will never work. Either insults will seep through, or the filters will be so strict that even modest criticisms are barred, and free speech is smothered.
A few years back, I wrote about the need for an international treaty to set standards on Internet content regulation. We Americans already have the perfect template — the First Amendment — but most of the world isn't nearly as open-minded. So we'll have to compromise. And here's where to start: Let's tell the Europeans that we'll recognize their “right to be forgotten" law and its nitpicky definition of defamation, but only until we hit the Atlantic coast. On this side of the water, let's play by our rules.
But the US can't hash out such a deal with China because Beijing won't bend on the issue of censorship. So there's only one question: Will we?
In effect, America's corporations, desperate for Chinese cash, are negotiating with themselves. And so far, free speech is losing.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del, has yet to decide whether he thinks President Donald Trump should be removed from office.
"I support the impeachment inquiry," Coons said. "Not necessarily removal."
The inquiry follows reports that the president tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, a Delaware resident and former U.S. senator.
It also followed a whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official that the Washington Post and the New York Times have said involved details of a July phone call Trump had with Zelensky.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, the state's lone congressional representative, announced in July that she supported impeachment proceedings. U.S. Sens. Tom Carper, D-Del., and Coons have been less quick to announce a stance.
Carper's office did not respond for comment on Tuesday.
Coons, who sees his chamber as a jury during the impeachment process, says it's too early to make a decision.
The Senate has to wait for the House to act. Once an officeholder is impeached by the House, a trial is held by the Senate to determine whether the accused is guilty of the charges. If a guilty verdict is returned, only then can the accused be removed from office.
"To say that I support an impeachment inquiry means I think the House should do its job and get to the bottom of this," Coons said. "It's inappropriate for senators to say what punishment they may or may not think is appropriate before there's even been articles of impeachment referred to the Senate."
Coons still wants to see the full transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky.
"We don't know what facts will be presented to the Senate yet," Coons said. "The facts may well develop in a different direction than we see them today. ... If I conclude that the facts as presented rise to the level of an impeachable offense, then I either will or won't vote for removal."
After the inquiry was launched, the White House released a summary of a July telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
According to the summary, Trump pressed Zelensky to reopen an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company to focus on any involvement by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president did not tie any U.S. aid to the investigation, as some had inferred.
In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son — that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Trump said, according to the summary. "Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me."
The inquiry, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced in late September, has loomed over Capitol Hill's day-to-day legislating.
Coons said that he has had "virtually no conversation" with Senate Republicans about impeachment. The majority caucus members "will simply change the subject" when he brings it up, Coons said.
"They're anxious about what else is going to come forward," Coons said. "The ways in which President Trump has acted this week give them real pause and concern. ... His middle-of-the-night tweets in recent days are even more jarring than his usual style."
He pointed to Trump on Thursday calling on China to also investigate Biden. China has reportedly rejected that request, with officials saying the country doesn't want to get involved in U.S. domestic politics.
Coons worries that the president could "behave in more and more erratic ways" because of the inquiry.
"It is making what was already a difficult environment more likely into a dysfunctionally (sic) partisan environment," Coons said.
Coons thinks the topic will become "unavoidable" when Congress reconvenes next week.
"I'm really hoping to have some stronger conversations in person," he said.
In the Republican-ruled Senate, Coons thinks that enough of his colleagues could decide the president's actions, however inappropriate, don't reach the threshold for impeachment.
"I am not optimistic that there will be a lengthy trial or that there will be really a fair ... consideration of any allegations against the president," Coons said. "The odds of his removal, given that that's never happened in American history, are very low."
Coons has joined other Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats in calling for their committee to investigate the whistleblower report and hold a hearing with U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
As of Tuesday, Coons had yet to read the whistleblower report, and committee chair Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., hasn't agreed to hold a hearing, the Delaware senator said.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Possibly some readers have followed the controversy over the New York Times' 1619 Project, an effort to take a new look at the history of slavery in America. 1619 refers to the date the first black slaves were brought to the shores of America.
After the Times launched the project in August, conservatives freaked out. Among others, former congressman and Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich argued the project was a “lie” and propaganda. National Review editor Rich Lowry stated that the essays presented an “odious and reductive lie” that “racism is the essence of America.” The general criticism raised by conservatives was that the 1619 Project was attempting to divide and delegitimize America.
The conservatives seem deeply uneasy about looking under the rock that is American slavery. Accompanying a fear of this history is the desire to maintain an innocence about the American past. We all grew up with the triumphalist narrative that focuses on heroic American moments. From the Founding Fathers to Abraham Lincoln to defeating fascism in World War II, there are undeniable heroics.
However, fear of history is dangerous and can lead to the promotion of illusions. It is past time that we, as a society, look harder into the history of slavery because that experience still shapes our world. Investigating slavery is like staring into the heart of darkness. There is a desire to look away.
The truth is that there has been an unwillingness to examine the history. In schools I attended, the subject of slavery was largely passed over. I don't think that is too different from the experience of most Americans.
Let me put out some ideas about slavery that I have gleaned from my own exploration. Much of my thinking has been shaped by a brilliant book, The American Slave Coast, written by historians Ned and Constance Sublette.
The Sublettes argue an alternative view of slavery in the United States. Rather than seeing slavery simply as a source of unpaid labor, they see slavery in the United States as a slave-breeding system. They write: “The story of national expansion premised on the reproduction of captive humans who were labor, merchandise and collateral, all at once, is horrific, and it's basic to the story of our development as a nation. It's not a sidebar to American history, it's central. It's particularly important, because despite the best work of scholars, American history has always come up against a disinformation process that has sanitized it. But sanitized history won't explain how we got to the mess we have today.”
Slave-breeding was a commercial enterprise to expand slavery westward. The Sublettes see the struggle that went on between Virginia and South Carolina as a central conflict. Slaveowners in Virginia competed with South Carolina over African importation of slaves.
South Carolina slaveholders obtained their slaves from Africa via the Middle Passage. Virginia bred slaves for the domestic market and aimed to supply high-priced slaves throughout the South. Both states favored the expansion of slavery into western territories as that was seen as essential to the growth potential of the industry and its profits.
The Sublettes argue that the 1808 abolition of the transatlantic slave trade was a huge protectionist victory for Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia slaveholders. By stopping the African importation, Jefferson crippled South Carolina's ability to compete against Virginia.
W.E.B. Dubois described it: “Slaves without the African slave trade became more valuable; with cotton culture their value rose still further, so that they were fed adequately and their breeding systematically encouraged.”
Jefferson had bragged to George Washington that the birth of black children increased Virginia's capital stock by 4% annually. Jefferson owned over 600 slaves during his lifetime. Washington owned over 300. They were the two presidents who owned the most slaves.
Slaves were the equivalent of money. They also were the basis for increased Southern political representation due to the three-fifths clause in the U.S. Constitution.
The Sublettes show how Native Americans had to be cleared out of the Southeastern United States to pave the way for the creation of cotton plantations. Andrew Jackson was key to that effort. More generally, they show how many presidents before Lincoln accommodated slavery. With the exception of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, all the presidents before Lincoln owned slaves.
Some of the stories the Sublettes tell are shocking.
President James K. Polk fought the Mexican War, in part, to annex Texas and extend slavery there. He bought slaves in secret while in the White House to feather his post-presidential nest. Polk was the absentee owner of a slave plantation in Mississippi. The overseer of his plantation had a reputation for cruelty and merciless whippings. Polk's slaves ran away much more than the norm of that time.
Maybe most shocking in the Sublettes' account was the treatment of African American women. There was no such thing as rape of an enslaved woman. It wasn't considered possible that rape could be committed against a slave. Rape was, however, a virtual industry in the South. The historian Kellie Carter Jackson writes: “Enslaved women had no right to their bodies, no right to their children and no right to refuse enforced breeding.”
The slave-breeding industry is an example of how far human beings will go in the unrestrained pursuit of profit. A much deeper exploration of the history of slavery is needed, and the conservatives' fear of untold history is misplaced. We do not have that many slave narratives, but we need a bottom-up view of the institution. Shallowness of understanding is a much bigger problem than potential bias in telling the story.
In American history, it does not lessen the positives to be honest about negatives. The 1619 Project and other efforts to tell the slavery story should be welcomed.

Texto completo: Days after a massacre of G.I.s, he was a one-man onslaught in the face of German tanks, earning a Medal of Honor. Only two other honorees from World War II now survive.
The town of Malmedy in the Ardennes region of Belgium is remembered for one of the most notorious war crimes against American prisoners in World War II. More than 80 unresisting G.I.s were shot to death on the town's outskirts by members of a German SS armored division in December 1944, soon after their surrender on the second day of the Battle of the Bulge, a surprise counterattack by the Germans bringing huge Allied casualties along a broad front.
Four days after what became known as the Malmedy massacre, Francis Currey, a lanky 19-year-old Army private in the 30th Infantry Division, carried out an extraordinary feat of arms to repulse an onslaught by the First SS Panzer Division a few miles from where its members had committed the massacre.
"Doughboy Throws Arsenal at Nazis," read a headline in The New York Times.
Private Currey and other infantrymen were in foxholes, backing up American antitank troops.
The Germans overran the antitank positions. But during the next 24 hours, Private Currey wielded his M-1 rifle, a bazooka, a Browning automatic rifle, two types of machine guns and an assortment of grenades to knock out several German tanks and rescue wounded Americans.
He received the Medal of Honor in July 1945, by which time he had been promoted to sergeant.
The citation said, "Through his extensive knowledge of weapons and by his heroic and repeated braving of murderous enemy fire, Sgt. Currey was greatly responsible for inflicting heavy losses in men and material on the enemy, for rescuing five comrades, two of whom were wounded, and for stemming an attack which threatened to flank his battalion's position."
Mr. Currey died on Tuesday at his home in Selkirk, N.Y., near Albany. He was 94. His death, which was confirmed by his son Michael, leaves two veterans who received the Medal of Honor in World War II still living.
Charles Coolidge, 98, was cited for bravery in France while an Army technical sergeant. Hershel Williams, 96, was decorated for heroism in the battle for Iwo Jima while a Marine corporal.
In recalling his exploits of Dec. 21, 1944, long afterward, Mr. Currey once told The Times Union of Albany, "It was just one day of nine months of steady combat."
But it was an extraordinary day.
The firefight began about 4 a.m. with the American antitank units overrun. Private Currey and at least five other infantrymen, from their division's 20th Regiment, withdrew to an abandoned factory that had been used as an American military hospital before its doctors and patients were pulled out in the face of the German offensive.
Private Currey and another G.I., braving fire from German infantrymen and tanks, raced across a road and grabbed bazooka rockets and antitank grenades from a smashed American halftrack.
After firing a bazooka to disable a tank, Private Currey shot three Germans in the doorway of a nearby stone house with his Browning weapon, then knocked down part of its wall with his bazooka, collapsing it on the Germans inside.
At that point, he saw that five G.I.s from the antitank unit had been cut off and were being fired on by German armor. He hurled grenades at those tanks, sending their crews fleeing into the remnants of the house, then blasted the house with machine-gun fire, saving the trapped Americans, two of them wounded.
Private Currey, incurring only a minor wound, then joined other squad members in speeding away in a jeep with the two injured soldiers, guided only by dim headlamps in the darkness, with Mr. Currey riding shotgun in case German soldiers spotted them.
"We did not have the slightest idea of where we were in the middle of Belgium," Mr. Currey was quoted as saying by Michael Collins and Martin King in "Voices of the Bulge" (2011), recalling that nighttime ride.
The G.I.s were, in fact, stopped by another American regiment's roadblock and suspected of being enemy infiltrators -- English-speaking German troops wearing American uniforms.
"They did not believe our story until we talked to someone who had some brains," Mr. Currey recalled. "The next day they moved us back to our regiment."
Francis Sherman Currey was born on July 29, 1925, in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y. He was orphaned at 12 and reared by foster parents on a farm in the nearby town of Hurleyville.
He joined the Army in June 1943, a week after graduating from high school, a six-footer but weighing only 130 pounds.
By the time the European war ended, he had been awarded a Silver Star and a Bronze Star for exploits after the events at Malmedy and three Purple Hearts, in addition to his Medal of Honor.
He was later a veterans' counselor in Albany.
Lt. Col. Joachim Peiper, the commander of the troops who committed the massacre, was tried by an American military tribunal along with many of his men and spent more than 10 years in prison.
In addition to his son Michael, Mr. Currey is survived by his wife, Wilma (French) Currey; another son, Jonathan; his daughter, Kathy Domery; seven grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Currey became the first Medal of Honor recipient to be portrayed as a G.I. Joe action figure. In his later years, he was honored at an annual parade in Hurleyville.
Mr. Currey had become the leader of his 48-member platoon in the final months of his combat duty. But he found it difficult to forge bonds with his men, since they were mostly replacements whom he barely knew. Only four or five soldiers from the original platoon roster were still with him. The toll of casualties had mounted.
"I couldn't buddy up with anyone outside of them," Mr. Currey told Gerald Astor for the Battle of the Bulge oral history "A Blood-Dimmed Tide" (1992). "A guy in the platoon was killed and it was horrible, I couldn't remember his name."

Texto completo: Readers object strongly to the White House's refusal to cooperate with House Democrats.
To the Editor:
Re "Vowing Defiance, White House Says Inquiry Is Invalid" (front page, Oct. 9):
Once again, President Trump reacts as he always has when anyone has dared to cross him: with a vicious attack, this time directed against nothing less than the United States Constitution. How dare he proclaim that the impeachment process is illegitimate when he has proved himself to be an entirely illegitimate president.
The Democrats in the House must not back down in pursuit of his illegal and unconstitutional acts, which threaten our democracy to the core. No softening, no retreating, no turning back from protecting our elections and our country's future.
We knew that this aggression was coming from the White House. Democrats, forge ahead without fear.
Janet K. Linder
Auburndale, Mass.
To the Editor:
This is a very bad and not in the least bit surprising response from the Trump administration.
These officials know that the more that is investigated, the worse they look, and they also know that they can do whatever they want without consequence.
Democrats will threaten and subpoena and hope that in the end, after many delays, the courts will rule in their favor. Who knows how long that will take?
The Democrats' path forward is to subpoena testimony and documents from the White House, but to see these documents as merely icing on a cake that will never get frosted. We already have enough to impeach the man who occupies the White House.
Lily Walman Blank
New York
To the Editor:
The Republicans' characterization of impeachment as an effort to reverse the 2016 election results is a deliberate attempt to avoid discussion of the criminality that lies at the foundation of the Trump White House.
Impeachment is a constitutional and patriotic duty mandated when elected officials defy the law. Besides that, the Democrats couldn't reverse the results of the 2016 presidential election even if they wanted to. The Electoral College beat them to it.
Ronald O. Richards
Los Angeles
To the Editor:
To Senate Republicans:
I know that you are aware of what this president has done and is doing to undermine and destroy this country. You know.
You aren't stupid. You've made some sort of Faustian bargain with President Trump, but at what incredible cost? You know. You know that the president's call with Ukraine was fundamentally wrong and against everything we stand for as the United States of America.
You know, and yet you protect him.
Now the precedent will be set. Foreign interference in our elections will be accepted. America is for sale. What's to stop a Democratic candidate from making a deal with China? The Democrats could say that they would make any trade deal China wants if only the Chinese will help with the election. Is this what you Republicans want as your legacy?
With another four years of Donald Trump, we will be destroyed. Do the right thing and lead us out of this darkness!
Pamela Viale
Goleta, Calif.
To the Editor:
Only a truly insane person would proclaim his "great and unmatched wisdom," as President Trump did on Twitter on Monday.
Mr. Trump's narcissism is a clear and present danger to the United States of America and American democracy.

Alarmist, wrong, climate predictions are nothing new

Resumen: In 2000, Dr. David Viner, a senior research scientist at University of East Anglia’s climate research unit, predicted that in a few years winter snowfall would become "a very rare and exciting event. A U.S. Department of Energy study led by the U.S. Navy predicted the Arctic Ocean would experience an ice-free summer by 2016. [...]the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2017, there were about 2,459 trillion cubic feet of dry natural gas in the United States.

Texto completo: The Competitive Enterprise Institute has published a new paper, "Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions." Keep in mind that many of the grossly wrong environmentalist predictions were made by respected scientists and government officials. My question for you is: If you were around at the time, how many government restrictions and taxes would you have urged to avoid the predicted calamity?
As reported in The New York Times (Aug. 1969) Stanford University biologist Dr. Paul Ehrlich warned: "The trouble with almost all environmental problems is that by the time we have enough evidence to convince people, you’re dead. We must realize that unless we’re extremely lucky, everybody will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years."
In 2000, Dr. David Viner, a senior research scientist at University of East Anglia’s climate research unit, predicted that in a few years winter snowfall would become "a very rare and exciting event. Children just aren’t going to know what snow is." In 2004, the U.S. Pentagon warned President George W. Bush that major European cities would be beneath rising seas. Britain will be plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020. In 2008, Al Gore predicted that the polar ice cap would be gone in a mere 10 years. A U.S. Department of Energy study led by the U.S. Navy predicted the Arctic Ocean would experience an ice-free summer by 2016.
In May 2014, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius declared during a joint appearance with Secretary of State John Kerry that "we have 500 days to avoid climate chaos."
Peter Gunter, professor at North Texas State University, predicted in the spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness: "Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions. ... By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine."
Ecologist Kenneth Watt’s 1970 prediction was, "If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000." He added, "This is about twice what it would take to put us into an Ice Age."
Mark J. Perry, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus, cites 18 spectacularly wrong predictions made around the time of first Earth Day in 1970. This time it’s not about weather. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver would be gone before 1990. Kenneth Watt said, "By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate ... that there won’t be any more crude oil."
There were grossly wild predictions well before the first Earth Day, too. In 1939, the U.S. Department of the Interior predicted that American oil supplies would last for only another 13 years. In 1949, the secretary of the interior said the end of U.S. oil supplies was in sight. Having learned nothing from its earlier erroneous energy claims, in 1974, the U.S. Geological Survey said that the U.S. had only a 10-year supply of natural gas. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2017, there were about 2,459 trillion cubic feet of dry natural gas in the United States. That’s enough to last us for nearly a century. The United States is the largest producer of natural gas worldwide.
Today’s wild predictions about climate doom are likely to be just as true as yesteryear’s. The major difference is today’s Americans are far more gullible and more likely to spend trillions fighting global warming. And the only result is that we’ll be much poorer and less free.

Ecologist Kenneth Watt’s 1970 prediction was, "If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000." He added, "This is about twice what it would take to put us into an Ice Age."
Mark J. Perry, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus, cites 18 spectacularly wrong predictions made around the time of first Earth Day in 1970. This time it’s not about weather. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver would be gone before 1990. Kenneth Watt said, "By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate ... that there won’t be any more crude oil."
There were grossly wild predictions well before the first Earth Day, too. In 1939, the U.S. Department of the Interior predicted that American oil supplies would last for only another 13 years. In 1949, the secretary of the interior said the end of U.S. oil supplies was in sight. Having learned nothing from its earlier erroneous energy claims, in 1974, the U.S. Geological Survey said that the U.S. had only a 10-year supply of natural gas. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2017, there were about 2,459 trillion cubic feet of dry natural gas in the United States. That’s enough to last us for nearly a century. The United States is the largest producer of natural gas worldwide.
Today’s wild predictions about climate doom are likely to be just as true as yesteryear’s. The major difference is today’s Americans are far more gullible and more likely to spend trillions fighting global warming. And the only result is that we’ll be much poorer and less free.

Texto completo: The interruption of famed violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter's performance with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra by an audience member in the front row who was recording her garnered international attention – and has sparked a conversation about when or if such a recording should be allowed.
Mutter, in her first interview since the Sept. 28 incident, told The New York Times she prefers cell phones be locked away during performances. She also shed new light on what happened.
Mutter told the New York Times the woman began recording her on a phone as she played the first movement of Beethoven's Violin Concerto, which distracted her. When she shot the woman stern looks, the woman did put her phone down, Mutter told the paper.
"The first movement is over, and I'm trying to concentrate and stay calm," Mutter recalled in the New York Times article. "Then she takes out a second phone, and a power bank. I continued the second movement, but it's already boiling in me. I'm totally out of the flow."
She added, "I feel violated in my rights, of my artistic property. As an artist you take such care when doing a recording – that you have your own sound engineer, that the mics are hung in the right spots. The sound is a part of you, you want your voice replicated in a way that really represents what you have worked on for an entire life."
She felt the audience "approval of her stance" and described the reaction as erupting "in long, powerful applause."
The New York Times article discussed the rules of etiquette and the idea that young people expected to record concerts and experiences, classical or not.
CSO rules say that during performances phones are allowed, but must be on silent. Non-flash photography is encouraged during moments of applause, but audio and video recording is not allowed.
"Please be mindful that the use of smartphones and other devices during concerts can be distracting to others," the rules also say.
Mutter told The New York Times, "The beauty of such an event, a pop concert as well as a classical concert ... is really being there, taking it in, having your own personal, really private memory of it."
Mutter, through her agent, declined to talk further about the incident.
CSO President Jonathan Martin told The Enquirer he never got a good answer about why the woman was recording the performance.
"Everyone expected her to put her phone back in her purse, but instead she stood up and started talking to the soloist," Martin said. "I was forced to go and defuse the situation or lose the performance and soloist – and perhaps the whole weekend."
Former Enquirer reporter Janelle Gelfand, who now writes for the Cincinnati Business Courier, was reviewing the performance when the woman interrupted the Beethoven Violin Concerto. "The orchestra ground to a halt," Gelfand said.
Gelfand described the confrontation as lasting several minutes, with Mutter telling the woman, "Either I will leave, or you will put away your phone and recording device."
Martin, who has also been praised for his handling of the situation, escorted the woman out.
"It's a balancing act," Martin said. "We want audience members to feel comfortable. But there is a social contract. You're there with 2,000 other people. Performers expect to come to the stage without interruption."

Texto completo: Please help me get the importance of this infamous Trump-Zelenskiy phone call. The Democrats and their soulmates in the liberal media are seriously getting ready to impeach the president — again — because President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelenskiy for a couple of favors?
Apparently, given the hysteria, it's the first time in U.S. history that our president has asked the leader of a foreign country to do a favor for him that might help him politically at home.
President Trump asked — "pressed" is the loaded word the New York Times and its multimedia echo chamber uses — Zelenskiy to do two things having to do with political corruption.
One was for Zelenskiy to help Attorney General Bill Barr open an investigation into a Ukrainian company involved in Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
The other favor, the one that was immediately declared an impeachable offense by the AOC/Schiff/Waters Democrats and liberal TV pundits, involved the shady activities of the Biden Family Overseas Enrichment Corp.
Trump asked President Zelenskiy to have his prosecutor open a corruption probe into the huge Ukrainian gas company that put Joe Biden's son Hunter on its corporate board and paid him about $50,000 a month to do what? Hunter knew nothing about the international natural gas business or Ukraine.
That stroke of good luck for the younger Biden in 2015 just happened to occur at the very same time VP Papa Joe was serving as the Obama Administration's bag-man-in-chief for U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine.
Even luckier, when the gas company was about to be looked into for corruption by the Ukrainian prosecutor, Papa Joe came to Hunter's rescue.
As he boasted in a video that the New York Times apparently has not yet seen, Papa Joe told the Ukraine government he'd withhold $6 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired in six hours, which he was.
The New York Times and its fellow liberal fake journalists aren't very curious about the details of the Biden Family's blatant conflicts of interest.
Impeaching Trump is all that matters to them and the Democrats.
The president's call won't hurt him politically and he'll never be impeached by the Senate, but the publicity about the Bidens' slippery doings in Ukraine will destroy the Biden family.
Papa Joe is an old coot who was never going to win the nomination anyway.
It's Hunter I feel sorry for. He's young. Now everyone in the media is talking about his personal issues and his past drug problems. He may never work again.
Hunter should have known better to take that high-paying Ukrainian "job." He was as unqualified as I am.
It wasn't a crime to take it, but he knew he was being used by the Ukrainian gas company to get access to his dad. It's not brain surgery.
As the son of a famous politician, I know what Hunter has had to deal with. To this day I get called to go out on Republican campaign trails.
All they want me to do is endorse them so they can pretend they have the mantle of Ronald Reagan.
Someone should have been warning Hunter long before 2015 to watch out for those $50,000-a-month do-noting job offers. His Papa Joe, for instance.

Is Trump's 'war' on state a show?

Texto completo: It's easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump's well-documented and much-ballyhooed "war" on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he's felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He's taken action after action against this state's best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California's unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality.
Even though Trump and his hand-picked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can't actually do it because California's right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the president of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump's administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don't meet federal clean air standards — even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards.
So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves "seem counterintuitive."
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California's many "sanctuary cities." He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don't do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he's had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum's observation that "There's a sucker born every minute." Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, "the only rule is that there are no rules."
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America's longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It's an approach completely unlike any previous president, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he's made against California.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President's new show, "If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California...and other diseases. But that's the state of things today in this country...We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts."
Added Becerra, "If the arguments in the President's tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we're looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court."

Texto completo: The NBA has come under severe criticism for bending over backward to appease the Chinese government after Beijing threatened the league with severe economic consequences over one pro-Hong Kong tweet. But we must remember, the NBA and its teams are just the latest victims of the Chinese government's efforts to force U.S. companies to do its political bidding. The U.S. government must help U.S. companies resist becoming complicit in Beijing's repression.
It started when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted a (now-deleted) tweet with an image that said "Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong." Within hours, the Chinese Basketball Association, sportswear brand Li-Ning, SPD Bank, state broadcaster CCTV's sports and tech-giant Tencent all announced they would suspend business with the Rockets. We know the Chinese government organized this swift punishment because so many Chinese entities shunned the team so quickly; in China that only happens with official approval.
Mr. Morey, under pressure, issued a partial apology, saying, "I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event."
The NBA issued a measured statement in English calling Mr. Morey's views "regrettable," and a more apologetic statement in Chinese, saying, "We are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey."
Beijing is costing the Rockets millions while pressing them to apologize - and implicitly threatening every other NBA team. The punishment came before the trial. That's how coercion works. It's how the Chinese Communist Party operates.
But the Chinese government's massive, punitive and coercive reaction to Mr. Morey's tweet must not be allowed, because the CCP is using its government power to bully Americans and American organizations to shut up about its repression. The fact that the NBA is playing along just shows how powerful Beijing has become in getting U.S. institutions to do its political bidding.
Lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates have quickly and rightly criticized the NBA today for folding on human rights in pursuit of cash in China. But it's not the NBA's job to stand up to the Chinese government; that's a job for the U.S. government.
The U.S. government must first explain to the American people that this is not an isolated incident; Beijing has been exporting its political censorship abroad as part of its comprehensive effort to interfere in free societies. Last year, China severely punished Marriott after an employee in Omaha, Neb., "liked" a pro-Tibet tweet. Marriott profusely apologized and fired the employee.
Next, Chinese authorities demanded all international airlines literally wipe "Taiwan" off their maps, under threat of economic punishment, in what the White House called an instance of "Orwellian nonsense." In this case, the U.S. carriers resisted and Beijing partially backed down.
Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta tried to claim on Twitter that his team is "not a political organization." As The New York Times noted, the NBA supported Enes Kanter's right to speak out about the abuses of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The NBA stands with me for freedom and democracy. It's made all the difference," Mr. Kanter tweeted Sunday.
But unlike the Turkish government, the Chinese government can hold billions of dollars in business over the NBA's head. LeBron James and the Lakers are set to play the Brooklyn Nets in Pudong and Shenzhen this week. If the Rockets, the most popular NBA team in China, can be banned over a tweet, there's no mystery why the rest of the league is running scared.
Just last week, China's foreign minister Wang Yi said, "China will not interfere in the internal affairs of the U.S." This is Chinese interference in our affairs. If we don't stand up to it now, we will soon find ourselves living in an America where everyone self-censors and nobody is allowed to speak out on things that are obviously outrageous, like Chinese repression in Hong Kong.
But U.S. companies are not strong enough to resist Chinese government coercion on their own. The U.S. government needs to do much more to make sure U.S. companies don't have to abandon their values at the point of an economic gun.

“Coed classrooms are the norm, but the norm does not serve girls well; it needs to be challenged and, ultimately, changed," she wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1994, a year after becoming head of school at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.
“Single-sex education is counterculture," she added, “but it's good for girls."
Mrs. Ford, who previously was dean of students at Milton Academy and the residential counselor at the Groton School, was 78 when she died Wednesday of complications from Alzheimer's disease.
She and her husband had returned to Greater Boston after she retired in 2008, and most recently she had lived in Concord.
In her early years as head of the Connecticut private school that counted Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis among its alumnae, Mrs. Ford decided Miss Porter's should invest more resources into making its interscholastic teams more competitive.
By her five-year mark, Division I colleges were recruiting nearly a dozen athletes who were seniors at Miss Porter's, the Times reported in 1998. Not all coaches and teachers welcomed the new emphasis on athletics.
“There is still a tremendous amount of ambivalence about girls being competitive in our society," Mrs. Ford told the Times that year.
“But I think for girls to really be successful, in their personal lives, in a business or political context, or any other venue, they have to learn from boys and men about exercising their strength and power, and sports are a perfect vehicle for teaching that," she added.
Mrs. Ford, who also introduced a compulsory course in ethics, believed in the importance of her initiatives, said her husband, Brian W. Ford, who coached crew at Miss Porter's while his wife was head of school and formerly had been a successful girls' crew team coach at Noble and Greenough School.
“She was determined that Miss Porter's was going to compete on an even level with every school in the country," he said. “And she felt that having decent, competitive sports was one element of that."
He added that his wife “had a kind of fierce independent attitude about life."
Running a private girls' school was a natural culmination of her background attending girls' schools as a youth and Trinity College, a women's school in Washington, D.C., until she left to serve in the Peace Corps, he said.
Although she believed women and men should work together as equals, Mrs. Ford thought that would be difficult to achieve in classrooms during their earlier years.
“Our future needs the best of everyone, men and women," she said in the 1994 letter to the Times, adding that “temporary separation of the two in school can serve us all in the long run."
Even in retirement, when she read about research that challenged the notion of single-sex education, Mrs. Ford said her experience as a student and an educator showed the approach had benefits.
In a 2011 letter to the editor of The Boston Globe, when she was president of the National Coalition of Girls' Schools, she wrote that “a major value of single-sex schools is freedom from gender stereotypes, not reinforcement of them. What prepares one for a successful adult life is the opportunity to know oneself apart from the traditional cultural imperatives, and to learn how to use one's strengths and values to become who one really is."
The third of four siblings, and the oldest daughter, Mary Burch Tracy was born in St. Louis on Nov. 27, 1940. She was 7 when her family moved to Baltimore and settled in the Bolton Hill neighborhood.
Burch was a family name and Mrs. Ford stopped going by Mary once she went to college.
Her father, Daniel O'Connell Tracy Sr., worked for a series of companies. Her mother, Virginia Corrigan Tracy, wrote for the Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore News American, interviewing celebrities and often bringing along her children.
“When people used to say that a woman couldn't be a good mother and have a job at the same time, I thought that was just nonsense," Mrs. Ford told the Baltimore Sun in 2000 for her mother's obit. “I thought my mother was much more interesting than any other mother I knew."
The example Virginia Tracy set inspired Mrs. Ford to have “the power of her convictions about how life should be," her husband said, “and that's what made her a great educator."
Mrs. Ford attended the Notre Dame girls' prep school in Baltimore and spent a couple of years at Trinity College, where she was elected class president. She then left to work and to spend time in London before joining the Peace Corps in 1967.
In Senegal, in West Africa, she spent two years staffing a social center that provided services such as a kindergarten, adult literacy courses, and prenatal health classes.
While in Senegal she met Brian Ford, another Peace Corps volunteer. They married in 1969 and initially lived in Boston.
“When we married, we had absolutely nothing," he recalled. “We had no money, we had no place to live, we had no jobs."
They both found work at what was then Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, where she became director of the volunteer department while finishing her bachelor's degree at Boston University, attending night classes.
Mrs. Ford went on to graduate from Simmons College with a master's in social work and from Harvard University with a master's in education.
Her husband said she spent 10 years at Groton as the first full-time residential counselor, followed by five years as dean of students at Milton Academy before being hired as head of school at Miss Porter's, where the school library now bears her name. As a former school counselor, “she taught me how to talk about feelings in ways that I found enormously helpful working as a teacher," her husband said. “She taught me how to listen to kids without judging, without a great deal of expectations. She had a lot of wisdom."
In addition to her husband, Mrs. Ford leaves their two sons, H. Winfield of Avon, Conn., and Randolph of Glenmont, N.Y.; two brothers, Daniel Tracy Jr. of Baltimore and George Tracy of Sarasota, Fla.; a sister, Virginia Tracy Perkins of Austin, Texas; and two granddaughters.
Family and friends will gather to celebrate her life at 2 p.m. Oct. 31 in Trinity Episcopal Church in Concord.
When Mrs. Ford and her husband first began dating in Africa, “I had a feeling I had met the most competent person I had every met in my life," he said. “She had – and the rest of her life bore this out — the ability to take on any task and get it done well," he added. “She was smart. She was strategic. She was also very kind."

Texto completo: An American withdrawal from northern Syria will leave Kurds who helped us against the Islamic State to fend for themselves.
The last time I saw my friend Abed, he was in the mood to celebrate. It was about a year ago and the two of us met for dinner in Fatih, a district in Istanbul where many Syrian refugees had settled.
Abed had come from a meeting with the immigration services, and it looked as though his application for Turkish citizenship would soon be approved. His relief was palpable. He ordered us more food than we could possibly finish and spoke with optimism about a business he was starting and the impending birth of his first child.
I eventually asked why he felt so certain about his application. "It's my last name," he explained. "The official noted that its origins come from around Aleppo, which, before it was a Syrian city, was an Ottoman one. It turns out I, too, am a Turk."
Over the past five years, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has, through a deft series of political maneuvers, ushered in a vast expansion of Turkish influence across the Middle East, consolidating his power with the establishment of an executive presidency, bolstering his alliance with Russia and compromising the Saudi leadership with leaked surveillance tapes related to the execution of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate.
His latest victory, an assurance by President Trump on Sunday that United States troops will withdraw from a militarized zone along Turkey's southern border with Syria, could lead to the most significant growth in Turkish territory in 100 years, since the days of the Ottoman sultanate. With an estimated four million Syrian refugees living in Turkey (a number that represents 15 percent of Syria's prewar population), it isn't hard to imagine that the Turkish occupation of northern Syria will allow many of those residents to return to the country.
But what will they return as? Syrians? Turks? Or something else?
Turkish identity generally exists as a dehyphenated monolith -- aside from the case of the Kurds, who both inside and outside of Turkey have long struggled to express a separate ethnic identity. They've also been long and staunch allies of the United States, proving themselves as effective fighters in service of our country's interests, from the invasion of Iraq to the fight against the Islamic State.
Speaking in defense of his decision to withdrawal American forces and allow a Turkish incursion into territory occupied by the Kurds, Mr. Trump said, "We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters."
Yet it's difficult to see anything but abandonment in the planned withdrawal, leading many of Mr. Trump's allies to denounce the decision, including his former United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, who tweeted: "We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend."
Unlike our NATO ally Turkey, the Kurds have proven themselves loyal. Loyalty is central to alliances. As it is to friendship.
When I was a Marine, I used to work as a special operator in Afghanistan, fighting alongside a group of Tajik tribesmen who had also proved themselves loyal friends. One of those deployments coincided with a federal government shutdown in Washington, which put limits on the funding of our unit. When I had to explain to my Afghan counterpart that even though he and his men wouldn't be paid on time, we still needed them to go out on a mission, he asked, "Are you being paid?" When I said yes, he answered, "It doesn't seem fair that you should be paid on this mission and that we should not."
Instead of arguing, we delayed the mission. It was a gesture of fairness that was long remembered.
Wars have a long memory. Treating our allies unfairly has never served our interests well over time. Thirty years ago it seemed difficult to imagine a reason for the United States to remain engaged with a Central Asian people with a reputation as fierce fighters who had helped us defeat a common enemy. And so we abandoned the Afghans to their own civil war, creating conditions that led to the rise of the Taliban and the Sept. 11 attacks.
In the short term Mr. Trump might claim that he has disentangled America from yet another foreign intervention. However, the Turks, the Russians, the Iranians and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad aren't playing for the short term.
As Abed and I finished our dinner, the conversation turned to the future. He told me about the office space he was planning to lease in Istanbul and about several common friends of ours who, like him, were turning in their Syrian citizenship to become Turks. With our stomachs full we walked toward the Bosphorus to catch separate trains home.
"Does it seem strange," I asked, "to think your child will be Turkish?" He laughed, placing his hand on my shoulder.
"Not really," he said. "Pretty soon none of us will be Turkish. We'll all be Ottoman."

Texto completo: Iran's airstrike on Saudi oil sites exposed vulnerabilities around the region.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds it bizarre that the Republican leadership is (rightly) going nuts over President Trump's betrayal of the Kurds in Syria while it's ignoring his betrayal of the U.S. Constitution at home. If only Lindsey Graham & Co. were as eager to defend our democracy as they are the Kurds. But I digress.
If you think Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria will make the Middle East more explosive, you're correct. But there's far more going on. Those troops were also interrupting Iran's efforts to build a land bridge from Tehran to Beirut to tighten a noose around Israel -- and their removal could help bring the Iran-Israel shadow war out into the open. This is the really big story in the Middle East today.
Here's the background: In the early hours of Sept. 14, the Iranian Air Force launched roughly 20 drones and cruise missiles at one of Saudi Arabia's most important oil fields and processing facilities. The drones and cruise missiles flew so low and with such stealth that neither their takeoff nor their impending attack was detected in time by Saudi or U.S. radar. The pro-Iranian Houthi militia in Yemen claimed responsibility for the raid. That was as believable as saying that Santa Claus did it.
Some Israeli strategists argue that this surprise attack was the Middle East's "Pearl Harbor." An exaggeration? Maybe not.
Whoever in Iran came up with the idea of this daring airstrike just got a big pay raise. It could not have worked out better. Because the sound you hear coming from every Arab capital and Israel is the same sound you hear from your automated driving assistant when your car has suddenly deviated from the mapped route:
"Recalculating, recalculating, recalculating."
Every country is now recalculating its security strategy, starting with Israel. Consider how Uzi Even, one of the founding scientists of Israel's Dimona nuclear reactor, assessed the Iranian strike.
"A total of 20 cruise missiles and drones were used in the attack," Even wrote in Haaretz on Sunday. "Drone wreckage discovered in Saudi Arabia shows that the Iranians are manufacturing and operating drones so advanced (with jet engines and significant stealth capabilities) that they do not lag behind Israeli capabilities in this field. Seventeen targets incurred a direct hit in this concentrated bombardment. Considering the 20 projectiles whose debris was found at the attack site, that's an 85-percent success rate, which indicates the very high capability and reliability of the technology that was used."
Photos of the aftermath, Even added, "show the precision that was achieved in the attack. Each one of the spherical gas tankers in the picture was hit in the center. The pictures also show that the strike precision was one meter. ... The Iranians, or their proxies, showed that they can hit specific targets with great precision and from a distance of hundreds of kilometers. We have to accept the fact that we are now vulnerable to such a strike."
Even's conclusion: Operations at Israel's "Dimona nuclear reactor should be halted. It has now been shown to be vulnerable, and the harm it could cause would likely exceed its benefits."
Not a bad day's work for Iran -- and Israel wasn't even the target. Now let's look at the Arabs. The Saudis and the United Arab Emirates got a double shock from the Iranian attack. It simultaneously exposed Iran's precision and Donald Trump's isolationism.
It had to have been quite the cold shower for the Saudis to call Washington to discuss what the U.S. planned as a strategic response only to discover that our president was busy looking for the cellphone number of Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, to see if he could cut the same deal with him that he did with North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un: Give me a photo-op handshake, and we can do business.
Translated into Arabic, Trump was saying to the Gulf Arabs: "I forgot to tell you. I'm only interested in selling you our weapons -- not using them in your defense. But don't forget to stay in my hotel when you're next in D.C.! Operators are standing by."
The Saudis and the U.A.E. got the message. They, too, got busy looking for the Iranian leader's cellphone number -- and the number of the pro-Iranian emir of Qatar, too. Time to get right with all the neighbors.
This, in turn, has fractured the tacit U.S.-Sunni Arab-Israel anti-Iran coalition and left Israel feeling more alone than ever to deal with Iran -- and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.
Because Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel also got a double dose of Trump reality. After Netanyahu did poorly in the recent Israeli election, Bibi learned how much Trump doesn't like losers. When asked about Bibi after the Israeli election, Trump said coolly that he hadn't spoken to him -- "our relationship is with Israel."
Translated into Hebrew, Trump was saying: "Bibi? Bibi? I once knew a guy who owned a deli at Lexington and 55th named Bibi."
And then, after the Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that when it comes to a war with Iran, "we'd certainly like to avoid it." Again, translated into Hebrew: "America is happy to keep oil sanctions on Iran, but it is not going to partner with Israel and the Sunni Arabs to create regime change there or militarily destroy Iran's capabilities."
Bibi had completely misread Trump's mind-set, which was: "We're awash in oil and gas. We're not fighting anyone's wars in the Middle East." The Iranians don't even have an embassy in Washington. But they read Trump perfectly.
Recalculating, recalculating, recalculating.
The Gulf Arabs can and will find a way to buy off the Iranians. Israel can't. Israel has a real Iran problem. Beware.
Iran's is an awful regime. The ruling clerics have deprived at least two generations of young Iranians the freedom and tools to realize their full potential -- one reason that a brain drain and drug addiction are rampant among Iranian youth.
While Iran's people "aspire to be like South Korea -- and they have the talent to be that -- Iran's hard-line leadership prefers to rule like North Korea," observed Karim Sadjadpour, Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment.
So Iran's Islamic revolutionaries need constant conflict with America and Israel to justify their ruthless internal repression. But Iran is heir to a great civilization. Even with its brain drain, it's still got lots of real scientific talent.
Iran is now trying to semi-encircle Israel with proxy militias like Hezbollah -- in Lebanon, Syria and Western Iraq, armed with precision-guided missiles. The word "precision" really matters. In the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel, Iranian-armed Hezbollah had to fire scores of dumb, unguided, surface-to-surface rockets of limited range in hopes of damaging a single Israeli target, mostly in the northern half of the country. Ditto Hamas in Gaza.
But since 2016, Iran has been transferring kits to Hezbollah to convert its dumb rockets into precision-guided missiles -- like those that perfectly punctured the Saudi oil facilities. It's not clear how many Hezbollah now has, but if it has only 150 it could hit all of the important economic and military targets in Israel. That's Israel's ports, airports, power plants, nuclear reactor, Intel computer chip factory and its network of software and technology companies. It could cripple Israel.
In light of all this, Israel has been signaling two things to Hezbollah and Iran. One is that in response to any missile attacks, Israel will carpet bomb neighborhoods in Lebanon where Hezbollah's families live and where it manufactures the missiles, and turn them into rubble, as it did on a small scale in 2006. And it will make the Lebanese economy collateral damage.
And the other is that Israel will attack Tehran directly, either with precision long-range missiles from Israel or submarine-launched missiles from the Persian Gulf, with this message: "Every time Tel Aviv is hit by your proxies, we will hit Tehran. You will not sit out this war. And you will not out-crazy us."
So, the Middle East may look calm right now, but that's an illusion. Everyone is recalculating: The Iranians are emboldened, the Arabs are frightened and Israel and Iran are one miscalculation away from a war of precision missiles that neither can afford.

Texto completo: html> WEST PALM BEACH - The man whose story about serving 10 days in jail for missing jury duty gained national attention will no longer have a criminal record, a Palm Beach County judge wrote in an order filed Monday.
Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes vacated and rescinded his finding of contempt of court and the sentence of probation for Deandre Somerville after “reflection over the weekend.”
The 21-year-old man was a sworn juror in a civil case and did not show up to duty Aug. 21. He later told the judge he overslept and then didn’t notify anyone about his absence. Kastrenakes sentenced the man, who had no criminal history, to 10 days in jail and a year of probation.
After he served the jail sentence, his probation was reduced to three months on Friday after Kastrenakes received an apology from Somerville and heard from his family. The judge also agreed to change his conviction for contempt of court to an adjudication withheld once he completed probation.
“The only reason the Court left him on a short term of probation was so that others could learn and take heed that serving on a jury is serious business deserving of attention, respect and adherence to their oaths,” Kastrenakes wrote in Monday’s order.
Somerville will no longer be on probation or have to give 10-minute presentations to jurors on the importance of jury duty, as Kastrenakes previously had ordered during Friday’s hearing.
During that hearing, Assistant Public Defender Daniel Eisinger said Somerville "knows what has done and he's suffered a tremendous penalty."
Kastrenakes wrote in Monday’s order he did “not want even a finding of contempt to be gleaned from perusal of his background or record." He said he found the 21-year-old to be "a thoughtful and respectful young man" who cares deeply about his family.
Kastrenakes did address the critique from the national conversation about whether this was a fair punishment for missing jury duty.
“The court also knows that it would have punished anyone who behaved the way Mr. Somerville behaved in the same manner,” Kastrenakes wrote.
The judge went on to say because of the “abundant publicity surrounding Mr. Somerville's case, I have concluded that the importance and seriousness of a sworn juror abiding by the law has been made clear.”
Across Twitter, individuals have sent out the judge’s email and office phone number asking the public to call and complain, and a Change.org petition asking for punishment for the judge has more than 8,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon. Somerville’s story was featured in national news outlets such as New York Times and Buzzfeed and everyone from celebrities such as Chelsea Handler to law professors and lawyers have expressed outrage at the sentence.
In court Friday, Kastrenakes cited several other cases of juror misconduct over the years that have gained attention, such as a juror in the John Goodman DUI manslaughter trial and a juror in the trial of Victor Salastier Diaz, one of several men charged in the Three Amigos convenience store robbery-murder.
In the Goodman and Diaz trials, the juror misconduct led to retrials.
Somerville's absence from court caused a 45-minute delay in the civil trial, but the case went forward and the jury rendered a verdict, according to court records.
In the case of the Diaz trial, the juror was sentenced by Chief Judge Krista Marx to eight days in jail, records show.
In court Friday, Somerville’s family said it called him each day he was in the jail and prayed with him. Somerville said when he received his jury duty notice, he had never been downtown to the courthouse, let alone picked for a case. He said he tried to stay away from all of that as best he could.
"I may have to live with a record for the rest of my life," he said in court Friday. "(But) hope for better days ahead."
In a text message Monday afternoon, Somerville said he was thankful for the judge’s ruling.

Here’s how you can tell who the press’ favorite 2020 candidate is

Texto completo: If you want to know who the press favors in the 2020 Democratic primary, look no further than the candidate who enjoys the softest, most defensive coverage from mainstream newsrooms.
By that measurement, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is clearly the favorite.
No other 2020 Democratic candidate is treated as gently as the senator from Massachusetts, as we were reminded this week following the release of records that seemingly contradict Warren’s oft-repeated claim that she was fired from her job as an elementary school teacher in 1971 for being “visibly pregnant.”
The Washington Free Beacon, which was the first to obtain the records, reports:
The Riverdale Board of Education approved a second-year teaching contract for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate’s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching after a single year because she was "visibly pregnant." Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a "2nd year" contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren’s resignation was "accepted with regret."
There is another apparent hitch in Warren’s current version of events. In 2007, the senator claimed she left Riverdale because of a certification issue. However, after she was elected to the Senate in 2012, Warren started telling people she was fired for being “visibly pregnant.” To be fair, both things can be true at once. Warren could have been fired for being “visibly pregnant” and there could have been a certification problem on her end.
But there is no reason why anyone should take the senator’s origin stories at face value. Fool me once and all that.

You would think that in this supposed golden-era of media fact-checking, when the truth matters now more than ever, that our very trustworthy and incredulous press would dig deeper into the matter.

Ha! Of course not. Newsrooms are hard at work this week downplaying the county records.

“Elizabeth Warren Details Her Account of Losing Teaching Job Because of Pregnancy,” the New York Times reported Tuesday, adding in its subhead, “Ms. Warren said she had grown more comfortable talking about her experience over the years, explaining why her description of the 1971 episode in her stump speeches differs from how she discussed it in the past.”

Oh, well in that case. Good enough for me!

The Washington Post published an op-ed, titled “Anatomy of a fake GOP scandal about Elizabeth Warren,” characterizing the Free Beacon report as fake news. The Post has published no original news coverage of the Riverdale story. The most it has done to report on the documents has been to host an Associated Press report on its website. That report is titled, "Warren stands by account of once being fired for pregnancy."

“Elizabeth Warren stands by account of being pushed out of her first teaching job because of pregnancy,” reads a CBS News headline. The report includes the following passage:
Two retired teachers who worked at Riverdale Elementary for over 30 years, including the year Warren was there, told CBS News that they don't remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school. But Trudy Randall and Sharon Ercalano each said that a non-tenured, pregnant employee like Warren would have had little job security at Riverdale in 1971, seven years before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed. "The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn't tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn't know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer," Randall said. "But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant."
Amazing. The two retired teachers CBS managed to hunt down have no memory of anything happening as Warren describes, but the newsgroup quotes them anyway as saying the senator's story sounds close enough to the truth. Even more amazing than that is certain pundits have highlighted the above passages, suggesting they actually vindicate Warren.

“CBS found a teacher who taught the same year Warren did at the same school, who couldn’t corroborate Warren’s exact circumstances but did confirm a culture of firing visibly pregnant teachers,” said New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie. Yes, that is the part of the CBS report you definitely want to underscore.
I feel like I am taking crazy pills. There is no reason whatsoever for newsrooms to give Warren, who has been caught already in one massive, glaring lie about her life story, the benefit of the doubt on this Riverdale issue. Yet they are doing exactly that.

The most shameless display of pro-Warren sycophancy this week comes from MSNBC, which brought on, of all people, EMILY's List's Vice President of Communications Christina Reynolds to discuss the new allegations against the senator.

"There may be multiple reasons why she didn't come back to that job, but I think what's clear is we know — listen, women were not allowed to get a credit card without their husband's approval pretty recently," said Reynolds.

Look, I understand people like Reynolds are in the business of supporting pro-abortion politicians like Warren. But MSNBC has no good reason to host her during news programming hours to run defense for Warren — unless, of course, that is the entire point.

"It holds water to me that maybe that's not something she wanted to come out with initially," Reynolds continued, praising Warren for starting an "important" conversation.
Speaking of carrying water, the press' reflexive defenses of Warren this week are evidence they know a thing or two about it.

Trump administration blocks Gordon Sondland from testifying before Congress

Texto completo: Just hours before United States Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was set to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, the administration pulled the plug on the testimony.
The move comes after threats from House Democrats that if the administration doesn’t comply, they will see the move as an act of obstruction, a potentially impeachable offense.
Sondland, 62, is a figure at the center of the Ukrainian investigation stemming from a whistleblower complaint of wrongdoing by the president. The complaint alleges that Trump unduly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate aspects of the 2016 presidential election and political rival Joe Biden. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.
Last week, text messages were released on the same day as congressional testimony from former State Department envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, with Sondland and chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine William Taylor from before and after a July 25 phone call that is a central part of the complaint. A transcript of that call was released to the public the day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry.
Sondland was specifically directed by the State Department not to comply with the Tuesday request to speak to investigators. His attorney, Robert Luskin, told the New York Times that Sondland was fully prepared to testify and would be willing to do so in the future, but because he is a State Department employee, he must comply with the administration's direction.
“Ambassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today. Ambassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the committee’s questions fully and truthfully," Luskin said.
A key tenant of the complaint is the alleged existence of some sort of quid pro quo between Washington and Kyiv. Democrats are looking into whether the administration conditionally withheld military aid. On Sept. 1, Taylor texted Sondland about potential requirements for arranging a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky.
"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?" Taylor asked Sondland, although the answer to that question isn’t clear as Sondland replied by directing Taylor to call him.
Messages from a Sept. 7 call show that Taylor was worried about interactions between the White House and Ukraine.
“The message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario," Taylor said. "Counting on you to be right about this interview, Gordon."
Sondland replied, "Bill, I never said I was 'right.' I said we are where we are and believe we have identified the best pathway forward. Lets hope it works."
“As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign," Taylor responded. Sondland denied that a "quid pro quo" existed and said Trump instead was looking whether Zelensky was "truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms" that were promised during his campaign. He also urged Taylor to “stop the back and forth by text.”
Sondland has served in his current role since July of last year.
This is a breaking story and will be updated ...

Texto completo: El gobierno del presidente Donald Trump ordenó a Gordon Sondland , embajador de los Estados Unidos en la Unión Europea, rendir testimonio ante la Cámara este martes, como testigo clave en la investigación para un posible juicio político contra el mandatario.
La decisión de bloquear a Sondland de hablar con los investigadores de tres comités de la Cámara podría desatar un conflicto con los representantes, ya que los demócratas han advertido que si la administración intenta interferir con su investigación, se interpretará como una obstrucción, un cargo que consideran potencialmente digno de juicio político.
El diplomático debía presentarse ante los comités de Inteligencia, Asuntos Exteriores y Supervisión de la Cámara.
Robert Luskin , abogado de Sondland, dijo en un comunicado que, como empleado del Departamento de Estado, su cliente no tuvo más remedio que cumplir con la orden de la Casa Blanca.
“El embajador Sondland está profundamente decepcionado de que no podrá testificar hoy” , dijo Luskin. “El embajador Sondland cree firmemente que actuó en todo momento en el mejor interés de los Estados Unidos, y está listo para responder a las preguntas del comité de manera completa y veraz”.
Apenas se supo sobre la inasistencia del diplomático, el presidente Trump publicó un par de tuits donde asegura que le hubiera gustado que el Embajador acudiera ante los comités, pero acusó falta de certeza jurídica.
“Me encantaría enviar al Embajador Sondland… a testificar, pero desafortunadamente estaría testificando ante un tribunal de canguros (sic) totalmente prejucioso, donde se han quitado los derechos de los republicanos, y los hechos verdaderos no están permitidos para el público” , escribió el mandatario.
Luego el presidente Trump citó un supuesto tuit de Sondland donde lo defiende.
“Es importante destacar que el tuit del embajador Sondland, que pocos informan, donde declaró: ‘Creo que usted están en un error acerca de las intenciones del presidente Trump. El Presidente ha sido muy claro: no hay quid pro quo de ningún tipo’. ¡Eso lo dice TODO!” , expresó el mandatario.
….to see. Importantly, Ambassador Sondland’s tweet, which few report, stated, “I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind.” That says it ALL!

MIAMI -- "I'm using Mexico to protect our border." Millions of Americans didn't even notice this recent remark made by President Trump. But Mexicans certainly did. They thought Mr. Trump's words were a blatant attack on their nation's sovereignty.
Still, while the president's statement was arrogant and offensive, it's actually true. Mr. Trump made his comment about the border on Sept. 26, just two days after Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, launched a formal impeachment inquiry that could lead to the president's removal from office. Yet sandwiched between the constant "witch hunt" accusations, Mr. Trump managed to say something that hit a raw nerve.
"I want to thank Mexico," Mr. Trump continued. "Twenty-seven thousand soldiers they have. But think of how bad that is -- think of it -- where we use Mexico because the Democrats won't fix our broken immigration system."
Almost 400,000 people have watched a video I posted on Twitter of Mr. Trump saying this. Some felt humiliated by the president's statement. After all, a friend wouldn't say to another friend that he's using him, much less say it in public.
But President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico (or AMLO, as he's known) didn't see it that way. "There's nothing we should be ashamed of," he said at a news conference. "We protect Mexico's sovereignty. At the same time, we try to avoid confrontation."
A salient feature of Mexico's current foreign policy is precisely AMLO's reluctance to confront anyone outside of the country. In short, American officials say what they want, and Mexico -- almost always -- goes along with it. The relationship between the two nations is by no means an egalitarian one. In fact, it poses a threat to Mexico: Mr. Trump has previously warned that he would impose tariffs if Mexico didn't back his immigration agenda.
Mexico may not have paid for the president's wall, but the country has, in effect, become Mr. Trump's immigration police force. Mexico itself has become the wall.
Recently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Mexico triumphantly announced a 56 percent decline in the number of Central American immigrants crossing Mexican territory between May and August. Why would Mexico force an entire family from Honduras or El Salvador to stay in Matamoros or Ciudad Juárez, if the United States is where they really want to go? The answer, sadly, is clear: Because that is exactly what the American government wants. Mexico is accepting tens of thousands of immigrants that Mr. Trump is refusing to take in. Mexico is now the United States' safety valve.
Mexico's president "basically, has accepted all terms and conditions" set by the United States, Armando Santacruz, president of Mexico United Against Crime, told me in an interview. "Yes, we are the wall. And [Mexico's] National Guard is now spending a lot if its resources keeping immigrants away."
I don't know where Mr. Trump came up with the 27,000 soldiers figure. Perhaps he was referring to the number of National Guard (or Guardia Nacional) troops currently protecting the Mexican border with Guatemala as part of an effort to prevent Central Americans from entering the country en route to the United States. The National Guard was never meant to serve as an immigration agency for the United States. It was created to combat crime in Mexico -- something it has failed to do thus far.
But Mexico is not only using the National Guard to turn away Central Americans. It has also agreed to accept immigrants who are seeking asylum in the United States while their applications are being processed. The country is basically America's waiting room.
The Trump administration has placed great pressure on the Mexican economy to get what officials want, precisely at a time when financial indicators suggest a recession could be looming.
Even so, we are talking about sovereignty, about dignity and basic respect for human rights, under circumstances where the safety of people fleeing gangs, violence and extreme poverty is at stake. Mexico should never forget that for decades it was an "immigrant exporter." Now it must treat Central Americans with the same care and respect it has always demanded for Mexicans living in the United States.
It's true: President Trump is using Mexico. And, against all logic, Mexico is letting him get away with it. This has to change.
What can Mexico do? It must refuse to be Mr. Trump's wall, to be the United States' waiting room and safety valve. Mexico must re-embrace its honorable tradition of protecting the persecuted and most vulnerable, whether they're fleeing civil war in Spain or crime and hunger in Central America.
To President López Obrador, I say this: It is a mistake to place bets on Mr. Trump. This is something all his former friends have learned the hard way. Do you really want to be associated with the policies of a president who, according to a recent report in The Times, suggested shooting migrants at the border in the legs? Why haven't Mexicans taken to the streets in outraged protest?
Mr. Trump is on the wrong side of history. When he finally leaves office, his accomplices and partners, inside and outside the United States, will be judged harshly for their misdeeds.
There is still time to do the right thing.

Texto completo: We need to stop pretending that Silicon Valley can compete with China on its own.
The brilliant 2014 science fiction novel "The Three-Body Problem," by the Chinese writer Liu Cixin, depicts the fate of civilizations as almost entirely dependent on winning grand races to scientific milestones. Someone in China's leadership must have read that book, for Beijing has made winning the race to artificial intelligence a national obsession, devoting billions of dollars to the cause and setting 2030 as the target year for world dominance. Not to be outdone, President Vladimir Putin of Russia recently declared that whoever masters A.I. "will become the ruler of the world."
To be sure, the bold promises made by A.I.'s true believers can seem excessive; today's A.I. technologies are useful only in narrow situations. But if there is even a slim chance that the race to build stronger A.I. will determine the future of the world -- and that does appear to be at least a possibility -- the United States and the rest of the West are taking a surprisingly lackadaisical and alarmingly risky approach to the technology.
The plan seems to be for the American tech industry, which makes most of its money in advertising and selling personal gadgets, to serve as champions of the West. Those businesses, it is hoped, will research, develop and disseminate the most important basic technologies of the future. Companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft are formidable entities, with great talent and resources that approximate those of small countries. But they don't have the resources of large countries, nor do they have incentives that fully align with the public interest.
To exaggerate slightly: If this were 1957, we might as well be hoping that the commercial airlines would take us to the moon.
If the race for powerful A.I. is indeed a race among civilizations for control of the future, the United States and European nations should be spending at least 50 times the amount they do on public funding of basic A.I. research. Their model should be the research that led to the internet, funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, created by the Eisenhower administration and arguably the most successful publicly funded science project in American history.
To their credit, companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple are spending considerable money on advanced research. Google has been willing to lose about $ 500 million a year on DeepMind, an artificial intelligence lab, and Microsoft has invested $ 1 billion in its independent OpenAI laboratory. In these efforts they are part of a tradition of pathbreaking corporate laboratories like Bell Labs, Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center and Cisco Systems in its prime.
But it would be a grave error to think that we can rest assured that Silicon Valley has it all taken care of. The history of computing research is a story not just of big corporate laboratories but also of collaboration and competition among civilian government, the military, academia and private players both big (IBM, AT&T) and small (Apple, Sun).
When it comes to research and development, each of these actors has advantages and limitations. Compared with government-funded research, corporate research, at its best, can offer a stimulating balance of theory and practice, yielding inventions like the transistor and the Unix operating system. But big companies can also be secretive, occasionally paranoid and sometimes just wrong, as with AT&T's dismissal of internet technologies.
Big companies can also change their priorities. Cisco, once an industry leader, has spent more than $ 129 billion in stock buybacks over the past 17 years, while its chief Chinese competitor, Huawei, developed the world's leading 5G products.
Some advocates of more A.I. research have called for a "Manhattan project" for A.I. -- but that's not the right model. The atomic bomb and the moon rocket were giant but discrete projects. In contrast, A.I. is a broad and vague set of scientific technologies that encompass not just recent trends in machine learning but also anything else designed to replicate or augment human cognition. We don't necessarily want a single-minded fixation on a particular idea of what A.I. will become.
As it did with the internet research, the United States government should broadly fund basic research and insist on broad dissemination, with the exception of tools that might be dangerous. Not all government funding need go to academia: Private research institutions like OpenAI that are committed to the principled development of A.I. and the broad dissemination of research findings should also be potential recipients.
In addition, the United States needs to support immigration laws that attract the world's top A.I. talent. The history of breakthroughs made by start-ups also suggests the need for policies, like the enforcement of antitrust laws and the defense of net neutrality, that give small players a chance.
It is telling that the computer scientist and entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee, in his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order," describes a race between China and Silicon Valley, as if the latter were the sum total of Western science in this area. In the future, when we look back at this period, we may come to regret the loss of a healthy balance between privately and publicly funded A.I. research in the West, and the drift of too much scientific and engineering talent into the private sector.

Texto completo: Tuesday’s forecast for Shanghai is not terribly different from Los Angeles weather: sunny, low-70s, little chance of rain.
But even as the Lakers boarded a flight Monday morning bound for China, they knew they were about to fly into a storm.
Sunday’s news cycle was bombarded by reaction to a Friday tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” The NBA is generally a league that is permissive about expressing personal views on social issues; the estimated hundreds of millions of NBA fans in China are apparently not. Subsequent fallout included Chinese businesses vowing to cut ties with the Rockets, former Houston star Yao Ming saying the Chinese Basketball Association would no longer work with them, and awkwardly worded statements from Rockets ownership and the NBA at large.
In the middle of the madness, the Lakers are flying to Shanghai and Shenzhen, two of the largest cities in the world for a pair of exhibition games with the Brooklyn Nets and a host of league events. What was initially planned as an innocent bit of diplomacy for a league that is extremely popular overseas could now have significantly higher stakes for both the Lakers and the NBA.
Outside of North America, it’s reasonable to say that China is by far the most important market for the NBA. The country of 1.4 billion people is basketball-crazed. According to numbers shared by the league: The CBA estimates that 300 million people play basketball at some level in the country. The NBA has had a dedicated office in China since 2008. Tencent, the league’s top media partner in China, estimates that nearly half a billion people watched NBA programming on their platforms – a figure that has tripled from the viewership just five years ago. It’s common to see Chinese-language reporters roaming locker rooms before and after games, and ESPN has a partnership with Tencent to get one-on-one postgame interviews with players as they walk off the court.
Many players understand the power of the Chinese market, and it’s common for players to tour Chinese cities for their shoe companies. LeBron James, for example, goes abroad virtually every summer.
“I’ve been able to go over there and I’ve always been welcomed with open arms,” he said last week. “They love the game of basketball. It started with Yao and Yi (Jianlian) and those guys over there. We want to make the game as popular as we can and show our appreciation by going overseas in China like we’re doing next week.”
While Chinese fans have a raucous following for both superstars and a handful of major franchises – of which the Lakers are definitely one – they showcase love for players at all levels. Lance Stephenson, who played for the Lakers last year before deciding to play in China this season, recently shared a video on Instagram of the doorman at his hotel mimicking his famous “air guitar” gesture.
Joe Young, who spent Summer League playing for the Lakers, played for Nanjing’s CBA team last season. When he first flew in, he remembers being greeted by hundreds – perhaps even a thousand – fans all bearing roses for him, a foreign player who went on to average 36 points per game for a franchise that hung around the bottom of the league standings. Toward the end of the season, Young didn’t like leaving his apartment for fear that he would be accosted in public by adoring fans.
“It’s just another level over there,” he said. “Those fans are crazy.”
But in light of the Morey incident, it seems that devotion has an uglier side to it: a hair-trigger for rebuking political discourse that puts China in an unfavorable light.
Morey’s tweet touched on a nerve that has been sensitive for months. Hong Kong is in the midst of protests of mainland China’s attempts to assert more control over the island that was a longtime British territory. A bill that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China sparked more than a million people to take to the streets in June to show their displeasure. Since, protesters and the Chinese government have had countless skirmishes, in which the New York Times estimated that some 2,000 canisters of tear canisters had been fired. Complicating the issue, many mainlanders feel that the legacy of Hong Kong is irrevocably tied to the country’s adversarial history with colonialism – Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai tried to relate the context in a Facebook post on Sunday night.
Morey’s tweet was deleted shortly after it was issued, but it was out in the open for the world to notice. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly noted that Morey’s tweet didn’t represent the Rockets, insisting that the team is an apolitical organization. Morey himself issued a statement saying he did not mean to offend Chinese fans. The NBA followed up with a statement that both related that the league supports individuals “educating themselves and sharing their views,” but also called the incident “regrettable.” James Harden, the Rockets’ franchise star, apologized and added “We love China.”
Outside of the league, the clamor was even louder as several political leaders criticized the NBA for kowtowing to Chinese interests – Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri even wrote an open letter to the NBA asking them to cancel the Lakers’ exhibitions there.
On other hot-button issues, the NBA has stood unconditionally behind its players’ ability to express political views. On his own, James has spoken in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, for gun legislation and against NCAA amateurism. Other politically outspoken NBA figures include coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, who have been particularly critical of the White House. Political expression has now entered the fabric of the NBA, so it’s all the more evident when the league tiptoes around a statement such as Morey’s that threatens its standing in a lucrative market.
The conflict of economic interests and political motivations is a needle the league has managed to thread for more than a decade of its increased investment in the Chinese market. This moment is arguably the first serious threat to the harmony that the NBA and China have managed to maintain. The Lakers, who sport two enormously popular stars in James and Anthony Davis, have a chance to heal some of the damage done.
Still, the larger question is likely to linger: Was it reasonable in the first place for the NBA to expect to have it both ways? That might not be so easily resolved.

Texto completo: Headnote KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA
The New York Times asked 18 families around the globe to show what they have for dinner on a typical weeknight.
Bangkok, Thailand
Wasa Khuhaprema prepared dinner for her family, including her parents, with help from her two young sons; the boys cook at least one night a week. This night, they ate an omelet with carrots, stir-fried minced pork and eggplant, and southern Thai sour curry with cauliflower. Family members are expected to clean up after themselves.
Gurgaon, India
The Osans - Radha, Tara, Gurinder and Shikha - get dinner on the table at their home in Gurgaon, southwest of New Delhi, with help from a cook. The family eats around 9 p.m., and on this night, the meal consisted of palak paneer (spinach with cheese), raita, kadai aloo (potatoes with onions and spices), cucumber salad and roasted chapatis.
Rome, Italy
Claudia Bellucci does most of the cooking for her family in Rome, and this night she was assisted by her daughter, Fiamma. For this meal, she picked herbs from her terrace for saltimbocca alla Romana (veal rolled with ham and sage). She also served homemade pesto with trofie pasta, a salad and baked tomatoes au gratin.
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
Basmah, Mazin, Abdulmalik and Abdulrahman Khojandi eat their meals - a mix of prepared and homemade foods - at home most nights during the week. Dinner on this evening was smashed beans, shakshuka and masoob, a mixture of banana, bread, dates, cream and honey.
Rehovot, Israel
Typically the Levy family eats at around 7 p.m., but on the Sabbath, the meal begins around 8. On this evening, they ate Yemeni soup, chicken schnitzel and chraime, a spicy Moroccan fish dish, with bread and rice. Tal Levy held the challah as he said a prayer.
Paris, France
Marina Pajovic Devouge prepared an early meal for her two children, Klara and Maxime, in the family's apartment in Paris before her husband got home. That night, the children ate some leftover roasted chicken from the butcher around the corner, paired with couscous from Picard Surgeles, a frozen-food store popular in France. They finished their meals with a Petit Suisse cheese and two slices of Comt� for Maxime, and a slice each of Comt� and Emmental for Klara.
Western Australia
Jarrod and Susie Opie and their three children live in Yallingup, on the Indian Ocean. On weeknights like this one, she cleans and he cooks: pan-fried nannygai, a local red snapper, with broccolini and sweet potato fries. The kids got extra fruits and vegetables.
Lima, Peru
On weeknights at their apartment, the Guevaras - Jesus and Margot, and their children, Eva and Dana - eat a dinner prepared by their housekeeper, who also does cleanup. Grilled steak was the centerpiece of this meal, paired with corn, potatoes and a salad.
Amsterdam, the Netherlands
Fleure Henket cooks for her family four nights a week, limiting meat consumption to two nights a week. This night, she served salmon with basmati rice and broccoli; dessert was a homemade custard with fresh raspberries and berry jam.
Texas, United States
The Garzas get weeknight dinner on their table in Laredo with help from an Instant Pot. On this evening, they ate spaghetti with meat sauce, along with a green salad and garlic bread. They eat at home six nights a week; they'll sometimes order takeout if they have prayer group or baseball practice for Grayson, 4.
Monterrey, Mexico
Luis Leduc and Katia Barragan take turns making dinner at their home in northeastern Mexico, but on this night it was Barrag�n's turn. She made huevos revueltos, a scrambled egg dish, with chorizo and onions, and served the eggs with flour tortillas. Their daughter, Emma, 4, insisted that the family eat strawberries, her favorite.
Moscow, Russia
Liza Lunin makes dinner most nights at her family's apartment. She and her husband, Viktor, have six children, who are in charge of setting the table. On this night, they ate kotleti - patties made with ground beef, bread, eggs and onions - alongside rice, green salad and a salad of roasted eggplant, red peppers and basil.
Tokyo, Japan
Yasuko Iguchi picked okra from her garden to cook for her son, Masahiro Iguchi, a divorced father of three who comes with his children to eat dinner five or six nights a week. On this evening they ate mebaru, a rockfish, with rice, miso soup and fresh fruit for dessert.
Istanbul, Turkey
Umut, Nevin, Deniz and Meral Terzi ate homemade kofte (meatballs), lentil soup and bulgur pilaf with grated tomatoes and bell peppers, along with dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) and red beans in olive oil. They ended the meal with a rice pudding called sutlac and pumpkin with tahini and walnuts.
Sao Paulo, Brazil
Carmem Massad Curi made picadinho, a traditional Brazilian stew made with beef, carrots and potatoes, which they ate with rice and a salad as they watched TV. Her husband, Luis Felippe, sets the table, and her children, Lucas and Giovanna, clear the plates.

Seattle writer Timothy Egan, the National Book Award-winning author of "The Worst Hard Times," as well as "The Big Burn" about the Great Fire of 1910, is coming to his hometown of Spokane on Oct. 29 to celebrate the release of his latest book with the Northwest Passages Book Club.
Egan's new book strays from the historical journalism for which he has become known. "A Pilgrimage to Eternity: From Canterbury to Rome in Search of a Faith" chronicles Egan's travels along the Via Francigena, a 1,200-mile medieval route that runs from Canterbury to Rome, where he sought an audience with Pope Francis.
Egan was raised in Spokane and graduated from Gonzaga Prep before moving to Seattle to study at the University of Washington. Egan's eight books have examined everything from the life of pioneering photographer Edward Curtis ("The Long Nights of the Shadow- Catcher"), a former Irish revolutionary who became an American hero and the first territorial governor of Montana ("The Immortal Irishman"), to an Eastern Washington murder that went unsolved for five decades ("Breaking Blue").
A former national reporter for the New York Times - he shared a piece of a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for his contributions to the Times' series "How Race is Lived in America" - he now is a contributing op-ed writer for the paper.
"A Pilgrimage to Eternity" is called "a fascinating page-turner" and "a joy and a privilege to read" in a starred review on Kirkus Reviews, while the late journalist Cokie Roberts wrote, "Somehow Egan has pulled together what seems like the entire history of Christianity, the scenes and succulents of much of Europe and his own personal story into an engrossing narrative."
Tickets to Egan's Northwest Passages event can be purchased at spokane7tickets.com.

Texto completo: Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union ensnared in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, will give a deposition to House committees investigating the president's pressure on a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political rival.
Sondland will meet behind closed doors Tuesday with the three panels -- Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and House Oversight -- spearheading the probe, according to a committee aide.
The official on Saturday confirmed the schedule on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. NBC News first reported Sondland's planned appearance.
A whistleblower's complaint revealed a July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, and his son and subsequent efforts to restrict access to records of the call. It also alleged that Trump asked Zelenskiy to look into unproven allegations that Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine.
Trump again maligned the whistleblower, Democrats and the news media in tweets Saturday morning, baselessly calling The New York Times and The Washington Post "pure fiction."
"The so-called Whistleblower's account of my perfect phone call is 'way off,' not even close. (Rep. Adam) Schiff and (Speaker Nancy) Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!" Trump also tweeted.
As part of their investigation, the committees subpoenaed the White House for documents on Friday, a step they had announced earlier in the week, and demanded documents from Vice President Mike Pence.
Sondland worked behind the scenes to carry out Trump's wishes in a country that's not part of the European Union. The ambassador met with Zelenskiy to give "advice" about how to "navigate" Trump's demands, the whistleblower reported. And in text messages turned over to House investigators Thursday, Sondland insisted that Trump's decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was not a quid pro quo -- as diplomat William "Bill" Taylor had feared, according to the texts.
"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions," Sondland wrote last month, before urging Taylor, the U.S. charges d'affaires in Ukraine, to call him instead.

Tokyo Olympics: Ticket packages 'running scarce'

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the Olympics? July 24 to Aug. 9. U.S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U.S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list.Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471.50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics? There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U.S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends flying into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U.S.
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10- to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay? Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling." Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o.d.o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, recommends a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo? Shibuya Crossing Who knew a crosswalk could double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails from early July to early September.
Animal cafes Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
Other notable sights Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do? Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Getting around The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says. "It's just really expensive to take a taxi to transfer between distant regions."

Confronting America’s ‘oligarchic drift’

Texto completo: If further confirmation was needed that the gap between the super-rich and the rest is still growing, the Census Bureau provided it last month: Income inequality is at its highest level in the United States since the bureau began tracking it a half century ago.
In fact, about a fifth of the nation’s wealth is now controlled by the richest 0.1% of Americans, while the middle class, hollowed out by the Great Recession, has struggled for decades with stagnant wages and sharply rising costs for education, health care and other necessities.
Against this backdrop, it’s reasonable to expect a robust debate about how to address the issue during the upcoming presidential campaign.
The position of the Republican Party, led by President Donald Trump, is already clear, at least by inference: In 2017, they enacted a $1.5 trillion tax cut that lavished most of its benefits on those who least needed the help, the rich and big corporations. We have heard no talk of rolling back this giveaway should the president be re-elected, and Trump has been flirting with the idea of reducing the capital gains tax on investment income.
On the other side, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, are proposing a wealth tax in their campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination. The idea is that taxes on the super-rich should encompass all their assets, such as stocks, real estate and art, rather than focus only on income derived from jobs and investments.
There are differences between the two. Warren’s plan would impose a 2% tax on net worth above $50 million and a 3% tax on net worth above $1 billion. Sanders’ plan begins with a 1% tax on net worth from $32 million to $50 million, and escalates to a top rate of 8% on net worth over $10 billion.
An analysis by two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped develop the plans for the candidates estimates that the Warren proposal would affect about 70,000 households, generating $2.6 trillion in revenue over a decade. The Sanders initiative would apply to 180,000 households, producing $4.35 trillion over 10 years.
The revenue generated from the taxes would be devoted to initiatives such as tuition-free college, student debt relief and universal child care that would ease the burdens borne by middle- and low-income people.
Sanders has said he believes billionaires should not exist in America. There may be something to that, although billionaires beg to differ (which is the only thing they have to beg for), as do some academics. They claim that wealth taxes would curb economic growth and create disincentives to invest and innovate.
“Turning the tax code into a vehicle for confronting what some call ‘oligarchic drift’ would undermine business confidence, reduce investment, degrade economic efficiency and punish success in ways unlikely to be good for the country or even to be appealing to most Americans,” Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, and Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote earlier this year.
Whatever the merits of their criticisms, we’re pretty sure they are wrong about the appeal of a wealth tax. A poll conducted this summer for The New York Times found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, favored a 2% tax on households worth more than $50 million such as the one Warren proposes.
It’s hard to credit the notion that entrepreneurs would be deterred from investing and innovating by relatively modest taxes imposed on vast fortunes, especially if the fruits of those taxes were devoted to improving a society that allows them to flourish in the first place. Nor do we believe that innovation is driven solely by the desire to accumulate wealth, although it is certainly a big factor.
Moreover, there is danger inherent in allowing the vast concentration of wealth in relatively few hands. Wealth equals power, and those with the biggest fortunes have the ability and motivation to shape politics and society to their own ends. “There’s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,” Sanders has said. “This is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.”
There may be other, and for all we know, better, ways of addressing gross inequality than a tax on wealth. But it certainly seems the most direct approach and is easily understood, which is not something that can be said about many tax plans. And, we hope, it keeps the issue front and center during the 2020 campaign.

Texto completo: If the wealthy are so stressed out, whose fault is that?
Seems like it's getting tough at the top. The winners in America's meritocracy are suffering. Children in affluent homes are being hothoused through childhood, stress-tested into elite schools and colleges, and pushed to the brink of suicide or breakdown. Their highly educated mothers and fathers are putting in long hours in their chosen professions: money-rich, perhaps, but time-poor.
The whining of the wealthy is getting louder.
Their new complaint is that they, too, are suffering at the hands of "the system." The system in question is the same meritocracy that in many cases has elevated them to their high perches. True, they have most of the money, wealth, power and opportunity. But they are working very hard for these advantages and they are working just as hard to secure them for their children.
Staying at the top, it turns out, is exhausting and expensive work. Perhaps sick of being cast as villains, some of the rich and successful have decided to declare themselves victims.
The latest diagnostician of this elite malaise is a Yale law professor named Daniel Markovits. In his widely discussed new book, "The Meritocracy Trap," he shows correctly how the ideology of meritocracy hurts the millions of people who don't make it to the top. The idea that successful people deserve the economic rewards flowing from that success is a pernicious myth.
But Professor Markovits also claims that meritocracy is as painful for the people on the top rungs of the ladder as it is for those lower down. "The elite and the middle class are not coming apart," he writes. "Instead, the rich and the rest are entangled in a single shared and mutually destructive economic and social logic."
The idea of meritocracy has long been used by the rich for self-justification. Now it is becoming fuel for their self-pity.
The raw competition for success, so the argument goes, hurts the winners as much as the losers: It is "mutually destructive." But this is not true. By any objective measure, the rich are doing just fine. They are wealthier and healthier than ever. Economists at the Brookings Institution found that the top 10 percent of male earners born in 1940 can now expect to live to the ripe old age of 88, 12 years longer than male earners born the same year in the bottom 10 percent.
This is not to say that successful people are immune to life's difficulties and strains. But there is no moral equivalence between the stress of a senior executive staying up late to polish a presentation for a client and the stress of a retail worker unsure if she will get the shift she needs to make rent.
The problems of the affluent are not systemic. They are self-inflicted. Well-heeled Americans have persuaded themselves that the stakes are high in every race in life. Especially when it comes to their children, the good is never good enough. Their children must have the best: the best preschools, the best high schools and the best colleges.
And they are willing to make sacrifices. George Packer reports in The Atlantic that affluent New York parents sleep on the streets to be first in line to enroll their children for nursery school. "I feared that I'd cheated our son of a slot by not rising until the selfish hour of 5:30," he writes. But sleeping rough is nothing compared to the length parents will go to in order to get their children into an top-notch college, as opposed to, say, a good public university.
The financier William McGlashan was one of the parents accused of gaming the system in the recent college admissions scandal. In a series of calls wiretapped by the F.B.I., Mr. McGlashan discussed photoshopping pictures of his son to make it appear that he was a football player to help him gain entry to the University of Southern California. At one point, Mr. McGlashan lamented, "The way the world works these days is unbelievable." But that is not the way the world works: It is the way he was working the world.
Affluent parents devote extraordinary resources -- money, time, string-pulling, to getting their kids into College A, which is infinitesimally better on some measures than College B. The first 18 years in the lives of the children of these parents have become an expensive, extended college preparation course.
It is surely true that this imposes enormous stress on the child or young adult in question, and possibly on the whole family. As one remedy, Mr. Markovits suggests that highly selective schools should "modestly increase the number of rich students" admitted, in order to "relax competition among rich applicants." This is a regressive proposal, but it flows naturally enough from a concern about the plight of the overstretched children of the elite classes. To be fair, he also wants them to admit more poor and middle-class students, by expanding their class sizes.
There is nothing wrong with parents spending a lot of money on their children. If they want to pay for them to attend a highly selective private college, religious institution or small liberal arts college, it's their money. The problem is not so much that rich people are spending as much as they are on these goods -- although that, too, is absurd. It is that they have begun to feel burdened by these costs and everything that leads up to them, all of which they have convinced themselves are unavoidable.
The broader political danger is that the affluent will become even more resistant to paying the higher taxes that are necessary for redistribution or better public services because they feel under such financial pressure themselves -- forgetting that, unlike the pressure the poor face, it is self-inflicted.
I have some better -- and cheaper -- ideas to improve the lives of the rich. If you are spending thousands of dollars and thousands of hours cultivating your children to get them into the most selective institutions: Just stop. Your kids will be just fine attending a good public university. And everyone's life will be more relaxed in the meantime.
If you are a professional working yourself sick in order to make a big salary: Just stop. Nobody is forcing you to work such long hours. Maybe you will only be rich, as opposed to superrich. But you'll be O.K.
If you are a homeowner with a huge mortgage that you took on in order to live in the very best neighborhood: Just stop. There is no law that says you have to live in the most expensive ZIP code you can afford.
Because, you see, nobody is making you do these stressful, expensive things. It is not a trap. It is a choice. If you don't want to be stressed out, stop making decisions that will stress you out. It is probably true that rich Americans are making decisions about their lives and their children's lives that are resulting in more stress and more spending -- and so more stress. But it is also true that they could be making different choices. They are not powerless.
People with money, power and education have the privilege of being able to lead a good life without too much stress and insecurity. If they choose to throw that away in the pursuit of some ideal of perfection, well, that's on them. Their stress is entirely the result of their own decisions. The very least they could do is refrain from asking for sympathy from everyone else.

Texto completo: MANILA -- A British businessman and his Filipino wife have been abducted in the southern Philippines, where Islamic militants have been known to seize foreigners and missionaries for ransom, the police and the military said on Saturday.
The couple, Allan Arthur Hyrons, 70, and Welma Paglinawan-Hyrons, were taken Friday night by six unidentified gunmen from a beach resort in the town of Tukuran in Zamboanga del Sur Province, the authorities said.
It was not immediately clear who had abducted the couple, but insurgent groups known for involvement in kidnapping operate in the area.
Maj. Helen Galvez of the Philippine regional police said that a day before the abduction, two people believed to be involved had checked in at the resort and were apparently waiting for the couple.
"They were seized at gunpoint and dragged across the beach where they were taken on two motorized boats that immediately sped off into the high seas in opposite directions," Major Galvez said.
One group known for its involvement in such abductions is Abu Sayyaf, or Bearers of the Sword, a militant group with many factions, one of which is led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who has been identified by the United States as the new leader of the Islamic State affiliate operating in the southern Philippines.
Mr. Sawadjaan took over from Isnilon Hapilon, who was killed during intense gun battles with Philippine troops when Abu Sayyaf fighters sacked the city of Marawi two years ago.
Mr. Sawadjaan's group is also believed to have orchestrated a suicide bombing at a Catholic church on Jolo Island in January that left 23 people dead.
After Friday's abduction, the police and the military sent out search teams and also enlisted the help of members of the former rebel group Moro Islamic Liberation Front to help in the effort, Major Galvez said.
The group was the largest Muslim insurgent force that originally fought for an independent state in the predominately Catholic Philippines. But it signed a peace deal with the government in 2014, and its leaders now head an interim government that oversees an autonomous region in the south.
Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for some of the Philippines' most brutal attacks, including kidnappings and beheadings. In May, the Dutch national Ewold Horn, in captivity since 2012, was killed when troops mounted a rescue attempt. A Swiss man, Lorenzo Vinciguerra, who was seized with him escaped in 2014.
Two years ago, Abu Sayyaf militants beheaded a German man, Jürgen Kantner, after his government refused to pay a ransom demand of $ 600,000. A year earlier, the same group beheaded two Canadian captives for the same reason.
Rommel Banlaoi, who heads the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, said that the latest incident proves that Abu Sayyaf "continues to evolve faster than the military countermeasures."
"Its major source of staying power are those armed groups involved in various crimes, such as kidnap for ransoms," Mr. Banlaoi said.
While the group, as a whole, has been weakening, it has found new ways of bolstering its name by parroting the Islamic State ideology while continuing to engage criminal activities, he said.

Texto completo: Please help me get the importance of this infamous Trump-Zelensky phone call.
The Democrats and their soulmates in the liberal media are seriously getting ready to impeach the president - again - because President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky for a couple of favors?
Apparently, given the hysteria, it’s the first time in U.S. history that our president has asked the leader of a foreign country to do a favor for him that might help him politically at home.
President Trump asked - “pressed” is the loaded word the New York Times and its multimedia echo chamber uses - Zelensky to do two things having to do with political corruption.
One was for Zelensky to help Attorney General Bill Barr open an investigation into a Ukrainian company involved in Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
The other favor, the one that was immediately declared an impeachable offense by the AOC/Schiff/Waters Democrats and liberal TV pundits, involved the shady activities of the Biden Family Overseas Enrichment Corp.
Trump asked President Zelensky to have his prosecutor open a corruption investigation into the huge Ukrainian gas company that put Joe Biden’s son Hunter on its corporate board and paid him about $50,000 a month to …
Do what? No one knows. Hunter knew nothing about the international natural gas business or Ukraine.
That stroke of good luck for the younger Biden in 2015 just happened to occur at the very same time VP Papa Joe was serving as the Obama Administration’s bag-man-in-chief for U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine.
Even luckier, when the gas company was about to be looked into for corruption by the Ukrainian prosecutor, Papa Joe came to Hunter’s rescue.
As he boasted in a video that the New York Times apparently has not yet seen, Papa Joe told the Ukraine government he’d withhold $6 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired in six hours, which he was.
The New York Times and its fellow liberal fake journalists aren’t very curious about the details of the Biden family’s blatant conflicts of interest.
Impeaching Trump is all that matters to them and the Democrats.
The president’s phone call won’t hurt him politically and he’ll never be impeached by the Senate, but the publicity about the Bidens’ slippery doings in Ukraine will destroy the Biden Family.
Papa Joe is an old coot who was never going to win the nomination anyway.
It’s Hunter I feel sorry for. He’s young. Now everyone in the media is talking about his personal issues and his past drug problems. He may never work again.
Hunter should have known better to take that high-paying Ukrainian “job.” He was as unqualified as I am.
It wasn’t a crime to take it, but he knew he was being used by the Ukrainian gas company to get access to his dad. It’s not brain surgery.
As the son of a famous politician, I know what Hunter has had to deal with. Those kind of fat jobs and sweet business deals are offered to the families of big-time politicians all the time.
I was offered stuff many times in the 1980s. I’d always call the White House lawyer and ask him what he thought.
He’d always say, “Your gut will always tell whether it’s wrong or OK. But if you have a problem, call me.”
To this day I get called to go out on Republican campaign trails.
All they want me to do is endorse them so they can pretend they have the mantle of Ronald Reagan.
This year I was asked to endorse a politician running for president in, of all places, Ukraine. I wouldn’t do it.
Then I was offered $100,000 by someone in the United States just to go to Kiev, go to a cocktail party or two and be photographed next to the candidate.
I turned that down, too. The Ukrainian politician didn’t care about me or Ronald Reagan or conservatism. He just wanted to wear the mantle of my father.
Someone should have been warning Hunter long before 2015 to watch out for those $50,000-a-month do-noting job offers.
His Papa Joe, for instance.

Texto completo: Men and women who start running competitively when they are in their 50s can be as swift, lean and well-muscled within a decade as competitive older runners who have trained lifelong, according to a buoying new study of the physiques and performances of a large group of older athletes.
The findings suggest that middle age is not too late to take up intense exercise training and begin banking many of the health and aging benefits of being an athlete.
Already, a wealth of research indicates that older athletes - known as masters - age differently than older people who are sedentary. Past studies show that competitive athletes in their 60s, 70s, 80s and even 90s tend to have more and healthier muscle mass, stronger hearts and much less body fat than non-athletes of the same age.
In essence, masters athletes represent “the model of healthy aging,” said Jamie McPhee, a professor of musculoskeletal physiology at Manchester Metropolitan University in England, who led the new study. “They have fewer long-term health conditions” than aging non-athletes, he said, “take fewer medications, have fewer hospital or medical visits, and their physical function is excellent.”
But many past studies of masters athletes have looked at participants, mostly men, who have trained for decades. Whether those of us whose work and family commitments, disinterest, ill health or long-term procrastination discouraged us from being serious competitive athletes earlier can start training in midlife and catch up to longer-term competitors’ performance and health has not been clear.
So, for the new study, which was published in August in Frontiers in Physiology, McPhee and his colleagues decided to find out. For more than a decade, he and his colleagues already had been studying the muscle and bone health of masters athletes, especially runners. Each of these runners had been at least 60 when he or she joined the study, and the researchers’ data showed that most displayed substantially greater muscle mass - although not necessarily bone density - than less-active older people.
Now they turned to this existing trove of data to look into whether it mattered, for health and performance, when athletes started training. The scientists focused on older distance runners for whom they already had extensive data about body composition, including their bone densities, muscle mass and body-fat percentages, as well as answers to lengthy questionnaires detailing how often and intensely the athletes had trained in every decade of their lives, beginning at the age of 18.
The records also tracked each runner’s times and placings in major races from the past two years. The runners had competed in a variety of distances, from the 800 meters to the marathon.
The scientists now gathered records for 150 of these masters runners and divided them into two groups, depending on when the athletes had begun training. One group, the early starters (mostly men), had been racing throughout adulthood, having often begun running as teenagers.
The latecomers, on the other hand, had not begun training and racing until they were at least 50, leaving them 20 or 30 years behind the early starters. Interestingly, while both groups included men and women, the latecomers featured a much larger percentage of women.
The researchers also gathered data about the body compositions of 59 inactive older men and women from a separate, long-term study of health and aging to provide a control group.
Finally, the researchers compared the health and performance parameters of the runners in each group to one another and to the controls.
And they found surprisingly few distinctions among the athletes. The runners’ finishing times barely differed, whether they had been training for 30 years or fewer than 10. Both groups of runners also showed about 12% greater muscle mass in their legs than the inactive control group and about 17% less body fat.
Only with bone density were the latecomer runners at a disadvantage. Their spinal bone density tended to be lower than among the control group or the long-term runners (whose spinal densities were comparable).
The upshot is that it does seem to be “possible to catch up with those who have trained several decades longer,” McPhee said.
There are caveats, though. This study did not look at sports other than running or at markers of health apart from muscles and bones. It also did not delve into participants’ genetics or their physiques before they joined the study, either of which could have uniquely fitted them to become older athletes and might not apply to the rest of us.
But even with these provisos, the study’s findings are encouraging, McPhee said, suggesting that, whatever our age, it may not be too late for us to become healthier and, if we so choose, late-blooming athletes.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Microsoft said Friday that hackers linked to the Iranian government targeted a U.S. presidential campaign, as well as government officials, media targets and prominent expatriate Iranians.

Overall, the hackers attempted to penetrate 241 accounts -- four successfully -- though none of those penetrated was associated with presidential campaigns or current or past U.S. officials, Microsoft said. A company spokeswoman declined to identify those targeted, citing customer privacy.

Reuters and The New York Times reported that the attack targeted President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, but this could not be independently confirmed. But a review of publicly available internet records by AP showed that the Trump campaign's official website is linked to Microsoft's email service.

Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, said there was "no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."

Microsoft's announcement is the latest sign that foreign governments are looking for ways to potentially disrupt the 2020 presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials have sounded the alarm about the risks for months.

Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, as well as the subsequent leaks of emails during the 2016 election roiled the DNC, hurt the Clinton campaign and was a focal point in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.

Foreign hackers have long targeted U.S. government and politicians, generally with little notice. But the disruption caused by Russia's attack has heightened awareness and prompted fears that other nations will try to follow Russia's example. Iran in particular could have a stake in the outcome of the U.S. election after Trump withdrew the United States from a nuclear agreement and stepped up sanctions against the country.

"The Russians came after us and our election system in 2016 and they paid virtually no price for that activity," said Jamil N. Jaffer, director of the national security law and policy program at George Mason University, and former chief counsel of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It's not surprising that China now more aggressively and maybe the Iranians are getting in that game. Why not?"

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was working with Microsoft to "assess and mitigate impacts." Chris Krebs, director of the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said much of the activity is likely "run-of-the-mill" foreign intelligence service work.

But, "Microsoft's claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions," Krebs said.

In a blogpost released Friday, Microsoft's Tom Burt, corporate vice president for customer security and trust, said that owners of four accounts that were compromised by the hackers have been notified. The company would not identify those accounts.

The attacks by a group Microsoft calls Phosphorous occurred during a 30-day period between August and September.

Burt said the Iranian hackers used password reset and account recovery features to try to take over accounts. For example, they gathered phone numbers belonging to targets to help with a password reset. In other cases, they tried to get into secondary email accounts that might be linked to the Microsoft account to gain access via a verification email.

The hackers researched their targets, making more than 2,700 attempts to identify emails belonging to a specific Microsoft customer. A spokeswoman declined to provide more details.

The company has previously taken legal steps to combat Iran-linked hackers, suing them in federal court in Washington D.C., so Microsoft could take control of websites Phosphorous used to conduct hacking operations and to stop attacks.

The campaigns of Sen. Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet, Pete Buttigieg, and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock also said they had not been targeted. A campaign aide for Sen. Bernie Sanders said the campaign doesn't comment on matters of technical security.

Republican National Committee spokeswoman Blair Ellis said the RNC is "constantly working to stay ahead of emerging threats."

Meanwhile, the DNC sent an alert out to campaigns Friday, warning them about the Iran-linked hacking group's targeting of Microsoft accounts belonging to "journalists, politicians and at least one presidential campaign."

The DNC has taken several steps to improve the party's cybersecurity since 2016. The most public move was the hiring of Bob Lord, a veteran of Silicon Valley cybersecurity with stints at Yahoo, Twitter, AOL and Netscape, to serve as its cybersecurity chief.

Lord on Friday declined to provide details on the hacking efforts, deferring to Microsoft. He has worked to improve security protocols for DNC staff, state parties and campaigns with access to the central voter file that DNC maintains.

In July, Microsoft announced that it had detected more than 740 infiltration attempts by nation-state actors in the past year targeting U.S.-based political parties, campaigns and other democracy-focused organizations including think tanks and other nonprofits.

The company declined to name or further characterize the targets or the actors. It said at the time that such targeting had similarly occurred in the early stages of the 2016 and 2018 elections.

A memo prepared by DHS and the FBI was sent to state election officials this week outlining possible ways Russia could seek to interfere in the 2020 elections by discouraging voters or utilizing voter suppression tactics.

The document, which was dated Thursday and reviewed by The Associated Press, outlines a few possible scenarios for state and local election officials to be aware of. Those include the use of social media to exacerbate divisions within political parties during state primaries and the hacking of election websites to spread misinformation on voting processes or to alter voter registration data.

Texto completo: Gary Clark Jr. opens the 45th season of the live concert series. And Matt Damon plays the infamous literary grifter in the 1999 film, which is available to stream.
What's on TV
AUSTIN CITY LIMITS 11 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The blues guitarist and Austin native Gary Clark Jr. opens the 45th season of this long-running live concert series, performing music from his latest album, "This Land," which was a New York Times Critic's Pick. Later on in the season, music fans can catch hourlong performances from Maggie Rogers, H.E.R. and Vampire Weekend.
MURDER FOR HIRE 6 p.m. on Oxygen. This true crime show, produced by the "Law & Order" creator Dick Wolf, explores the sinister world of contract killings. In it, law enforcement officers recount their undercover sting operations that have caught vengeful ex-spouses, disgruntled former co-workers and ruthless criminals seeking out hits. The Season 2 premiere follows the case of Dalia Dippolito, a Florida woman who is serving 16 years in state prison for hiring a hit man to kill her husband. The sting operation, which involved officers staging a murder scene at the couple's home, was filmed and posted on YouTube by the Boynton Beach Police Department.
GARY GULMAN: THE GREAT DEPRESH 10 p.m. on HBO. Gary Gulman opens this comedy special, his first for HBO, with a set that didn't make a lot of people laugh. In archival footage from 2017, the comedian steps onto a Boston comedy stage and, shaking, confesses to the crowd that he has "a severe mental illness." "It's excruciating," he says. "This is like a cosmic bottom. This is like a bottom." After that performance, the comedian spent two years battling depression, a topic that he opens up about in his latest special. In documentary footage interwoven with his stand-up set in Brooklyn, Gulman talks with friends and family about his mental health and his journey to get well. He also uses his time onstage to talk about his experiences with therapy, medication and hospitalization, as well as observations about millennial attitudes, masculinity and his own childhood.
What's Streaming
THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (1999) Stream on Hulu and Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube and Vudu. As purported fraudsters, hustlers and scammers continue to captivate the collective consciousness, it may be a perfect time to revisit an infamous literary grifter -- Tom Ripley. In this film adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's psychological thriller, Matt Damon plays the charming impostor, who is hired to track down the wealthy Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) in Italy at the request of Greenleaf's father. While abroad, Ripley becomes obsessed with Greenleaf's luxurious lifestyle and begins to slowly take on his identity, turning to violence to keep up his ruse. The film was a New York Times Critic's Pick, with Janet Maslin writing that Damon played the role "with a fine, tricky mix of obsequiousness and ruthlessness." It seems right then that Andrew Scott, fresh off his role as the "hot priest" in the Emmy-winning "Fleabag," is set to star as Ripley in an upcoming Showtime series based on Highsmith's books.

Texto completo: The artistic evolution revolution, with chimps in the role of members of the House of Commons, set an auction high for the artist.
LONDON -- This time it was the bidding that made people gasp.
Banksy, the world's most famous street artist, joined the ranks of the world's most expensive artists Thursday night when his 2009 satirical painting, "Devolved Parliament," showing Britain's House of Commons populated by chimpanzees, sold for 9.9 million pounds with fees, or about $ 12.1 million, at Sotheby's, setting an auction high for his work.
"This is like the moment Basquiat made it into the Soho galleries in the 1980s," Alex Branczik, Sotheby's head of contemporary art in Europe, said after the sale. "I've realized he's a serious artist, but he has such a broad popular base. He appeals to established and new collectors," added Mr. Branczik.
"Devolved Parliament," a Victorian-style oil on canvas showing the debating chamber of the House of Commons packed with earnest-looking chimps, was being offered at the evening auction of contemporary art just four weeks before a Brexit-traumatized Britain is due to leave the European Union. Signed and dated 2009, the painting, offered by a private collector, had been estimated to sell for between £1.5 million and £2 million, or $ 1.9 million to $ 2.5 million. Acoris Andipa, a London dealer who specializes in Banksy, called the 14-foot-wide "Devolved Parliament" "an important piece," saying it was the most valuable work executed solely by Banksy to have so far appeared at auction. (Other pieces have sold privately for at least $ 3 million.) "It's just so topical. And the sale was perfectly timed for Frieze," Mr. Andipa added, referring to the contemporary art fair currently running in Regent's Park that always draws international collectors.
But for some in Sotheby's packed salesroom, the result was an anticlimax. They had been hoping to witness a stunt as spectacular as the Banksy "shredding incident" that transfixed the world's news and social media last October at Sotheby's.
On this occasion, Banksy had already done his monkey business.
After a dramatic 13 minutes of competition, in which as many as 10 bidders were involved, at least five of them in the room, it was finally knocked down to a telephone buyer. At one point the hammer was poised to fall at £6.4 million, but a bidder at the back of the room flung up his hand at the last second, before finally giving way to the winning telephone bid.
"It's a really important moment," said Mike Snelle, half of the London-based artist duo, the Connor Brothers, who was in the salesroom. "The price was final recognition of how important an artist he is. The art world has taken time to catch up with how significant he is culturally." The artist's previous auction high was set in 2008 for the painting, "Keep It Spotless," a collaborative work by Banksy and Damien Hirst, which sold for $ 1.9 million at a Sotheby's charity auction.
When Sotheby's announced last month that it would be selling the Banksy, the auction house catalog said the painting had been included in the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery's hugely popular 2009 show devoted to the artist, who was born in Bristol. It was then titled "Question Time." Sotheby's said the painting, retitled "Devolved Parliament," returned on loan to the Bristol Museum in March to coincide with Britain's then-scheduled exit from the European Union.
But sharp-eyed Banksy enthusiasts notified The New York Times about significant differences between the image seen in Bristol in 2009 and that exhibited in 2019. Most crucially -- and perhaps symbolically -- the overhead lamps in the House of Commons had been turned off in the later version, and a banana held by a chimp in the foreground was turned downward, rather than up.
Sotheby's subsequently amended the cataloging to say the painting had been "reworked" by the artist after the 2009 exhibition.
This new auction high for a Banksy painting follows on from the remarkable £395,250, or about $ 518,000 given last month for a rare proof of the iconic 2004 "Girl With Balloon" screen print at a Christie's online sale of Banksy's work.
Printed with the balloon in gold rather than the usual red, it was thought to be one of just 22 produced. The result was an auction high for any Banksy print, according to Artnet.
To put the current peaks of the Banksy market in perspective, the price of that "Girl With Balloon" was just a fraction lower than the auction high of $ 530,500 achieved six years ago for Albrecht Dürer's 1514 engraving, "Melencolia I," one of the most acclaimed masterpieces of European Renaissance art.
"Everyone wants a piece of it," said James Baskerville, the head of Christie's Banksy sale. "His market ebbs and flows, but if he continues to create works and do stunts, the market will continue to rise."

Texto completo: The world lost a treasure that will never be replaced when the legendary opera singer Jessye Norman died on Monday at the age of 74.
As one writer notes, "if arias are like lyrical prose poems, then each singer becomes a poet, reading the text with a unique timbre and cadence." As for Norman, her voice delivered pure poetry from her interpretations of a Wagner opera or Bizet's "Carmen."
But while the performer would rise from a world of limitations in the segregated South and Jim Crow to worldwide acclaim, the divine diva could never shed that which often left her feeling on the edge rather than in the inner circle - the color ofher skin.
In her memoirs, she acknowledged how her parents "dared to dream of and plan for brighter futures for their children" - and Norman made the best ofevery opportunity that came her way. After leaving her childhood home of Augusta, GA, she traveled to Howard University, continuing to fight perceptions that because she was Black, she was somehow less talented.
She first began to compete internationally in 1968, winning the Bavarian Radio International Music Competition and then, a year later, accepted an invitation to sing at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. She continued to hone her craft on stages throughout Europe, eventually returning to the U.S. She would become known for her ability to bridge classical masterpieces with the music that marked her beginnings - the Negro spirituals - blending the structure of her operatic performance with the improvisational style of the spiritual.
Norman, a dramatic soprano, would become known for her prowess in roles that included Wagner's Sieglinde, Ariadne by Richard Strauss, Gluck's Alceste, Beethoven's Leonore and both Cassandre and Dido in Les Troyens by Berlioz. In addition, she sang and recorded recitals of music by Schubert, Brahms, Chausson, Poulenc, Mahler and Strauss, sang at the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan, at Queen Elizabeth II's 60th birthday celebration and took the stage to perform La Marseillaise during the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution on July 14, 1989. She also sang at the 1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Atlanta and for the second inauguration of Bill Clinton.
Her formative years as a singer harken to her loss in the Marian Anderson Vocal Competition in Philadelphia at the age of 16. However, the experience led to the offer of a full scholarship at Howard University where she sang in the university chorus and as a soloist at the Lincoln Temple United Church of Christ.
After graduating in 1967 with a degree in music, she began graduate studies at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore and later at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance in Ann Arbor, Michigan, from which she earned a master's degree in 1968.
During a New York Times interview, Norman talked about her wide range of vocal abilities.
"As for my voice, it cannot be categorized and I like it that way because I sing things that would be considered in the dramatic, mezzo or spinto range. I like so many different kinds of music that I've never allowed myself the limitations of one particular range."
She would add, in another interview when asked to characterize her voice, "pigeonholes are only comfortable for pigeons."

Podcasting’s first family

Texto completo: Last week, on a blessedly temperate Wednesday eve, hundreds of variously costumed people thronged outside DAR Constitution Hall, just a short trot from the White House. In Washington, D.C., ostentatious hordes typically mean some new protest is afoot, but this gathering was for a different reason. The crowd — an assortment of makeshift elves, magicians, adventurers, and park rangers along with others, such as myself, and my slightly unprepared companion in casual dress — had come to see three brothers play Dungeons & Dragons with their father.
The first of a two-night stop along the McElroy family’s national Become The Monster Tour, my fellow audience members and I were in attendance for a live-show recording of The Adventure Zone, a wildly, surprisingly popular role-playing comedy podcast hosted by Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy, and their father, Clint. For the better part of three hours, we enjoyed the goofy twists and ludicrous turns of a Travis-led game scenario titled “Oh Dang! Bigfoot Stole My Car With My Friend’s Birthday Present Inside,” in which Justin played a surly, witchcraft-curious teenage girl roped into babysitting Griffin’s character, a less-than-true-to-life 11-year-old Griffin McElroy. After the titular Bigfoot car-snatching, the two were eventually driven around by a hip-hop-emcee-styled limousine driver played by Clint. Like their devoted audience, the four were dressed in cosplay for their respective characters, costumes made all the more garish by the fact Travis McElroy had set the game in 1998.
I returned to the DAR Constitution Hall the following night — this time with a different but similarly unprepared companion — for a sold-out live-show recording of the brothers’ first and flagship podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me. Billed as “an advice show for the modern era,” the once-weekly podcast — known as MBMBaM to fans (often pronounced “mah-bim-bam”) — aired its first episode in April 2010.
The brothers, introduced every episode as “your oldest brother, Justin McElroy”; “your middlest brother, Travis McElroy”; and “your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy,” promise to “take your questions and turn them, alchemy-like, into wisdom.” Instead, the queries, whether selected from listener submissions or mined from the feverish id of the internet that is Yahoo! Answers, are little more than an invitation to hop into their comedic sandbox. The result is an unending stream of wit, idiocy, and lighthearted fun that shoves meaning into nonsensical phrases such as “blast my cache” and “beanfreak” and crafts instant, fan-cherished lore around gonzo monstrosities such as “Garfield the Deals Warlock” imagined out of thin air.
The McElroys’ unique mélange of oddball humor, quick family banter, and silly, seductive weirdness has turned what might easily be two niche comedy podcasts into the crown jewels of an ever-expanding new media-entertainment empire. In addition to the sold-out live-show tours, the podcasts consistently rank among the highest downloaded comedy podcasts on iTunes — MBMBaM currently sits in the top 20; TAZ, at 28th — and the combined Twitter following of the brothers and the two shows is well over 1.2 million.
Originally conceived as a one-off episode for MBMBaM, The Adventure Zone has grown into something approaching a cultural phenomenon. Despite the nerds-in-their-basement cache of Dungeons & Dragons, the McElroys emphasize comedy and storytelling over fidelity to rules and mechanics. Paired with familiar yet engaging campaign arcs — an Agatha Christie-inspired train mystery; a Groundhog’s Day-type time loop; a Ben Hur/Fast and Furious crossover “battlewagon” race — TAZ is immediately accessible to anyone interested in good fiction. Their just-concluded 36-episode arc, titled “Amnesty,” featured a monster-of-the-week-style campaign, à la Buffy the Vampire Slayer, set in West Virginia’s Monongahela National Forest.
Which turns out to be quite a few: Since its debut episode in late 2014, the twice-monthly podcast has been downloaded over 180 million times. Last July, the McElroys partnered with artist Carey Pietsch to create a graphic novel adaptation of their first TAZ campaign arc. Upon its release, The Adventure Zone: Here There Be Gerblins topped the New York Times’ trade fiction bestseller list, the first graphic novel ever to do so. This July, their second graphic novel adaptation, The Adventure Zone: Murder on the Rockport Limited!, also hit No. 1 on the list.
In 2017, sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy was named a Forbes 30 Under 30 “media luminary,” and this year Clint McElroy and the brothers began writing their very own Marvel comic series. They filmed a short-but-charming six-episode TV series, set in their hometown of Huntington, West Virginia, for the streaming service Seeso in 2017 (currently available on VRV). Their work even made it into friend-of-the-show Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton.
Theirs is a family business. In addition to their other projects, the brothers each host a podcast with their respective wives. And, of course, they do make time to play D&D with dear ole dad at least once a month.
That family also extends to their hometown of Huntington. Since 2014, the McElroy family has catalyzed hundreds of thousands of dollars of donations for Huntington and West Virginia-based charities. Each year around Christmas, they host a holiday fundraiser around their annual MBMBaM “Candlenights” live-show performance in Huntington. In 2017, the McElroys organized and published a TAZ fan-artist comic, “The Adventure Zine,” as a charity benefit for the city’s Facing Hunger Food Bank, which raised more than $187,000 in donations.
The trio, raised Southern Baptist in a culturally conservative state, have become more openly political and “woke” of late (indeed, they caution listeners against revisiting MBMBaM’s first 80 or so episodes, produced in the far back early aughts when no one knew better). But even as their views on social and political issues are clear in their work (as is their right), they have largely managed to keep their comedy about comedy, an admirable feat in 2019.
Theirs is a goofy realm with real-world reach, where anyone who wants to joke about ghosts and horses and ghost-horses or adventure into the Magical World of Elevators and fight with a talking sword is welcome — including my two live-show companions, both now fans for life.

Whistleblower complaint was always political, regardless of when he told Adam Schiff

Texto completo: President Trump and his defenders act like they’ve got a hot one on their hands with the revelation that the “whistleblower” in the Ukraine mess tipped off Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and his staff before anyone else. They apparently think this is the proof the public needed to know that this is a political hit job.
But here’s the truth: It was always obvious that this was political. We don’t need a detailed timeline of the career government worker’s day to know that he was motivated by politics.
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Schiff, a Democrat from California, had been notified of the government worker’s complaint “days” before it had been officially filed. At a press conference shortly after the Times’ story went online, Trump triumphantly waved a printed out version and declared that it proved the complaint and the House move to impeach him was all “a scam.”
Yes, it’s a scam. But learning whether the “whistleblower” first walked to the Capitol to tip off Schiff, and whether he stopped on the way buy a pussy hat, is beside the point.
The only thing that matters is that this James Comey protégé just instigated an impeachment in a naked attempt to sway the 2020 election.
Look at the full complaint. The summary at the top asserts that Trump “is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.” Wow, that sounds pretty severe! But that’s apparently as far as Democrats got. The rest reads like a game of Clue.
Take this part lifted directly from the complaint, which the author himself admits is largely based on second and third-hand information:
Mr. Sytnyk and Mr. Leshchenko are two of Mr. Lutsenko's main domestic rivals. Mr. Lutsenko has no legal training and has been widely criticized in Ukraine for politicizing criminal probes and using his tenure as Prosecutor General to protect corrupt Ukrainian officials. He has publicly feuded with Mr. Sytnyk, who heads Ukraine's only competent anticorruption body, and with Mr. Leshchenko, a former investigative journalist who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Lutsenko's record. In December 2018, a Ukrainian court upheld a complaint by a Member of Parliament, Mr. Boryslav Rozenblat, who alleged that Mr. Sytnyk and Mr. Leshchenko had “interfered” in the 2016 U.S. election by publicizing a document detailing corrupt payments made by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych before his ouster in 2014.
Clear as Watergate, right?
That’s just a small piece of the background for what Democrats believe will be a slam-dunk attempt at impeachment. Those are just a few of the details behind the case that Democrats believe will move public opinion squarely in Democrats’ favor.
The complaint started with a phone conversation Trump had with the head of Ukraine to ask about potential corruption issues related to the 2016 election and Joe Biden. Democrats had, until now, been very keen on learning more details about foreign interference in the 2016 election. As for Biden, isn’t it strange that Democrats aren’t so much defending him as they are attacking anyone who has questions related to him and his son’s dealings with Ukraine?
The timeline of when this government worker delivered his complaint to Schiff doesn’t matter. It’s a distraction from the fact that the complaint, regardless of where it was delivered and when, is in itself an attempt by Democrats to sway the next election.

Letter: Take Krugman’s prediction with a grain of salt

Texto completo: An article ran on the Opinion Page of the Sept. 28 issue of The Salt Lake Tribune from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and headlined, “Impeaching Trump is good for the economy.”
For reasons not easily understood, the Gnomes of Oslo awarded Krugman the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008. A year later they awarded President Barack Obama the Nobel Peace Prize — 10 months after he took office. But I digress.
Krugman, like most star economists, has made his share of good and bad predictions about the future. Of the bad, none was worse (he kind of confessed so two years later) than the central point of this whopper that ran on the Opinion Page of the New York Times on November 9, 2016 — the day after Trump was elected: "Now comes the mother of all adverse effects — and what it brings with it is a regime that will be ignorant of economic policy and hostile to any effort to make it work. ... So we are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight.”
Given the foregoing, Tribune readers wouldn’t be out of line taking Krugman’s latest prediction with a grain of salt.

Texto completo: Los medios de comunicación viven de la publicidad pero eso no quiere decir que deben aceptar cualquier aviso que llegue a su departamento de ventas.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, el canal de noticias CNN rechazó circular dos avisos publicitarios de la campaña de reelección de Donald Trump argumentando que contenía imprecisiones.
Uno de los avisos hablaba de un intento de golpe de estado de los demócratas por su llamado a indagar la posibilidad de un juicio político. En este también se acusaba al exvicepresidente Joe Bide n de corrupción sin ninguna evidencia.
“[Biden] le prometió a Ucrania $1,000 millones si despedían al fiscal que investigaba la compañía de su hijo”, dice el narrador de la publicidad.
Lo cierto es que por ahora no hay evidencia de que Biden haya incurrido en delitos. Los avisos de Trump además atacaban a algunos de los periodistas de CNN como Don Lemmon y Chris Cuomo .
“Además de menospreciar a CNN y sus periodistas, el anuncio hace afirmaciones que han sido demostradas como falsas por varios medios de comunicación, entre ellos CNN”, dijo un portavoz de la cadena.
Los avisos de Trump eran de 30 segundos. Los puedes ver aquí.

Donald Trump has a Twitter problem and vice versa

Texto completo: If you go to his page, which I try not to, and stare into it like the night sky, sometimes you can catch one in real time.
A Trump tweet that is. You'll have hours of nothing and then WHOOSH , a streak of white hot ignorance cuts through the Twittersphere, leaving behind it a flaming wake of likes and an ever-lengthening streak of comments.
Like most shooting stars, the tweets are just flaming trash en route to either self-immolation or a crash landing, but something about it still captivates us. We've grown somewhat accustomed to the meteor shower of typos, bigotry, provocation, and insouciance flung by President Trump, but we still can't quite believe our eyes.
(And likewise, I often find myself using Trump tweets as occasions to cast wishes into the void of space.)
But lately, the morning dusting of fiery content from the White House seems a bit heavier, the projectiles more weighty and more frequent, their impacts leaving more damage, cratering the discourse. After staring slackjawed at the spectacle of TOTUS (that T is for troll) as the firestorm from his thumbs ramps up, one thing is certain: It's not pretty.
This past week has seen Trump elevate his troll game on Twitter into something that can only be described by an unfortunate term I have no interest in putting here. The term in question designates a social media style that relies on relentless nuisance posting of memes, comments, and unfunny jokes purely as a means of sadistic self-gratification.
KnowYourMeme.com has the most useful summation: “an Internet slang term describing a range of user misbehaviors and rhetoric on forums and message boards that are intended to derail a conversation off-topic, including thread jacking [another word I probably can't put here], and non-commercial spamming."
Random , useless , and unnecessary all spring up in other attempts to define the unprintable term — but more often than not, it tends to be one of those you-know-it-when-you-see-it situations.
Over the past week, we've seen the president perch on his wire to drop messy conspiracy theories about a deep state coup, insult members of Congress, insinuate that his impeachment would trigger a civil war, and perhaps worst of all, share a Nickelback song (since removed for copyright violations; a slight consolation.)
It would all seem like the desperate ravings of the most powerful man in the world who is losing touch with reality in front of 65 million followers if . . . oh wait I guess it does seem like that, doesn't it?
Granted, like many other numbers associated with Trump, his Twitter metrics are the products of wild inflation. Glance at the comments that clog any of his tweets and you'll notice that most of those in his online infantry either have follower counts in the low teens or the hundred-thousands. It's hard to say who is really along for the ride.
But whether you follow him or not (I follow the “Unfollow Trump" account, which posts his tweets without contributing to his count), the fallout from his tweetstorms goes well beyond the browser. His unchecked abuse of the platform authorizes harassment and trolling from the highest levels of our society — revels in it, even. And if the process of removing Trump from office seems unlikely to succeed, let the ongoing attempts to get him kicked off of Twitter show you how it's not done.
Senator, presidential hopeful, and Maya Rudolph impersonator Kamala Harris this week issued a public plea to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to remove Trump from the platform for “blatant threats that put people at risk and our democracy in danger" (and, oh yeah, run afoul of the Terms of Service that we all clicked “Sure, fine, whatever" to).
And Recode founder Kara Swisher wrote a searing op-ed in The New York Times titled “Donald Trump Is Too Dangerous for Twitter," in an attempt to galvanize a growing chorus of exhausted, feed-weary users wondering why, if there is indeed a @Jack, does he allow bad things to happen to good tweeters.
“With this latest move by the troller in chief, with no reaction from Twitter, it's official that the medium has been hijacked by those who want to take advantage of its porous and sloppy rules," Swisher wrote. “It is incumbent on the giant social platforms to prevent the president from dangerously weaponizing their tools."
Twitter's standard defense for allowing Trump to run rampant is the newsworthiness of his tweets; and rather than remove Trump's dangerous posts, the fix is rather to affix a “notice" to his most egregious violations that users must click through before seeing the tweet, offered “to provide additional context and clarity." Sort of like a sign posted inside of a burning house to let you know it's on fire.
It's all part of Twitter's mission to “protect the health of the public conversation," whatever that means. In the meantime, not to bury the lead, but the sky is falling. Is that newsworthy?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump lashed out at the media and Democrats on Wednesday for their descriptions of a whistleblower complaint about Trumps phone call with the president of Ukraine.

At a press scrum in the Oval Office and at a news conference with the Finnish president in the East Room, Trump made many claims that clashed with verifiable facts.

Here are just nine.

This is an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation, taken by very talented stenographers.

This is wrong. The White House released a memorandum of the telephone call in July between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that has become a key focus of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry.

But the document itself contradicts Trumps assertion that it is a word for word transcript of what was said. The document includes a note of caution that it is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.

Heres the full note:

CAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation. The word inaudible is used to indicate portions of a conversation that the notetaker was unable to hear.

The whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but I then found out he was second-hand and third-hand.

This is wrong. The Intelligence Community Inspector General issued a statement that said the whistleblower indicated they had first-hand and second-hand knowledge of the incidents described.

The statement said its staff determined that the Complainant had official and authorized access to the information and sources referenced in the Complainants Letter and Classified Appendix, including direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct.

In other words, he didnt know what was on the call.

This is wrong. The whistleblower report is correct on key details about the call, according to the White House memo about it. While its true that the whistleblower wasnt on the call, the whistleblower complaint said the conversation included an effort to get a foreign country to investigate one of the Presidents main domestic political rivals. The Presidents personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.

The White House description of the call has Trump saying I would like you to do us a favor though. Shortly after that, he said, Theres a lot of talk about Bidens son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.

And Trump also said, Rudy (Giuliani) very much knows whats happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him, that would be great.

Two reporters from the Washington Post wrote a book on Trumps immigration policies.

This is wrong. Trump went on to describe how the Post and its owner  Amazons Jeff Bezos  are corrupt.

But the book hes talking about was written by reporters from the New York Times, not the Washington Post. The book was authored by Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, two reporters for the Times, not the Post. Border Wars: Inside Trumps Assault on Immigration is scheduled to be published Tuesday by Simon & Schuster.

Trump said the new book wrongly claims that he wanted sharp spikes at the top (of his border wall) so if anyone gets it it goes piercing through their skin.

Trump said the book gets wrong details of his discussions about the wall. But on the point of sharp spikes at the top of a wall, Trump himself supported  and tweeted about  such a plan.

Trump approvingly tweeted an image of a proposed barrier fence with spikes on Dec. 21, 2018. The image offered a close-up of three spikes with razor-sharp points.

I heard Rick Scott today say that was a perfect conversation. How can they impeach him on that conversation?

This is wrong. Trump exaggerated what Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said about Trumps phone call with Zelenskiy.

A couple of hours before Trump spoke, Scott was interviewed about the impeachment inquiry on Fox News. He did not say the phone call was perfect, as Trump has described it many times.

When asked on Fox News about how he interpreted the conversation, Scott said: I still dont see what the crime is. I keep saying, show me what the crime is. No one ever says that. They say, Well he shouldnt have done it. Well, all of us would do things differently than other people would do it but if we are going to impeach somebody there ought to be something that they did wrong.

When asked a follow-up question about the part of the phone call when Trump suggested Zelenskiy investigate Trumps potential 2020 opponent, Scott turned the focus on the Bidens, asking, Shouldnt we actually know what happened?

Why are we the only one that gives big money to Ukraine?

This is wrong. Since 2014, the European community has provided Ukraine with $15 billion in aid, including more than $2 billion in grants.

The United States has provided $1.5 billion in military aid, which includes sales of weapon systems. The United States has offered up to $3 billion in loan guarantees, but that uses the guarantee of the United States to give Ukraine a lower rate on loans, it isnt aid itself.

Says Adam Schiff got up and relayed a call that didnt take place. He made up the language  He went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never said.

This is wrong. Schiff, who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, prefaced his congressional testimony last week by saying he was describing the essence of Trumps phone call shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words.

Schiff, as we reported previously, never tried to read the presidents remarks in full. And, importantly, the White House document is not an exact transcript of the call to begin with.

The WTO has been much better to us since I have been president, because they understand they cant get away with what theyve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States.

This is misleading. For decades, the United States, like essentially all countries, has lost most World Trade Organization cases in which it was a defendant. But, like essentially all countries, it has won most cases when it was the complaining party.

Under Trump, there are some indications of an improved (though still losing) U.S. record in cases its defending against. But trade experts told us this has had little to do with Trumps policies. WTO cases often take years to reach a final decision, and Trumps own efforts to block new judges for WTOs appellate body have in fact put the WTOs continued operations at risk.

Below are six book recommendations with reviews by library staff. Call the Black Mountain Library at 250-4765 or visit buncombecounty.org/libraries if you would like to reserve any of these titles.
Fiction "Olive, Again"
by Elizabeth Strout
New York Times best-selling author and Pulitzer Prize winner Elizabeth Strout continues the life of Olive Kitteridge, a character who has captured the imaginations of millions. Prickly, wry, resistant to change yet empathetic and ruthlessly honest, the iconic Olive struggles to understand not only her own life but the lives of those around her in Crosby, Maine. Whether with a teenager coming to terms with the loss of her father, a woman about to give birth during a hilariously inopportune moment, a nurse who confesses a high school crush, or a lawyer who struggles with an unwanted inheritance, the unforgettable Olive will continue to startle us, to move us, and to inspire moments of transcendent grace. Avail. 10/15
If you like this one, try: "Olive Kitteridge" by Elizabeth Strout, "Clock Dance" by Anne Tyler and "Three Junes" by Julia Glass
"The Last Train to London"
by Meg Waite Clayton
Centering on the Kindertransports that carried thousands of children out of Nazi-occupied Europe, "The Last Train to London" follows Truus Wijsmuller, a member of the Dutch resistance who risks her life smuggling Jewish children out of Nazi Germany. After Britain passes a measure to take in child refugees from the German Reich, she dares to approach Adolf Eichmann, the man who would later help devise the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question," in a race against time to bring children on a perilous journey to an uncertain future abroad.
If you like this one, try: "A Daring Escape" by Tricia Goyer, "Far to Go" by Alison Pick, and "The World That We Knew" by Alice Hoffman
Non-Fiction "What We Talk about
When We Talk about Books"
by Leah Price
Reports of the death of reading are greatly exaggerated. In "What We Talk about When We Talk about Books: The History and Future of Reading," Leah Price examines the world's great libraries and finds scant evidence that a golden age of reading ever existed. From the dawn of mass literacy, most readers skimmed and multi-tasked. The evidence that books are dying proves even scarcer. In encounters with librarians, booksellers, and activists who are reinventing old ways of reading, Price offers fresh hope to bibliophiles and literature lovers alike.
"Talking to Strangers"
by Malcolm Gladwell
How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know is an excursion through history, psychology, and scandals and suggests that because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we invite conflict and misunderstanding. In his powerful examination of our interactions with strangers — and why they often go wrong — Gladwell has written a gripping guidebook for troubled times.
Teens "Sweeping Up the Heart"
by Kevin Henkes
From two-time Newbery Honor author Kevin Henkes — Amelia Albright dreams about going to Florida for spring break like everyone else in her middle school. But her father has said no, and now Amelia is stuck at home. But then she meets Casey at her neighborhood art studio; Amelia has never been friends with a boy before, and the experience is fraught and thrilling. When Casey claims to see the spirit of Amelia's late mother, the pair embarks on an altogether different journey in their attempt to find her.
"All Our Broken Pieces"
by L.D. Crichton
Lennon doesn't believe in much, but she does believe in the number five. If she flicks the bedroom light switch five times, maybe her new LA school won't suck. Ten flicks and maybe her new step-family will accept her. Twenty-five and maybe she won't cause any more of her loved ones to die. Kyler witnesses this pattern of lights from his tree house next door, where he fills his notebooks with lyrics that reveal his own true scars. And as Lennon infiltrates his mind, Kyler wants to know the truth about his new muse.

Bringing Mom on a job interview goes too far

Texto completo: In 2001, a graphic designer in New Jersey refused to sign a non-compete agreement required by her employer.
The woman's father, an attorney, had advised her not to sign, and the decision cost her the job. Years of litigation followed, with the state Supreme Court ultimately ruling that the company had justly fired her.
The incident is a worst-case scenario of what can happen when parents meddle in their adult children's careers, said John Sarno, president of the nonprofit Employers Association of New Jersey.
Almost 20 years later, parents are asserting themselves to an even greater degree by sitting in on job interviews, filling in job applications, badgering employers to give their children raises and promotions and — in at least one case — bringing a cake to a child's potential employer, according to a survey by a subsidiary of Robert Half, a global human resource consulting firm.
"Sadly, it's not a new phenomenon," said Dora Onyschak, the New Jersey metro market manager for Robert Half. "Bulldozer parents and helicopter parents are kind of similar in that really they just want what's best for their kid, so they want to try and help them to be as successful as possible. But that can sometimes blind them to the fact that maybe they're being too involved or their involvement can be inappropriate or certainly unprofessional when looking for a job."
"Helicopter parenting" became part of the American lexicon in the early 2000s to describe the practice of hovering over children and monitoring their every move. The behavior has since evolved into that of bulldozer, snowplow or lawnmower parenting — when parents remove obstacles in their children's lives so they never have to face adversity or failure.
Sarno prefers to call them "advocate parents" and traces their rise to increased diagnoses among children of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as intensified competition to gain admittance to good colleges. Both converge to create anxiety-riddled parents who feel obligated to overly protect their children, he said.
"It's really about a parent who has had this identity, this role as the advocate through the public school, often through college, and they can't give up the role when the young adult starts their career," Sarno said. "I really think it's about parents that can't let go."
Part of that reluctance stems from the 2008 financial crisis and changing social attitudes that have delayed typical markers of adulthood, such as marriage and homeownership, said Jacob Goldsmith, director of the emerging adulthood program at Northwestern University's Family Institute. Studies show that unlike more prosperous previous generations, half of children born since 1980 will not out-earn their parents.
"It really scares parents," Goldsmith said. "I think there are a lot of parents looking around and realizing that their kids are not going to make the same money that they did, that their kids are not reaching the milestones they did at the same time, and they don't know what to make of that and they really want to be helpful, so they jump in."
Fourteen percent of U.S. adults surveyed this year by Morning Consult for The New York Times said they had pulled strings in their professional networks to secure a job for their 18- to 28-year-old child. About 11% of respondents said they would contact their adult child's employer if the child had an issue at work. Another 16% said they had written all or part of a job or internship application.
Both Goldsmith and Sarno said parental interference in work matters is rare and not unique to millennials, who have been unfairly maligned by some as lazy or entitled.
Most of the parents with whom Goldsmith works as a therapist exert more subtle control. They will not sit in on job interviews, but they will edit job applications for their children or perform other tasks on their behalf, he said. Instead of teaching, they take action.
"Part of why we as therapists get worried about bulldozer parents is we worry that these kids don't learn the skills they need to do this stuff themselves," Goldsmith said. "I see a lot of emerging adults who struggle to know how to have difficult emotional conversations with their bosses. That's hard; there's no class for that. We often learn that by talking to our parents. But if the parents step in and do it for you, you never learn it."
Children of bulldozer parents often resemble children who have been neglected, he said. Both hit adulthood without a tool kit for dealing with adversity and feel as if they have not accomplished anything on their own.
"What I see, and this is a direct result of helicopter parenting, is kids who hit 25 and they've never hit a major roadblock in their life and they are terrified of failure, paralyzed because they feel like life is only successful if you make no mistakes," Goldsmith said. "Kids that were helicopter-parented in many ways look like the kids who never had opportunities ... because they're never really doing it themselves."
Most hiring managers are put off by candidates with meddling parents, Onyschak said.
"As an employer, do I then become concerned about the candidate's ability to think independently? Do I worry then that they perhaps are not good decision makers?" she said. "It questions their level of independence and maturity, and you don't want that to be the reason the person does or does not get the job."
Still, employers like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn have embraced the close relationship between new hires and their parents, launching "Take Your Parents to Work" days to give parents a glimpse of their children's work lives.
Onyschak said she supports parents who provide more hands-off guidance: helping their children practice job interviews, helping them weigh the pros and cons of multiple job offers, looking over cover letters and résumés. But the oversight should stop there, she said.
"We're not hiring the parent, we're hiring the individual, so we want candidates who can think for themselves, who are assertive, who can ask their own questions," Onyschak said.
For parents feeling the urge to become more heavily involved, Goldsmith recommends taking a step back and asking themselves if they are facilitating — or enabling.
"When you've got a parent who's really tuned in and providing good support and facilitating growth, that kid's going to fly to the moon," he said. "But when you have a parent who responds to anxiety by stepping in and trying to run the kid's life — even if it's not as egregious as showing up at a job interview — you still end up with a kid who doesn't really trust the tools they have to be in the world."

7 p.m. Thursday. Port City Music Hall, Portland, $7 at the door, 18-plus. portcitymusichall.com
The PechaKucha presentation format, created in Japan in 2003, means that each person shows 20 images and speaks about each one for 20 seconds. "I Am Other: PechaKucha Night Portland" will feature stories that speak of transforming negative experiences into positive ones, and you'll hear from several local speakers including Caleb Dunlap ("See Things Differently") and Ollie McGowan (Trans to Power") all of whom will leave you feeling inspired and empowered.
McQueen
Doors at 7:30 p.m. Friday. Empire, 575 Congress St., Portland, $7 in advance, $10 day of show, 21-plus. portlandempire.com
Comedian McQueen is known for being the creator of the Comedy Central digital series "Heads Will Roll" and for his work with the website Funny or Die. He's toured extensively from coast to coast and his live show was described by The New York Times as a "dynamic, high-tech blend of music, impressions and stand-up." McQueen will perform tracks from his off-the-wall debut "Black Cat," complete with original visuals that will take you on a wacky, weird and certainly funny trip rife with pop culture references, as the strange world inside his head is brought to life. In other words, this is not your average comedy show. Local funnyman Connor McGrath will get you warmed up, then it's off to the offbeat world of McQueen.

Texto completo: In his new book, the photographer reveals the essence of important buildings. In conversation, he has a few unvarnished things to say about some of them.
Of all contemporary photographers, none has so rigorously explored the nature of his medium as Hiroshi Sugimoto. Since the mid-1970s, and working exclusively in black and white, he has devoted series of images to natural history dioramas, the interiors of movie palaces lighted only by their uncanny glowing screens and the historic personages of Madame Tussauds wax museum.
His photographs have stretched and reshaped the concepts of time, space and light endemic to the medium, and in the process they have altered our grasp of history, visual perception and existence itself. He has anointed fossils "the pre-photography time-recording device" and called photography "a process of making fossils out of the present."
About two decades ago, Mr. Sugimoto turned to photographing iconic, mostly modernist buildings (the exception: the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and two years ago inaugurated a building of his own design, his idiosyncratic Odawara Art Foundation Enoura Observatory perched above Sagami Bay in eastern Japan. This month brings the publication of "Hiroshi Sugimoto: Architecture," many of whose 100 images have never been published before, including two of the Enoura Observatory.
Roberta Smith, co-chief art critic of The New York Times, sat down with the artist to discuss the new publication, museum architecture and another Sugimoto book that has yet to appear in English. The interview has been condensed and edited.
How did you start photographing buildings?
I was first commissioned by MOCA in Los Angeles, for their survey of 20th century architecture. I don't accept commissions but in this case, I thought, wow, it might be interesting, if it gives me the challenge of visiting the icons of 20th century architecture.
I was already very interested in architecture.
Your photographs of buildings are deliberately blurred, which reduces the architecture to a kind of essence, a geometric form without finishing or details.
Losing all the details brings back the fundamental concept. I'm trying to bring it back to the original vision of the architect.
When it is in a purer state. You've written that "a building is the result of an ideal making a compromise with reality."
Yes.
I'm interested that the captions in the new book don't give the reader a lot of information about the buildings.
Just a name.
The name of the building, but not who designed it, when or where.
So it's for the most professional people.
Well, not everybody knows everything. I know quite a few of them, but had to Google others. The Italian buildings from the '30s I didn't know.
I see. Just the name of the building. No location.
That says something about how you want them perceived. We're supposed to experience the image on its own.
Right.
This looking at so much architecture seems to have led you to ask yourself, "What would I do if I were an architect?"
Yeah, sometimes I thought if I were this architect, I wouldn't have done this.
You would have changed that.
Right. This is a mistake or failure. So several years ago I made this book in Japanese as a report criticizing the design of museums.
I know. I read about this book online and my first thought was: When is it going to be translated into English?
I never thought of translating it into English. It's mostly for the Japanese market. I was kind of free to say whatever I said. I have this rating page; each museum has a short explanation and up to five stars.
So a lot of people think that, in the United States, the best museum, or one of the very best museums, is the Menil in Houston. Have you seen that one?
Houston. Yes, yes. That's beautiful. The light from the ceiling is very nicely diffused but I never had a show there. The book only covers all the museums that have given me a one-man show.
Hands-on experience.
I was really into each building. And I suffered a lot. This is a consumer report. A user's manual.
Well, I'm begging you to translate it into English.
It was published like six, seven years ago, so now I have more museums to criticize.
Better still, an expanded English edition. I read that you ranked Peter Zumthor's Kunsthaus Bregenz as the best.
He designed a space to make art look its best, which is quite unusual for an architect.
Here's another 5-star.
Renzo Piano's Hermès building in Ginza
It looks like Pierre Chareau's Maison de Verre, your photographs of which appear in the new book for the first time. Piano has done some pretty good museums. Have you photographed the new Whitney?
No. This was before the Whitney.
Right. Have you seen it?
Yeah, yeah.
What do you think?
It's a storage area. It's not a gallery. It brings people into the storage.
You should really publish this in English. You're very opinionated. You once wrote that art today is "stilling into a breezeless lull."
The worst museum in my consumer report is one César Pelli designed, the National Museum of Art in Osaka. Such a bad building.
What did you think of the César Pelli Museum of Modern Art?
In New York?
The 1984 expansion. That's when they had escalators across the big windows in the lobby overlooking the garden, diagonally. I mean, hello?
I attended the opening and was amazed. It was like a shopping mall.
I know.
And the beautiful original MoMA, with -- I still remember when I went there, like in the early '70s. The beautiful staircase --
It went up two levels.
And then "Guernica" was there at the top.
And the galleries had linoleum floors. Remember that? It was very humble and unpretentious.
Right. I photographed that Bauhaus staircase.
It's in the new book opposite your photograph of the Taniguchi staircase in the lobby of MoMA's 2004 redesign.
Right.
So did you like the Taniguchi better?
Taniguchi, no, no, no. I liked the original one better. The Taniguchi staircase is O.K. But compared to this, it's --
They've restored the second flight of the Bauhaus staircase. So you can go all the way up to the third floor again. No "Guernica" of course, but it's a big improvement.
Oh yeah? Oh, I didn't know that.

Texto completo: Stay up to date with email updates about WNYC and ProPublica’s investigations into the president’s business practices.
In the past two weeks, we’ve heard a lot about efforts by President Donald Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to push officials in Ukraine to investigate Trump’s opponents. As the news has unfolded, it has introduced us to a litany of unfamiliar characters in both Ukraine and the U.S., many of whom were working with Giuliani or, in some fashion, on behalf of the president.
Our “Trump, Inc.” colleague Ilya Marritz was in Kyiv, Ukraine, last week following the trail of Giuliani in an effort to understand more about these obscure figures who have suddenly become so important. (Yes, Ilya went there. Listen to our episode.)
Listen to the Episode
One thing that became clear during his travels: Giuliani’s “anti-corruption” efforts involved working with men who have their own questionable histories.
We reached out to Giuliani as well as the White House. We have not heard back.
Here is a rundown of key players in Giuliani’s efforts.
The Former Prosecutor Fired for Not Going After Corruption…
Viktor Shokin was Ukraine’s general prosecutor in 2015, a position akin to attorney general. He was responsible for investigating corruption. But according to U.S. officials, NGOs and the International Monetary Fund, he was not actually doing this.
Giuliani has claimed that then-Vice President Joe Biden improperly pushed for Shokin’s removal to avoid an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence that is true.

According to the now-famous whistleblower’s report, Shokin spoke with Giuliani over Skype late last year in a call arranged by two Giuliani associates. (More on them in a moment.)
In response to our questions, Shokin declined comment, explaining that he’s out of the country.
The Former Prosecutor Who Was Not a Lawyer…
Yuriy Lutsenko took over the job of prosecutor general from Shokin in 2016. He got the job after allies in Parliament changed the law to allow the position to be filled by someone without a law degree. Lutsenko has no legal training.
Lutsenko once told a reporter that the U.S. ambassador had given him “a list of people whom we should not prosecute.” He later acknowledged that he was the one who asked for such a list.

Lutsenko has said he’s spoken with Giuliani “maybe 10 times.” In the middle of one meeting in New York last January in which Giuliani and Lutsenko talked about investigating the Bidens, Giuliani reportedly called Trump to loop him in.
In the spring, Lutsenko told a reporter he “would be happy to have a conversation” about Hunter Biden with Attorney General William Barr. Then, last week, he told the Los Angeles Times that he hadn’t found any evidence against the Bidens and said he had told Giuliani that any investigation should be conducted “through prosecutors, not through presidents.”
In response to our questions, Lutsenko denied any wrongdoing. He was fired earlier this year.
The Current Prosecutor Caught on Tape…
Nazar Kholodnytsky is now Ukraine’s top anti-corruption prosecutor. Audio tapes captured Kholodnytsky in unrelated cases coaching a witness to give false testimony and tipping off suspects to police raids. Kholodnytsky acknowledged the tapes were authentic, but said they were taken out of context.
Earlier this year, the U.S.’s then-ambassador to Ukraine called for Kholodnytsky’s firing. She explained , “Nobody who has been recorded coaching suspects on how to avoid corruption charges can be trusted to prosecute those very same cases.” (The ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, was removed from her position shortly after.)

Kholodnytsky and Giuliani met in Paris in May 2019. Kholodnytsky told The Washington Post the discussion was private, “prosecutor to a former prosecutor.” Kholodnytsky told the Post that he had questions about the Bidens as well as the prosecution of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort.
When the Post asked Giuliani about the meeting, he said, “I’m not going to tell you about that.”
Kholodnytsky told us he was too busy to answer our questions.
Giuliani’s Special Envoys…
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are two Ukrainian-American businessmen who have worked with Giuliani and introduced him to the Ukrainian prosecutors. Giuliani has described them as his clients. They went to Ukraine after Giuliani canceled a trip in the wake of a New York Times article that revealed his travel plans.
In a detailed story about their work with Giuliani, Parnas told Buzzfeed they did nothing wrong. “All we were doing was passing along information,” Parnas said. He added, “We’re American citizens, we love our country, we love our president.”
Parnas was sued for allegedly defrauding investors in a movie he was involved with, “Anatomy of an Assassin.”
“He conned us from day one,” one of the investors told the Miami Herald, adding, “He financially ruined us.” Parnas lost the case but has denied wrongdoing. “The truth is going to come out about that judgment,” he has said.

Fruman is well-connected in Ukraine, where he owns a number of businesses, including Mafia Rave, a beach club in Odessa. Fruman and Parnas have been political contributors in the U.S. Last year, they set up a Delaware LLC that weeks later contributed $325,000 to a Trump-allied political group.
Giuliani was subpoenaed by Congress this week regarding his communications with Parnas and Fruman.
Parnas and Fruman did not respond to our requests for comment.

Thomas L. Friedman: How to impeach Trump, do justice and win an election

Texto completo: I’m going to discuss impeachment today, but first I want to talk about the National Symphony Orchestra’s opening concert and gala last Saturday night. It was very revealing.
At mid-concert, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, David M. Rubinstein, came out to greet the audience and the VIPs. He welcomed the different ambassadors, then he went through the Cabinet members present and then the Supreme Court justices. He introduced Justice Samuel Alito, who got a smattering of applause. Then he introduced Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the balcony. First many women in the audience stood up to applaud. And then everyone stood up. And then everyone applauded. And then everyone applauded more. And then some people cheered. And then some whistled. And it went on and on and on.
It was extraordinary. I’ve been to a lot of Kennedy Center concerts, and a few when the president, sitting in his official box, was introduced. But I’ve never witnessed anything like the reception for Justice Ginsburg. And this was not a totally liberal audience. There were many older GOP donors and corporate types there. This was a spontaneous, bipartisan expression of respect for, and longing for, a national leader of integrity and humility — after three years of a president utterly without shame, for whom no ethical red line has been too red to cross.
There is still a civic pulse in this country. Some Americans still support President Donald Trump, but far, far more are exhausted and disgusted by him. And that is why his latest outrage is so dangerous to him. He knows that we know that many Republicans know that he committed an impeachable offense. And it’s all out there now: a whistleblower complaint filed by a CIA officer detailing how Trump dangled military assistance in front of the president of Ukraine if he would do Trump a “favor” and investigate bogus corruption charges against Joe Biden.
I believe that this not only could warrant Trump’s impeachment but that it could be done without plunging the country into “civil war” or guaranteeing Trump’s reelection — provided Democrats keep stressing four things.
First, this charge against Trump began with an independent whistleblower — an intelligence officer, aided by other insiders. Sure, it could turn out that he was a Hillary Clinton fan, which Trump would use to rile up his base, claiming that Democrats were trying to steal his election mandate. But if this turns out to be what it appears — a nonpolitical CIA analyst and other civil servants motivated by their oath to uphold the Constitution in the face of a president who was violating his oath — then Trump and the Republicans will have a problem.
Democrats in Congress need to make sure they say and do nothing that gets in the middle of this framing of the story, which, for now, appears to be accurate: nonpolitical civil servants inside the government acting on conscience against a lawbreaking president acting on political greed and excess.
That so many GOP senators have kept quiet up to now — save for uber-sycophants like Lindsey Graham — suggests that they fear that this framing is accurate and it stinks to them.
Second, there almost surely will be another nonpolitical, high-integrity civil servant who will testify about Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. That’s Masha Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who was abruptly yanked home in May, months before her assignment was up. My State Department friends who know Yovanovitch say she was a widely respected, professional diplomat. She was apparently removed because she was somehow resisting Giuliani’s efforts to enlist the Ukraine government in Trump’s sordid effort to take down Biden.
Again, how eager will Republicans be to defend Giuliani and Trump by trashing a U.S. ambassador — with a stellar record — who was trying to prevent foreign interference in our elections?
Unlike Robert Mueller, who never spoke until it was too late and had his work “interpreted” by Trump’s attorney general, Bill Barr, the whistleblower and his allies and the former ambassador are — and will be — speaking for themselves.
Third, unlike the Mueller investigation, this case is very easy for people to understand: Trump called the new Ukrainian president, who was desperate for U.S. military aid to use against Russian aggression, and made him an offer he couldn’t refuse: guns for Biden.
Finally, I have no doubt that Trump’s base will stick by him. But they are not the important constituency today, because Trump needs more than his base to get reelected. He needs the moderate Republicans, independents and suburban women who came his way in 2016 — but then abandoned him in 2018, enabling the Democrats to retake the House. What will they do in 2020?
I believe that more than a few will be thinking about a question that will hang over all the impeachment testimony about Trump’s actions in Ukraine: If this is how he behaved while constrained by reelection concerns, how will Trump behave if he gets reelected — despite this wretched behavior — and no longer needs to worry about reelection? America will become a banana republic.
It’s for all these reasons that Democrats have to be so disciplined in how they prosecute this case. They need to have a single spokesman, Rep. Adam Schiff, and everyone else needs to keep quiet. They need to have professional prosecutors, not uninformed legislators, question witnesses; they need to keep the focus on the nonpolitical witnesses; and they need to have their presidential candidates stay out of this impeachment story and concentrate on their ideas for reviving and reuniting America.
Impeaching Trump right now on the eve of the next presidential election is very inconvenient. But doing the right thing is often inconvenient and unpopular — and doing it precisely when it’s inconvenient often indicates that it’s the right thing to do. But you have to do the right thing for the right reasons the right way.
Democrats should pursue impeachment in the House as if there were no election in 2020. And they should pursue the 2020 election as if there were no impeachment.
And they should do it by letting the nonpolitical whistleblower and the other civil servants take the lead. These humble patriots started this, and it will go only as far as their credibility sustains it. And it’s their credibility that will influence the swing voters that brought Democrats the House in 2018 — those independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women — a few of whom, I suspect, were at the Kennedy Center last Saturday night, giving a standing ovation to Justice Ginsburg.

Texto completo: El representante demócrata Adam Schiff, jefe del Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara Baja y ahora responsable del impeachment a Donald Trump, supo de la llamada del presidente a su homólogo ucraniano días antes de que el escándalo se hiciera público.
La persona que dio a conocer el asunto que ha echado a andar la maquinaria del juicio político al mandatario estadounidense se puso primero en contacto con un asistente de Schiff , que le pasó la información al demócrata.
Según The New York Times, un portavoz y funcionarios y exfuncionarios estadounidenses aseguraron que el denunciante habló con este miembro del equipo de Schiff para trasladarle cómo se habían manejado sus acusaciones cuando un compañero se las hizo llegar al principal abogado de la CIA. El asesor de Schiff le sugirió al denunciante que rellenara una queja formal , de acuerdo al diario neoyorquino.
En un comunicado, Patrick Boland, portavoz del Comité de Inteligencia y del propio Schiff, dijo que el denunciante contactó con ellos para obtener información sobre cómo informar posibles irregularidades dentro de su jurisdicción . “El comité aconsejó convenientemente al denunciante que contactara con un Inspector General y que buscara asesoría legal”, explicó Boland. Según aseguró, el comité no recibió ni revisó la queda de antemano.
El portavoz del equipo de Schiff, que dejó las puertas abiertas para todos las personas que quieran recibir asesoría sobre actos de dudosa moralidad, “espera completa protección para (el informante), a pesar de las amenazas del presidente “. “Solo gracias a su coraje -continuaba el comunicado- estos actos de abuso de poder del presidente salieron a la luz”.

Texto completo: Thanks to geography, Ukraine lies on the fault line between east and west. Now, it finds itself at the center of an American political battle over impeachment.
Events over the past two decades set the table for the conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that triggered an impeachment inquiry. They don’t add up to a tidy picture of historic inevitability, but they do show how Ukraine and the United States got to this place.
A quick history
Ukraine was one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union in 1922, subject to decisions in Moscow, but the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left Ukraine with an economic landscape ripe for control by oligarchs and ambiguous relations with east and west. That has done much to shape United States-Ukraine relations since.
Americans tuned in to Ukraine again in 2004, when it had its Orange Revolution. A popular backlash thwarted an effort to install the departing president’s hand-chosen successor Viktor Yanukovych. It wasn’t just the poisoning of Yanukovych’s opponent, Viktor Yushchenko, that rocked Ukrainian politics. It was the eruption of anger over widespread government corruption.
Yanukovych was defeated in 2004, but he took the presidency six years later, bringing an advisor who worked with his Party of Regions along: Paul Manafort, the future Trump campaign manager.
Political tumult and war in 2014
Ukraine’s balancing act between east and west broke down when Yanukovych first said he would sign a major economic agreement with the European Union, and then abruptly backed out. After months of protest and a violent crackdown, Yanukovych was forced out and fled to Russia.
Russia responded to Yanukovych’s overthrow by sending special forces into Crimea and triggering the annexation of the semi-autonomous region — Ukrainian territory since 1954 but with many ethnic Russians living there. Russia then fueled open warfare between separatists and the Ukrainian government in eastern Ukraine.
As a hot war developed in the east, a Ukrainian energy company put Hunter Biden, the vice president’s son, on its board of directors. The oligarch behind the firm, Mykola Zlochevsky, faced money laundering charges in Britain. Adding the younger Biden gave the impression that the firm had powerful American backers.
Europe moved to bolster the western-leaning government with billions in loans and grants. But along with the aid came pressure to root out corruption.
That anti-corruption policy led to the moment in 2015 when Vice President Joe Biden threatened Ukraine with the loss of $1 billion in aid if a lackluster prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, wasn’t replaced. Trump has since recast that, without evidence, as Biden protecting his son’s business interests.
The continuing fighting in eastern Ukraine posed another problem. For both military and political reasons, Ukraine wanted weapons from the west. Europe, and initially the United States, too, held back.
In the last year of the Obama administration, Congress authorized lethal aid. By the second year under Trump, the Defense Department had signed off on two deals, one to sell Ukraine $47 million in anti-tank missiles. In 2018, Congress approved another $250 million in military assistance. The State Department had an additional $141 million available.
The threads come together
In 2016, Manafort lost his job running Trump’s campaign after reports surfaced of under-the-table payments for his work in Ukraine. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation convinced a jury in August 2018 to send Manafort to prison for tax fraud involving millions of dollars.
Before the conviction, in March 2018, the Pentagon anti-tank missile sale went through. Soon after, Ukraine hit pause on its investigation of Manafort. “We shouldn’t spoil relations with the (Trump) administration,” a top adviser to Ukraine’s president told the New York Times.
Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was his man in Ukraine, looking for dirt on Biden. Separately, Giuliani had several large security service contracts in the country, including the national government.
The money Congress appropriated in 2018 took on a new importance. Before Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Zelensky, he had put nearly $400 million in aid on hold. Early in the call, Zelensky told Trump that Ukraine was eager to buy another round of missiles.
But Hunter Biden was on Trump’s mind. Trump linked Biden’s board seat to the vice president pushing for the removal of the Ukrainian prosecutor.
He said “a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” according to a White House summary of the conversation.
By mid August, an anonymous whistleblower had reported the exchange to the inspector general for the intelligence community. In September, the Trump administration released the $250 million in military aid.
On Sept. 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed the American people and announced that an impeachment inquiry was underway.

Texto completo: Rutgers University athletics director Pat Hobbs says for the next two months he'll oversee the search for a replacement for fired football head coach Chris Ash. Nunzio Campanile is the interim head coach for now.
Speculation is rampant that former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano will be a front-runner. Schiano went 68-67 in his 12 seasons here (before the school joined the Big Ten), including a stretch from 2005-11 where the Scarlet Knights were 56-33 with six bowl appearances.
In 2006, Rutgers was 11-2 with a win over No. 3 Louisville, a week spent inside the AP Top 10, and a school-record No. 12 finish in the AP poll.
So will Schiano return? Here's what you need to know:
Schiano is not a front-runner... yet
When asked on Monday, Hobbs did not directly reference Schiano but also did not rule out the possibility that the former coach is in the mix.
"Anybody who can help Rutgers football be competitive and win conference championships is a candidate for this position," Hobbs said.
Despite speculation that Schiano could be a favorite for the job, Hobbs said he has not spoken to or met with any potential candidates yet.
"No, and I'll repeat that because I know there's been reports out there of agreements and other things," Hobbs said. "I have had no conversations with anyone about the permanent position of being the head football coach at Rutgers University."
The Tennessee controversy
The University of Tennessee planned to hire Schiano as its new head coach in 2017, but school officials changed their minds after many Vols' fans, donors and politicians balked at the hire. Their complaints stemmed from Schiano's background as an assistant at Penn State during Jerry Sandusky's tenure as the Nittany Lions' defensive coordinator. Sandusky is serving 30 to 60 years in prison for his conviction on 45 counts of sexual abuse. Schiano has said he had no knowledge of Sandusky's crimes. Tennessee school officials said they fully vetted Schiano, including examining his time at Penn State.
The Schiano file
Schiano left Rutgers for a job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2012 for his first-ever head coaching job at the professional level. He compiled a 11-21 record in two seasons before being fired in 2013.
He then coached two years at Berkeley Prep in Tampa before Urban Meyer hired him to be Ohio State's defensive coordinator and associate head coach in 2016.
Right now, he's not coaching
After three years with the Buckeyes, it was announced in early 2019 that Schiano would not be returning to the team. Reports suggested that the New England Patriots were hiring Schiano to be defensive coordinator, but he suddenly resigned due to his wishes to spend more time with his "faith and family."
Would a Schiano return mean The Chop is coming back?
The Rutgers football team's rallying cry was "Keep Chopping" during the Schiano tenure (Ash did away with the mantra. replacing it with "The Hunt"). Schiano started the craze after the 2005 opening game, when Rutgers blew a 20-point lead at Illinois and he had no idea what to say, according to the New York Times. Schiano gathered his players in a meeting room and recalled the words of a sports psychologist he once met at the University of Miami who told the team that playing football was like chopping wood. It caught on: It was not uncommon for a player to refer to a game as a "60-minute chop" and explain a big hit by saying, "I got my chop on."

Truths in Ancient Vineyards

Texto completo: All over the world, treasures for wine lovers have been hiding in plain sight, unnoticed or unimagined.
They are old vineyards, planted decades or even centuries ago.
I've seen them myself in Spain and Portugal, France and Italy, Argentina and California, even in Mexico. The survivors are often out of the way, sometimes on steep, rocky slopes that make your legs quiver and your back ache just to look at them.
For so many years, these rare gems were known only to those who worked them. They were labors of tradition, and therefore of love, cherished links to parents and grandparents and ways of living in small communities that may now seem archaic.
The grapes were used in the spirit in which the vines had been planted, to meet local or personal needs. Perhaps they were sold to cooperatives, where they were destined for anonymous blends, or maybe they were used for the owner's own wine, made for personal consumption or sold regionally.
It would be sacrilege to say that these vineyards were ignored. But their potential was understood only in a narrow context in which the wine you drank, like the food you ate or the family with whom you lived, was both revered and taken for granted.
One of the most intriguing stories in wine over the last 40 years has been the fate of these vineyards. Many have already disappeared as developers snapped up the land, or big wine companies replaced the old vines with new plantings that were deemed more profitable.
But others have been saved by the efforts of imaginative younger winemakers who understood the value of these old vines, both as cultural icons and as raw materials. They would use these grapes to make fine wines that could be sold half a world away in a globalized economy that could never have been foreseen by those who originally planted the vineyards.
Here at Wine School, we believe that wine is almost never just about what's in the glass. The drinking experience is crucial, of course. If a wine is boring, it's hard to summon interest in where it comes from and what it might represent. Sometimes, wine may represent nothing beyond its production and the economic rationale for its inception.
Wines that are part of cultural traditions are another matter entirely. Where they come from, and what and whom they represent, are central to understanding them fully. Yes, they can be enjoyed simply for the sensual pleasures they provide. But they can offer much more.
At Wine School, we think that consumers must decide for themselves how much of a priority wine will be, and how much effort they are willing to expend, both in acquiring wines and in understanding them. We also believe that the joy and pleasure wine can provide is a reward that goes far beyond the labor extended.
Each month, I select a particular wine and suggest three good examples for you to drink and think about. For the last few weeks we have been focusing on cinsaults from the Itata Valley region of Chile. Here are the three wines I recommended:
Rogue Vine Itata Valley Grand Itata Tinto 2016; A Los Viñateros Bravos Itata Valley Granítico Cinsault 2016 and Pedro Parra y Familia Secano Interior Itata Pencopolitano 2017.
These wines are by no means typical of the fruity Chilean reds the world has come to know, nor are they meant to be. Even as intrepid growers are exploring new territories, some at inconceivably high altitudes in the foothills of the Andes, most Chilean wines still come from the Central Valley, comprising a series of smaller valleys south of the capital city, Santiago.
Excellent wines have been made there, no doubt, but most of the effort from the big companies that dominate Chile's wine industry has gone into pleasant, reliable wines from relatively familiar grapes.
South of the Central Valley and closer to the city of Concepción, however, are regions like Itata Valley and Bío Bío, where wine has been made for generations almost entirely for local consumption. Here are the old vineyard treasures, generally composed of grapes that wine authorities of previous generations deemed ignoble, like país, known in English as mission, carignan, muscat and cinsault.
These are grapes that came centuries ago with European missionaries, and have been part of the local tradition ever since, planted in cold, wet coastal areas or on foothills in the interior. These old vineyards were planted without modern wire trellising and tended without irrigation. Instead, the vines were trained into upright, goblet shapes, known in French as gobelet and in English as bush vines.
These old bush-vine vineyards, especially those planted in granite soils, are the cherished objects of desire of a new generation of wine producers like Leonardo Erazo, a partner in both Rogue and Bravos, and Pedro Parra, a Chilean geologist who consults with winemakers all over the world, but has a special affinity for the potentially great terroirs of his home territory.
These grapes historically went into bulk wines, or were used for pipeño -- fresh, rustic wines that were consumed locally. Now, this heritage is traveling the world in wines like the three bottles I recommended.
The Granítico from A Los Viñateros Bravos comes from vineyards in the Guarilihue Alto area, where the grapes, as the label suggests, are grown on granite soils.
The wine was fresh and lively, with aromas of dark fruit and a spicy herbal quality bordering on anise. It was gently tannic, with a mild, refreshing bitterness. Altogether it felt almost weightless, yet with an undeniable concentration to it.
Unlike the Granítico, which was 100 percent cinsault, the Rogue Vine included 5 percent país with the cinsault, all from the Tinajacura area. It was fascinating to compare this wine with the Granítico.
I found it a little finer, with flavors that lasted a little longer on the palate. The dark fruit aromas were similar, but the herbal quality seemed closer to chocolate than anise, and it had a similar touch of bitterness. I thought it was lovely, fresh and graceful.
The Parra wine was somewhat different. For one thing, it was a year younger, and for another it was just 67 percent cinsault and the rest país. It was more floral and herbal than the other two, with a spicy cinnamon flavor, yet similarly fine and lightly tannic.
All told, these wines all were light and fresh in style. They showed a sort of -- I don't want to call it transparency, maybe a translucence, in which glimpses of a place can be sensed, but the full cultural importance of these wines cannot.
That may partly be because these wines are relatively new, made by young producers who are still getting to know the vineyards and their capabilities. But it is also because when you make a wine with the intent of selling it around the world, some of the local flavor is inevitably going to be lost.
Is it a fair trade-off? Once, when visiting an agricultural cooperative in northern Italy, I was charmed by an Alpine cheese I had never had before. I wondered aloud if I could find it in New York.
"Why do you assume you have the right to have that cheese in New York?" my host asked. Ever since, I've heard her voice in my head. Distance changes foods that are alive, like cheese and wine. Not only might they be prepared differently to withstand voyages, but they are also consumed out of their native context.
To the "all that counts is what's in the glass" crowd, this may not mean much. But I think knowing what is lost deepens the understanding of what remains in these wines. It also helps to better comprehend the skill and intent of the producers, whose respect for the heritage these wines represent colors their efforts, when they could just as easily simply exploit a resource.
Fewer people commented on these wines than ordinarily. Perhaps they were hard to find. But those that took the trouble seemed to like them.
"They seem to have been made by a person, not a corporation," Peter in Philadelphia said.
Ferguson in Princeton, N.J., tried A Los Viñateros Bravos and likened the wine to Goldilocks: "Not too acidic, not too many tannins, not too heavy, not too sweet, just right."
For the farmers who nurtured these fields for centuries, the notion that people in North America, Europe and beyond are enjoying the fruits of their vineyards may indeed seem like a fairy tale. For all concerned, that's a happy ending.

Texto completo: First, let people buy some types of devices over the counter.
At this point, over a year later, I can't remember if I asked Senator Elizabeth Warren about the Spock ears, or what.
She had called me on the phone at my house in Maine. This was a couple of months after I had devoted one of my Times columns to hearing aids. I had lamented a number of things in that essay, especially the cultural stigma associated with the devices. Cool glasses? You're Elton John. Hearing aids? You're a little old lady.
It was my argument that hearing aids should be more stylish -- provocative, even. If hearing aids came in the form of, say, pointy Spock ears, or lit up with crazy colors, wouldn't you try them out? Maybe once?
But the senator didn't want to talk about Spock ears. She wanted to talk about the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, which she had co-sponsored. After its passage in 2017, it headed over to the Food and Drug Administration for guidelines on how it should be carried out.
The F.D.A. is expected to issue those guidelines shortly, possibly as early as January. When it does, the world will change for millions of Americans with hearing loss.
The act reclassifies a whole category of hearing assistance devices so that people can buy them at a retail store, without have to go through an examination by an audiologist. Many of these devices, called personal sound amplification products, PSAP for short, are available already; they're just not marketed as hearing aids. With the new law, such a device can be billed as a hearing aid, if it meets F.D.A. standards.
The hope is that the act will make these devices more widely available -- that people who have been reluctant to contact a doctor about their hearing may feel more comfortable simply picking up a device at a Walmart.
PSAPs are not for everyone. They are designed for individuals with mild to moderate hearing loss. Still, that's a lot of people. Researchers at Johns Hopkins estimate that 25 million Americans have mild hearing loss, meaning they struggle to hear speech in many situations, not just noisy restaurants. Ten million more experience moderate loss -- they are unable to follow a conversation without directly observing the speakers.
If your hearing loss is severe, or profound, these over-the-counter devices won't do you much good. People who have lost, or never had, the ability to hear sounds quieter than conversational speech require devices more complex than these (as do many people with less severe loss). A good comparison is reading glasses: If your vision is impaired, you should see a doctor; if you just need a pair of readers, you can pick them up at the drugstore.
PSAPs, which join a broad category of devices that include so-called hearables, can also cancel out unwanted noise, stream music, even translate a foreign language into English. Through Bluetooth, I can use my hearing aids to talk on the phone. In addition to these, I own Hearphones, manufactured by Bose. When I ride the subway in New York, I use the noise-canceling feature in the Hearphones to silence the world around me. At the same moment, I can stream music from my iPhone into my head.
There I am, sitting on the 1 train downtown, hearing no sound except the soft music of one of Chopin's nocturnes for piano.
The Hearphones are also very helpful at a party or a restaurant, where an app on my phone enables me to silence the conversations of people behind me, and amplify just the voice of the person I'm with.
There are more than a few reservations about the new over-the-counter hearing aids, though. Some of these come from audiologists, whose business will surely be affected by the act. Taking audiologists out of the process raises the possibility that people won't get the device appropriate to their needs. In the long run, a hearing aid that doesn't work or fit can be worse than nothing. And medical conditions that require intervention might well be missed without a professional exam.
But in general, over-the-counter devices will make good hearing available to millions of people. The average cost of hearing aids in this country is $ 4,600 a pair. The nonprescription devices won't be free, but they'll be cheaper -- some for sale right now cost $ 300 to $ 350. My Hearphones cost $ 500.
The real problem is that in many cases, hearing devices are not covered by insurance. And even at $ 300, they will be expensive enough to keep many people from getting help. I'll allow someone to my right to explain why the ability to hear shouldn't be covered by all Americans' insurance.
Why doesn't Medicare cover hearing aids? Why do so many private insurers fail to do so? I understand the need to keep overall costs down, but something's wrong when something as basic as hearing the world is considered one of those luxuries conservatives mock as "free stuff."
The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act isn't the cure to the inequities of coverage, but it's a start. Perhaps the next president will spend as much time trying to help all Americans hear better as the current one has spent trying to buy Greenland.
I don't know if that president will be Elizabeth Warren. But I do know that she sponsored a bill that will make the world better for people like me. It's worth noting that her co-sponsor was Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa. If Senator Warren wins, I'm sure she'll face plenty of partisan resistance to her many plans. But the new act is proof that she can reach across the aisle in order to get things done.
A president who might make our lives better, instead of worse? A woman who has the ability to pass bipartisan legislation?
Say this in your Spock voice: "Fascinating."

Texto completo: Booked tonight for the latest chapter of the Champaign Public Library's 'Great Authors' series: New York Times best-seller and pooch lover LISA SCOTTOLINE, author of a series of humorous memoirs (including 'Why My Third Husband Will Be a Dog') and 32 novels.

The latter is what brings the Pennsylvanian and one-time lawyer to town -- she'll talk from 7 to 8 p.m. about her latest legal thriller and give away copies of 'Someone Knows' to the first 350 people through the doors, which open at 6:30.

On the eve of her visit, Scottoline shared with Editor Jeff D'Alessio a few of her favorite things.

* Favorite book as a kid: "Anything with Nancy Drew and the roadster. Nancy has it all -- a girlfriend, a boyfriend and a great car. Actually, these days, I'm jealous."

* Favorite tactic for curing writer's block: "Having bills to pay."

* Favorite library or bookstore: "All libraries and bookstores are my favorite. As between libraries and bookstores, that's like choosing between Bradley Cooper and Bradley Cooper. Basically, I prefer Bradley Cooper."

* Favorite writing setting: "Where I'm sitting right now, which is in a little small room I have right off my garden, so when I get stuck on a section of the novel, I can go out and weed. And anybody who gardens knows that weeding is fun for about 15 minutes, in which case I'm driven to go back and write, having no easier alternative."

* Favorite literary villain: "The ones that I think up in every book. Quite frankly, I like characters in which the hero is a little bit of their own villain, because that's a lot like my life. No obstacles have ever been so great as the ones I put in my own path."

* Favorite piece of advice for young writers: "Just do it, in the words of the immortal Nike. So much of writing is behavioral, and everybody has a story in them. I firmly believe that."

* Favorite writing instruments: "A computer and a lot of M&Ms."

* Favorite compliment someone has paid me: "Basically anything good that people say to me about my writing. I've written over 30 novels and eight humorous memoir collections, and far from being jaded, I am deliriously grateful every day to be published, to be writing and to have readers read me.

"I love anytime they tell me anything nice, and I eat it up with a spoon. I'm a sucker for positive reinforcement, and I'm truly blessed to hear from readers. So they can say anything they want to me, and they might just get hugged."

Democrats need an easy-to-understand impeachment case, but the one they have right now is very confusing

Texto completo: If the case for impeachment were as strong as #TheResistance says it is, you would think they could explain it in an honest way that bears at least some semblance to reality.
They can’t, so they’ve reheated an old talking point — foreign interference in an election! — that doesn’t even come close to describing what Trump did that's supposed to be so impeachable.
Democrats apparently believe that they can take an innocuous midsummer phone conversation between President Trump and the leader of Ukraine about potential corruption and sum it up as: Trump asked a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election.
Democrats and liberals in the media are doing everything they can to convince themselves that this will be a slam dunk in convincing the public that the president deserves removal from office.
“This has clarity and understanding in the eyes of the American people,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California reportedly said last week in a private meeting with colleagues.
Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, said she believed that “everybody understands” the “very clear threat to national security and to our Constitution” that rose from the phone call.
New York Times liberal Charles Blow, master of original metaphors, wrote this week that “the clarity” of Trump’s “transgression” on the call is “as clear as a bell.”
Eugene Robinson at the Washington Post confidently declared that “it is not in question” that Trump “committed at least one impeachable offense” and that his “misconduct” is “easy to understand.”
There’s just one problem there: None of it is easy to understand. It's actually almost impossible to comprehend without a flowchart, an abacus and a crystal ball.
If I’m an average person who has just been told that the president may be impeached for having asked the Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, my first question is, "Is Ukraine still a country?" My second question is, "Why Ukraine?"
I know that right now we’re supposed to suspend all questions because there’s an impeachment we have to get to but Democrats will eventually have to address that second one and it's clear that they have no idea how.
Next, as an average person, I'd want to know the answer to this question, "Why would Ukraine be of any assistance in an American election?" Maybe the average person will have heard somewhere that it has something to do with Joe Biden. Great! Let’s look at the part of the transcript from the phone call as it pertains to the former vice president.
Trump: "[T]here's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.”
The average person, who Democrats think should understand the severity of this “transgression” in a pinch, needs to know about this "prosecution" business, why Trump thought it was so “horrible,” and how it relates to Biden. But this is the point where Democrats think everything should end.
No, no, average person! You don’t need to know any more about that. Just look at the phone call. Isn’t it bad?!
Assuming the average person agrees to drop that line of questioning and loses all curiosity about what Hunter Biden was up to in Ukraine, he still needs to know what any of this has to do with the 2020 election. The transcript says nothing about the election, which, at the time of the phone call, was still a year and four months away.
So this is the case for impeachment that Democrats believe to be a home run. Isn’t it easy to understand?

Don't conflate Trump's Australia phone call with the Ukraine scandal

Texto completo: The New York Times and Washington Post reported yesterday that Attorney General William Barr solicited help from foreign leaders in regards to his investigation into the origins of the Mueller investigation, and that President Trump specifically asked the Australian government to assist Barr. This is a new story and certainly an important one, but it should not be conflated with the Ukraine scandal.

Legally, Trump’s phone call to Australia is very different from his phone call to Ukraine, just as Barr’s actions overseas are very different from Trump’s actions on the phone with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Barr’s investigation into the origins of the Russia hoax is both established and official. It’s not illegal or even shady for him to seek aid with it outside the United States. Whether he should is another matter entirely. But because the Russia investigation is an international affair involving multiple countries, it’s not unreasonable Barr would ask for their cooperation.
Likewise, Trump’s request that Australia assist Barr in his credible, established investigation is different from his conversation with Zelensky, in which he asked Ukraine to help dig up dirt on Joe Biden — a U.S. citizen who was not under any investigation. In his phone call with Zelensky, Trump was, in essence, asking Ukraine to open up a new, independent investigation. He did this instead of going to the DOJ and FBI. Why? Because at its core, this request was about the 2020 election, and asking a foreign government to conduct opposition research on your political rival is a big no-no.
There’s another important distinction that Philip Klein points out: the Ukraine phone call involved Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani — a man who is not authorized to handle matters of national security. “It is much more difficult to make the case that Trump was acting out of national interest to rid Ukraine of corruption when he's dispatching his personal lawyer to look into the case,” Klein writes.
Trump’s phone call with Zelensky demonstrated an overt willingness to use presidential power for personal gain. With Ukraine, he deliberately asked a foreign government to investigate his political opponent instead of asking U.S. authorities to open a lawful, official investigation. The purpose was clear: Trump wanted dirt that would help him get reelected so he went to someone that had it.
The same can’t be said of his conversation with Australia, or of Barr’s interactions with other foreign leaders. Did Trump hope to discredit the Mueller investigation with Australia’s help? Certainly. But because Barr’s investigation was legal, it’s difficult to tie it directly to personal gain in the same way as the Ukraine phone call.

Neither of these conversations was appropriate. Trump shouldn’t be using foreign policy to advance a political agenda in any way, shape, or form, and neither should Barr. But because these conversations offer very different outcomes, they’re not comparable in legal or political terms.

Texto completo: Jacksonville police made an arrest in what they termed a "horrendous" incident Friday that saw a victim beaten, tied and dragged behind a minivan.

Eric Shaun Bridges, 34, was arrested Sunday evening on a charge of attempted murder, the Sheriff's Office said.

Officers were called to Pearce Street near West 36th Street where a person was found lying on the street suffering from life-threatening injuries.

"The victim had been severely beaten and was dragged from a suspect's minivan by his legs for about two blocks behind a Dodge Caravan with a male driver, Assistant Chief Brien Kee said Friday. Some of the attack was caught on a camera that is part of the Sheriff's Office's Real Time Crime Center.

"The video was so graphic we can't release it. It's horrendous," Kee said.

Investigators found the minivan over the weekend and learned it had been reported stolen prior to the incident. Homicide detectives spoke to people in the area, tracked leads and analyzed evidence in and around the crime scene as well as in the vehicle, and tracked down Bridges midday Sunday, the Sheriff's Office said.

Bridges has eight prior arrests in Jacksonville, mostly for grand theft, according to jail records. The Sheriff's Office did not indicate a possible motive in Friday's attack.

The Sheriff's Office said the victim was a man, but LGBT activists report the victim was a transgender woman. WJXT TV-4 spoke with a relative of the victim, who identified them as a gay man.

Last week, police announced an arrest in the killing of a transgender woman.

Sean Bernard Phoenix's arrest was announced Thursday in the Feb. 4, 2018, shooting death of 36-year-old Celine Walker at the Skinner Lake Drive Extended Stay America. The two had a previous relationship.

Transgender Awareness Project leader Paige Mahogany Parks posted, "Yes JSO keep them coming" on Facebook regarding the arrests.

"The transgender community feel a lot safer knowing that JSO has two suspects in custody," Parks said. "There is more work to do but we are satisfied with the work JSO have done."

Walker's death was the first of three transgender homicides that occurred over a five-month period in the city.

The second occurred June 1, 2018, when 38-year-old local performer Antash'a Devine Sherrington English was shot between two abandoned homes in the 1500 block of Ella Street. Then about three weeks later 24-year-old Cathalina Christina James was shot outside the Quality Inn and Suites on Dix Ellis Trail.

Nationwide, crimes against the transgender community have been a concern. In the United States this year, at least 18 transgender people -- most of them transgender women of color -- have been murdered, The New York Times reported. The American Medical Association declared the violence against the community an "epidemic" across the country.

Texto completo: As the headlines about higher education these days are dominated by stories of admissions scandals involving the rich and famous, those of us living and working on college campuses see a much less made-for-TV reality that's both inspiring and sobering.
We believe in the transformative power of education - many of us know it personally - not just for individuals, but for society as a whole. A more educated society is more engaged civically, and happier and healthier, too. At the same time, we know that simply opening the doors of our elite institutions to those from all backgrounds isn't enough.
We dedicate millions of dollars to financial aid - in Trinity's case, more than $50 million a year - to recruit an increasingly talented and diverse student population. We tell prospective students that we value their ability far more than their ability to pay. But when they get here, are we doing enough to create an educational environment that meets their needs, that's truly inclusive?
Recently, Trinity has been in the national news thanks to a new book by Paul Tough, "The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us." In researching his book, Tough spent time on our campus several years ago, interviewing students and our then-new vice president for enrollment, Angel Perez, gaining insight into the complex challenges of college admissions.
Tough was drawn to Trinity as a focus because of our moves to boldly change course - by going test-optional, removing barriers to application for first-generation college students, and investing more heavily in financial aid to recruit top students from all backgrounds. A cover story by Tough in the New York Times Magazine last month portrayed Trinity as a national leader in access in higher education, a portrait that instilled a great deal of pride among many of our students, faculty, and alumni.
Indeed, I am proud too, especially of the progress made in the years since Tough's book was researched. Since changing our approach to admissions in 2015-16 (that is, with the class of 2020), we have succeeded in significantly expanding access and increasing the college's geographic, racial and socioeconomic diversity; building the academic strength and engagement of our student body; and meeting the college's enrollment and revenue goals.
Application numbers have been steady or rising over the past four years (6,121 for the class of 2023), and our yield rate - the percentage of students who enroll after being offered admission - jumped 8 points in 2016 and has remained at or above 30% ever since. The academic strength of entering students continues to grow, and the student body is unquestionably more diverse by numerous measures than it was several years ago. Today, Trinity has its highest-ever percentages of international students (from 76 countries) and first-generation college students. The just-entered class of 2023 includes 24% domestic students of color and 17% first-generation college students, and 62% of the class is receiving financial aid (25.8% of those students are Pell-eligible).
Our more diverse student body is engaged and thriving at Trinity; they also are persisting: Our retention rate (first-year students who return for their sophomore year) is on the rise, now at 91%.
All of this progress has been made while keeping the college on sound financial footing, with balanced operating budgets every year. How did we increase financial aid while balancing budgets? We cut costs where we could, of course, but this success is owed greatly to the vision and belief among our trustees and friends of the college, who dug deep in their pockets to support these changes.
Still, this isn't a moment at which we rest. Last week, we were honored to host another New York Times-featured author, Anthony Abraham Jack, whose bestselling book "The Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges Are Failing Disadvantaged Students" is opening eyes to the fact that for first-generation and low-income students, getting into college is only half the battle. The policies and cultures in academia can perpetuate or even exacerbate inequalities and keep us from realizing a truly inclusive environment.
Several hundred of us (members of the Trinity community and surrounding institutions and neighborhoods) gathered to hear Jack's lecture "On Diversity: Access Ain't Inclusion." Later, we continued the conversation with a screening of a documentary "(Un)Privileged: The Cost of Being Poor at An Elite Institution" by 2016 Trinity alumna Bettina Cecilia Gonzalez, and in small-group discussions in residence halls across campus that night. Trinity is operating with many of the best practices to support disadvantaged students that Jack suggested, such as orientations designed specifically for first-generation students and food options for students during college breaks, when food insecurity can be high.
Jack's visit was a fitting follow-up to Trinity's being highlighted in the national media for its leadership, a reminder to keep striving. As we steadfastly pursue our academic mission, one that's nearly 200 years old, we believe in it more deeply than ever, and we know that at the heart of our work now is to provide an ever better and more inclusive experience.
Joanne Berger-Sweeney is the president of Trinity College and a professor of neuroscience.

China's government abuses obscure gains on anniversary Guest Columnists

Texto completo: Oct. 1 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This year also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the launching of the PRC's economic reforms. China is celebrating this anniversary, and how could it not?
Seventy years ago, it was one of the poorest nations in the world; today it has grown with astonishing speed to become the world's second-largest economy. Literacy has more than quadrupled, jumping from roughly 20% in 1949 to about 95% today. Hundreds of millions of citizens have emerged from poverty, and a new middle class has burgeoned to where it now outnumbers America's middle class.
Since the beginning of the 1979 economic reforms, China has also opened up to international influences. We have both benefited from this "open door" policy by engaging in field research, cultural exchanges, and the sponsoring of intercollegiate debates between Rollins students and students in China. We have also benefited by welcoming Beijing-sponsored Chinese language teachers to our campus, as have many other colleges and universities in the U.S. and around the world.
But dark clouds are throwing shade on China's success story. Since the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square, China has been suppressing free expression with a heavy-handedness that has recently intensified. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), perhaps the most enduring ruling party in the world today, is teaching its citizens to view the West as a hostile force.
The Beijing authorities employ YouTube to spread propaganda overseas, including live feeds of its anniversary celebrations. But ironically YouTube is blocked within China. So are search engines like Google and all mainstream western news outlets. The severity of these restrictions has reached a point where, when we travel in China, we can access our academic institution's website only by using a Virtual Private Network or VPN.
But our troubles are small compared with those faced by the people of Hong Kong and certain targeted minority groups in China. As Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators take to the streets to oppose Beijing's pressures, China's communist leaders are deploying multiple disinformation tactics, using, for example, false accounts that dishonestly discredit the protesters.
According to a recent New York Times article, more than 200,000 Twitter accounts were part of "a sprawling Russian-style disinformation offensive from China."
We admire and are deeply appreciative of China's many cultures, but we are troubled by the government policy toward the Muslim Uyghurs of Xinjiang in China's remote northwest. This region has been roiled by ethnic tensions, economic disparities, separatist-inspired conflicts, and some radical Islamist influences. But the Chinese government uses these problems as a pretext to purge peaceful political dissidents and Uyghur intellectuals. In the last two years, the state has intensified its campaign by employing so-called reeducation camps in which critics of the regime are confined and silenced.
In the summer of 2018, Li Wei visited Xinjiang and heard firsthand accounts of how hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uyghurs are being kept in these secretive camps for the stated purpose of "countering extremism and terrorism." He saw checkpoints, armed police and even neighborhood-based militia everywhere in the cities he visited. Their presence was designed to make potential dissidents nervous, and it had this effect on Li Wei as well.
Some 2,500 years ago, China was in chaos, rocked by internecine warfare and plagued by the corruption of self-serving rulers.
At that time, Confucius sought answers to these problems in the hope of restoring social order based on humanity and integrity. He understood that reform is never easy, so he taught that a wise and benevolent citizen must be courageous and unwavering, insisting on virtuous practices no matter what burdens this may impose on him. His lessons remain relevant today.
We hope that China will grow ever more prosperous. But we also hope that by the time the 80-year anniversary of the PRC arrives in 2029, it will have learned to draw from its ancient wisdom and so restore its traditional emphasis on human decency and integrity. Only by doing so will it be able to establish the harmonious society that it claims to seek.

Ukraine saga through different lenses

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is underway. But what it's all about means such radically different things to America's two main political tribes that they might as well be living in parallel realities.
On Earth One, Trump faces a long-overdue reckoning for blatant abuse of power after getting caught red-handed trying to pressure Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, into providing dirt on a political opponent, current Democratic front-runner Joe Biden. In this reality, he got away with accepting the Kremlin's help to cheat his way into victory in 2016, but now his misdeeds have caught up with him.
On Earth Two, Trump is the victim of a conspiracy between the "deep state" - the intelligence and foreign policy establishment - and sore-loser Democrats, a sequel to the Russia hoax. In this reality, the scandal is Biden's abuse of power as vice president in 2015 to pressure the Ukrainians into firing a prosecutor who was investigating a gas company that had given Biden's son, Hunter Biden, a cushy job, while Trump was merely pushing Ukraine to probe corruption.
Earth One is inhabited by the vast majority of Democrats, Trump-critical Republicans, and the liberal and centrist media (including some on the news side of Fox News). Earth Two is inhabited by most Republicans, some contrarian leftists and the large pro-Trump contingent in the conservative media.
Obviously, Earth One is actual reality. (Yes, Hunter Biden's $50,000-a-month job on the gas company board was an embarrassing example of nepotism, but it doesn't come close to Trump administration malfeasance.) All the evidence points that way. Credible people who are generally capable of assessing evidence with minimal partisan bias agree.
But millions of Americans live on Earth Two, and Earth Two also has a large media apparatus.
Some say that if Richard Nixon had the media landscape Trump has today, he would have survived the Watergate scandal. Back then, the right had the National Review and a few smaller magazines, some conservative pundits in the national media, and local conservative newspapers that did not stray too far from the respectable mainstream. The national conversation was dominated by the liberal giants: The New York Times, The Washington Post and the three TV networks.
Forty-five years later, there's conservative talk radio, Fox News and countless internet sites. What's more, the line between the professional journalist and the citizen with a computer barely exists. For better and worse, the rise of the new media has empowered once-marginalized voices - whether it's gay rights activists or conspiracy loons.
In this environment, it's much easier for watchdogs - some of them ordinary citizens with no journalistic training - to fact-check the media and sometimes expose hoaxes or distortions. It's also much easier for extremists, propagandists and conspiracy peddlers to vie for attention with serious journalists. It's especially easy to muddy the waters when it comes to messy stories like the Ukraine saga, rife with corruption, political shenanigans and lies.
Public loss of trust in the mainstream media exacerbates the problem. Partly, this is the result of a deliberate effort on the right to discredit the "liberal media." (Thus, claims the Russia story was misreported are wildly exaggerated.) Partly, it's the media's own doing. There have been many examples of sloppy and biased reporting, such as the recent coverage of new disclosures on the Brett Kavanaugh sexual misconduct accusations in which dramatic claims made headlines and then collapsed.
Our present quagmire has many authors. But Earth One and Earth Two will probably stay separate for quite a while.
