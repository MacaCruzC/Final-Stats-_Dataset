Texto completo: Long before President Donald Trump raised alarm by halting hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid in an alleged effort to influence Ukraine, his administration had built up plenty of practice in using federal funds to punish a favorite target: California.
The Justice Department said it would deny criminal justice grants to sanctuary cities that don't assist immigration agents, a move that several lower courts have blocked. The Department of Transportation is moving to cancel a $929 million grant to California's high-speed rail project and may try to claw back an additional $2.5 billion the bullet train program already has received.
And the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that if California didn't improve its air quality, the feds would withhold billions in federal highway funding a move that Gov. Gavin Newsom called a "threat of pure retaliation" against a state that has sued the Trump administration 60 times.
Since he took over as president, Trump has used his power over federal funds as a cudgel to push cities, states and foreign governments to do what he wants.
"The threat of withdrawing federal funding is not a new tactic," said Michael McConnell, a Stanford law professor. "But President Trump has tended to personalize the threats more than prior administrations."
And the actions that have prompted threats of funding clawbacks range from momentous to minuscule. Earlier this month, the Trump administration threatened to withdraw federal funding for a Middle East studies course at Duke University and the University of North Carolina over its depictions of Christianity and Judaism.
But now what appears to be another move to block federal funds approved by Congress has sparked a full-blown political firestorm. Trump's decision to freeze nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine before urging the country's president to investigate one of his political rivals has led to the threat of impeachment looming over his presidency.
Trump also has pushed legal boundaries on the use of federal funds in other ways, experts say. After Congress declined to approve funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump declared a national emergency to move funds from the Defense Department for wall construction. And he considered freezing more than $4 billion in aid to foreign countries last month before deciding not to amid political backlash.
Trump has long painted himself as a master dealer in the business world, making his willingness to drive a tough bargain central to his image as a successful real estate mogul. But between court decisions blocking some of his funding moves and the crisis over Ukraine, he's found that those tactics don't necessarily translate as well in a government setting.
Trump is far from the only president to use similar tactics. The Constitution gives the power to appropriate federal funds to Congress, but in many cases, that power is delegated to the president and the executive branch.
Presidents have used foreign aid as a carrot or a stick to extract diplomatic commitments and reforms from foreign governments. And it's also been used domestically: Barack Obama's administration, for example, threatened to block federal funds for states that discriminated against Planned Parenthood and didn't allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, although it never actually did so.
Still, Trump has used federal funds as leverage more often, more brazenly and in ways that have pushed the legal envelope more than past presidents, legal experts say.
What sets the Ukraine example apart and potentially makes it so perilous for Trump is that he allegedly was acting to damage a potential 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, not to change policy.
"What's especially concerning about the Ukraine example is he seems to do it not just for public policy ends but for his own personal, political ends," said Michael Dorf, a Cornell Law School professor who focuses on constitutional law.
Trump has insisted that he acted appropriately and was not drawing a quid-pro-quo between federal aid and Ukraine digging into Biden, and he blasted the whistleblower who made the call public.
"I want to know who's the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that's close to a spy," Trump said at a closed-door meeting Thursday at the United Nations, The New York Times reported. "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now."
Republicans pointed out that the record of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released by the White House did not directly mention the aid funds the president had temporarily frozen although the document notes that it is "not a verbatim transcript."
Many of Trump's threats about federal funding haven't gone further than tweets. In February 2017, soon after taking office, he suggested he could cut off federal money to UC Berkeley after the university called off a speech by right-wing activist Milo Yiannopoulos amid violent protests.
The high-speed rail line is one example where the Trump administration has moved to take back federal money. In yanking back federal funds, the Department of Transportation argued that the state has failed to follow through with its plan for the bullet train project, which has been marred by extensive budget overruns and delays. But Democratic leaders in the state have claimed that Trump acted out of animus for the state, targeting it for political reasons.
Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of UC Berkeley Law School, argued that Trump's apparent solicitation of help from a foreign government for information that could damage a political rival was in and of itself a violation of federal law, whether or not he implied a connection with U.S. aid to Ukraine.
But he said Trump's broader history of using federal money as a political tool was a dangerous trend: "Congress has to set the strings on grants, not the president."

Texto completo: In some ways, perhaps, the odds were stacked against Alice McDermott becoming a successful fiction writer. McDermott, 66, whose middle-class parents were the children of immigrants, grew up in New York City, where she attended public schools.
McDermott says her parents always had books in their hands and were dutiful about reading to her.
Despite that love of words, however, McDermott says her parents, who had grown up in the shadows of the Great Depression and World War II, weren’t exactly thrilled when she announced her intention to make writing her profession.
“I can’t say they were actually joyous at the idea when I proposed being an English major and becoming a writer,” McDermott says during a telephone interview.
“Out of the goodness of their hearts, the advice was: ‘Why don’t you get your secretarial skills perfected and then you can work in a publishing house and have health care.”
McDermott, who admits to something of a stubborn streak that tells her to push forward when someone wants to hold her back, persevered.
And that persistence paid off as McDermott, who will be on the campus of Franklin & Marshall College Tuesday to deliver the Hausman Lecture, became one of America’s finest writers, turning out critically praised novels that also found their way onto the bestseller lists.
McDermott’s second novel, “That Night,” validated her choice of career early on. Though it didn’t win, the 1987 novel was a finalist for the National Book Award, the Pulitzer Prize and the Pen/Faulkner Award.
She won the National Book Award for her 1998 novel “Charming Billy,” and two other novels, “At Weddings and Wakes” (1992) and “After This” (2006), were both finalists for the Pulitzer. “After This” was longlisted for the National Book Award.”
Her most recent novel, “The Ninth Hour,” which unfolds in the early part of the 20th century and tells the story of a widow, her daughter and the convent of nuns who serve their Irish-American neighborhood in New York City, was published in 2017 and made that year’s best-of lists for the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and NPR. Of the novel, the New York Times wrote: “McDermott has extended her range and deepened it, allowing for more darkness, more generous lashings of the spiritual . . . Vivid and arresting . . . Marvelously evocative.”
“To be taken seriously was huge for me,” says McDermott of the reception her first novel received. “I mean, it was important to have mentors in college who took me seriously as a writer. Then, to have an editor and a publisher and have your work read and written about ...
“But right away there’s also: That was then; what are you doing now?”
McDermott has likely always been able to answer that question. From the beginning, she has approached fiction writing as she would any other job, getting up in the morning and working through the day.
“With a middle-class background, it’s get up and go to your desk, go to work,” she says. “You’re no different than a waitress or a surgeon. You have a job to do.”
McDermott, who lives with her husband, a neuroscientist, outside Washington, D.C., says that never changed, even when they were raising their three children.
“Mommy has to go to work,” McDermott says she told her children, “even though mommy works in that room over there and is not punching a time clock. It’s my obligation.”
McDermott, who taught for many years at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore until her recent retirement, says she advises her female students not to take time off from writing if they do have children because “you have to keep it going.”
That’s never been a problem for McDermott, who says she always works on two novels at the same time.
“It’s a terrible thing to do,” McDermott says. “I always make sure I tell students that this is just my crazy way of working. It’s not a good way of working. I don’t know, it’s just something I have fallen into. It seems to be something I need to do. “
McDermott, who says the writers William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf and Vladimir Nabokov instilled in her a love of language, insists she never quite knows where a novel is going to lead when she starts it. She says she believes she knows where it’s going to go, but has found that as the writing continues “you sort of teach yourself what the book wants to be.”
“As the writer,” she says, “you’re also your own first reader. And if there’s not a sense that you are discovering something through the writing, just the way a reader hopes to be discovering something, then why do it? If you think you know the whole story and you’ve got it in your head and it’s just a matter of writing it down, why go through all the hard work of writing something down. Just call up a friend and tell them the story.”
Though McDermott, through determination and hard work, has consistently excelled at the profession she chose at a young age, she says she always feels like a novice when she sits down to start a book. And she’s always grateful for the opportunity to open a new chapter in her writing career.
“It’s a great privilege,” she says. “I’ve never taken for granted that I get to write what I want to write. I’ve never been pressured to write something that might be commercial or less than something I feel has integrity. That I’ve had the support of of my editor and my publisher and my readers, it still astonishes me.
“It’s a wonderful privilege to have the freedom to pursue any art in this culture that is not first and foremost about monetary gain or playing on the public in some way to get money out of them.”
Though she retired from her teaching position, McDermott says she has no plans to give up writing. She says her publisher plans to release a collection of her essays next year and a novel will follow in 2021.
“Those of us who are bitten with this pursuit, nobody asked us to start it, so why should we stop it?”

Texto completo: The accolades for the Finger Lakes wine region of New York to continue to accumulate.
The most recent example: "Wine & Spirits Magazine" has named Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery as one of the Top 100 Wineries of 2019.
Also on the worldwide list is such prestigious wineries as Champagne Krug in France; Penfolds in Australia; and Stags' Leap Winery and Tablas Creek in California. Dr. Frank was the only winery named from the Finger Lakes region of New York. The winery previously was named in the "Wine & Spirits Magazine" Top 100 in 2016.
Over the past few years, the winery has rolled out more personalized tasting experiences geared toward the varied interests of its visitors. It remodeled its tasting rooms and allowed each guest to choose wines to taste from the entire list including reserve and single vineyard wines. The Terrace at 1886 allows guests to enjoy flights of wine paired with local cheeses on the new outside terrace overlooking the vineyards on Keuka Lake. Now in its fourth year, the 1886 Food and Wine Experience offers guests a thorough educational tour and tasting paired with creative small bites.
Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery is at 9749 Middle Road, a few miles north of Hammondsport, Steuben County. The winery, which opened in 1962, was at the forefront of the post-Prohibition wine movement in the Finger Lakes. The vineyards on Keuka Lake are home to some of the oldest vines in the U.S.
More Finger Lakes accolades • For the second year in a row, the picturesque Finger Lakes wine region was named top wine region in the USA TODAY 10Best Reader's Choice poll. The Finger Lakes Wine Festival in Watkins Glen and F.L.X. Table in Geneva also finished in the Top 10 in their respective categories.
• Finger Lakes wines regularly have strong showings in the national wine press. The most recent example: New York Times wine writer Eric Asimov included Nathan K Finger Lakes Dry Riesling in a list of 20 wines under $20.

Texto completo: What happens when you mix rage, shame and pride with years of nationalist education?
Over the past few months, reports on Chinese mainlanders hurling curses at Hong Kong protesters have disturbed people around the world. These self-appointed guardians of Beijing's authority have appeared in Australia, where they shouted profane insults in Mandarin about the mothers of a group of Hong Kong supporters. In Canada, mainland students driving their Ferraris and Aston Martins to "demonstrate force" derided Hong Kongers as poor and added an expletive for good measure.
As a mainlander who lives overseas, these accounts were shocking to me. The overseas Chinese students I've met, to be clear, are nothing like these protesters; I was both sad and horrified to see images of a young Chinese man holding a sign telling Hong Kong sympathizers in London to "kneel down" in front of their "master." (He, too, used more profane language.)
But when I read these accounts, I thought about the last time I was back home in Shanghai over the summer. While I was there, I watched television in the evenings with my mother. From 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., there were only two options: shows focused on food, or TV dramas set during the Sino-Japanese war. We often opted for the latter, and so our nights were spent watching well-dressed Communist Party members outsmarting the Japanese invaders on every occasion. "If they had been as invincible as they were portrayed on the television," my mother commented once, "why would the war have lasted eight years?"
I thought about the connection between what I'd watched and what I was now reading about -- a generation shaped by shows like these, designed to convert the human cost we paid for today's prosperity into nationalist zeal and to send the message that we should feel anger toward Japan and others, while believing firmly in China's current path.
The first thing to note about Chinese patriotism is that it was born out of conflict. Unlike in a democratic country where the people vote to elect their leaders, the Chinese Communist Party first claimed the mantle of legitimacy after the Sino-Japanese War. That is, the party led the Chinese people to eventually overthrow "the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism," and "founded the People's Republic of China," as the preamble of our Constitution puts it. As a result, to love the state means to endorse the party. "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China," the famous "red" song goes.
And it was also born out of shame. Growing up, we learned that the Qing government was so weak that it signed many unfair treaties with the Western and Japanese colonizers over the course of the 19th century. We learned that even after the empire fell apart in 1911, the new government, dominated by warlords, was corrupt enough to let Japan occupy Shandong province after World War I. We learned that millions of our countrymen had been killed during the Sino-Japanese War. We internalized the trauma of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937-38.
We were steeped in this before we were even old enough to understand the messages we were supposed to be absorbing. Today, it is almost funny to recall that the first naked woman I saw on the big screen was from "Red Cherry," one of the patriotic movies we watched as a mandatory part of our curriculum. In one scene, a Chinese teenager was forced to walk on the dinner table naked, showing a giant Nazi tattoo on her back to a group of German officers. Looking back, it's a good antiwar movie, but I was only a primary school student. Sitting in the movie theater with my class, I had no idea what a Nazi was. What I remember was that it shocked me to see the girl's bare body, and later to see a different girl trying to burn herself to remove a similar tattoo.
In other movies, we saw the famous 14-year-old Communist Party hero, Liu Hulan, walk courageously up to a fodder chopper, refusing to save her life by betraying the other party members in her village. We witnessed Chinese people being lynched, raped and buried alive by the Japanese, and watched as some of them still managed to chant patriotic slogans all the way to the end. When we returned to school from the movie theater, the teachers asked us to learn their spirit of "ningsibuqu" -- to prefer to die than to surrender.
After years of schooling, every Chinese national is left with a wardrobe of collective enemies: the Western countries and Japan. No sensible adult would be foolish enough to adopt this completely black-and-white view. But a hostile mind-set can still get the better of us when nationalistic sentiments are involved.
To many mainlanders, for example, the recent protests in Hong Kong brought back humiliating memories of the Chinese Empire at its weakest. When I saw pictures of Hong Kong protesters hanging a British colonial flag in the legislative building, I could feel, even in my own blood, the fury slowly gathering. The next day, I happened to talk to a Chinese friend, who had been forwarding sympathetic posts about the protests only a few days before. "If they want to kiss up to the previous colonizer," she said, "leave them alone."
When more violent pictures of the Hong Kong protests filled Chinese social media, I was having dinner with an old friend in Shanghai, a consultant trained in both China and America. "How can the protests," he asked me, "be so well-organized if they are not orchestrated by the United States in the first place?" The logic was flawed, I thought. The Hong Kong protests were a leaderless movement, organized through the internet. But I didn't want to say so, because I didn't want to quarrel.
Of course we should remember our history. But when I try to understand my friends in China, and those horrible overseas Chinese nationalists, I think about the way lessons about our colonized past have morphed into a crackdown on voices that differ from Beijing's. We have been victims in the past, and so now Chinese people must share "one heart" and "one faith." We must all want to see China grow into a strong nation, one that defies the best efforts of our collective enemies to thwart us -- and anyone who criticizes government policy or doubts a government narrative is "un-Chinese," a "running dog" of foreign forces.
We are trapped in this rhetoric. Nobody wants to seem unpatriotic, so in the increasingly tense political climate in China, moderate patriotism is silenced and extreme patriotism is becoming the loudest, if not the only, voice.
Most of us love our country. It's almost an instinct, like the attachment we bear toward our kin. Perhaps the bigger question is how to make patriotism a matter of education, not indoctrination. There is a lesson here for every country, not just China. If patriotism is taught first and foremost to perpetuate power, to control people, to prepare them as soldiers for potential conflict and war, the result is the same: It is a young man, holding a sign, telling another person to kneel down in front of his master.

Texto completo: Dorian devastated this place, but hope keeps washing ashore.
OCRACOKE, N.C. -- I write this from a barrier island 26 miles off the mainland coast, accessible only by boat or plane. It has been about three weeks since Hurricane Dorian blew through, tore up and submerged the place that my 1,000 or so neighbors and I call home. While it might seem from a distance that the storm has passed, we are all as shellshocked as we were on Day 1.
I first came to Ocracoke as a 17-year-old who'd just lost her legs to meningitis and sepsis. The topography was overwhelmingly beautiful -- and one night on the beach with a full moon, I found a reason to live again after tragedy. Nearly seven years ago, I came again for a 10-day vacation with my children, and never left. I didn't stay because of the geographical beauty, I stayed because of the village.
Many natives are descendants of the quartermaster of Blackbeard the pirate and still speak with a Hoi Toide brogue, a reference to the way the natives pronounce "high tide." It's a magical village where barters of bourbon for fresh fish take place with ease between bicycle baskets. Neighbors help neighbors, and newcomers who stay live by the motto of the native Ocracokers: We don't ask for help, we give help. But that has changed. America, we need your help.
About one-third of the island are native Ocracokers, one-fourth are Hispanic, two people are African-American and the rest, like me, are varying degrees of driftwood. We have Democrats, Republicans, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, agnostics and Buddhists. When a storm hits and the ferries can't run and a plane can't land, we are on our own. It is that exact nature of isolation that makes this place so special. We don't care who you voted for, or who you pray to, or what color your skin might be, when stuff hits the fan, we need each other, and if I have something you can use, then take it. When you live in vulnerability, you find out what matters most.
The island averages five feet above sea level, but Dorian inundated us with an unprecedented seven-foot storm surge that, according to the head of North Carolina Emergency Management, flooded over hundreds of our homes with anywhere from a few inches to four feet. Neighbors had to be rescued from their attics by boat, folks axed down their doors and swam through the surge to higher ground. At the Village Craftsmen, a native-owned gift store in operation for 40 years, lines are marked with the names of previous hurricanes. Hurricane Matthew from 2016 is there, one of the worst anyone can remember. The line for Dorian is 27 inches higher than Matthew. It is a miracle, that unlike our friends in the Bahamas, no one here died.
Our day care center, briefly reopened, has been closed because of septic issues; our historic library has been closed. Our post office was reopened on Sept. 18, but our only bank remains closed. Currency is bartered goods. Most local businesses lost all of their merchandise. Our health center is now a series of mobile emergency units. Instead of surge, our island is now inundated with relief workers. Immediately after the storm, local watermen from neighboring islands came into our harbor, skiff after skiff, filled with water, food and supplies. Our schoolchildren, exhausted and anxious, and whose school may not be habitable for a year, helped those coastal kin unpack the boats and load the goods into the few trucks that were operable on the island, and then hauled them to our fire department, which has been the base of operations and distribution since disaster struck. We now call it FireMart.
We still have not been declared a federal disaster, hence we have no assistance from FEMA. Hundreds of my neighbors and friends have been displaced, matriarchs of our village are sitting on piles of debris waiting for good Samaritan crews to help clean out their homes, while the walls are bowing and the mold is growing daily. Last week, I began making phone calls from Raleigh to Washington to speak with my representatives and leaders about our current state of disaster.
I discovered that on Friday the 13th, one week after the storm, Gov. Roy Cooper's office delivered a request for a declaration of disaster for public assistance and infrastructure to the White House. Representatives from Senator Thom Tillis's office assured me that the senator urged the president to sign it that day. On Saturday, Sept. 21, eight days after the request was sent to the president, our newly sworn-in congressman, Greg Murphy, came to the island and announced that President Trump had just signed the FEMA declaration. Our state senator, Bob Steinburg, posted on his social media accounts that same hour that the president had signed the document. Those social media posts have now been deleted.
On that same day, Governor Cooper followed up the request for the Public Assistance Program for infrastructure recovery with a request to the White House for assistance with individuals and families. Two days later, he came for his second visit to the island since Dorian. His first visit was the day after the storm. The governor sat on the porch of my home for 45 minutes, listening to the stories of native island matriarchs. He brought with him the state secretaries of health and human services, environmental quality, public safety, the emergency management director, the chief officer of the Department of Transportation and the brigadier general of the National Guard, all of whom toured my home, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, and had almost three feet of water inside. Under a mulberry tree, the governor told me that the news from Senator Steinburg and Congressman Murphy was untrue. The declarations of disaster had not been signed by the president.
Five days after the storm, I remembered the beach. I wear neoprene sleeves when I swim, to hold on my prosthetic legs, but the day before another amputee on the island had lost his sleeve to the flood and I gave him one of mine. The ocean was calm, and so I took the chance. I swam for half an hour, but coming up out of the sand ledge, a wave knocked me over and sucked my prosthetic leg off. Friends combed the beach until sundown without luck. Our local newspaper put it out on social media that if anyone spotted my leg to please return it to the FireMart. My leg washed up on the beach the next day, discovered by my favorite bartender. For the last few days, my leg has been the butt, so to speak, of the joke for my community, giving them something to laugh at, something to distract them from the purgatory in which we are now living. Ocracokers know that humor is the helpmate of hope. The story of my leg is also giving us hope. The sea taketh and the sea giveth back.
I am a proud resident of Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, United States of America. I do not believe in divisiveness. Most survivors of disasters will tell you that there is no better teacher of equality. And while Ocracoke is strong and proud, and has been for over 300 years, we've been knocked to our knees by this one, and we need our fellow Americans and our leaders to step in and expedite help immediately. We may have two legs to stand on, but we need more than that right now.

How China Sees the World

Texto completo: From climate change to Taiwan, China's foreign policy is about impressing the masses at home, not fighting enemies abroad.
The past few months have been challenging for China: A trade war with the United States has taken a toll on the economy, while months of protests in Hong Kong have raised questions about the sustainability of Chinese political control at the edges of its rule.
But rather than play down these challenges at home, President Xi Jinping's response has been to accentuate the peril of foreign threats to the Chinese nation, while glorifying the bond between the Chinese Communist Party and the people. His bet has been that through cementing nationalism in China he will strengthen his hand. So far, this tactic has proved effective, but it is not without significant risks for China and for the world.
Whether the issue is Taiwan, the South China Sea or climate change, the primary audience for China's actions on the world stage remains domestic. Even as China has become a superpower, the Chinese Communist Party remains more concerned with appearing to defend the nation with symbolic gestures and rhetoric than with actually fighting foreign powers. As Mr. Xi told the Central Committee in 2013, "Winning or losing public support is an issue that concerns the C.P.C.'s survival or extinction."
China's citizens were reared on grievances about their country's subjugation at the hands of foreign powers. As tensions grow with the United States -- especially as the Trump administration casts China as a "whole of society" threat, to use the words of the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray -- this sense of victimization will continue to drive China's foreign policy.
From the time Mao Zedong seized power 70 years ago until today, Chinese leaders have staked their claim to rule on safeguarding the nation against foreign adversaries after a history of invasion and occupation. With the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Mao declared: "Ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation. We have stood up." After the political crisis in 1989 and the widespread disillusionment that followed the brutal crackdown at Tiananmen Square, the Chinese Communist Party began a nationwide patriotic education campaign to encourage pride in China's achievements and in the party for helping the country overcome a "century of national humiliation."
Such propaganda has been surprisingly effective at creating room for the government to maneuver amid international challenges. For example, in 2013, as tensions escalated with Japan, instead of using force, Beijing employed fiery words and demanded that foreign aircraft identify themselves and comply with Chinese instructions when flying over the East China Sea. In 2001, after a midair collision with an American spy plane, China defused the crisis by mourning the "martyred" pilot while avoiding a repeat of the anti-American demonstrations that had swept the country in 1999. In my research, I have found that the government has helped shore up public approval by reminding citizens of the nation's long struggle and emphasizing that China will ultimately prevail by biding its time for future success.
Yet this strategy has costs. Chinese leaders risk tying their hands in the long run if invoking historical grievances hardens the public's desire for vindication in the future. Opinion polls show that the public is hawkish on territorial disputes and American military operations in Asia, making it hard for Beijing to reassure the region that its intentions are peaceful. And each time the government spins up and then winds down nationalist anger, whether online or in the streets, it breeds resentment against its heavy-handed manipulation. Blanketing the airwaves and the internet with propaganda may foster the appearance of conformity, but it also hides public disenchantment.
And under Mr. Xi, nationalism has taken on a particularly virulent form. The government has detained more than a million of its Muslim minorities in Xinjiang Province and sought to "Sinicize religion" by replacing expressions of ethnic and religious identity with patriotic slogans. Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party's attempts to inculcate loyalty and squelch opposition among the diaspora in Taiwan and Hong Kong have aroused concerns that Beijing cares more about its vision of ethnic unity than respect for sovereignty and the rule of law. These efforts may bolster the hand of those in the United States promoting a new "red scare" that targets ethnic Chinese and policies that restrict scientific research on the basis of national origin.
For all of Mr. Xi's rhetoric about "a China solution to humani­ty's search for better social systems," the Chinese Communist Party has not tried to export its ideology or system of government, unlike Soviet efforts to spread communism or American programs to promote democracy. In seeking to make the world safer for the party, Beijing has made it easier for authoritarian states to coexist alongside democracies. Mr. Xi's overriding focus is not on spreading his brand of autocracy, but on eliminating risks to his rule at home and securing his nation's economic growth and security.
But China is not a monolith. Many Chinese resent the direction Mr. Xi has taken the country's politics and foreign policy. By narrowing the range of what is acceptable, by forcibly linking nationalism with unquestioning loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party, and by reining in the limited freedoms that many in China had come to enjoy, the party has alienated many citizens who had previously accepted a somewhat more responsive and respectful form of authoritarian rule. In the last few years, the party under Mr. Xi has created an image of strength that masks an increasingly brittle -- as well as brutal -- form of rule. The bill for Mr. Xi's approach may yet come due, with threats to his rule more likely to come from within than from without.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, backed out on Friday from a scheduled appearance at a Kremlin-supported conference in Armenia that may include President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
"Not going," Mr. Giuliani told The New York Times in a text, after The Washington Post reported on Friday afternoon that he was set to make a trip next week to a conference sponsored by the Kremlin and the Moscow-based Eurasian Economic Union.
His planned appearance was to take place a week after the public release of a complaint filed by a whistle-blower alleging that Mr. Trump used the powers of his office to pressure officials in Ukraine for political dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Giuliani is featured prominently in the complaint for his efforts trying to pressure Ukrainian officials.
Mr. Giuliani said he needed to spend more time with his client next week, as the Democrat-led House prepares the first depositions in its impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani said an aide in his office had scheduled him for the conference, and that he had previously appeared there. He said he did not know if he was to be paid for his appearance, or if he already had been paid.
The Post reported that Mr. Putin was expected to attend the conference, but Mr. Giuliani said that he did not know if that was the case.
Mr. Giuliani has aggressively pursued a theory that first exploded on the fringe of the internet that it was Ukranians, not Russians, who hacked into the emails of Democrats during the 2016 campaign. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, spent two years investigating whether there was conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, who intelligence officials say wanted Mr. Trump to win the election.
Mr. Mueller's final report did not find direct evidence of a conspiracy, but examined repeated contacts between some Trump campaign advisers and Russians.

Pakistan Leader Castigates India In U.N. Speech

Texto completo: Pakistan's leader castigated India over its Kashmir crackdown from the podium of the United Nations on Friday, warning of a "blood bath" when and if Indian authorities lift a curfew over the disputed territory.
The speech by Prime Minister Imran Khan at the United Nations General Assembly was partly directed at his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, who in his own speech earlier Friday omitted any reference to Kashmir.
Last month India revoked the longstanding autonomy of the mountainous border region, the flash point of two wars with Pakistan since both achieved independence from Britain more than 70 years ago.
The Indian authorities arrested thousands of Kashmiris, severed most electronic access and imposed a curfew on the entire populace of about 8 million. While some curbs have been eased, the curfew remains in effect.
Mr. Modi and his subordinates have described their move as an internal domestic matter aimed at making the region more prosperous.
The Indian prime minister's shift on Kashmir was welcomed by his base of Hindu nationalists, who have long wanted to exert power in the Muslim-majority region and have long accused Pakistan of supporting militant separatists there.
Mr. Khan has repeatedly denounced what he has described as Mr. Modi's reckless disregard of Pakistan's historic claims to the region.
The Pakistani leader has frequently reminded the world that Pakistan and India are both nuclear powers. He has used terms like genocide to describe India's intentions for the disputed Kashmir region and has complained that Mr. Modi has ignored his entreaties for a dialogue.
In an interview with The New York Times Editorial Board on Wednesday, Mr. Khan said Mr. Modi was leading India down an irrational path, a theme he reiterated in his General Assembly speech.
"Is it arrogance that has blinded him from what is going to happen when the curfew is lifted? Does he think the people of Kashmir will quietly accept the status quo?" Mr. Khan said. "What is going to happen when the curfew is lifted will be a blood bath."
The pent-up frustration of Kashmiris living under what Mr. Khan described as Indian military occupation would inevitably come back to haunt India, he said.
"Would I want to live like that?" Mr. Khan said. "I would pick up a gun."
Mr. Khan, who has conspicuously avoided crossing paths with Mr. Modi while both are attending the annual gathering in New York, had said that he would be using his General Assembly speech to emphasize Kashmir and implore the United Nations to intervene.
Mr. Modi, in his speech, sought to portray India as a peace-loving nation that he said had given the world Buddha's philosophy of serenity. His only reference to Pakistan and Kashmir was oblique, saying India had long been a victim of terrorism.
"Our voice against terrorism, to alert the world about this evil, rings with seriousness and the outrage," Mr. Modi said. "It is absolutely imperative that the world unites against terrorism."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn’t recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn’t what places Keyser on the heroes’ roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh” by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser’s erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn’t remember the party, not that it didn’t happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford’s story isn’t true and doesn’t make sense, according to the book. Given their close friendship during their school days, isn’t it likely that Ford would have told her about such an attack? And, had Keyser been at the alleged party, since she already had her drivers license and often gave Christine a ride, wouldn’t she have taken her younger friend home?
According to the book, Ford’s team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford’s narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford’s acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls’ high school as Ford, wrote: “Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart.” And, “I don’t care, frankly, how f—-ed up her life is.”
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys’ school chimed in: “Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is.” To which Amitay responded, “Leland is a major stumbling block.”
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn’t come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser’s “significant health challenges,” during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: “I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs.”
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser’s credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN’s “Reliable Sources” Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser’s “memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges.”
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, “Justice on Trial,” by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that’s heroic.

Bernie Sanders accuses Biden donors of ‘trying to buy this election’

Texto completo: In a campaign email blast on Friday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders solicited financial support for his presidential bid by telling potential donors that Democratic front-runner Joe Biden was "trying to buy this election."
Citing a Thursday article from the New York Times titled "Anxious Biden Allies May Unleash Super PAC," Sanders, 78, warned his potential supporters that endowment by wealthy donors could unfairly buoy former Vice President Biden, 76, into primary victory.
"It should not be a surprise that wealthy donors of the political establishment are trying to buy this election," Sanders said in his email. "Now we need to be ready for when they do."
Sanders, who claimed in April that his average individual donation was just $14, continued to slam high-dollar fundraising as a threat to the political process.
"Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to promote or attack candidates," his bid for more donations said. "They are a threat to our democracy. And frankly, they are a threat to our campaign and our hopes to transform our country."
Sanders outraised all other Democratic candidates in the first quarter of 2019 with $18.2 million and an average donation of $34, but he stalled in the second quarter, raising $18 million with the average being only $18. Biden's average donation in quarter two was $49, and he has added support of large donors since that time.
Appealing to the working class, which has always been Sanders' primary campaign target, he continued to decry sourcing funds from wealthy donors or groups.
"The antidote to a super PAC is a political revolution funded by working people, chipping in what they can," he said. "We are the only campaign that is entirely funded by grassroots donations from start to finish. And so now we are asking you to chip in what you can before our FEC fundraising deadline."
Sanders signed his plea for funds with a request for just $2.70.

'The woman was bad news': Diplomats defend US ambassador to Ukraine who Trump fired and denounced

Texto completo: Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled by President Trump as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and denigrated by him in the phone call that is now at the center of a whistleblower complaint and potential impeachment proceedings, was born in Canada to parents who fled Nazi and Soviet oppression.
Yovanovitch, 60, is a career official who was twice chosen for ambassadorships by President George W. Bush and once, to Ukraine, by President Barack Obama. Trump said of her on the call: “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news,” Trump said in their July 25 conversation, according to a transcript released by the White House. “She’s going to go through some things.”
That prompted widespread condemnation from American diplomats. “The threatening tone of this statement is deeply troubling,” the American Academy of Diplomacy said in a statement. “Whatever views the Administration has of Ambassador Yovanovitch’s performance, we call on the Administration to make clear that retaliation for political reasons will not be tolerated.”
Former senior State Department career official Dan Fried told the New York Times: “It’s more than crazy — it’s ugly, it’s threatening. Masha Yovanovitch is known as a straight arrow, disciplined, professional. If you take out Masha Yovanovitch, you send the message to every ambassador that we will not have your back."
At her confirmation hearing in June 2016, she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that she had arrived in the U.S. at age three and joined the foreign service in 1986. "My parents’ lives were changed forever by communist and Nazi regimes,” she said. “They survived poverty, war and displacement, and finally arrived in the United States, with me in tow, in search of freedom, opportunity, dignity and accountability. The very values that Ukrainians demanded in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity.”
That autobiographical aside hinted at how she would approach her job as the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, as she emphasized the need for rule of law in Ukraine while invoking the history of the Soviet occupation of Ukraine that Kremlin propagandists try to obscure. But Yovanovitch’s tenure in Kyiv was curtailed by a controversy that State Department officials regarded at the time as a disinformation campaign by corrupt Ukrainian officials who played on President Trump’s political interests in order to protect their own careers.
“I think President Trump, in the wake of the Mueller investigation having been concluded — and there not being any accusation of collusion — is now going on the offensive,” Kurt Volker, the State Department’s special representative for the Ukraine crisis, said in May. “That is all domestic political narrative.”
That defense came too late for Yovanovitch, who had returned from Kyiv days earlier after the president and his family echoed attacks on her integrity that were lodged by a Ukrainian prosecutor distrusted by the State Department. And Volker’s views did not deter Trump from attacking Yovanovitch and appearing to praise the prosecutor in the subsequent controversial phone call with Zelensky.
Yovanovitch, who was raised in Connecticut, was appointed U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in the final year of Obama’s presidency. Bush had chosen her as ambassador to Kyrgyzstan in 2005 and Armenia in 2008. Before then, she had been deputy chief of mission in Ukraine from 2001 to 2004.
Trump’s comments were an extraordinary display of animosity, particularly to another head of state, according to prominent former U.S. diplomats.
The president criticized Yovanovitch while urging Zelensky to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and to probe allegations that former Vice President Joe Biden had worked to kill an investigation into a Ukrainian company that had hired his son, Hunter Biden. That exchange reflected Trump’s confidence in allegations raised by then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yurie Lutsenko.
Ukraine's outgoing prosecutor general had told an American journalist that he had evidence of former Ukrainian officials coordinating with Hillary Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 presidential election. Lutsenko had accused Yovanovitch of instructing him not to investigate numerous people, a claim he would eventually retract. Volker, without mentioning Lutsenko by name, panned those allegations as a desperate ploy to develop a political alliance in Washington that would convince Zelensky to keep him in office.
“Other people in Ukraine are trying to use the U.S. domestic politics as a vehicle for their own engagement, either in fighting their domestic enemies inside Ukraine or trying to feel like they’ve got some special relationship with people in the United States,” Volker said at the Carnegie event.
But Lutsenko had already met in private with Giuliani, who hopes to prove that the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2020 engaged in corruption to protect his son. And Volker would subsequently put Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, in contact with the new president. Giuliani’s interactions with Ukrainian officials have stoked suspicions that Trump’s team is trying to press Ukraine to investigate his political opponents heading into the 2020 election season.
“I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop,” Giuliani said in early May. “And I’m going to give them reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”
It’s a turn of events that Yovanovitch could not have envisioned during her confirmation, which focused on how the U.S. could fortify Ukraine in the midst of a war with Russia, even as Moscow denies invading the former Soviet vassal state. The U.S. diplomat touted the appointment of Lutsenko — whom she praised for his “commit[ment] to reforming” the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office — as a victory for the rule of law.
“Ukraine has made more important progress on reforms in the last two years than it did in its first 23 years of independence,” she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in her prepared testimony. “These reform achievements are all the more impressive given that they have come in the face of Russian aggression. The best defense against Russian aggression is a successful Ukraine."

Ansel Elgort’s best clapback at The Goldfinch critics: His mom liked the film

Texto completo: Pipe down, critics. The Goldfinch star Ansel Elgort wants you to know that the film is good, despite negative reviews, because his mom said so.
Celebrities are notoriously thin-skinned, but this defense takes millennial hypersensitivity to the next level.
“The film does work, and people who see it enjoy it and are moved by it,” Elgort said on his Instagram story last weekend. “The most important person it moved for me was my mother, and she’s not moved by all my films. But she really liked this one, so that made me really like it, too.”
And the critics across America, hearing that Elgort’s mother approved of his performance, collectively changed their minds.
Wait, that’s not how that works.
The fact is, every movie star is going to have some duds. From Meryl Streep to Leonardo DiCaprio, plenty of famous actors have starred in films that flopped. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re bad actors; it means the films are not worth defending with this level of passion.
So you starred in a bad movie. Move on.
When one fan posted Elgort’s video to Twitter, many comments said something to the effect of, “The film wasn’t that good, but I liked the book!” or “The film wasn’t that good, but it wasn’t terrible!” That doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the movie.
Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Goldfinch has earned accolades such as CNN’s “dull” and the New York Times’ “strictly for the birds.” If the movie is bad, critics should say so. That’s not rude; that’s how movie reviews work.
For his part, Elgort couldn’t even argue that the movie was good. The best he could say was that “there is a lot of good in the film, too.” Sure there is.
The 25-year-old should be used criticism by now. Columnist Ross Douthat wrote that in the 2017 film Baby Driver, Elgort “seems way too much like a soft kid with a punchable face who wouldn’t really last an hour in this world.”
That’s tough. But if Elgort has the same reaction every time his work receives criticism, it might just be true in real life.

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump, le dijo este jueves a un grupo de funcionarios que quiere saber quién suministró la información sobre su llamada al presidente de Ucrania, lo que provocó que la Cámara de Representantes haya iniciado un juicio político en su contra.
El presidente insinuó que les castigaría con la pena de muerte, según ha reportado el diario The New York Times, lo que sorprendió a algunos en la audiencia.
“Quiero saber quién es la persona que le dio la información al informante porque eso se acerca a un espía”, dijo Trump. “¿Sabes qué solíamos hacer en los viejos tiempos cuando éramos inteligentes con los espías y la traición, cierto? Solíamos manejarlo un poco diferente de lo que hacemos ahora”, agregó.
Asimsimo, Trump indicó que el informante no había escuchado la llamada en cuestión y que había obtenido detalles a través de los comentarios de varios oficiales.
El informante, que aún no ha sido identificado, lo reconoció aunque citó cuentas de la Casa Blanca relacionadas con “negocios interagenciales oficiales”, reportó Los Angeles Times.
El mandatario ha hecho las declaraciones en una reunión con representantes estadounidenses ante la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU).
El mismo diario ha reportado que una persona presente en el evento le compartió una grabación de los comentarios del presidente.
Algunos asistentes rieron, como si se tratara de una broma.
Durante el evento al que no tuvo acceso la prensa, Trump se quejó varias veces del informante y criticó a los medios por haber reportado la denuncia, la cual describió como “deshonesta”.
Trump ha dicho también que la prensa es “escoria”.
La Comisión de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes ha hecho pública esta mañana la denuncia del informante.
El documento ha sido divulgado dos días después de que la presidenta la Cámara, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunciara el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump debido a los hechos vinculados a la llamada entre él y el presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, el 25 de julio.
“El presidente de Estados Unidos está usando el poder de su cargo para solicitar interferencia de un país extranjero en las elecciones de Estados Unidos en 2020” , ha dicho el informante.
En la denuncia, con fecha del 12 de agosto, el informante indica: “en los últimos cuatro meses, más de media docena de funcionarios de Estados Unidos me han informado de varios hechos relaciones con este esfuerzo”.
El informante dice que el abogado personal de Trump, Rudolph Giuliani, es una “figura central” en las acciones y que el procurador general, William Bar, “parece estar involucrado también” en la trama.
“La interferencia incluye, entre otras cosas, presionar a un país extranjero para investigar los principales rivales internos del presidente ”, señala el reporte.
Luego del evento en las Naciones Unidas, Trump participó en un evento de campaña para recoger fondos, de donde salió diciendo que la llamada es la “cosa más grandiosa” que le ha pasado al Partido Republicano porque había recaudado mucho dinero luego de la polémica.
El portavoz de la Casa Blanca no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios sobre el tema, ha señalado el diario.
Sobre el documento del informante, Stephanie Grisham, directora de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca, ha respondido diciendo que “no es más que una colección de relatos de eventos de terceros y recortes de prensa improvisados” .
La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, olvidó en un avión el discurso con el que iba a anunciar el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump, ha informado la agencia de noticias Reuters.
Pelosi había pasado el fin de semana analizando las acusaciones en contra de Trump y empezó a redactar su discurso en un vuelo de Nueva York a Washington, pero lo dejo en un avión, ha dicho una persona familiarizada con el incidente
Sin embargo, no todo se perdió. “Al menos lo había organizado en su cabeza”, ha agregado la fuente.
Fue así como Pelosi reconstruyó el discurso de memoria, en el que dijo que las acciones de Trump ponían en peligro la seguridad nacional y violaban la Constitución.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A whistleblower complaint and Democratic outrage over President Donald Trump's discussions with the Ukrainian president have sparked yet another inquiry into Trump's interactions with foreign leaders and has spilled over into the 2020 presidential campaign.
The story folds together diplomatic efforts from both the Obama and Trump administrations. Here we've attempted to breakdown what everyone is talking about.
First, it's important to know the players, who include familiar and some not-so-familiar names. They are: Trump, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and current Ukrainian secretary general Yuriy Lutsenko.
At the heart of the matter are two developments that took place this summer: an August whistleblower complaint by a U. S. intelligence official and a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky. Democrats demanded the release of the call transcript and the whistleblower complaint, while they sought more information about Trump's and Giuliani's contacts with Ukraine.
A whistleblower complaint and a phone call
A whistleblower complaint Aug. 12 reported that the president "used the power of his office" to solicit foreign help to discredit one of his main political rivals. The whistleblower, who has not been identified publicly, detailed efforts by senior White House officials to "lock down" access to records of a phone call July 25 between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump urged his counterpart to investigate Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Democrats want to know more about Trump's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma Group, an energy company in Ukraine. They contend that using the levers of diplomatic engagement to dig up dirt on a political rival is an abuse of power and raises questions about whether the president's actions amount to illegal soliciting of campaign assistance from a foreign country. The issue has further fueled Democratic investigations into Trump, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24.
Trump acknowledged bringing up Biden in a phone call with Zelensky, but said the talk was appropriate.
"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption – all of the corruption taking place – and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine," Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas and Ohio.
Hunter Biden in Ukraine
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U. S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
Shokin was accused by U. S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.
But Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
Hunter Biden told the Times in May that he had "no role whatsoever" in the Ukrainian investigation of the company or any of its officers. The Post has reported there is "no evidence" Biden was trying to help his son.
Trump's call with Zelensky
On July 25, Trump called Zelensky, the Ukrainian president. Trump told Zelensky he could improve that country’s image by pursuing corruption cases.
Trump also withheld more than $250 million in security assistance that Congress had appropriated and that Ukraine desperately needed. But the Trump administration made the funding available earlier this month.
Trump-Ukraine phone call: Trump acknowledges bringing up Joe Biden in phone call with Ukraine president
The day after Trump’s call, Ambassador Kurt Volker, the U. S. special representative for Ukraine, was dispatched to meet with Zelensky. And days later, Giuliani met in Spain with Andriy Yermak, a Zelensky aide, to discuss a possible meeting between Trump and Zelensky.
Giuliani has tweeted allegations of Biden corruption repeatedly, at one point alleging “bribery, extortion, money laundering and fraud” by the Biden family in China and Ukraine.
Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield told The New York Times in May that Biden acted "without any regard for how it would or would not impact any business interests of his son, a private citizen. ”
Reviewing the whistleblower complaint
The Trump administration initially refused to provide the complaint to Congress because of concerns that the phone call was protected by executive privilege and because the targets of the complaint – Trump, Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr – weren't members of the intelligence community.
The inspector general for the director of national intelligence (DNI), Michael Atkinson, said in a Sept. 9 letter that the matter involves an "urgent concern," which is defined as "a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of the law," but "does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters. " Atkinson said a preliminary review found the complaint credible.
Such complaints are typically reported to Congress within seven days. But Atkinson said he hit an impasse with Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, over sharing the complaint with Congress. Atkinson said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not meet the definition of an “urgent concern. ” And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director’s jurisdiction because it didn't involve allegations concerning a member of the intelligence community or intelligence activity.
Atkinson said in a letter to Maguire he disagreed with that Justice Department opinion.
"I set forth my reasons for concluding that the subject matter involved in the complainant's disclosure not only falls within the DNI's jurisdiction, but relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the American people," Atkinson wrote.
The inspector general said he requested authorization to at the very least disclose the “general subject matter” to Congress but had not been allowed to do so. He said the information was “being kept” from Congress.
Biden: I never talked to son Hunter about overseas business dealings
On Sept. 25, the White House released a five-page memo summarizing the call and provided the whistleblower's nine-page complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees. The House panel released the complaint Sept. 26, at the start of a hearing with Maguire. The intelligence director and inspector general met privately with the Senate Intelligence Committee the same day.
Maguire told the House panel he delayed providing the complaint to Congress while consulting with the White House about executive privilege and with the Justice Department about whether the complaint qualified as an "urgent concern. " Maguire said the release of the call summary eliminated the concern about executive privilege, but that the Justice Department decided the complaint didn't qualify as an "urgent concern" because the targets weren't members of the intelligence community.
“Reports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the President’s communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security,” Pelosi said in a statement before announcing the impeachment inquiry.
Giuliani admits he talked to Ukraine about Biden
Congressional Democrats said they were appalled by the efforts of Trump and Giuliani to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.
"If he demanded a foreign government do his political bidding, that’s when he crossed the critical threshold," Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. , a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote on Twitter.
The dispute had been simmering as Congress investigated what was said during the call. But it began to boil over Sept. 19, when Giuliani gave an interview to CNN in which he first denied that he urged Ukraine to investigate and then acknowledged it.
“Of course I did,” Giuliani said during the rambling interview.
Giuliani said he met with Ukrainian officials on his own and then told Trump.
“I did what I did on my own,” Giuliani said. “I told him about it afterward. ”
In reaction to Trump's acknowledgment that he talked about Biden in the call with Ukraine's president, Murphy tweeted: "If an American president gets away with bullying foreign counties to do his political bidding then we should just give up and accept our new banana republic. "
Three congressional chairmen – Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. ; Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. ; and Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. – had announced Sept. 9 that they were demanding records from the White House and State Department about alleged attempts to manipulate Ukraine’s judicial system.
“As the 2020 election draws closer, President Trump and his personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice system in service of President Trump’s reelection campaign, and the White House and the State Department may be abetting this scheme,” said the letter from the Democratic chairmen.
The State Department has insisted that President Trump’s attorney is “a private citizen” who “does not speak on behalf of the U. S. Government. ” Yermak publicly stated that “it was not clear to him whether Mr. Giuliani was representing Mr. Trump in their talks. ”
House Democrats voice concerns
Schiff said the prospect of misconduct at the highest levels of government "raises grave concerns that your office, together with the Department of Justice and possibly the White House, are engaged in an unlawful effort to protect the President and conceal from the Committee information related to his possible 'serious or flagrant' misconduct, abuse of power, or violation of law. "
Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. , tweeted that withholding the complaint could become another part of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment investigation.
"This is deadly serious," Cicilline said. "If the President does not allow the whistleblower complaint against him to be turned over to Congress, we will add it to the Articles of Impeachment. "
Trump said the complaint was partisan, although he later said he didn’t know who made it.
"It’s a partisan whistleblower," Trump said.
Trump's response
Trump has said Biden should be investigated, but when speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump refused to describe his July call with the Ukrainian president and he dismissed the whistleblower complaint as a partisan attack.
"Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case," Trump said. "It's a disgrace. " Trump has denied any impropriety in the call.
"I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate," Trump said last week. "It's just another political hack job. "
Biden's response
Biden lashed out Sept. 20 at Trump's effort to push Ukraine to investigate him.
"Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one," Biden said during a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. . "So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president. ”
Biden then put out a statement late that evening.
"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country," the statement said. "This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor. "
Biden said Sept. 21 he has never spoken to his son about his business dealings overseas.
"Here’s what I know," he said. "Trump should be investigated. "

Giuliani's Ukraine gambit at core of complaint

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- When it comes to Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani became President Donald Trump's courier, attack dog, fixer and a self-described meddler in another country's affairs. His purpose was single-minded: get information "very, very helpful to my client."

To hear the intelligence-community whistleblower tell it in the complaint unwrapped Thursday, Giuliani was a one-man wrecking ball, breaking things in a complex international landscape and leaving actual diplomatic envoys to clean up his "damage."

To hear Giuliani tell it, "I will be the hero" in this episode and those who criticize him now are "morons." So he told The Atlantic magazine.

He was once called America's Mayor, the man whose moxie and grace in the death and rubble of 9/11 personified his stricken city and won him admiration around a shocked world.

Now he blends a sentiment that was familiar from that time and is familiar again in the world view of Trump himself: You're with us or against us.

Citing the accounts of mostly unidentified U.S. officials, and buttressed by Giuliani's own words from countless turns on Fox News, his tweets and newspaper interviews, the anonymous whistleblower pieces together a systematic effort by Giuliani on behalf of Trump to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his businessman son, Hunter.

Trump made that appeal explicitly in a July phone call with Ukraine's new president that is at the heart of the whistleblower's complaint. "I would like for you to do us a favor," Trump said.

But the whistleblower goes well beyond the phone call to lay out Giuliani's efforts back to late last year. He or she also traces the consternation that Giuliani's machinations were causing inside the U.S. administration and even among some people in the White House itself.

"Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani's circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President," says the whistleblower.

"These officials also told me that State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to ‘contain the damage' to U.S. national security," the whistleblower continues.

Kurt Volker, official U.S. envoy for Ukraine negotiations, and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, also met officials from the new Ukrainian administration and "sought to help Ukrainian leaders understand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official U.S. channels on the one hand, and from Mr. Giuliani on the other."

The complaint cites published reports of meetings Giuliani held with Ukraine's chief prosecutor in New York in January and Warsaw, Poland, in February, after a phone call he had late in 2018 with the prosecutor's predecessor. Giuliani associates later traveled to Kyiv and met the chief of the security service and another close adviser to the newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the complaint states.

This was the month Giuliani himself planned to go, and he was blunt to The New York Times about his purpose when his intended trip came to light. He intended to press for an investigation that would be helpful to Trump's reelection.

"We're meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do," he said. "There's nothing illegal about it," he went on, though "somebody could say it's improper."

The next day, he canceled the trip and complained about the lack of cooperation from the new Ukrainian administration. Zelenskiy is "surrounded by enemies of the (U.S) president," he said, "and of the United States."

In this period, the whistleblower says, citing the "general understanding" of U.S. officials close to the matter, the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that the prospects for a meeting or phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy would depend on whether the Ukrainian president "showed willingness to ‘play ball.'"

In June, Giuliani tweeted his frustration about Zelenskiy's "silence" on the matters he wanted him to pursue.

Then in July, says the whistleblower, "I learned of a sudden change of policy with respect to U.S. assistance for Ukraine" -- namely that Trump had personally instructed all U.S. agencies to suspend all military aid to Ukraine.

A week later, Trump and Zelenskiy had their July 25 phone call.

The complaint states that about a week after the call, Giuliani traveled to Madrid, Spain, to follow up with a Zelenskiy aide about matters arising from the phone call.

And about a week after that, Trump took a conciliatory tone, calling Zelenskiy a "very reasonable guy" and dangling the possibility of a White House visit for him. The two met this week at the United Nations. The military aid that had been held up was eventually released. There's no sign that the Bidens are under any official Ukrainian investigation for Hunter Biden's business relationships in that country when his father was vice president.

To the whistleblower, the episode shows Trump "using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election," with Giuliani "a central figure in this effort."

During the special counsel's Russia probe, Giuliani proved more useful for commanding headlines than in the courtroom. He became a staple on cable news, the face of a legal team that helped Trump emerge from the investigation with a less damaging result than many had expected.

Now Giuliani is doing some damage-control for himself, as some Republicans suggest Trump was ill-served by his interventions.

"It is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I'm not," he told The Atlantic. "And I will be the hero! These morons -- when this is over, I will be the hero."

‘Noncompete’ agreements harm workers

Texto completo: It’s a truism that capitalists don’t like competition — especially for workers. In recent decades, American companies have tried to limit this problem by requiring millions of employees to sign contracts prohibiting them from moving to rival firms.
The absurd and harmful proliferation of the practice is well illustrated by a recent survey that found 30 percent of the nation’s hair salons required stylists to sign noncompete agreements.
A few states, notably California, have long restricted the use of the tactic. And in 2008, Oregon passed an innovative law that barred noncompete agreements for most workers, including those making less than the median income for a family of four — $97,631 in 2018. A new study finds that the Oregon law made a big difference for workers, increasing both how often they changed jobs and how much they got paid.
There is no single explanation for the stagnation of workers’ income in recent decades, but a key reason is that negotiating power shifted from workers to employers. The rise of noncompete agreements is both a symptom, demonstrating the power of employers to dictate terms, and a cause, undermining the ability of workers to obtain a larger piece of the pie.
Defenders of the practice say it encourages companies to make investments, for example in employee training, since the company is more likely to reap the benefits. They also insist that workers are compensated for the loss of bargaining power with higher wages or greater job security. Indeed, some experts have asserted that the elimination of noncompete agreements would cause wages to fall, because workers would no longer be paid for signing.
The Oregon study shows that this theoretical model of labor markets bears little relationship to the lived reality. After the law took effect, job hopping increased by as much as 18 percent — and wages for workers no longer bound by noncompetes rose by as much as 21 percent.
Put plainly, the old rule allowed employers to suppress their workers’ pay.
Among the reasons: Workers are often required to sign noncompete agreements after they accept a job, when they no longer have as much leverage to negotiate. Workers also may not understand the terms, nor anticipate the consequences for their own careers.
There may be some case for allowing corporations to negotiate noncompete agreements with top executives or other particularly valuable employees — although states would do well to consider the example of California, where the absence of noncompetes has contributed to the rise of Silicon Valley. But allowing broad use of noncompetes harms workers.
A growing number of states have followed Oregon’s example in the past few years. Illinois went first, in 2016, banning noncompete agreements for workers making up to $13 an hour. Six more states have since passed new laws, ranging from Maryland, which drew the line at $15 an hour, or about $31,200 a year, all the way to Washington, which rendered noncompete restrictions unenforceable for workers making less than $100,000 a year. (The other states with new laws are in New England: Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.)
A Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, introduced federal legislation in January banning noncompete agreements for low-wage workers. In March, a bipartisan group of six senators, including Rubio, requested a Government Accountability Office study of the agreements, writing there was “no good reason” to let companies bind the hands of low-wage workers.
The Rubio bill needs to be broader. It would protect only workers who are eligible for overtime pay under federal law — mostly, employees earning less than $23,360 a year — a significantly lower threshold than in the Oregon law. It also needs stronger penalties for companies that break the rules. And Congress should consider protections for workers who may justifiably be subject to noncompete agreements, such as requiring any deal to be part of the job offer.
But the bill nonetheless offers a rare opportunity for bipartisan agreement. Congress should act to protect the freedom of American workers to seek jobs in an open marketplace.

Texto completo: This cartoonish counterterrorism satire is a slapstick circus that can't decide who is slapping whom.
A circular firing-squad of full-on crazy, Chris Morris's "The Day Shall Come" barges into American counterterrorism tactics with sledgehammer satire and a numbingly repetitive plot.
All credit to Marchánt Davis, then, for finding the deep pocket of poignancy in his beleaguered character, a Miami preacher and sidewalk revolutionary named Moses. Protesting gentrification and an assortment of social ills, Moses and his wife (a wonderfully wry Danielle Brooks) run a tattered urban farm where he and his ragtag band of followers plot to overthrow "the injustice of the white European." With the help of dinosaurs and ray guns.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Moses is clearly delusional, not evil, but tell that to Kendra (Anna Kendrick), the avid F.B.I. officer whose cartoonishly incompetent team sees an opportunity to log an easy homeland-security win. Enlisting a bemused informant (Kayvan Novak) to pose as an Arab terrorist, Kendra orchestrates a sting operation designed to entrap Moses rather than investigate him. What follows can only be described as a pileup of screw-ups, a slapstick circus that can't decide who is slapping whom.
Assuring us via title card that the movie is "based on a hundred true stories," Morris (who wrote the script with Jesse Armstrong) comes nowhere close to the bitingly smart humor of his 2010 jihadist satire, "Four Lions." Moreover, thanks to Davis's perfectly guileless performance, we never forget we're laughing at the pointless persecution of a harmless, mentally ill indigent.
That nagging discomfort could be what sinks "The Day Shall Come." Or maybe it's felled simply by the challenge of writing satire at a time when the headlines of "The Onion" are not that much different from those of The New York Times.

How Much Will Battle To Impeach Hurt Stocks?

Texto completo: Political drama seldom alters economic fundamentals. But it can influence presidential behavior, which in turn can affect economic policy.
From the date burglars broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex in 1972 until the resignation of President Richard Nixon two years later, the S&P 500 fell 25 percent.
That might seem to be evidence that impeachment battles and constitutional crises are bad for business and, consequently, for financial markets. Except in that same span, the West German stock market fell by 26 percent, despite the absence of any equivalent political crisis. And during a more recent impeachment, Bill Clinton's in 1998, the S&P actually rose 22 percent.
In the 1970s, markets weren't responding to troubles and high drama in Washington; they were adjusting to oil embargoes and a spike in inflation. In 1998, they reflected a booming economy. And those episodes have something to tell us today as an effort to impeach President Trump begins.
On Tuesday afternoon, some analysts attributed a drop in major stock indexes, as well as a rally in Treasury bonds, to the opening of the impeachment inquiry. But these historical episodes of impeachment drama show that any moves driven by political headlines tend to be modest and short-lived. Economic fundamentals matter a lot more.
So don't be surprised by an occasional day in which activity in Washington appears to move markets. "A surge of buying moved into the market yesterday morning after reports circulated that several high-level figures in the Nixon administration were resigning in connection with the Watergate affair," The New York Times reported in May 1973.
But do be surprised if these effects turn out to be more than temporary blips. After reviewing market and economic trends in the Nixon and Clinton impeachment periods, economists at Cornerstone Macro found that whatever had preceded the political tumult simply continued.
"Although there were days when moves were outsized, in both examples markets simply continued a trend that was already in place and attributable to other factors," wrote Roberto Perli, Melissa Turner and Andrea Vera in a note to clients.
They conclude that the existing market trend -- reflecting a global economic slowdown particularly concentrated in manufacturing -- is likely to persist, unaffected by the president's latest troubles.
The question for a potential Trump impeachment seems less about the instant reaction to the latest developments, and more about whether there could be a feedback loop between impeachment and economic policy.
The ups and downs of the trade wars have been the major driver of economic and financial developments in 2019, much as the oil embargo was in 1973 and the dot-com boom was in 1998. And trade is an area over which Mr. Trump has direct control.
The question will be whether the distraction of an impeachment investigation occupies his attention enough to make escalation of the trade wars less likely, or causes him to act more provocatively on that front, perhaps to try to redirect public attention.
The White House is already signaling that the impeachment effort will stymie any legislative deal-making. "House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks," the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement Tuesday.
In general, gridlock is perfectly fine for the economy and markets. Let's imagine, for example, that impeachment means that the Trump administration's renegotiated North American trade deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, fails to advance in Congress. It would still be unlikely to do any major economic damage unless Mr. Trump reacted by trying to pull the United States out of the existing NAFTA deal.
Similarly, it is an open question whether an impeachment investigation will make the president too distracted to impose more aggressive tariffs on Chinese or European imports, or make him feel backed into a corner and willing to take bold but economically risky action.
All of which means that to assess the eventual market implications of a Trump impeachment, it's not really a matter of economic analysis. It may ultimately be about behavioral analysis.

Texto completo: A risk to L.G.B.T. Americans' health. Also: A Jewish relic from a death camp; women who have been abused.
To the Editor:
Re "Does Sexual Equality Law Cover Gay Workers? Justices Will Rule" (front page, Sept. 24):
The Justice Department's move to support discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. employees is the latest in a series of efforts by the Trump administration to undermine the basic rights of these Americans, and it will jeopardize their health.
Many Americans will lose their jobs and their health insurance if the Supreme Court sides with the Justice Department. It will also contribute to stigma against the L.G.B.T.Q. community, reinforcing a barrier to health care.
For example: Nearly a quarter of transgender Americans have avoided seeing a doctor out of fear that they will be mistreated. The administration's goal of ending the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic in America by 2030 will also be undermined.
If the L.G.B.T.Q. community, which is already disproportionately affected by H.I.V.-AIDS, can't gain access to sexual health services, including H.I.V. treatment and prevention, we can't end the epidemic.
Preventing new H.I.V. diagnoses is not only the right thing to do, but it would also save taxpayer dollars.
Condoning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity isn't just inhumane. It is fiscally reckless, and it puts lives at risk.

The Shofar That Survived Auschwitz
To the Editor:
"Show of Faith: A Jewish Relic That Survived" (front page, Sept. 22) reinforces the power of hope and faith.
Auschwitz was the center of death. The Nazi program of annihilation of the Jewish people left few chances for survival. The shofar, the ram's horn sounded at the High Holy Days, symbolizes the desperate clinging to life itself.
The word "miracle" is frequently used to describe the rays of light that kept certain survivors alive. Auschwitz was hell on earth, and yet that still, small voice of faith was heard.
The High Holy Days will have more meaning this year after learning about this improbable relic.

Justice for Abused Women
To the Editor:
Re "I Killed My Partner. It Saved My Life" (Sunday Review, Sept. 8):
I was glad to see Arlene Adams's story and that she, unlike so many women who defend themselves against a violent abuser, did not receive life or a long sentence in prison. Research has shown that most women break the law for reasons of survival.
In Michigan, at least a third of the women convicted and sentenced to life or long sentences for murder were defending themselves or their families against violent abusers. More than half of these women are black. Many could not get the police, courts or politicians to protect them when they called for help, yet they were severely punished for defending themselves alone.
At least one woman is murdered by a husband or a boyfriend every six days in Michigan. That number has not diminished in the last decade. Whether in face-to-face combat with violent abusers or threatened with death, women who fight for their lives are survivors, not threats to society.
Some states -- California and New York, for example -- have passed laws to give incarcerated women who defended themselves a second chance at reduced sentences and freedom. So-called battered spouse syndrome laws, as well as prosecutors, judges and defense lawyers, have failed most women.
Our criminal-legal system will serve women and all of society better when it offers support and opportunity instead of punishment.

Texto completo: By honoring India's divisive and authoritarian prime minister Narendra Modi, the foundation is going against its professed belief of considering every life valuable.
NEW DELHI -- On Tuesday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation presented Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister of India, with one of its Global Goal Awards in New York. The Gates Foundation has chosen to honor Mr. Modi for his Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, or Clean India Mission, which claims to have built 100 million new toilets in India over the past five years.
The initiative is a commendable one, but its impact since its inception is open to question. More than 300 million Indians were still defecating in the open in 2017, according to the World Bank. The Clean India campaign claimed that from 2014 to 2018, the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were fully or almost fully free from open defecation.
Data from independent sources tempers these claims significantly. A working paper published by the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics, which works on health in rural India, and Accountability Initiative, a research group at a leading Indian think tank, calculated that the percentage of people defecating in the open in those states had indeed gone down -- from 77 percent in 2014 to 44 percent in 2018 -- but not by nearly as much as the government claimed.
The campaign has also largely ignored the question of "manual scavenging," the removal and disposal of human waste with bare hands by Dalit men and women. In the past three years, 88 sanitation workers died while cleaning septic tanks and sewers, according to Indian government data.
Bezwada Wilson, a renowned activist who has been fighting to end this repugnant practice, pointed out that Mr. Modi's flagship program seems to be counting on the persistence of manual scavenging. A day after Mr. Modi received the award in New York, two young Dalits were killed for defecating in the open in Madhya Pradesh.
Along with other staff at the India office of the Gates Foundation, I first heard about Mr. Modi being considered for the award a few months ago. I did not realize that the decision had already been made. It took me until early August to raise my questions, but I saw very quickly that the foundation had taken the decision and considered it irrevocable. That this endorsement of Mr. Modi would not do the Gates Foundation any good did not seem to be up for discussion.
I had joined the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation because I truly believed in its mission -- that every life has equal value and all people deserve healthy lives. I resigned from it for the exact same reason. By presenting Mr. Modi with this award, the Gates Foundation is going against its own core belief. It has the prerogative to interpret its own ideology as it sees fit -- in this case in a very narrow manner -- but I will continue to believe in the spirit of the words.
The Gates Foundation has chosen to celebrate a single, questionable initiative of Mr. Modi's government. It has completely disregarded how his politics have filled the lives of marginalized communities in India and the territories it controls with fear and insecurity, let alone that he has transformed India into a majoritarian, Hindu nationalist state.
Mr. Modi does not deserve to be embraced. The United States, where Mr. Modi received the Gates award, refused him a visa in 2005 for "severe violations of religious freedom," after a brutal pogrom against Muslims in the state of Gujarat -- where Mr. Modi was chief minister -- left over a thousand dead. (The ban wasn't lifted until Mr. Modi's election as prime minister, in 2014.)
As of Sept. 1, almost two million people in the state of Assam have been rendered stateless. The updated list of citizens, known as the National Register of Citizenship, was created with a view to target "illegal immigration" from the neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has promised to carry out the exercise across India and "remove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddha, Hindus and Sikhs." It is a clear threat against every Dalit, Muslim, Christian and Jewish citizen of the country -- the absolute opposite of the Gates Foundation's mission of considering all lives equal.
And as I write, Mr. Modi's recent assault on Kashmir is foremost on my mind. Seven million people are currently under virtual incarceration in Indian-occupied Kashmir. That is my home, and those are my people. On Aug. 5, Mr. Modi's government unilaterally abrogated the semiautonomous status of Kashmir after placing the valley of Kashmir under a military siege and cutting off phone, internet and television connections.
Despite Mr. Modi's rhetoric about bringing greater economic growth to Kashmir, the suffering of the people of Kashmiris has only been exacerbated by his actions. By Tuesday evening, as the Gates Foundation presented the award to Mr. Modi in Manhattan, Kashmir completed 51 days of being cut off from the rest of the world. There are reports of illegal detention and torture of teenagers, of night raids terrorizing families, sparing no one.
Mr. Modi's government is explicitly following what United Nations human rights experts have described as the "collective punishment" of the people of Kashmir. The lockdown and the communications blackout has made it difficult for patients to reach hospitals and access lifesaving drugs in time. And it has banned foreign reporters from Kashmir.
Several staff members at the Seattle and New Delhi offices of the foundation expressed their concerns about the decision to reward Mr. Modi, but the foundation publicly chose to normalize him. They claim that the award is "specifically for achievements in sanitation."
As world leaders meet at the United Nations General Assembly this week and questions are raised about Kashmir and Mr. Modi's policies in India, the Gates Foundation has provided him with a global platform to divert attention, to change the narrative. But the problem with the award wasn't merely its timing, which made it a public relations disaster for the foundation. The decision to honor Mr. Modi would be wrong on any date.
The celebration of Mr. Modi by an organization that stands for the betterment of the most vulnerable simply cannot be justified. If major, powerful nonprofit organizations endorse such polarizing politicians, then who speaks for the vulnerable and the neglected?
The Gates Foundation has crossed the wide gulf between working with a regime and endorsing it. That is not the pragmatic agnosticism of an organization working with the government of the day, but a choice of siding with power. I will choose to walk a different path.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- When the White House first released the reconstructed transcript of President Trump's July 25 phone conversation with the president of Ukraine, some former government officials noticed something peculiar about it.
The document lacked a standard marking in its upper right-hand corner, known as a "package number," or the number that the National Security Council officials would assign to the transcript as they logged it for storage.
Instead, it bore the marking "[PkgNumberShort]," which former officials, including one who served in the Trump White House, said was an indication that the document had not been formally placed into the council's carefully organized records system according to normal practice.
The full meaning of that became clear on Thursday only with the release of the complaint by an anonymous whistle-blower brought against Mr. Trump. The complaint explained that the transcript of the call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was handled in a highly unusual manner, stored not in the National Security Council's main computer system but in a far more secret and restricted system maintained by intelligence officials within the White House.
The whistle-blower, whom The New York Times has identified as a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to the White House, alleges that the National Security Council took an extra and previously unknown step to shield Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky from all but a very small number of officials by assigning it to that system.
The rough transcript of Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky was stored in a system operated by the agency's intelligence directorate "solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive -- rather than national security sensitive" information, the whistle-blower wrote. He added that White House officials told him it was "not the first time" Trump officials had confined a presidential transcript that way.
The more secure system is designed to hold delicate information about covert actions, intelligence programs and other highly classified activities, several former National Security Council officials said. Records of presidential calls with foreign leaders would be stored there only rarely, they said, in cases where those topics were discussed with close American partners like the leaders of Britain and Israel.
Accessing that special database requires enhanced desktop computer software not granted to all National Security Council officials. In extreme cases, agency aides must physically enter the offices of the intelligence directorate to read documents stored in the system. In the Obama White House, delicate documents were often hand delivered in a thick leather folder bearing the National Security Council seal and had to be returned.
The handling of the Ukraine call transcript has raised alarms among Democrats in Congress and former national security officials of both parties, including ones who served in the Trump administration. They agreed that nothing about the conversation appears to warrant placement in the extra-secure system.
"We need to look into the allegation that this may not be the only communication of a potentially corrupt character that was shielded by this classified information computer system abused for that purpose," Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Thursday at the Capitol.
Mr. Schiff and other Democrats say it appears that the White House sought to hide Mr. Trump's effort to pressure Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election, and his son Hunter Biden, as well as to pursue conspiracy theories that hold that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 presidential election.
"During my tenure, I had no knowledge of documents being moved out for political sensitivity," said a former Trump White House official familiar with the system. "I don't know the legality of what was done. It certainly feels unethical." The official said that decisions to move documents to different levels of classification typically involve the National Security Council's legal office.
All officials at the agency, whose size has ranged from about 100 to 150 staff members in recent years, have security clearances that allow them access to a shared classified computer network on which countless documents are stored, many of them categorized at relatively low levels of secrecy.
Stored on the less-classified network are transcripts of presidential calls with foreign leaders, which past White Houses have actively distributed widely among national security and foreign policy officials on secure email systems.
After embarrassing leaks in 2017, in which two transcripts of Mr. Trump's calls with foreign leaders were published in the news media, the Trump White House cut the number of people to whom phone call records were distributed.
In the case of Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky, White House officials appear to have concluded that it was not enough to limit distribution of the document, and made it impossible to read by all but a select few N.S.C. staff members. They did so by housing it in the far more restricted system, which requires software that most officials do not have.
Even those White House aides granted access to the more secret system must have specific permission to read individual documents there, which are known as Sensitive Compartmented Information and organized by code words. One former agency staff member said that in the most extreme cases, it might be necessary for an aide to physically visit the intelligence directorate to read certain documents.
Larry Pfeiffer, a former career intelligence official who served as White House Situation Room director during the Obama administration, said that the risk of political embarrassment is not adequate grounds for placing an N.S.C. document in a system designed for national security matters like the operation to kill Osama bin Laden.
"Clearly, someone made a decision that this conversation needed to be locked down," Mr. Pfeiffer said. "You read this conversation and there is nothing 'compartmented' from an intelligence perspective."
"Anyone with half a brain can read it and understand why they wanted to protect the distribution," he added.

7 interesting things to know about Ukraine

Texto completo: A spotlight has been shined on the country of Ukraine and its newly-minted leader, as a call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are at the center of a whistle-blower complaint and subsequent impeachment inquiry.
Amid all the news involving Ukraine, here are some interesting tidbits about the country.
1. A part of it is (disputedly) the geographical center of Europe
Several countries have staked claims on the title — and Ukraine is one of them. According to travel guide company Lonely Planet, Ukraine contends that Europe's geographical center lies near Rakhiv, which is in the southeastern part of the country.
There was even a monument erected in the 1980s, according to Lonely Planet, and is now surrounded by restaurants and shops.
However, Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings wrote in a CNN piece that the exact center of Europe is widely disputed, with several other countries — including Ukrainian neighbors Poland and Belarus — claiming the title. The National Geographic Institute of France made its own declaration in 1989, assigning the title to a spot in Lithuania, according to Jennings.
2. It's currently (still) in a border conflict with Russia over Crimea
If the term “Crimea" sounds familiar, it's because the peninsula in southern Ukraine dominated news headlines in 2014, when it was annexed by Russian President Vladimir Putin — an action that was condemned internationally.
Russian troops swept Crimea just days after the February 2014 ouster of Ukraine's Russia-friendly president, catching the West by surprise. Putin has claimed that Russia "reintegrated" Crimea to protect ethnic Russians who made up the majority of Crimea's population from Ukrainian nationalists.
The situation gained even more scorn on the world stage after a Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down over the area, killing all 298 people on board.
Five years later, eastern Ukraine is still engaged in low-level conflict, and continues to rely on several allies, including the United States, for money and aid. (That's why Trump ordering a hold on $400 million to Ukraine ahead of his call with the president there has become such a big deal.)
3. Its president is a popular comedian with no political experience
Zelensky, 41, was elected in April with 73 percent of the vote against the incumbent, Petro O. Poroshenko.
Zelensky — who is also the nation's first Jewish leader — played the Ukrainian president on a popular TV show for years.
"Throughout all of my life, I tried to do everything to make Ukrainians laugh," he said as he was sworn in the following month. "In the next five years I will do everything, Ukrainians, so that you don't cry."
Zelensky's victory reflected Ukrainians' exhaustion with widespread corruption and the country's political elite. Minutes after he was sworn in, Zelensky dissolved the country's parliament, slamming it as a hot-bed of self-enrichment, and promised to stop the war in the east against Russian-backed separatists.
4. It houses Chernobyl
Interest in the nuclear power plant disaster of April 1986 has spiked recently, as HBO rolled out the five-part miniseries “Chernobyl" in the spring. (It won several Emmys on Sunday, including for best limited series.)
The disaster, which happened in Soviet Ukraine just north of Kiev, resulted in the deaths of 31 people (although the total death toll is thought to be much higher).
The Exclusion Zone has experienced an increase in tourism in the past year, part of a concerted effort by the Ukrainian government.
5. Its capital, Kiev, is a fairly popular tourist destination
A travel piece published in The New York Times in 2012 calls Kiev “one of Europe's most vibrant 21st-century cities," citing new approaches to traditional Ukrainian cuisine (“the Ukrainians are the Italians of Eastern Europe when it comes to the love of good food"), its contemporary art scene, and a “delirious dance-til-dawn night life."
Kiev, according to the Times, is a “weekend magnet for European and Russian fashionistas," with an aesthetic that includes “brightly colored buildings" and glittering gold domes.
6. It's known for cuisine staples like borscht and 'chicken Kiev'
Borscht is a versatile soup, with myriad variations, but the common ingredient is always beets, according to a 2014 Globe restaurant review (you can find it locally at Cafe St. Petersburg in Newton). A 2018 recipe for vegetarian borscht calls it “a hearty sweet-and-sour bowl."
Meanwhile, chicken Kiev is made by pounding cutlets flat, rolling them around a log of butter, and then breading and frying them, according to Food & Wine.
Locals also like to drink a Ukrainian version of vodka called “gorilka" or “horilka."
7. It has its own place in US pop culture
If “Seinfeld" has taught us anything, it's this: Don't make the mistake of calling Ukraine “weak" on the subway.
In a famous scene from “Seinfeld," Kramer and Newman are playing a game on a New York City subway train, as Kramer flaunts his fantasy-military power. When Newman said he wasn't out of the game yet because he still had troops in Ukraine, Kramer laughed in response.
“You know what Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck," Kramer said. “The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble."
At that, a stranger in a fur Cossack hat turns around and says, “I come from Ukraine. Do not say Ukraine weak."
Kramer responded, “We're playing a game here, pal."
The stranger then grew outraged, shouting, “Ukraine is game to you?" before smashing the board game.

Texto completo: Psst. We're going to let you in on a secret:
Diana Krall, Christian McBride, Kenny Barron, Dave Holland, Chris Botti and Eliane Elias are all pretty darn good.
OK, so that's hardly breaking news. You probably don't need us to tell you that these artists are worth seeing during the 62nd annual Monterey Jazz Festival Friday through Sunday at the Monterey County Fair and Event Center.
But sometimes the high point of the festival is discovering new favorite artists. So we're recommending nine acts (and one movie) that might not be on your radar.
Larkin Poe
Performing >> 1 p.m. Saturday on Jimmy Lyons Stage; 3 p.m. Saturday on Garden Stage
The skinny >> We know that it can be hard to get to the festival in time to see the first act on the Jimmy Lyons Stage. But, trust us, it will be worth your effort to catch Larkin Poe, the amazingly soulful and powerful blues-rock outfit featuring Nashville-based sisters Rebecca and Megan Lovell. Sure, if you miss them at 1 p.m., you can always watch their 3 p.m. set on the more intimate Garden Stage. Yet, Larkin Poe is so awesome that we're seriously considering catching both of their sets at the festival. And maybe you should as well.
Allison Au Quartet
Performing >> 4:30 p.m. Saturday on Garden Stage
The skinny >> Au is one of the top talents on the Canadian jazz scene, a gifted saxophonist-composer-bandleader who won a Juno Award (Canada's equivalent of a Grammy) for best jazz album for her latest full-length, 2016's "Forest Grove." Her music is bold and boundless, weaving a number of influences into something that is both truly modern and truly special.
Leyla McCalla
Performing >> 6 p.m. Sunday on Garden Stage
The skinny >> The acclaimed vocalist-cellist, who many know for her work in the Grammy-winning string band the Carolina Chocolate Drops, is at the top of her game on "The Capitalist Blues." It's the New Orleans resident's third solo outing, following 2013's "Vari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes" and 2016's "A Day for the Hunter, A Day for the Prey," and it absolutely pulses with the varied sounds, flavors and vibes of Fat City.
Pamela Rose and Terrence Brewer
Performing >> 3:30 p.m. Saturday at Dizzy's Den
The skinny >> Don't miss your chance to catch two Bay Area musical treasures celebrate their new album, "Don't Worry Bout Me Remembering Ella & Joe," which honors the musical partnership of legendary vocalist Ella Fitzgerald and guitarist extraordinaire Joe Pass.
Rose and Brewer are definitely the right pair for this job. Rose is a versatile and powerful vocalist who is equally comfortable belting blues or jazz, while Brewer can fret it up with the best of them.
Michael Mayo
Performing >> 8:30 p.m. Saturday at Night Club
The skinny >> He's one of the more promising new voices in the industry, with a knack for combining jazz and soul in sleek, shiny, yet still wholly natural sounding ways. Hear that voice even once and you'll understand why such established artists as Herbie Hancock and Josh Groban have decided to work with Mayo over the years.
Connie Han Trio
Performing >> 7 p.m. Friday at Night Club
The skinny >> People are expecting big things from Han, a 23-year-old jazz pianist who released her major label debut, "Crime Zone," on Mack Avenue last year. Notably, Han was featured in Jazziz magazine's "The Shape of Jazz to Come: Artists to Watch in 2019" and selected as one of 12 jazz musicians to keep an eye on in 2019 by Paste Magazine.
Kenny Stahl
Performing >> 12:30 p.m. Sunday at Dizzy's Den
The skinny >> Start off the last day of the 62nd Monterey Jazz Festival with some outstanding jazz flute work, courtesy of this accomplished Chicago-raised musician.
He's worked with so many notable artists over the years, from Stevie Wonder and Jaco Pastorius to Cal Tjader and Lee Greenwood, but he's also managed to put together an impressive solo career.
Sasha Berliner
Performing >> 8:30 p.m. Saturday at Pacific Jazz Cafe
The skinny >> Those who dig the vibes should try to see this up-and-coming San Francisco musician, who has been featured in Hot House Jazz Magazine, "PBS NewsHour," NPR, The New York Times and other publications/shows of note. She honed her skills as a teen at the Oakland School for the Arts and went on to study with vibraphone great Stefon Harris at the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York.
Next Generation Jazz Orchestera
Performing >> 4:30 p.m. Saturday at North Coast Brewing Co. Jazz Education Stage; 12:30 p.m. Sunday at Jimmy Lyons Stage
The skinny >> Don't miss the stars of tomorrow during these showcases of great, young talent from around the country. Directed by Paul Contos, this year's orchestra features several Northern California musicians: Daiki Nakajima (tenor saxophone) from Prospect High School in Saratoga; Grady Flamm (trumpet) from Rio Americano High School in Sacramento; Ethan Pires (trumpet) from Northgate High School in Walnut Creek; and Joe Turgeon (trombone) from Jesuit High School in Sacramento;
Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool'
Screening >> 5 p.m. Friday at Jazz Theater
The skinny >> The No. 1 pro tip for the festival is not to ignore the cool films being shown for no additional charge at the Jazz Theater. It's a good way to break up the day, get off your feet and out of the sun, and learn more about some fascinating subjects.
And, really, who in popular music history is more fascinating than Miles Davis? This brand-new documentary, directed by Stanley Nelson, looks absolutely superb. The other two films being shown this year are "Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes" at 5 p.m. Saturday and "Mary Lou Williams: The Lady Who Swings the Band" at 4:30 p.m. Sunday.

Of course Hunter Biden, the 49-year-old child, is fair game

Texto completo: Save for public appearances with their parents, there's no reason for the media to report on any private behavior of Malia and Sasha Obama or Tiffany and Barron Trump. Let Malia enjoy her music festivals in peace. Stick to Tiffany's Instagram to follow her jet-setting adventures. The kids of politicians who don't follow their parents footsteps into public life ought to retain their right to privacy.
But those who ride on their parents' coattails are and always have been a different story.
Ivanka Trump influences federal policy and actively, by her own volition, represents America on the world stage solely by virtue of her father's election. Chelsea Clinton actively campaigned for her mother in both the 2008 and 2016 election cycles, serves on the board of not-so-apolitical Clinton Foundation, and now and then talks of running for office herself.
Sure, the media ought not to pry into their personal lives absent any impropriety. But if they are corrupt, how is that not fair game?
Which brings us to Hunter Biden, who according to the New York Times' Michael Barbaro, is just a very large, 49-year-old child.
Tweet
Unlike his late brother Beau Biden, the younger Biden hasn't served in elected office. But Hunter Biden has overwhelmingly chosen to enter public life using his father as leverage. Although the media has focused on Biden's controversial role on the board of the Ukranian Burisma Holdings, his apparent nepotistic advantage goes back decades. Fresh out of law school, Biden became the deputy campaign manager of his father's reelection campaign and got a job with MBNA America — one of his dad's largest donors at the time. From there, Hunter worked his way from one lucrative appointment to the next, all while apparently popping in on his father's political career and serving as his envoy.
Biden is also an absolute mess of a human being. He was dishonorably discharged from the military for cocaine use. He left his wife of more than two decades to date his dead brother's wife, then left her in turn to move to Los Angeles and marry a woman he knew for exactly one week. He has since been sued by another woman demanding child support for his alleged illegitimate offspring.
Biden apparently suffers from long-running substance abuse issues, making his dishonorable discharge relevant to the question of why he earned the Burisma appointment in the first place. That shouldn't necessarily make all of his personal life fair game. But his ongoing legal battle with a woman who claims he impregnated her and then bailed is cause for concern if he remains active in politically significant roles while the elder Biden campaigns for the presidency. His corruption and legal battles are 100% fair game.

Texto completo: In 2001, a graphic designer in New Jersey refused to sign a non-compete agreement required by her employer.
The woman's father, an attorney, had advised her not to and the decision cost her the job. Years of litigation followed, with the state Supreme Court ultimately ruling that the company had justly fired her.
The incident is a worst-case scenario of what can happen when parents meddle in their adult children's careers, said John Sarno, president of the nonprofit Employers Association of New Jersey.
Almost 20 years later, parents are asserting themselves to an even greater degree by sitting in on job interviews, filling in job applications, badgering employers to give their children raises and promotions, and – in at least one case – bringing a cake to a child's potential employer, according to a survey by a subsidiary of Robert Half, a global human resource consulting firm.
"Sadly, it's not a new phenomenon," said Dora Onyschak, the New Jersey metro market manager for Robert Half. "Bulldozer parents and helicopter parents are kind of similar in that really they just want what's best for their kid so they want to try and help them to be as successful as possible. But that can sometimes blind them to the fact that maybe they're being too involved or their involvement can be inappropriate or certainly unprofessional when looking for a job."
"Helicopter parenting" became part of American lexicon in the early 2000s to describe the practice of hovering over children and monitoring their every move. The behavior has since evolved into that of bulldozer, snowplow or lawnmower parenting -- when parents remove obstacles in their children's lives so they never have to face adversity or failure.
Sarno prefers to call them "advocate parents" and traces their rise to increased diagnoses among children of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as intensified competition to gain admittance to good colleges. Both converge to create anxiety-riddled parents who feel obligated to overly protect their children, he said.
"It's really about a parent who has had this identity, this role as the advocate through the public school, often through college, and they can't give up the role when the young adult starts their career," Sarno said. "I really think it's about parents that can't let go."
Part of that reluctance stems from the 2008 financial crisis and changing social attitudes that have delayed typical markers of adulthood such as marriage and homeownership, said Jacob Goldsmith, director of the emerging-adulthood program at Northwestern University's Family Institute. Studies show that unlike more prosperous previous generations, half of children born since 1980 will not out-earn their parents.
"It really scares parents," Goldsmith said. "I think there are a lot of parents looking around and realizing that their kids are not going to make the same money that they did, that their kids are not reaching the milestones they did at the same time and they don't know what to make of that and they really want to be helpful, so they jump in."
Fourteen percent of U.S. adults surveyed this year by Morning Consult for The New York Times said they had pulled strings in their professional networks to secure a job for their 18- to 28-year-old child. About 11% of respondents said they would contact their adult child's employer if the child had an issue at work. Another 16% said they had written all or part of a job or internship application.
Most of the parents Goldsmith works with as a therapist exert more subtle control. They will not sit in on job interviews, but they will edit job applications for their children or perform other tasks on their behalf, he said.
"Part of why we as therapists get worried about bulldozer parents is we worry that these kids don't learn the skills they need to do this stuff themselves," Goldsmith said.
Children of bulldozer parents often resemble children who have been neglected, he said. Both hit adulthood without a tool kit for dealing with adversity and feel like they have not accomplished anything on their own.
Most hiring managers are put off by candidates with meddling parents, said Onyschak.
"As an employer, do I then become concerned about the candidate's ability to think independently, do I worry then that they perhaps are not good decision makers?" she said. "It questions their level of independence and maturity and you don't want that to be the reason the person does or does not get the job."
Still, such employers as Google, Amazon and LinkedIn have embraced the close relationship between new hires and their parents, launching "Take Your Parents to Work" days to give parents a glimpse of their children's work lives.
Onyschak said she supports parents who provide more hands-off guidance: helping their children practice job interviews, helping them weigh the pros and cons of multiple job offers, looking over cover letters and resumes. But the oversight should stop there, she said.
For parents feeling the urge to become more heavily involved, Goldsmith recommends taking a step back and asking whether they are facilitating – or enabling.
"When you've got a parent who's really tuned in and providing good support and facilitating growth, that kid's going to fly to the moon," he said. "But when you have a parent who responds to anxiety by stepping in and trying to run the kid's life – even if it's not as egregious as showing up at a job interview – you still end up with a kid who doesn't really trust the tools they have to be in the world."

Texto completo: CVS Health wants to help millions of American workers improve their sleep. So for the first time, the big pharmacy benefits manager is offering a purely digital therapy as a possible employee benefit.
The company is encouraging employers to cover the costs for their workers to use Sleepio, an insomnia app featuring a cartoon therapist that delivers behavior modification lessons.
CVS Health's push could help mainstream the nascent business of digital therapeutics, which markets apps to help treat conditions like schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. The company recently introduced, along with Sleepio, a way for employers to cover downloads as easily as they do prescription drugs. The company said it had already evaluated about a dozen apps.
Some industry executives and researchers say the digital services should make therapy more accessible and affordable than in-person sessions with mental health professionals.
Big Health, the start-up behind Sleepio, is one of more than a dozen companies that are digitizing well-established health treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy, or devising new therapies -- like video-game-based treatments for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- that can be delivered online. Since last year, a few pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis, announced partnerships with start-ups to develop digital treatments for mental health and other conditions.
So far, the use of treatment apps has been limited. But with the backing of CVS Health, which administers prescription drug plans for nearly one-third of Americans, those therapies could quickly reach tens of millions of people. A few employers have started offering Sleepio, and more are expected to sign on this fall, CVS Health said. Like in-person therapy, the insomnia app does not require a prescription.
"We are at this pivotal moment," said Lee Ritterband, a psychiatry professor at the University of Virginia School of Medicine who has developed online health interventions for more than a decade. "For years, these have been bubbling under the surface."
Other experts argue that online therapies may not be ready for mass adoption. In a recent study in Nature, researchers warned that most digital treatments lacked evidence of health benefits. Although first-of-their-kind medical apps that claim to treat diseases must obtain clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, health apps that make vaguer wellness claims -- like better sleep -- generally do not need to demonstrate effectiveness to federal regulators.
CVS Health said it was carefully reviewing the scientific literature on digital therapies to decide which ones to offer employers. The company selected Sleepio first partly because the app was backed by rigorous, published studies, said Dr. Troyen A. Brennan, CVS Health's chief medical officer.
"It's important for us as a pharmacy benefit management company, as a big retail pharmacy, to endorse digital therapeutics when they work as good as or better than medications one can take by mouth," Dr. Brennan said. "We can give the stamp of approval from having looked at the scientific information."
Volunteers in randomized studies who used Sleepio reported feeling milder insomnia than people who used a placebo treatment app or online sleep education. But the app has not been rigorously studied against sleeping pills or in-person behavioral therapy.

CVS Health is offering Sleepio just as health experts have soured on prescription sleeping pills.
In 2018, retail pharmacies in the United States dispensed more than 29 million prescriptions for drugs like Lunesta and Ambien. But the F.D.A. warned Americans in April that taking certain sleeping medications had caused dangerous sleepwalking and "sleep driving," resulting in serious injuries and even deaths. The American College of Physicians now recommends cognitive behavioral therapy -- a proven psychological intervention that can help people change negative thinking patterns -- as the initial treatment for adults with chronic insomnia.
Peter Hames, the chief executive of Big Health, said he had hit upon the idea for Sleepio after he developed insomnia. He taught himself to modify his poor sleep habits, he said, by reading self-help books on cognitive behavioral therapy by Colin A. Espie, a sleep medicine professor at Oxford University. He and Professor Espie later founded Big Health to digitize the techniques.
"We are taking evidence-based, nondrug therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy that are traditionally delivered face to face by human therapists and then fully automating them," Mr. Hames said.
Sleepio unfolds more like a low-key, single-player video game, where the user is on a quest for better sleep, than a clinical health program. The app features an animated sleep expert with a Scottish accent, called "the Prof." An affable but firm therapist, the bot offers people who have insomnia symptoms a series of six weekly online sessions.
"At times, you may feel like quitting or even give up, but don't despair. This is totally normal," the animated therapist says in the first session. "What I can tell you for sure is, if we work closely together on this, we have an excellent chance of defeating your poor sleep."
Big Health has raised $ 15 million from investors including Kaiser Permanente, the California-based health system. In 2015, the start-up began selling Sleepio directly to employers, sending them aggregated data on their employees' progress. Companies pay a fee for each employee who uses the insomnia app, but Big Health declined to disclose its pricing.
Delta Air Lines and Boston Medical Center, two of the companies that work directly with Big Health, said employees who used Sleepio reported improved sleep.
"It feels a lot more like play than work," said Lisa Kelly-Croswell, the chief human resources officer at Boston Medical Center, which has offered Sleepio since 2016. About 3,000 employees there completed the app's initial screening questionnaire, she said, while 350 people finished the six-week program.
In several randomized studies that assigned some volunteers to use Sleepio and others to a different treatment, like online sleep education, the Sleepio user group generally had a greater reduction in the time it took to fall asleep and the time spent awake at night. At the end of the studies, however, there was little difference in total sleep time between Sleepio users and nonusers.
According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the goal of insomnia therapy is to improve both the quality and the quantity of sleep. Professor Espie said the app's goal was to treat broken sleep, saying that "people who get consolidated sleep feel the benefit of that."
But in one large randomized clinical trial with more than 3,700 participants, only 18 percent of Sleepio users completed the insomnia treatment. In another study, with nearly 1,400 participants, more than half of the Sleepio group did not engage with the app at all -- suggesting that app therapy may be off-putting to some people.
Professor Espie said some Sleepio users felt benefits from the app early on and stopped using it.
Christopher L. Drake, section head for sleep research at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit and a co-author of the 1,400-person study, said many people simply preferred in-person therapy.
"The future will be combining the efficiency and access of a digital therapeutic with the personalization that you get from one-on-one therapy with a clinician," Dr. Drake said.
CVS Health's rollout of Sleepio is part of its larger effort to popularize online health treatments as employee benefits. Dr. Brennan said the company planned to move forward with the apps it deemed to have solid evidence of efficacy.
"We're doing it because we think patients are going to benefit from it," Dr. Brennan said. "That's an important step for physicians. That's an important step for patients."
Although Dr. Brennan emphasized in an interview that CVS Health was rigorously evaluating treatment apps for efficacy, a company spokeswoman said in a follow-up email that the pharmacy giant wanted to maximize choices for employers.
"We will not curate a finite list of available vendors," Christina Beckerman, the spokeswoman, wrote.

Texto completo: The pieces will appear in an exhibition at the Louvre marking the 500th anniversary of the Renaissance master's death, and Italy will borrow works by Raphael.
Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing of a spread-eagled male figure, known as the "Vitruvian Man," will soon travel to Paris to star in a blockbuster Leonardo exhibition at the Louvre Museum. It will make the trip as part of an exchange agreement signed Tuesday by the culture ministers of France and Italy, after many months of sometimes bitter negotiations.
The drawing -- a study of the proportions of a human body -- is one in a series of works that Italian museums are sending to the Louvre for a show to mark the 500th anniversary of the Renaissance master's death. The show is set to open Oct. 24 and run until February.
As part of the swap, the Louvre will send Raphael masterpieces, including "Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione" and "Self-Portrait with a Friend," to Italy for a 2020 exhibition of his work at the Scuderie del Quirinale in Rome.
The principle of an exchange of works by Leonardo and Raphael was laid down in a Franco-Italian summit held in Lyon, France, in 2017. But a diplomatic dispute that broke out between the two countries over the nationalist agenda of Italy's previous government loomed over negotiations. Relations between the two sides soured further late last year, when Lucia Borgonzoni, then Italy's undersecretary for culture and a member of the right-wing League party, questioned the logic of lending multiple Leonardos in a major anniversary year. "Leonardo is Italian, and he only died in France," she said. Ms. Borgonzoni later told The New York Times that France was showing "a lack of respect" and treating Italy like a cultural "supermarket."
The countries' culture ministers began working toward reconciliation in February, and talks resumed thereafter. Italy's new culture minister, Dario Franceschini, and his French counterpart, Franck Riester, finalized the list of loans with Tuesday's agreement.
Mr. Franceschini described the deal as "an extraordinary occasion," allowing Leonardo and Raphael to be remembered in major tribute exhibitions. (Next year is also the 500th anniversary of Raphael's death.)
"Now, more than ever, it is essential for culture to be at the heart of European policies," he said in a statement, "both because it is a tool for creating a shared sense of citizenship, and because it is a great opportunity for economic growth."
"Vitruvian Man" is a loan from the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence is lending four other important drawings: a landscape, a preparatory sketch for the Adoration of the Magi and two drapery studies. The gallery is not sending any paintings, however: "Annunciation," which had been requested by the Louvre, will remain in Florence, where it will continue to hang in a new space dedicated to Leonardo.
The Louvre already has the world's largest collection of da Vinci paintings. After his death in the Loire Valley town of Amboise, where he was a guest of King Francis I, the paintings became part of the French national collections. The Louvre's five Leonardo masterpieces include the Mona Lisa and another portrait of a woman known as "La Belle Ferronnière."
The only Leonardo painting in the Italian national collections heading to Paris is "Head of a Woman (La Scapigliata)," an unfinished portrait of a disheveled beauty, which belongs to the Galleria Nazionale di Parma.
Two other Leonardo paintings will be sent from the collections of the Vatican under separate agreements, according to the Louvre.
They are "St. Jerome," from the Vatican Museums, an unfinished oil-on-wood painting of the saint, and "Portrait of a Musician," from the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan.

Texto completo: Pakistan's leader, lamenting what he said was the world's indifference to civilian suffering in Kashmir, on Wednesday condemned India's military clampdown there and said he would appeal to the United Nations for help.
"They do not understand that this can go horribly wrong," the Pakistani leader, Prime Minister Imran Khan, said.
In August, the Indian government revoked the longstanding autonomy of the contested border region and arrested thousands of Kashmiris. It cut off phone and internet service to millions of people and imposed a curfew.
The move raised tensions between India and Pakistan, which have long been at odds over the restive region. A million troops have squared off along the disputed border, one of Asia's tensest flash points and the source of two previous wars between the two countries.
On Wednesday, meeting with editors of The New York Times, Mr. Khan said he would ask the United Nations to intervene when he addressed the General Assembly on Friday.
"If the U.N. doesn't speak about it, who is going to speak about it?" Mr. Khan said.
In revoking a 70-year-old legal provision that had given autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and buttressing its military presence there, Indian officials said the goal was to establish peace and prosperity.
Pakistan has a history of funding separatist militants in Kashmir. But the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, rose to power with an unvarnished appeal to Hindu nationalists, who have long wanted access and sway in Muslim-majority Kashmir.
Over the past two months, Indian forces have rounded up at least 2,000 Kashmiris, including elected representatives, local officials say.
Mr. Khan said India was behaving irrationally -- and against its own longer-term interests.
"Arrogance," he said, "stops people from being rational."
Mr. Khan said he would ask the United Nations to step in, warning that it was too risky to allow tensions to escalate between India and Pakistan, both of which have nuclear weapons.
"This is the U.N.'s job," he said, adding: "They have to intervene, send observers there."
That may be a long shot.
"I can't imagine India agreeing to it, and the U.N. isn't going to intervene over India's objections," said Laurel Miller, director of the Asia Program at the International Crisis Group.
The Kashmiris are not the only Muslim group to be oppressed as the world looks away. The Rohingya in Myanmar and the Uighurs in China have also been brutalized.
But in Kashmir, part of the problem, Ms. Miller said, may not be the message but the messenger.
"There is a history, and an existing reality, of Pakistani tolerance of and support for militant groups," she said.
Ms. Miller, like Mr. Khan, said some nations might be reluctant to press the issue because they don't want to jeopardize their relationship with India, a major economic market.
That could change, she said, if widespread violence breaks out in Kashmir.
Mr. Khan said he feared that was exactly what would happen.
"This is very dangerous," he said, "because people don't realize where it's headed. It's going to be a massacre, the moment they lift the curfew."
The Pakistani leader said he was not optimistic that he would accomplish anything in his speech to the United Nations, at least not in the near term.
"But at least the world will be aware," he said. "Because I fear an impending genocide."

Texto completo: SAN RAFAEL >> Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, whose words captivated perhaps the most dedicated fan base in rock 'n' roll for generations, died Monday at his home in San Rafael, his family announced Tuesday. He was 78.
No cause of death was listed but The New York Times reported he recently had surgery.
"It is with great sadness we confirm our beloved Robert passed away yesterday night. He died peacefully at home in his bed, surrounded by love. His wife Maureen was by his side holding his hand," a statement from the family read.
Although he didn't perform as part of the Grateful Dead, Hunter was arguably as much responsible for the success and longevity of the Bay Area band as Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and the other players in the band.
Deadheads as the band's passionate fans are called treasured Hunter's words every bit as much as they did Garcia's guitar solos.
Indeed, it was Hunter's strikingly poetic lyrics in such classic Dead songs as "Box of Rain," "Uncle John's Band," "He's Gone" and "Touch of Grey" that helped set the Dead apart from the jam bands that followed. And although the Grateful Dead officially disbanded not long after Garcia's death in 1995, Hunter's songs are still being being played regularly by the band's various offshoots, such as Dead & Company, which performed before huge crowds during a two-night stand at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View earlier this year.
"As the Dead's lyricist, Hunter was the ideal combination of madman visionary after hearing Dark Star' for the first time, he dashed off transcendent words that captured the psychedelic nature of the song perfectly and a meticulous craftsman deeply rooted in poets from (Rainer Maria) Rilke to T.S. Eliot, whom he, in fact, partially quoted in at least one song," says band historian Dennis McNally.
Hunter, who collaborated mostly with Garcia on songs for the Dead, remained something of a mystery, mostly staying out of the limelight, even when the Dead was at the height of its commercial powers. He rarely consented to interview requests.
"As a person, he was sensitive and occasionally grumpy but one of the central moral voices of the band the reason that you don't hear "Truckin' " as the soundtrack to too many commercials is because he wouldn't allow it," said McNally. He guarded his privacy, "which kept him devoted to his craft in a way we're all pardon me grateful for," McNally added.
Still, many listeners felt like they knew Hunter perhaps because there was such a clear, distinctive voice to his work. He was a master storyteller, spinning yarns that at their best felt as timeless as anything created in rock 'n' roll history.
Yet, there was a duality to the lyrics. His words to a song like "Jack Straw" come across as if they might have been penned in the 1930s.
But there was also an element to Hunter's writing that connected to what was happening in the counterculture of the '60s and '70s.
"Hunter tapped into his generation the same way (Bob) Dylan did," Mike Campbell, lead guitarist of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, was quoted as saying in Rolling Stone magazine. "People will look back and say, That's American culture represented in music.'
"He captured the hippie freedom, the mentality of the little guy against the corporation. A lot of the songs are about gambling, card playing and riverboat guys who'll cut your throat if you look the wrong way."
One thing is for sure: His lyrics have lost none of their poignancy over the decades.
And they should only continue to capture the hearts and minds of fans for generations to come.
"For his fans that have loved and supported him all these years, take comfort in knowing that his words are all around us, and in that way (he) is never truly gone," the statement from the Hunter family read. "In this time of grief please celebrate him the way you all know how, by being together and listening to the music."
Born June 23, 1941 in the San Luis Obispo area, Hunter grew up an avid reader, devouring works by such authors as William Saroyan and T.S. Eliot, and later became fascinated with Pete Seeger and other musicians.
He was in the Bay Area by 1960, where he met Garcia (reportedly at a performance of the musical "Damn Yankees") and the two formed a folk music duo called Bob and Jerry. The partnership flourished after Garcia co-founded the Grateful Dead in Palo Alto in 1965 and the two soon began crafting such gems as "China Cat Sunflower" and "St. Stephen," with Garcia handling the music side and Hunter supplying the words.
He'd go on to also write songs with other band members, including Bob Weir ("Jack Straw," "Sugar Magnolia") and Phil Lesh ("Box of Rain"), as well as release several albums of his own as well as books of poetry.
He also collaborated with Elvis Costello, Bruce Hornsby, Jim Lauderdale and Bob Dylan, who, according to Rolling Stone, once said of Hunter: "We both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting."
But it was his affiliation with the Dead that defined Hunter's career. So much so that he was enshrined with the group into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

The Justify doping scandal points to an unjustifiably broken horse racing industry

Texto completo: A bombshell New York Times investigation published this month uncovered that Justify, winner of the 2018 Triple Crown, failed a drug test shortly before the Kentucky Derby — a finding that should have disqualified the colt from competing for the ultimate prize in U.S. horse racing.
Worse still, the unusual circumstances surrounding the failed drug test suggest a possible cover-up by the California Horse Racing Board, whose purported mission is to ensure the integrity and safety of the state’s horse racing industry. The board’s secrecy and lack of enforcement is simply another sign that action is urgently needed to regulate the use of banned substances.
Justify first tested positive for scopolamine — a prohibited drug that can enhance performance — in April of 2018 after winning the Santa Anita Derby. If the name Santa Anita rings a bell, that’s because it’s the famous racetrack that has seen an alarming 31 horse deaths since December.
Sadly, there’s little integrity left in the multibillion-dollar horse racing industry, with widespread doping problems and hundreds of American racehorses dying on tracks each year — a fatality rate that far exceeds that of other racing jurisdictions around the world.
A 2019 survey commissioned by The Jockey Club found that horse fatalities, the use of drugs and overall corruption are the most significant factors influencing public perception of the industry. Only about one-fifth of Americans have a positive view of horse racing.
Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert said in a statement that Justify had inadvertently ingested scopolamine from jimson weed contaminating his feed. However, the amount of the substance detected through testing — 300 nanograms per milliliter — was excessive and could point to the deliberate use of scopolamine to give the thoroughbred a performance edge. A second test after Justify won the Kentucky Derby, the first leg of his march to a historic Triple Crown victory, confirmed the positive result. Rather than disqualify Justify and file a formal complaint, the state racing board quietly dismissed the case.
Beyond the bad optics of this case (Chuck Winner, chairman of the California racing board at the time, owns horses trained by Baffert), there’s a more fundamental conflict of interest in tasking state-level racing boards, run by industry insiders, to oversee the use of drugs in a national sport where horses compete across state lines.
Reform is sorely needed. Earlier this year, two congressmen representing the heavyweight horse racing districts of Lexington and Saratoga Springs reintroduced the Horseracing Integrity Act to establish a national independent anti-doping authority that would create uniform standards, testing protocols and penalties. Currently, policies vary widely across 38 separate racing jurisdictions.
Introduced in the House by Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr and Rep. Paul Tonko of New York, and in the Senate by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona, the bipartisan legislation has racked up impressive endorsements from animal welfare groups and key industry players, including The Jockey Club, the Breeders’ Cup, the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association, and The Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and other major racetracks. With 146 cosponsors and counting, the bill is well-positioned to pass Congress should leadership bring it to the floor for a vote.
Notably, this legislation would substantially increase out-of-competition drug testing to catch bad actors early, and would adopt the international standard of prohibiting race-day medications. Administering drugs shortly before a race can mask the warning signs and symptoms that precede a horse’s catastrophic breakdown, while giving equine athletes an unfair competitive advantage.
Gradually, race tracks are coming on board. In April, major tracks — including all three hosts of the Triple Crown — agreed to phase out over the next two years the use of Lasix (a potent diuretic that can cause significant weight loss). While Lasix can help prevent respiratory bleeding in horses running at high speeds, less than 10% of racehorses suffer from this condition.
Meanwhile, a staggering 95% of all racehorses are administered Lasix as a potential performance enhancer — even when it compromises an animal’s health. As one of the leading trainers at Penn National Race Course testified in federal court, “almost everybody” dopes their horses in order to win — “95% to 98%.”
Unlike some professional athletes who deliberately try to cheat the system by taking performance-enhancing drugs, racehorses are at the mercy of their owners and trainers. The Horseracing Integrity Act would help protect equine athletes from some of the worst abuses of power plaguing the industry.

Texto completo: A reader calls the list succinct and "breathtaking." Also: The U.N. meeting on universal health coverage; funding for the Hudson River tunnel.
To the Editor:
Re "President Trump, Just the Facts" (column, Sept. 23):
Thank you, David Leonhardt, for "stepping back to look at the full picture." I follow the news closely every day, but the list of Donald Trump's malfeasances put forth so succinctly was really breathtaking.
That this man remains in office under the protection of Moscow Mitch (McConnell) and his allies is hard to fathom. If President Barack Obama had committed just one of those acts of perfidy, Joe Biden would be an ex-president now.
Please, Mr. Leonhardt, update this list often; as sure as the sun will rise, there will be new and more heinous entries to come. And please, email it directly to Mitch and Nancy Pelosi.

The Reversal in Health Coverage
To the Editor:
Re "Fewer Insured Amid Attacks on Health Act" (front page, Sept. 11):
On Monday, the United Nations High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage took place in New York, convening leaders from all countries to reinforce political commitment toward health care for all by 2030.
Dozens of countries have universal coverage models in place, and many low- and middle-income countries are making great strides; ironically, the meeting's host country, the United States, is a strong outlier.
A large percentage of the United States' gross domestic product is spent on health care, yet life expectancy and health outcomes compare poorly with other high-income countries spending much less. Although fewer Americans live in poverty today, an increased number live without health insurance. A need for emergency care may put these families in financial distress or, worse, on the streets.
A majority of uninsured patients undergoing trauma care and emergency surgery are at significant risk for catastrophic health spending. Hospitals are suing patients who cannot afford lifesaving care, seemingly prioritizing profit over lives.
If not these, then what are strong enough incentives to protect the Affordable Care Act as a steppingstone to move toward health care for all?

Why the Hudson River Tunnel Project Is Dead on Arrival
To the Editor:
"Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel" (editorial, Sept. 15) gives the impression that a new Hudson River tunnel can be funded by the United States Department of Transportation by just turning on a spigot. No matter whose name is on it, the project is ineligible for federal funding because the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's proposal submitted last year did not meet the requirements in law. If the Port Authority's new proposal is more of the same, this project still can't be funded with taxpayer dollars.
The plan fails to prove that the Port Authority can deliver the project on time and on budget. The tunnel relies on federal loans, which have yet to be applied for, without a defined method of repaying them. Additional local funding, which has not been identified, is required to cover the cost.
These requirements are set by Congress and must be followed by all applicants, including New York and New Jersey.
If the politicians behind this project continue to ignore the law, the tunnel won't need a name.

Texto completo: An indictment followed the company's costly settlement of lawsuits over rigging pollution test results.
A senior manager at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has been charged with conspiring to rig diesel-emissions tests on the automaker's vehicles, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed on Tuesday. The charges come months after the company agreed to a costly legal settlement of lawsuits over the deception.
Federal prosecutors are charging Emanuele Palma, a manager for diesel drivability and emissions, with wire fraud and violations of the Clean Air Act, among other crimes.
From 2011 to 2017, Mr. Palma and unnamed co-conspirators misled regulators and the public by purposefully calibrating emissions-control systems so that cars would produce lower emissions on regulatory tests than in other situations, according to the indictment, dated Sept. 18.
In a statement, a Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company would "continue to fully cooperate with the authorities, as we have throughout this issue." Mr. Palma did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment.
Fiat Chrysler agreed in January to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits accusing it of rigging certain diesel-powered pickup trucks and Jeeps with illegal software to pass emissions tests.
In 2017, the Justice Department sued the company over the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that Fiat Chrysler had illegally used software that switched off vehicles' pollution controls under certain driving conditions. The E.P.A. argued that the software enabled the vehicles to pass emissions tests while allowing them to release higher levels of pollutants in normal driving.
Under the settlement announced in January, the company agreed to pay $ 305 million in civil penalties in connection with those claims and another $ 6 million over allegations of illegally importing noncompliant vehicles. It also reached a settlement with California, which sued separately.
Fiat Chrysler is not the only auto company in the cross hairs of the federal government. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the emissions-certification process at Ford Motor. And in 2017, Volkswagen agreed to pay more than $ 20 billion to settle civil and criminal lawsuits over the rigging of vehicles to cheat on emissions tests.

Congressmen Mike Thompson and Jared Huffman both concurred with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s call Tuesday for an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, but the North Bay’s Democratic lawmakers were two years apart in reaching that conclusion.
Thompson, an 11-term incumbent from St. Helena, decided Tuesday morning the president should be removed from office if he withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for help with his own 2020 reelection campaign.
“Today we have the proverbial straw,” Thompson said, marking the first time he supported impeachment as House Democrats, including moderates who have been reluctant to seek the president’s removal, joined a push to remove Trump from office.
“We have credible information that the president tried to convince a foreign government to help him in his reelection,” Thompson said in an interview. If so, there is “no doubt” that is grounds for impeachment, he said.
David McCuan, a Sonoma State University political scientist, called Thompson’s announcement “his first public foray crossing this Rubicon.”
Thompson is a longtime ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, who had resisted for months the call from liberal members to mount an investigation of Trump’s alleged malfeasance.
Huffman, a four-term member from San Rafael, has called for Trump’s impeachment since early 2017 and referred to his support in December of that year for an impeachment measure introduced by Rep. Al Green, a Texas Democrat.
Green said Tuesday he felt “vindicated” for being the first congressional Democrat to explicitly call for impeachment.
Huffman, a member of the House Progressive Caucus, said early advocates were “a pretty lonely group” of about two dozen House members.
“Obviously, we’re in a different place today,” he said, noting there was no dispute among Democrats during the Tuesday’s caucus session called by Pelosi.
“I’ve never seen anything like this in our diverse and fractious caucus,” Huffman said.
“There’s no amount of spin or nuance that can get the president out of this box,” he said, asserting that Trump has “admitted the key facts” of what Pelosi called “a breach of his constitutional responsibilities.”
Asked if he felt Pelosi had dragged her feet on impeachment, Huffman said he was “not interested in those backward-looking critiques. We turned a historic corner today.”
New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg commented Monday on Pelosi’s reluctance to back impeachment, noting Huffman’s tweet Friday: “We are verging on tragic fecklessness.”
“That went a little viral,” Huffman said Tuesday.
The next step, he said, is the anticipated testimony by Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, on Thursday before House and Senate intelligence committees.
Thompson, a former House Intelligence Committee member for eight years, said Maguire had tried to prevent information about Trump’s contact with the Ukrainian president from reaching Congress.
“That’s unfathomable,” he said.
Trump’s agreement Tuesday to release a transcript of their conversation was insufficient, Thompson said. Congress needs to hear from the whistleblower who initially revealed the contact “and we need the full cooperation of the administration.”
Thompson said that Michael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community inspector general, had deemed the whistleblower’s complaint a matter of “urgent concern.”

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee’s attempts to winnow the presidential primary debate stage did not succeed in shrinking the number of candidates for the next debate. On Wednesday, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard became the 12th candidate to qualify for the October debate after missing the qualifying threshold for the September round.
Candidates must secure 130,000 individual donors and at least 2% support in four our more DNC-approved polls by Oct. 1 to make the debates scheduled for Oct. 15 and 16, the same standards as the September debate. A Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found Gabbard with 2% support, her fourth qualifying poll.
The September and October debates standard is much higher than that for debates in June and July, which required either 65,000 donors or 1% support in at least three DNC-approved polls, not both. The increase meant that the September debate stage was cut in half to 10 candidates, down from 20 in the June and July rounds, and one debate night rather than two.
All 10 candidates from the September debate automatically qualified for the October round. But candidates who already passed the donor threshold and were close to meeting the standard, such as billionaire businessman Tom Steyer and Gabbard, could still count their September qualifying polls toward October.
Steyer earned his fourth qualifying poll for the October debate on Sept. 8. The addition of him and Gabbard brings the October lineup to 12, meaning that the debates could again take place over two nights rather than one.
The rise in debate standards prompted condemnation from candidates.
"It's the polling requirements that have really been kind of arbitrary," Gabbard said on Fox News Wednesday morning, adding that it is not clear why the DNC recognizes certain polls but not others thought to be credible by outside experts. "Really, the problem is for voters who are seeing a lack of transparency, therefore a lack of trust in the process."
Candidates who have not met the donor threshold argue that the rules prioritize spending on digital ads to secure more individual donors rather than on talking to voters and building a grassroots operation.
"I question the effectiveness of that polling when you have 24 candidates when you're getting within the margin of error, well within the margin of error, to try and measure a qualification point," former Housing Secretary Julián Castro told reporters in August before he had qualified for the September debate.
The debate threshold has, however, prompted some candidates to drop out of the race. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ended her campaign after it was clear she would not make the September debate. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in early September he would drop out if he could not make the October debate, and he ended his campaign last week.
The 12 candidates who have qualified for the October debate in Ohio, hosted by CNN and the New York Times, are:

The DNC again raised standards for the November debate, but not as drastically as it did for the September and October rounds. Candidates must have 165,000 individual donors and meet a polling threshold, which can be 3% support in at least four approved polls or 5% support in two early voting states.

Charles M. Blow: Trump sees that the pillars of American democracy are weak

Texto completo: Donald Trump has discovered that the pillars of this temple we call the American democracy are weak. He’s growing ever more confident that he has the strength to topple them.
The phone call Donald Trump is reported to have had with the president of Ukraine in which he demanded that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden’s son Hunter, if true, is a shocking example of a president who feels invincible and unrestrained.
The phone call is reported to be part of the whistleblower report that the Trump administration is preventing from being forwarded to Congress, and by extension, is concealing from the public.
There is no evidence that then-Vice President Biden or his son did anything illegal. There is, however, clear evidence that Trump has broken the law — both in the conspiracies to pay off women who allege sexual affairs with him and in obstructing justice over Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
But that doesn’t matter to this man. For him, “real” is relative. The only truth, the only thing that matters, is what you can make people believe. Facts are not absolute; they have alternatives.
This is the chief executive officer of the country, and he is single-handedly mutilating it.
The Constitution is not sufficient restraint on a lawless president, in part, I assume, because it was inconceivable that such a dishonest man would rise to the office.
Trump has tested the slim guardrails erected to constrain presidential power and behavior, and he has shown them wanting, frail and assailable. He can thwart, resist and make a mockery of attempts to hold him accountable and to coerce acceptable behavior because Washington is filled with more survivalist politicians than with selfless patriots.
Trump has captured the Republican Party, and that means that he is holding Republican legislators hostage. None — or precious few — would dare to openly, publicly disagree with him, let alone challenge him. And Trump’s loudest supporters feel like the ascendant voices in the party.
He also has a particularly pernicious propaganda machine in Fox News. Fox’s promotion of Trump’s agenda and narrative, at the same time that Trump attacks and diminishes other, more legitimate and unbiased news sources, sufficiently muddies the water for enough people, especially those who support him.
Democratic leaders are investigating the president and his administration on multiple fronts, but they, too, are muddled when it comes to articulating a coherent and consistent perspective on their greatest power of presidential chastisement: impeachment. Is an impeachment process underway or not? Is this impeachment by another name? Is this impeachment-lite?
CNBC’s John Harwood tweeted Saturday:
“is whistle-blower/Ukraine situation changing Pelosi’s view on potential Trump impeachment? adviser tells me: ‘no. see any GOP votes for it?’”
He followed up Sunday, tweeting:
“senior Dem aide on Speaker/impeachment: ‘contrary to popular belief, Pelosi isn’t giving members a red light. She’s telling them to do what’s right for them and their district. But Ukraine stuff may be breaking point. goes to whether we can actually have free/fair 2020 election’”
It is possible, but Pelosi is weighing another concern: Maintaining Democratic control of the House and her own speakership. There is a school of thought that a vote to impeach in the House that is met with a refusal to convict and remove in Moscow Mitch McConnell’s Senate will be viewed as a “failed impeachment,” would put the country through unnecessary strife and might turn swing voters against the Democrats or rile up Republicans to vote for Trump.
The first rule of politics is self-preservation, and everyone in Washington is following that rule to the letter. But as they do, the country suffers. The country succumbs. The country collapses.
Trump thinks that the idea of Congress as a coequal branch of government is largely a tradition and convention, even though it is written as so in the Constitution. Trump, however, knows that the enforcement mechanisms are weak and rusty. To a large degree, Congress will have to fight his obstruction in the courts, where cases can have a long horizon. He can simply run out the clock, or stall as the sting of an accusation dulls in the public consciousness.
The public is being told that the only real, meaningful remedy to the Trump problem is to defeat him at the polls next year. But that is by no means a surety. As Nate Cohn wrote in The Times in July, Trump could lose even more of the popular vote next year and still win the Electoral College by an even larger margin than in 2016.
But even more disturbingly, the Ukraine call, if the details are as reported, shows us in plain sight that not only would Trump accept help from foreign actors to win in 2020, he is willing to actively participate in and encourage foreign interference.
We only know about this instance because of leaks about the whistleblower report. There is no way to know how much else may exist that we don’t know, or who is planning to interfere in our election or doing so right now.
In some ways America is strong and resilient. But Trump has found America’s soft spot, its vulnerability, and he’s plunging his fangs into it.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – La Casa Blanca prevé entregar al Congreso de Estados Unidos una copia de la queja interna sobre la llamada del presidente Donald Trump con su homólogo ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, que ha provocado el inicio de un proceso de “impeachment”, según medios.
El Gobierno se había negado hasta ahora a dar este paso, pero según The New York Times y Politico, tras el inicio formal del proceso de juicio político la Casa Blanca cambió su estrategia.
De acuerdo a los planes descritos por fuentes conocedoras de la cuestión, se hará entrega de la copia de la queja a finales de semana, junto al informe que elaboró el receptor de la filtración: el inspector general de la Comunidad de Inteligencia, Michael Atkinson.
El rotativo neoyorquino, además, también indicó que el Gobierno sopesa permitir que el filtrador, cuya identidad no se ha revelado, pueda reunirse con los investigadores del Congreso.
Estos movimientos son una muestra de la seriedad con la que la Casa Blanca ha recibido el inicio de la investigación sobre un juicio político contra Trump.
Está previsto también que este miércoles la Casa Blanca divulgue la transcripción de la llamada que mantuvieron Trump y Zelensky el pasado 25 de julio, origen de todo este terremoto político.
En esa llamada, el presidente estadounidense pidió a Zelensky que investigase al exvicepresidente Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter por supuestos actos de corrupción en Ucrania.
Además, Trump supuestamente bloqueó cerca de 400 millones de dólares en ayuda militar para Ucrania con tal de coaccionar a su Gobierno para que abriese esa investigación, unos fondos que finalmente transfirieron el pasado 11 de septiembre.
La presidenta de la Cámara Baja de Estados Unidos, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunció este martes que abrirá una investigación de juicio político contra Trump por haber “traicionado” la seguridad nacional y la Constitución.
Trump consideró esa decisión como una “basura” y una “caza de brujas”.
Más tarde, la Casa Blanca emitió un comunicado en el que afirmó que “lejos del trabajo y los resultados de este presidente, los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes han destruido cualquier posibilidad de avance legislativo para el pueblo al seguir centrando toda su energía en ataques políticos partidistas”.
“Sus ataques contra el presidente y su agenda no solo son partidistas y patéticos, sino que incumplen su deber constitucional”, añadió el comunicado.

Texto completo: It has become a battle royal: the leader of the world’s largest economy versus the leaders of the fifth largest, with little incentive for a cease-fire.
We are talking, of course, about President Donald Trump and California. Last week, the president combined a visit for campaign cash with a mighty strike at the blue state – revoking the state’s decadeslong ability to set its own tough auto emissions standards. He also castigated its cities for “allowing” the homeless crisis, warning San Francisco that it’s violating environmental rules over the issue.
Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and other leaders are fighting back. On Friday, California, along with 22 other states and several major cities, filed a lawsuit against the administration’s emissions action – its 60th suit against the administration. On Monday, the governor spoke at the United Nations climate action summit, touting California’s leadership in the switch to clean energy, with such jobs outnumbering those in the fossil fuel industry 5 to 1, and California outpacing U.S. economic growth.
“I don’t know what the hell happened to this country that we have the president that we do today on this issue,” he said, adding that President Trump is turning the conservative argument of states’ rights on its head. A serious problem with smog led to a waiver for the state to set its own tailpipe standards under the Clean Air Act, signed by a Republican president (Richard Nixon) while a Republican governor (Ronald Reagan) was in office.
The widespread feeling here is that the president feels snubbed by four automakers that agreed to California’s standards. He won one last week, though, when a federal judge blocked a new California law requiring disclosure of tax returns to qualify for the presidential primary ballot.
“I’ve never seen the animus so strong,” says longtime political observer Barbara O’Connor, speaking of the combat between Sacramento and Washington. And it’s not limited to those two capitals, she says. “It has huge ripple effects” across the country, with the potential to turn red states like Arizona against the president.
“The ripple is coming. It’s based on clean air and water and the Constitution, and whether or not there are really three [branches] of government in Washington,” she says. San Francisco and Los Angeles are hardly alone in having to deal with homelessness, though their challenge is severe, and voters are also impatient with the slow pace of various lawsuits against the administration, according to Professor O’Connor.
“I see it as ultimately playing out as political change,” she says.
Not all observers see such far-reaching reverberations.
“I don’t think there’s much effect in the great beyond,” says Bill Whalen, former speechwriter to Pete Wilson, California’s Republican governor during the 1990s. 
President Trump’s criticism of California liberals goes back to his campaign, illustrated by his focus on the 2015 killing of Kate Steinle by a convicted felon who was in the country illegally, says Mr. Whalen. “It really hasn’t changed.”
Terry Madonna, a pollster in the swing state of Pennsylvania, doesn’t think the ongoing fight sways voters “one way or the other.” Their opinions of the president are hardened, and most of his supporters likely share his views of liberal California.
But here’s where observers align: The last time a governor of California and a president of the other party were at serious loggerheads, the conflict was not nearly as personal or partisan. When former Governor Wilson and then-President Bill Clinton locked horns over immigration, the Wilson team published Op-Eds and ran ads in The New York Times, recalls Mr. Whalen, who is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution. “That was nothing compared to the vitriol here.”
And yet there is no incentive for either side to disarm, he explains.
For President Trump, California is a convenient foil in a race that will be won or lost in the Midwest. He has no hope of winning in a state where he is wildly unpopular, but he can point to California as liberalism run amok – on immigration, homelessness, and income disparity. He has made not only the governor, but the entire Democratic establishment his punching bag, from mayors to members of Congress.
Neither is it in the interest of the governor to stand down.
Governor Newsom is in a strong position to fight the Trump administration because California is running historic budget surpluses. He can rely on a fellow Californian, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to defend the breach in Washington. Ms. Pelosi was expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday against President Trump. Governor Newsom, meanwhile, has political ambition and a role to promote as a leader of the “resistance” to the president – and perhaps as a potential presidential candidate down the road.
But the governor says that values and the future are at stake when it comes to climate change. “I know ... we’re supposed to stay above politics, but you can’t on this issue,” he told the summit audience on Monday. Given the state’s recent experience with fires, floods, and drought, “this is not an intellectual exercise for us.”
It can be argued that the battle over auto emissions could have a ripple effect – given that 13 other states, plus Washington, D.C., follow California’s standards and account for about a third of the U.S. auto market. Yet the four automakers say they are sticking with California. The staying power of the conflict may also hinge on who wins the 2020 presidential election.
Much more could be accomplished if the president and California worked together, says John Pitney, professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College in California. But he does not think the state will pay a high price in the end.
“We’ll muddle through,” he says. “That’s the beauty of the separation of powers. California can make its plea to the House. It can make its appeal to the courts. It’s not an ideal situation, but the ideal is the exception, rather than the rule.”

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250 million in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, which is engaged in a five-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released a day after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect." If that's the case, why not make everything public?
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the whistleblower's report that he deemed it of "urgent concern."
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this on the grounds that the alleged target of the complaint – presumably Trump himself – is not a member of the intelligence community.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress – not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law – to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Trump's Talk With Ukraine: What to Do?

Texto completo: Readers have different views of how the Democrats should respond: impeachment, censure or focus on the whistle-blower.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Admits He Spoke to Ukraine About Biden" (front page, Sept. 23):
The Democrats have reached the proverbial fork in the road. If they choose the path of impeachment of the president, even if they fail in the Senate, they can hold their heads high, as the defenders of the Constitution and a party of values. If they choose to continue to go down the no-impeachment path, they will be known as enablers, who just like their Republican colleagues turned the other way to give free rein to President Trump's actions.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far shied away from impeachment, a political strategy aimed at not hurting her party's chances in the 2020 elections. But there comes a time when political strategy must be superseded by principles. The Democrats must ask themselves: "If not us, who? If not now, when?" The time is now.
Subir Mukerjee

To the Editor:
People to President Trump: You're fired! In the latest episode of a TV character who plays a president in real life, the heat gets turned up on him. He plays the role of a cocksure "gets away with anything" guy and kicks all boundaries while fighting the competition. Oh, it's exciting! Ratings are high! He basks in the attention. Serious talk of impeachment. Will they get him now?
He will not go down easily, that's a promise. He'll fight them all the way, disregarding and subverting all the rules, and staying loyal to his audience by becoming more and more outrageous. In fact, every day a new outrage. Ha ha, let's gut the Endangered Species Act. War with Iran, sure, if that's what it takes to win.
Please, let's get this clown out of here, fast! The show is getting old; we're so tired of the antics. He needs to be fired on the spot. Now.
Anne Legêne
Great Barrington, Mass.
To the Editor:
The pressing issue right now is not impeachment but following the rule of law with regard to whistle-blowers who cite a concern for our national security.
The Whistle Blower Protection Act of 1989 demands protection of the whistle-blower and investigation by the inspector general if our national security is in question. If the inspector general finds the complaint credible and urgent, as he did in this case, he sends the complaint to the director of national intelligence, who has one week to submit the complaint to the House oversight committees. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to fulfill his responsibilities and pass the complaint on to the oversight committees.
This is the issue that Speaker Nancy Pelosi describes as "entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness." In a democracy, the rule of law must prevail. The congressional oversight committees must see and investigate the complaint.
Susan Shelton
Falmouth, Mass.
To the Editor:
Because President Trump cannot be indicted while in office and there is virtually no way the current Senate majority would convict him, then I urge the House of Representatives to censure Mr. Trump, not impeach him. Democrats should take the legislative win and move on to the 2020 elections.
It's time to get hyperstrategic and focus on taking back Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania. A couple of wins in the Midwest next year will accomplish Goal No. 1 -- defeating Mr. Trump.
Denny Freidenrich
Laguna Beach, Calif.
To the Editor:
I submit that President Trump's attempted collusion with Ukraine's president will have the reverse effect from what he hoped for. The attack on Joe Biden's son, combined with the tragic loss of Mr. Biden's other son due to cancer, will probably initiate a sympathy spike in his popularity.
Gerald Falbel
Stamford, Conn.
To the Editor:
Hard not to feel sorry for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. He's got Vladimir Putin invading and occupying his country on one side and Donald Trump threatening to cut off security aid on the other. Now that's a one-two punch!

IF YOU MISSED IT OVER THE WEEKEND: Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders has now unveiled his long-awaited plan to forgive all medical debt — a total of about $81 billion — having teased the notion several times on social media and broadcast news for over a month. Get caught up on the proposal below.
Good morning and welcome to the Washington Examiner’s Daily on Healthcare! This newsletter is written by senior healthcare reporter Kimberly Leonard (@LeonardKL) and healthcare reporter Cassidy Morrison (@CassMorrison94). You can reach us with tips, calendar items, or suggestions at dailyonhealthcare@washingtonexaminer.com.

Sanders’ plan — first of all, where did that $81 billion come from? In a 2018 Health Affairs study, researchers combed through 2016 credit records for over four million Americans, finding that one in six had an overdue medical bill. The sum of all of those medical bills comes to $81 billion. More than half of those bills amounted to about $600 each, and the largest share of medical debt holders were 27 years old, just one year older than the cut off age for remaining on a parent’s insurance plan.
How does Sanders plan to tackle the multi-billion-dollar problem? The plan promises that the government will erase the $81 billion weighing Americans down by allowing the government to negotiate directly with collectors. The campaign has not added further details about the logistics. The plan would also be meant to put an end to predatory debt collection practices, which often include harassment, and will prohibit debt collection after the statute of limitations.
The plan would do away with for-profit credit rating companies like Equifax to create a public credit rating agency. What’s more, medical debt would be excluded from credit ratings.
The multi-billion-dollar sum reported in Health Affairs may actually be higher than what the government will have to pay. The market value of the total medical debt may be as low as $500 million, according to Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt, who spoke to the New York Times Saturday.
“A staggering 79 million Americans struggle to pay their medical bills or are paying off medical debt, including more than half of those making less than $40,000 a year,” the Vermont senator said in Saturday's statement. “Last year alone, 8 million people were pushed into poverty due to medical expenses.”
Sanders’ go-to stat is a little shaky: An early advocate for “Medicare for all” (he “wrote the damn bill”), Sanders has garnered critical attention for repeatedly claiming that 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year due to medical debt. But bankruptcy experts say the number is overstated.
The figure comes from a March editorial in the American Journal of Public Health in which Dr. David Himmelstein, the lead author, sampled debtors' bankruptcy filings each year from 2013 to 2016 and found that medical costs were linked to 500,000 bankruptcies annually.
But even Himmelstein’s research shows that Sanders’ claim inflates the role of medical debt in causing bankruptcies. The editorial does not say the bankruptcies were directly attributable to medical bills; rather, it says that medical expenses played some role in those people's financial distress.
Himmelstein added that declaring bankruptcy due to medical costs is often a middle-class problem and most often affects people with decent health coverage with high copays and deductibles rather than those without any coverage at all.
Other researchers have found dramatically lower numbers: Economists Carlos Dobkin, Amy Finkelstein, Raymond Kluender, and Matthew J. Notowidigdo conducted their own study to measure the rate of medical bankruptcies per year. Rather than look at bankruptcy filings to find medical bills, they looked at hospital admissions to find instances of bankruptcy after admission.
The economists studied hospital admissions in California from 2003 to 2007 and tied half a million of those patients to detailed credit reports to track how many filed for bankruptcy from 2002 to 2011. They concluded that hospitalizations contribute to only 4% of bankruptcy filings, and the rates of bankruptcy filings level off about four years after admission.
Even without a bankruptcy filing, medical costs could cripple a family’s finances: Dobkin, Finkelstein, Kluender, and Notowidigdo’s study highlights the rate of bankruptcies, but doesn’t address the fact that medical debt can lead to financial and personal hardships that don’t always result in a bankruptcy, Notowidigdo told Cassidy.
“Our findings suggest that medical factors play a much smaller role in causing U.S. bankruptcies than has previously been claimed,” the authors said in the report. “Overemphasizing ‘medical bankruptcies’ may distract from an understanding of the true nature of economic hardship arising from high-cost health problems.”

US DRUG PRICES QUADRUPLE THOSE OF SIMILAR COUNTRIES: REPORT: Drug prices in the U.S. are nearly four times higher than the combined average prices in 11 other similar countries, according to a report released Monday by the House Ways and Means Committee. The report finds that people living in the U.S. pay as much as 67 times more for prescriptions. Committee staff looked at 2018 pricing data for 79 drugs sold in the U.S, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Australia, Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland.
The report comes as House members prepare to hold hearings on drug prices this week, just after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a plan that would allow the government to tie the prices of certain prescription drugs to rates that are similar to other countries.
JUST AHEAD: APPELLATE COURT HEARING ON TITLE X: On Monday, an 11-member en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit will hear oral arguments in challenges to the Trump administration’s Title X family planning program rule. Several clinics have left Title X because they’re no longer allowed to directly refer to abortions if they accept the grants. The judges will hear arguments in San Francisco from states, Planned Parenthood, and other medical providers.
The case could eventually wind up before the Supreme Court.
ABORTION FOES SEIZE ON KLOPFER CASE TO PUSH FOR MORE ABORTION LAWS: Abortion opponents are pushing for new legislation following the discovery of 2,246 fetal remains in the garage of a deceased abortion doctor who faced multiple complaints while he was alive and lost his medical license.
Anti-abortion advocates and the White House have compared the turn of events, involving the late Dr. Ulrich "George" Klopfer, to the case of Kermit Gosnell, the Philadelphia abortion doctor who kept dismembered fetal remains at his clinic and was convicted of killing three infants born after botched abortions, of involuntary manslaughter of a woman having an abortion, and of multiple other crimes.
Rep. Jackie Walorski, who represents South Bend, Indiana, is circulating a letter to fellow Republicans calling for the U.S. attorney general to conduct an investigation and is looking at crafting legislation.
One approach she is considering is modeled after a bill that Vice President Mike Pence signed into law in 2016 when he was governor of Indiana. That bill required abortion clinics to provide for the cremation or burial of fetal remains after an abortion. The Supreme Court upheld the law this year, though it hasn't ruled on its merits, and it became enforceable in Indiana this month.

Nicholas Kristof: Trump and the whistleblower

Texto completo: There’s so much we don’t know about the whistleblower complaint concerning President Donald Trump. But here are four things we do know:
First, it seems that an experienced intelligence official was so deeply disturbed by Trump’s interactions with the president of Ukraine to feel the need to blow the whistle.
Second, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who was appointed by Trump and has long experience on national security issues, found the whistleblower’s concern to be legitimate and urgent.
Third, the whistleblower complaint came after Trump and his associates hounded Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to undertake a corruption investigation involving Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The Ukrainian summary of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy included this cryptic sentence: “Donald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.” The Wall Street Journal reports that in that phone call, Trump pressed Zelenskiy about eight times to work with Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani to investigate the Bidens.
Eight times! Nevertheless, he persisted!
Fourth, Trump withheld $250 million in military assistance urgently needed by Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression, although Ukraine didn’t learn of this until August. He released the money after the whistleblower complaint and after members of Congress intervened.
So for all the murkiness, let’s be clear: This stinks.
(Trump’s position is that his phone call with Zelenskiy was “pitch-perfect” and “It doesn’t matter what I discussed.”)
Thus it appears that after benefiting from Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump then tried to coax Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election. It’s particularly egregious that Trump seemed eager to trade $250 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars for Ukrainian help in tarring a Democratic rival.
Giuliani has helpfully acknowledged that he urged Ukraine’s government to investigate whether Biden’s diplomatic efforts were meant to help Hunter, who had been involved in a gas company in Ukraine. (There’s no evidence of this.) Giuliani also pushed Ukraine to reinvestigate old corruption charges that ensnared Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and to conclude that this was a political attack on Trump.
In effect, Trump apparently tried to use U.S. diplomatic might and the leverage of military assistance to get Ukraine to exonerate Manafort for 2016 and smear Biden for 2020.
The incoherence of the Trump-Giuliani position is underscored in this interview Thursday evening on CNN:
Chris Cuomo: Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?
Rudy Giuliani: No. Actually, I didn’t …
Cuomo, 24 seconds later: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?
Giuliani: Of course, I did.
Trump has been credibly accused of using the presidency to enrich himself (summits at Trump properties!), to protect himself from law enforcement (appeals to James Comey, offers of pardons!) and to punish perceived adversaries (Amazon, CNN, Andrew McCabe). Now he may have harnessed the power of the presidency to gain political advantage.
This is bombshell layered upon bombshell. On top of the initial accusation by the whistleblower is the refusal of the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to obey federal law and relay the matter to Congress within one week.
The law is very clear, but it’s also true that Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both suggested that there might be situations involving classified information where a president should not follow the statute. These are very tricky questions of executive power versus congressional oversight.
Jeffrey Smith, who was the CIA’s general counsel under Clinton, told me that despite the technical legal arguments, there should still be ways to allow oversight, especially if the core issue is a commitment that the president has made to a foreign power.
Smith cited a time when he was at the CIA and a matter came up that did not technically require reporting to Congress but still raised troubling questions. After some soul-searching within the agency, it provided a briefing to the “gang of eight” congressional leaders, and Smith told me that the same would be appropriate today.
Look, this whistleblower’s complaint will leak. The Trump administration’s recalcitrance will simply make it all the more newsworthy.
When historians review Trump’s term, I think they will see combat between an out-of-control president and various U.S. institutions, such as the courts, the Civil Service, law enforcement, the intelligence community, the House and the news media, which generally have done a credible job of standing up for laws and norms and against one-man rule. The only institution Trump has co-opted completely is the Republican Party in Congress.
Today’s struggle over the whistleblower may be remembered as a central battle in that epic confrontation. The core question is whether our president can get away with weaponizing the federal government to punish political opponents, or whether legal constraints and congressional oversight can keep him in line.
This is a test of our political system, and the next few months will determine whether we pass.

Texto completo: Inspectors at the World Anti-Doping Agency are considering recommending on Monday that the global regulator's board once again ban Russia's antidoping agency. The move would come days before the start of the world track and field championships in Qatar, and amid fears Russia manipulated athlete data provided to WADA earlier this year, according to two people familiar with the board's plans.
Handing over the data from the Moscow laboratory that was at the center of a 2015 doping scandal had been a key requirement set by WADA when it lifted a three-year suspension of the Russia antidoping agency, known as Rusada, in 2018. The suspension had been imposed after WADA investigators found Russia had orchestrated a vast, state-sponsored doping scheme that tainted the Olympics and other major sports events.
Getting access to the Moscow laboratory that held the data -- a crucial tool in determining the identities of hundreds of athletes who may have cheated across a raft of sports -- had been a challenging and at times bruising experience for WADA. The agency faced heavy criticism from non-Russian athletes and other stakeholders for lifting Russia's suspension, and for allowing it to once again certify on its own that its athletes were not using banned drugs, even as Russia had not fulfilled all the conditions of a road map it had agreed to follow.
Now questions have been raised about the validity of the data. WADA alluded to there being an issue in July, when it said its investigators were examining "some differences" between the data retrieved from the Moscow lab and a separate database provided to it by a whistle-blower in 2017.
"The inconsistencies in the data identified by WADA's investigators are being thoroughly assessed to establish how and when they happened and whether they will have any impact on bringing cases forward," a WADA spokesman said. WADA's board will receive a briefing from its compliance review committee -- the group charged with monitoring Russia -- at a scheduled meeting on Monday in Tokyo.
Yuri Ganus, Rusada's chief executive, told The New York Times in text messages and a follow-up telephone interview that he would "feel very bad" if the data from the Moscow laboratory was found to have been manipulated, but he said he could not rule out the possibility that it had been.
"I want to hope for the best, but I live in a country where we have to be ready for all possible situations," he said.
Discrepancies in the data are "a huge deal," according to Rob Koehler, WADA's former deputy director general. Koehler now leads Global Athlete, a lobbying group for athletes formed in the aftermath of the 2015 scandal.
If the accusations of manipulation are true, he said, "it's another black mark to WADA, given the voice of athletes against reinstatement was so strong."
Monday's meeting in Tokyo, which will host next summer's Olympics, will come only hours before world track and field's governing body meets to discuss the fate of Russia's athletics federation ahead of this month's world championships, which begin on Friday in Doha, Qatar.
That group will almost certainly recommend extending a suspension issued to Russia's track federation, a decision that would result in Russia's athletes being forced to compete as neutrals for a second straight championship.
Ganus, who was brought in to lead Russia's antidoping agency after the scandal, has been critical of some aspects of Russia's handling of its aftermath. He was particularly scathing about management of the nation's athletics body, which he said "isn't ready" to be welcomed back into the international fold.
He said he expected Russian athletes to participate at the world championships next week as so-called Authorized Neutral Athletes, a group that requires separate vetting from track's governing body, the IAAF, before being allowed to compete. Unlike athletes who will compete in their national colors, the group of about two dozen neutral competitors will wear white uniforms and their national anthems will not be played if they win a gold medal.
"There will be no Russian team," Ganus said. "There will only be a neutral flag because too many questions remain." He called for a complete overhaul of the Russian track federation's management.
While Russia's track federation has met most of the requirements demanded of it by track and field's investigators, one condition of ending its ban -- that the status can only be lifted once all the data is supplied to WADA -- is not going to be met in time.
If that data is found to have been manipulated, Russia's absence is likely to be indefinite.

In New York, This Is How They Roll

Texto completo: They came to Brooklyn from as far away as California, dressed in cutoff shorts, sequins and cowboy hats. It was September 1980 -- the last days of disco -- and Donna Summer thumped on a boombox in Prospect Park. There, 800 people had gathered to compete in what was billed as the first roller-skating marathon on the East Coast.
Never mind that modern skates, with their two-by-two design patented by James L. Plimpton, a New York City furniture dealer and inventor, had been around since 1863. Suzy Chaffee, a former Olympic alpine skier and something of a celebrity then, was on hand to salute the winners. She wore a shimmering bodysuit and waved from the back of a truck at the end of the course. ("If you've got any juice left in you," she told the crowd at the finish line, "you're invited to boogie.")
Giuliano Maddamma, a 22-year-old construction worker from Cleveland, won that year, skating the 26.2-mile course in an hour and 37 minutes.
"Skating was such a New York thing," Ms. Chaffee said in a recent interview. "It lifted the city."
Roller skating has long been an integral part of city culture. And even now, as summer slides into fall, groups of skaters convene around town for weekly get-togethers. Last month, they gathered for the Big Apple Roll and made their way from Brooklyn to the Bronx. In late September skaters will be back in Prospect Park for the NYC Skate Marathon. But unlike four decades ago, the equipment is high-tech and the participants are more professional.
The crowds are smaller, too, mostly because many of the city's rinks built in the 1930s and 1940s have either closed or been demolished to make way for condominiums. But skate professionals say there are signs of renewal. Myles Cotter-Sparrow, a marketing executive for Rollerblade Inc., said he had seen a 10 percent increase in the number of people using skates compared with a year ago. Actors like Chris Evans (Captain America!) tout the sport. And around the world, skate marathons are big business.
"The sport has redefined itself," Mr. Cotter-Sparrow said. "Athletes are as fit as any top-level sport."
For others, roller skating is a wink at a vibrant past. Bob Nichols, 72, has a 1936 poster on the wall of his Midtown apartment of a woman in a red coat and skates, her hand tucked under the arm of a man. "Halloween Roller Skating Carnival," it reads. "Bring Your Skates." The poster was created to promote a party on the Central Park Mall.
Then, the park was swollen with roller skaters -- children, mostly, and their keepers -- who looped around the Great Lawn in summer and in fall before the snow choked the streets with slush. Mr. Nichols said his parents used to skate at the Empire Roller Skating Center in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, when he was young. His sister did, too; she had a pair of skates with wooden wheels.
Mr. Nichols liked skating outdoors. He began in the late 1970s, just as roller skating rebounded with a disco beat. Then, roller disco dominated popular culture with the catchy sounds of Gloria Gaynor, KC and the Sunshine Band and, later, the Bee Gees. It was popular, too, at exclusive clubs like the Roxy, in Chelsea, where Mr. Nichols occasionally skated.
"It was a celebrity thing," Mr. Nichols said of the club. "I'm a baby boomer person. We were young and in good shape and athletic enough. Either that or people made fools of themselves."
In 1980, skating entrepreneurs estimated that roller skating had developed into a $ 6 million to $ 8 million business in New York, according to The New York Times. People would roller-skate to their doctor's appointments. Enthusiasts wore their skates for eight hours. "Roller-skating is now transportation plus meditation plus aesthetics," a skater told The Times.
Roller-skating was so popular, there were magazines devoted to the sport. And in 1983, President Ronald Reagan declared October National Roller-Skating Month. But skaters did not lace up only for fun: Many New Yorkers used their skates to go to work. Ms. Chaffee said she used to glide from her apartment near Gracie Mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to Central Park before heading south to the garment district, where she had an office.
"It was great exercise," she said.
The death of disco in the 1980s dealt a blow to roller skating. But by then, two brothers from Minneapolis, Scott and Brennan Olson, had come up with a new design for an in-line skate that gave users more control and flexibility. (They named the company Rollerblade.) By the mid-1990s, New York's parks were bustling again, this time with in-line skaters and dancers who performed tricks for eager spectators.
But city officials saw the free-spirited dancers with their loud boomboxes and volunteer D.J.s who played music on weekends as a nuisance. So, they tried to eject them. (The city had sought to limit roller skaters in Central Park going back to the 1880s.) Mr. Nichols, along with a fellow skater, Lezly Ziering, founded the Central Park Dance Skaters Association and negotiated with the mayor's office to establish hours and regulations so they and others could perform.
According to Mr. Cotter-Sparrow, costumed disco extravaganzas like the one in Prospect Park in 1980 gave way to today's sometimes grueling professional races in which world-class athletes compete. Among the biggest are in Paris and Berlin, where thousands compete for prize money in a race sponsored by BMW and Adidas. And in Georgia next month, 58 participants are expected to skate 87 miles from Athens to Atlanta.
Now, as then, outdoor skate culture maintains a certain camaraderie. "The strategy is not to elbow someone to victory," Mr. Cotter-Sparrow said. "It is to outstrategize your opponents by using energy." Marathon skaters race in close-knit packs, often warning fellow skaters of hazards so they don't take the pack down.
Mr. Cotter-Sparrow recalled a 2017 race in Duluth, Minn., in which a skater slid in front of him on wet pavement. "I jumped over him," he said. "You'll hear someone shout, 'Wet line!"'
"There is subtle communication among skaters," he added. "They are like Canadian geese: They draft off each other. Or like a school of fish. They have synchronicity."
That is what is appealing to Ms. Chaffee, then and now. She still promotes the sport even though it has lost its disco flair from the 1980s.
"I couldn't be happier," she said. "Those were fun days."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

'New York Times is having a rough year': CNN anchors lament recent 'mistakes'

Texto completo: CNN anchors Brian Stelter and S.E. Cupp discussed the New York Times' litany of recent "mistakes" and how the flubs "damage" the reputation of the media.
"To put it kindly, The New York Times is having a rough year," Cupp began, before recounting the list of "controversial, regrettable" flubs on her show Saturday night, but added, "None of these things represent the Times entirely," but "they’re also not helping."
The Times has faced backlash in recent months for publishing an anti-Semitic cartoon of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, Brett Stephens' overreaction to being called a "bedbug" on social media, the paper changing a headline involving Trump, and their botched story about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last week.
'Mistakes add up': CNN anchors lament recent NYT 'mistakes'
"You always need strong editors who are able to see when something’s going to embarrass you and your news organization. It seems like... that's what's being missed," Stelter said.
"When there are mistakes made, those mistakes are amplified and do damage more broadly than just The New York Times," he continued. "Then politicians like President Trump can use it as ammunition against the media as a whole. So what I hope is happening at the Times, and what I think is happening, is that kind of conversation about where are the checks and balances, the multiple layers of editing that everybody needs. Everybody needs a good editor."

Texto completo: It was after midnight when Kaitlin Chad Moss, her new husband, Jeremy Moss, and a handful of devoted wedding guests lingered as long as they could before they were politely informed that the celebration was over and it was time to go home.
“That’s when it hit me,” said Kaitlin Moss, 29, who was married last September at the Green Valley Ranch, a lodge and events space in Coram, Montana. “I’m never going to have everyone I love in one room like this again. It was hard to accept. I felt sad, and it didn’t go away.”
Kaitlin Moss broke down that night in front of her girlfriends. “I wish someone had warned me that this was something you could feel. Why is no one talking about this?” said Kaitlin Moss, who lives in Denver.
Thomas Meehan, 28, a government relations liaison officer for the Texas State Office of Risk Management, who married his husband, Philip Arnold, last New Year’s Eve in New Orleans, posed the same question to his mother, sister and friends. “I had six months of intensive planning, and after our wedding was over there was this void. I felt alone,” he said. “Everyone was shocked a guy could feel like this - depressed, lonely, and like I didn’t have a purpose.”
Post-wedding sadness is not uncommon among the newly married. Laura Stafford, a professor and director of the Bowling Green State University’s School of Media and Communication, and Allison Scott Gordon, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky’s Department of Communication, have jointly conducted two studies on depression, specifically concerning newly married women.
“In 2016 we looked at 28 women, half of whom said they felt sad or let down after their wedding,” Stafford said. Last year they interviewed 158 women. Twelve percent of the women interviewed in the second study expressed feelings of depression after being wedded.
“These women were the center of attention, and planning a wedding takes up so much of your time, it would be weird to not feel some kind of letdown,” Stafford said. “We also found there was more focus on the wedding than on the marriage. There was also uncertainty about their goals, their role as a wife, their relationship and partner choice.”
The pair are working on a third study where the same 158 women will be interviewed again to see if their moods have changed a year later.
“I kept waiting for my wedding bliss but instead I fell into this funk. I’d just gotten married to a great guy and I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t happy,” said Kaitlin Moss, the founder of theeveryhostess.com, a website covering lifestyle and entertaining. “It was like losing a job you love. That feeling lasted for three months.”
Brittny Drye, 34, who got married in 2015 and is the founder and the editor-in-chief of Love Inc. magazine, had a similar reaction. “I was very down and felt bad for six months. It was very confusing. I just got married, why am I not on Cloud 9?”
There are many reasons behind the emotional crash. For some, it’s returning to everyday life. For others, it’s the elimination of planning and anticipating such a big celebration or the loss of looking forward to that cultural, life-altering event. Then there’s the diminished attention, social letdown and the pressures and expectations that come with your new life and spouse.
To distract herself from her melancholy emotions, Drye hosted dinner parties. “I thought doing something that had elements of my wedding, but on a smaller scale, like home decor projects or entertaining friends where I’d mix cocktails, do floral arrangements, and make a meal would help,” she said. “But it was temporary and the sadness would return.”
Elizabeth Sloan, a licensed professional counselor and a clinical fellow at the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy in McLean, Virginia, said the wedding glow eventually dims.
“It’s normal to have mixed feelings about the life changes you’ve just made, which are now permanent and somewhat out of your control,” Sloan said. “It’s easy to look at your gains: a wedding, a spouse and new life. But there are also losses: the life you used to have. And when we feel loss, there’s sadness.”
Sloan added that changes in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain could be a contributor. “There’s a dopamine rush that comes with planning a wedding, and a dopamine cliff afterward because you’re not always doing exciting things,” she said. “You’re back home paying bills and going to work and figuring out what to make for dinner. That drains dopamine, it doesn’t increase it.”
Scott Stanley, a research professor and co-director of the Center for Marital and Family Studies at the University of Denver, cited social media and an inability to be present during the wedding as additional triggers.
“People are experiencing performance pressure because everything is announced on social media, including successes and achievements,” Stanley said. “There’s also more pressure for perfection, and to find the perfect person and not make a mistake. Physically and emotionally it’s exhausting. Some people struggle to rebound.”
Meehan, the government relations liaison officer, isolated himself after his wedding. “I lost the desire to socialize,” he said. “People started asking if I was OK. And people couldn’t understand why I wasn’t.”
Some had assumed, he said, “something was going on with me and Philip, but we were fine. It was hard to verbalize because how do you get depressed from your wedding?”
Meehan said he believes the emotional attachment to the event, paired with the fact that he was the driving force behind the planning, were partly to blame. “People think this is a women’s thing or a gay thing - it’s not,” he said. “Men don’t want to be perceived as weak or vulnerable. I’m just one of the first to be vocal about it.”
Bret Levesque, 36, an academic adviser for the University of Miami who got married in March at the Living Sculpture Sanctuary in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, spoke similarly. “Gay or straight, male or female, this is a thing that’s happening. I just didn’t know what it was called. I didn’t know why I felt lonely or that I lost a sense of purpose except that all the stimulation from planning our party was gone.”
Gone, too, is the couple’s professional wedding posse.
“They lost an insta-family who wanted to create their vision,” said Michelle Rago, the founder of Michelle Rago Destinations, an event planning and design firm based in New York. “The constant conversation they’ve had for the past year with this team of people, who they liked and whose attention and dedication was focused on them and producing their wedding, can be very intoxicating.”
But then, she continued, “There’s a huge drop of connectivity and that’s difficult for people. There are no more phone calls, meeting for drinks, or support system. It’s hard to give up the attention that was on you for over a year.”
Meehan used FaceTime to stay in touch with friends. He talked about his feelings with his husband. He forced himself to reconnect and to become more extroverted. Eventually the loneliness lifted.
Drye, the editor-in-chief of Love Inc. magazine, was easily angered and on edge after the wedding. “My new husband and I fought more than normal,” she said. “We have a strong marriage, we got through it, but it’s more serious than people give it credit. I should have seen a therapist; it would have helped me and my marriage. The blues is like this cutesy word people use. This is a real, concerning issue that should be taken seriously.”
Professionals agree. “For most, this kind of sadness is temporary,” said Sloan, who added that these melancholy feelings generally lessen during the months that follow your wedding. “First talk to other married friends, then talk to your spouse. Holding a secret creates distance,” she said.
Other positives that can emerge are greater connections with your spouse.
“Going through an intensive experience only to return inward can evoke emptiness, anxiety, loss and loneliness,” said Dr. Orna Guralink, a New York-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst. “But these feelings can inspire curiosity about the next stage for your life and ask you to figure out how you want to live as a married person. That can lead to a better discussion or a good opening for a new kind of conversation.”

I understand Baltimore, and it understands me

Texto completo: Several years ago, my wife Dawn and I decided to move back to Baltimore to raise our family. Leaving my investment banking job in New York, I did not expect my friends there to understand the decision.
What I also did not expect is that many of my friends in Baltimore would not understand it either.
I can't tell you how many people immediately jumped to assumptions that I had been fired from my job or that my mother must be in poor health. In reality, I wanted to raise my family in a community that I knew and understood - a community that I felt understood me.
I had spent my entire life in dramatically different communities. I remember struggling to fit in with kids in my neighborhood in the Bronx because my mom sacrificed to put me into an independent school, where she thought I would do better. And truthfully, I did not fit in with those kids either. When that did not work for me, she eventually sent me to military school.
From academia to the military to the world of finance - I have spent my entire life moving between different spaces. I have come to understand (and often tell young people) that you belong in every space that you are in, and that space would be incomplete without you there.
But being able to navigate communities is not a substitute for having one. Coming home to Baltimore was in pursuit of a community that I felt was my own.
Today, my son gets his hair cut by the barber who used to cut my hair. He and his sister get to come up with my mom and my grandmother close by. This is community.
It is what I love about Baltimore, and it is also the answer to the very real hardships and challenges that plague the city. In Baltimore, the need is unavoidable. You can't understand or engage with the beauty of our community without also engaging with the hardships.
That reality underscores the need for all of us to be involved in finding answers and creating solutions, in our own way. To me, there was no better place to become a social entrepreneur. When I came back home, I founded an organization called BridgeEdU that helped students navigate the first and second year of college, when many students (especially from low-income and first-generation backgrounds) struggle.
We can see the factors that hold people back in college - two of the biggest being lack of readiness for the coursework and prohibitive costs. But we found that factors you might not expect played as big of a role, things like child care or transportation. The need for low-dollar emergency financing and trusted mentorship. It was about community.
It was about community for Bianca, who in 2014 was 17 years old and a high school junior in West Baltimore when she gave birth to her son. She graduated a year later with a cumulative GPA of 1.8 and no plans. Her parents didn't attend college and didn't have money for college, and even though Bianca had completed the paperwork and qualified for federal financial aid, she didn't follow through. College wasn't on her radar.
In 2015, I visited Bianca's school to talk about our program at BridgeEdU that puts underserved students on a path to college success by removing barriers and providing supports. Bianca enrolled in the two-year program. She spent her first year in community college to improve her academic standing, and she transferred to Coppin State University in her second year, where she received academic and financial supports, success coaching, and mentoring.
With the right mix of information and support, Bianca is well on her way. She is balancing a cashier job at a hospital with a full college course load and the primary responsibility of raising her son - who, like my own son, started kindergarten this fall. She is a student leader at Coppin and on track to graduate with a bachelor's degree in nonprofit management in 2020.
"It's pretty overwhelming," she told me, "but nothing I can't handle because I don't feel like I'm alone."
Community. She has her sights set on graduate school and a career working with young people like herself to ensure a strong high school-to-college transition.
Baltimore is as much her accomplishments as it is the conditions that threatened to hold her back.
Baltimore is as much the community she fosters as it is the challenges she is facing. Baltimore is her promise as much as it is her pain. Baltimore is the community that emerges from the devoted and beautiful souls that come together to move her forward.

Flood's established feel could be a self-fulfilling prophecy The new restaurant from Palace Diner's Greg Mitchell succeeds in giving off an old-school vibe, with a wink.

Texto completo: Tasting Greg Mitchell's chocolate pudding convinced me that he had chosen the perfect name for his new restaurant.
Flood's, conjoined to The Francis Hotel in Portland, occupies roughly the same footprint as its predecessor, Bolster Snow & Co. And where a technique-driven, mostly Italian menu powered the former restaurant's quick-fizzling buzz, Mitchell's new endeavor runs on nostalgia - more specifically, nostalgia for something that did not even exist until four months ago.
"When we talked (with Atlanta-based branding partners La Famiglia Bros.) about the restaurant, we used old ephemera like menus and signage from old-school restaurants as inspiration," said Mitchell, who co-owns Biddeford's famed Palace Diner. "I wanted cards and matchbooks for Flood's that you could stumble across in an antique store, among stacks of hundreds of vintage postcards, and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference."
That same drive extends to Flood's main dining room, which has been reshuffled into something akin to a speakeasy, trading a modern open kitchen vista for a frosted-glass bar, brass stanchions and burgundy leather banquettes. If you weren't told otherwise, you'd think this space - itself a newer brick extension bolted onto the historic Victorian mansion - had been here for a century.
Mitchell admits that his creation is a work in progress, but already it seems to be delivering the experience he's after - generating an eerie sense that Flood's is a place that always was ... and never was.
Much like its namesake, a morally ambiguous, seafood-smitten octogenarian named Hugh G. Flood, the subject of a 1944 profile by New Yorker magazine writer Joseph Mitchell (no relation). It took four years for Mitchell, the writer, to admit it, but he fabricated Mr. Flood, hammering together this composite character from "aspects of several old men who work or hang out in Fulton Fish Market," as well as the author's own religious fervor, birthday and even culinary passions.
Likewise, Greg Mitchell's restaurant spins its own version of history through pseudo-antique decor, a classic cocktail list and a terse, retro-oriented food menu. When it works (and it mostly does), the combination provides reality distortion at its most pleasurable.
Nowhere is that truer than in a vintage metal-footed crystal dish, into which head chef Billy Hager and his team spoon bittersweet homemade chocolate pudding and a slack dollop of barely sweetened whipped cream ($6).
If you haven't eaten chocolate pudding since the last time you had dessert in a cafeteria, you're not alone. Pudding isn't a terribly 21st-century dessert and certainly isn't trendy. But when blended fresh from milk, cornstarch and sugar, and topped with a crumbly, Maldon-salt-strewn cocoa shortbread cookie, Flood's version offers a bowlful of imaginary, "Sliding Doors"-style history: a world where chocolate pudding reigns over all other desserts.
"It's rich and familiar, nothing weird or different, and it fits with the idea of old school," Mitchell said. "And when it's firing on all cylinders, our goal is that it's the best chocolate pudding you've ever had." Spoiler alert: It is.
Flood's bar program also tethers itself to a romantic yet largely dreamed-up past. Its curt wine list of nine (total) bottles and glasses, almost all French or Italian, recalls not-too-distant decades when American drinkers still ignored New World wines.
The cocktail list, while erected on a foundation of Sazeracs, gin martinis and daiquiris, also introduces some contemporary flavor profiles, including guava, curry and warm-spice Falernum syrup as part of the refreshing Be Ernest ($9), and subtle black tea and lemon in the C.M.P ($12) - a clever reference both to the clarified milk punch process used to strain out cloudiness, as well as to the restaurant's power supplier.
More modern culinary references sneak onto the menu here and there, like an artistic smear of house-made ricotta whipped with cream that softens the acidity in a chunky heirloom tomato salad ($15), or Japanese and Italian eggplants roasted until custardy with crisp, sweet (and recently rediscovered, very on-trend) Jimmy Nardello peppers ($8).
Yet these plates feel like pleasant surprises, never out of step with what Greg Mitchell describes as the other "Old-World, tavern-influenced" dishes. Indeed, they offer a more vegetable-friendly balance than you might have encountered last century, at a real-world version of Flood's.
There, the most you might have hoped for would be the few snippings of chive scattered over a ramekin of homemade aioli, a sauce for the playfully named Sardine Party appetizer ($10) - a pile of hand-cut waffle potato chips, tin of plump Portuguese sardines and a chili-coated lemon wedge. I struggled a bit with the unremitting savoriness of the dish, but perhaps that's the point.
"It's very much a chef's kind of snack," Mitchell said. "Kitchen people love tinned fish and pickled stuff. When I'm at home, I'll eat sardines with pickles or mustard."
Another dish that could have used a bit more balance is the porchetta ($28) - a coil of crunchy-crusted, fennel-and-thyme-stuffed pork belly, served bare, like a chop, with only blistered, vinegar-tossed cherry tomatoes on the plate. A solid dish, but absent anything starchy or neutral flavored to absorb the fatty richness (including slicks of oil pooling on the plate), it was a challenge to finish.
Contrast that with Flood's stupidly excellent cheeseburger ($18), which not only did I down but made me consider changing my evening plans to fit in another before the restaurant's later-than-average closing time of 10 p.m. It's hard to go wrong when all the components are this superb: a grass-fed, Maine beef patty ground in-house and seared hard; charred yellow onion relish; crisp-tart homemade pickle chips and a seeded potato bun baked across the street by Briana Holt at Tandem Bakery.
I laughed when I saw it was listed on the menu as The Celebrated Cheeseburger. How, I wondered aloud to my dinner guest, could a 3-month-old restaurant already have developed such burger-based clout?
"We saw that phrase when we were working on branding. It was from an old restaurant's menu that said they were still selling their celebrated hamburger," Mitchell said. "So when we used it on our opening day, we did it with a little wink. Of course nobody had eaten it. It's fabricated history. But now they have, and we hope in time they celebrate it."
When they do - and they will - I want an invitation.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE EMMYS 8 p.m. on Fox. Awards season kicks into gear with the 71st annual Emmys, television's biggest night. With a whopping 32 nominations, "Game of Thrones" seems to be the front-runner for the drama awards. The show, which ended after eight seasons this spring, has already won 10 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and could very well win best drama for the fourth time. But, as Margaret Lyons, a television critic for The New York Times, noted after this year's nominations were announced, "The variety and flair of the comedy categories -- performing, writing, even directing -- are just way, way more interesting than the sort of blah drama contenders this year." Among the newcomers are fan favorites like "Schitt's Creek," which is up for best comedy, and "Fleabag," which was nominated for 11 awards, including best acting and best writing for its creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The event itself will go hostless this year, but Jenny McCarthy, Shannon Sharpe and Kelly Osbourne will co-host Fox's red carpet coverage starting at 6:30 p.m. Over on E!, Giuliana Rancic and Jason Kennedy will do the honors, beginning at 6 p.m.
MACK WRESTLES 2 p.m. on ESPN and 4:30 p.m. on ABC. This documentary, part of ESPN's 30 for 30 Shorts series, follows Mack Beggs, a high school wrestler from Euless, Tex., as he navigates the demands of the wrestling world, and the stigma that surrounds transgender athletes. When Beggs started his transition at the end of ninth grade, both his school and his family were supportive. But, because Texas state law prevented Beggs from competing on the boys' wrestling team, the general public started to have concerns about a male-identifying wrestler competing against girls. After reading an ESPN article about Beggs, the filmmakers Taylor Hess and Erin Sanger set out to make the film, with the hope that it would "give athletes like Mack a platform and "ultimately create a more inclusive space," Sanger told the Dallas Observer.
THE CIRCUS 8 p.m. on Showtime; Stream on Showtime platforms. Showtime's most-watched documentary series returns for its fourth season, just as the race for the White House heats up. Co-hosts John Heilemann, Alex Wagner and Mark McKinnon follow the group of Democrats vying to take on President Trump in 2020, as they meet constituents in key states across the country. The hosts also check in with major figures on the right, like Roger Stone and Steve Bannon, and newcomers on the left, including Representative Ilhan Omar and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
What's Streaming
CRIMINAL Stream on Netflix. There's often a satisfying moment in the end of a crime drama where the perpetrator finally sheds light on what happened, usually while sitting across from detectives in a police interrogation room. This new procedural, with episodes set in four different European countries, focuses solely on that cat-and-mouse dynamic inside those rooms as detectives work to extract important information from their suspects. David Tennant, who played a dogged detective in "Broadchurch," finds himself on the other side of the table in the United Kingdom episode.

Texto completo: The Girls
An All-American Town, a Predatory Doctor, and the Untold Story of the Gymnasts Who Brought Him Down
Abigail Pesta

Seal Press: 240 pages, $28
--
The girls came from small towns and suburbs. All were energetic kids, climbing and tumbling and sending their parents scrambling for outlets for their daughters' vibrant energy.
They crossed paths with the predator in places where they should have been safe: gym, school, the doctor's office. And they all came away from the encounters changed -- even if it took years before they realized just how much, and why.
In "The Girls," journalist Abigail Pesta writes about one of the biggest scandals in American sports history: the decades-long sexual abuses carried out by Dr. Larry Nassar. She also chronicles how Nassar was abetted by the institutions he used to gain access to girls, including individual training facilities, Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, the sport's national governing body.
Pesta tackles a story of massive proportions -- at Nassar's 2018 sentencing, 204 women provided victim impact statements. To tell it, the author focuses on individual testimonies, her interviews with 25 of the survivors about their experiences. The result is devastating.
Readers hear from Sara Teristi, abused by Nassar in the 1980s. Teristi began her gymnastics career as a 5-year-old growing up in a Michigan town too small for a stoplight. Pesta writes of the girl's exuberance: "She cartwheeled up and down the halls of her family's ranch house, rattling vases and photo frames. ... She used her bed as a trampoline, bouncing so high she scraped her nose on the ceiling."
At 10, Teristi joined a gymnastics club in nearby Lansing. There, she met coach John Geddert, a rising star in the sport who would eventually serve as team coach to the U.S. women in the 2012 Olympics. It was while rehabbing from one of the inevitable injuries that Teristi was introduced to Larry Nassar, an osteopath whose own star was on the rise.
Slight, bespectacled and nerdy, Nassar presented himself as a friend to Teristi and the other young athletes he treated. His treatments were hands-on, and his hands wandered, touching patients in places unrelated to their injuries.
The women Pesta talked with saw Nassar for a variety of complaints, but a common thread runs through their stories: the doctor pushing aside their leotards to touch breasts and genitals, including digitally penetrating them both vaginally and anally. That their mothers often were in the room led many girls to doubt their own perceptions: What Nassar did felt wrong (and painful), but if their mothers didn't object, it must be medically necessary, right?
Indeed, one reason Nassar got away with the abuses for so long was that his targets were so primed for obedience. The young gymnasts were already accustomed to rigid rules and perfectionism. As Teristi told Pesta, "Any child wants to make the adults in their life happy."
The girls often were isolated from typical teenager activities, socializing only with other gymnasts. And they talked with each other -- which had the paradoxical effect of normalizing behavior that was not normal. After one girl told another she didn't want to see Dr. Nassar, Pesta reports, another girl sympathized, saying, "Yeah, he touches you funny."
Over the years, some of Nassar's patients did complain -- to coaches, therapists and the police -- but nothing seemed to stop the abuse. Families fractured, the trust between parent and child broken as the girls struggled to understand what had happened to them. Many of the women interviewed faced depression and self-harm.
It took three decades before anyone listened. The Indianapolis Star broke the sexual abuse accusations in 2016, and then several athletes shared their stories on "60 Minutes." Nassar denied wrongdoing -- he explained the touching as medically necessary -- but when police found a vast trove of child pornography in his possession, the tide began to turn against him.
This is a story of great evil eventually brought to justice (after his 2018 conviction, Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison). Pesta's empathy for these girls and women is palpable, and powerful.
There are times when the book threatens to veer toward cliche (the "triumph of the human spirit" is invoked), and I wish Pesta had spent more time probing Nassar's own story (to explain how the monster was made).
Beyond Nassar, readers also learn just enough about the dark side of gymnastics to want to know more. Is the sport itself irrevocably broken, and are all young athletes at risk for damage in the quest for gold medals? "People don't understand how many broken girls it takes to produce an elite athlete," Teristi tells Pesta, an indictment that goes beyond any one person.
Pesta details changes the Nasser case prompted, including legislation extending the statute of limitations on prosecution and USA Gymnastics cutting ties with problematic coaches, to address the sport's culture of abuse. Where she's able to go beyond newspaper accounts is in giving voice to the survivors' stories.
At its best, the book has the effect of a chorus of righteous anger, and some of the survivors' words ring with a beautiful fury. "You might have broken us," said Amanda Thomashow, the whistleblower who reported Nassar to Michigan State and the police, "but from this rubble we will rise as an army of female warriors."

Texto completo: the best storytellers, in particular -- possess the enchanting, irresistible power to take the reader somewhere else. Ta-Nehisi Coates imagines the furthest reach of that power as a means to transcend borders and bondage in "The Water Dancer," a spellbinding look at the impact of slavery that uses meticulously researched history and hard-won magic to further illuminate this nation's original sin.
For Coates, whose epistolary quasi-memoir "Between the World and Me" won a National Book Award in 2015, this trip to the past was foreshadowed in his vividly drawn examination of what it means to be black in today's United States. "America understands itself as God's handiwork," he writes in "Between the World and Me," which is structured as a letter to his teenage son, "but the black body is the clearest evidence that America is the work of men."
For his first novel, "The Water Dancer," Coates ventures into the perspective of Hiram Walker, a slave born under "the Task" who is the story's narrator and fulcrum.

Hiram is the mixed-race son of the owner of a Virginia tobacco plantation called Lockless and a mother who was sold away when he was 5. Without giving too much away, Hiram has a near-photographic memory about all but the most intimate details of his past, and it is that hidden trauma that could fuel a supernatural power.
In capturing Hiram's voice, Coates uses an elaborate, richly drawn impression of the language of the time, somewhere between 1850 and the dawn of the Civil War. Though the beneficiary of a steady supply of free labor, the plantation is in decline because of soil mismanagement and owners' greed.
In depicting the fall of the plantation, Coates provides something of a microcosm of the nation. "Eat up the land, then keep going," one character muses about the plan- tation's future. "Someday they gonna run out of land, and I don't know what they'll do then."
Lockless and nearby towns are at the volatile intersection of three classes -- the Tasked (slaves), the landowners (the Quality) and the low whites that take any means to impress the Quality. Coates draws a portrait of the cruel, coldly effective apparatus that grew around slavery, especially in its efforts to camouflage those so intricately tied to its day-to-day operation.
"There were dumbwaiters that made the sumptuous supper appear from nothing, levers that seemed to magically retrieve the right bottle of wine hidden deep in the manor's bowels," he writes, examining a practice that echoes into exploitative labor practices of the present. "Because those charged with emptying the chamber-pot must be hidden even more than the chamber-pot itself."
As Hiram grows older, he falls in love with Sophie, another of Lockless' Tasked, and that feeds his drive to pursue freedom. Slavery "paints its executors as guardians at the gate, staving off African savagery, when it is they themselves who are savages," Coates writes, "and at that moment of revelation, of understanding, running is not a thought, not even as a dream, but a need, no different than the need to flee a burning house."
Passages like these shine a light from the past through the present. The book, however, offers much more than a relatively easy indictment of history. Exploring the loaded issues of race and slavery has became yet more fuel for today's culture wars, but an underlying message of liberation through the embrace of history forms the true subject of "Water Dancer."
While Hiram's first escape attempt is unsuccessful, he grows aware of a facility with Conduction -- a teleportation-like power that manifests through storytelling as a mix of light, water and fog that can carry users across impossible distances and ultimately to freedom.
Hiram's potential for Conduction leads him to become involved with the underground railroad (known here only as "the Underground"), which is described in richly drawn details that showcase Coates' meticulous, journalism-forged hand with research.
Hiram is taken to the free Northern city of Philadelphia, where Coates begins blurring the line between reality and fiction as Hiram encounters the real-life slave narratives of Box Brown and Jarm Logue and is taken in by the fictional White Brothers, who were inspired by ex-slave abolitionists William and Peter Still, according to a closing note by Coates. While exposed to fleeting triumphs by the Underground amid a steady supply of tragedy, Hiram soon comes together with the movement's most powerful force, Moses, a master of Conduction eventually revealed to be American abolitionist Harriet Tubman.
In a pointed, evocative Tubman-led effort to free slaves, Conduction's power is on display. It arises from Tubman's detailed, unsparing retelling of personal history, no matter how painful. Her sermon-like sharing propels the Underground across impossible distances and back. This forms a particularly poignant superpower for a people whose history and culture were broken apart by slavery.
"Memory is the chariot and memory is the way," Coates' Tubman later assures Hiram as he begins to understand his own powers. "Memory is bridge from the curse of slavery to the boon of freedom."
But even as Hiram feels the pull to use his powers to find Sophie, "The Water Dancer" again reaches for more than a tidy rescue narrative as Hiram returns home to reconcile what happened to his mother and confront his own past.
Using a touch of magic to explain an effort of unimaginable terror and courage in escaping slavery, "The Water Dancer" at times feels like a spiritual companion to Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Underground Railroad." But instead of imagining a literal railroad in place of a treacherous effort to pull innocent people from slavery, Coates envisions the transcendent potential in acknowledging and retelling stories of trauma from the past as a means out of darkness. With recent family separations at the U.S. border, this message feels all the more timely.
"I choose the muck of this world," Hiram tells Sophia in accepting the pain that comes with a world forged by tragedies both personal and socio-political. "I choose the everything."
As America of today continues to struggle with the muck of its past, we should all be so lucky.

Texto completo: Auto writer
says the union and the company are both stuck in the past
Detroit is stuck. Its carmakers still sell plenty of vehicles. But while their chief challenge for the past century has been figuring out which cars consumers will buy, they now face a future of having to sell Americans on the very idea that they need to buy a car at all.
That's what makes the United Auto Workers strike against General Motors so different from past conflicts. The union and carmakers have always played tug-of-war: In good years, the UAW demands a share of the prosperity. In bad years, the companies seek concessions so they can stanch their losses. But the current strife pits the auto industry's past way of doing business against its uncertain future. The carmakers would have you think that every American wants a big ol' SUV or pickup truck. And the union, with its walkout, is saying it wants to keep things the way they are, without shutting plants or laying off workers or paying more for health care.
But the stakes have changed in a way that neither the carmakers nor the union fully acknowledges. Consumers have signaled that maybe they don't need Detroit quite as much as they used to. Auto analysts suggest that the country has reached "peak car" - meaning the number of autos sold each year isn't likely to increase. Some predict a drop in worldwide demand. The long-term trend has been shifting toward fewer cars per household. Because the United States is so big, it takes a lot to bump the ownership statistic, but it has been below two cars per household since 2009. Not only do these trends cause havoc with automakers' planning, they blunt the UAW's ability to argue for more money and guaranteed jobs, and to get them through strikes.
Drive any highway in America, and you'll see fleets of new sport utility vehicles and pickups. The carmakers push them in their advertising just as the behemoths push smaller vehicles out of the way while zooming past. They offer lease deals and rebates, or knock $5,000 or more off the price, which they can afford to do because the big models yield big profits. The companies argue that they're meeting consumer demand, but like department-store clerks who bring out only the most expensive dresses, they rarely put any effort into marketing less-profitable cars. Detroit automakers have all but erased smaller cars from their lineups: Ford has dropped the iconic Taurus, which helped it compete with Japanese carmakers in the 1980s. Chrysler is going to discontinue, in North America, the little Fiat 500, which it got from its Italian overseer. And GM has ended production of the small Chevrolet Cruze at its factory in Lordstown, Ohio, one of four vehicle plants it announced last year that it wanted to close, a move that enraged the union and struck fear in the hearts of local communities.
The 49,000 striking GM workers, meanwhile, are survivors in what has been a brutal era for the industry. In 1979, the company had 511,000 hourly workers, 10 times as many as in its factories today. But now the union may be keeping GM from dealing with its future, possibly endangering even more jobs as a result.
The UAW wants GM to give full-time jobs to the 7 percent of its workers who are temps; adjust its two-tiered wage and benefits system so newer workers can achieve parity with veteran workers faster; and reopen the four plants. GM says these steps would raise its costs and limit its flexibility. For example, some workers from the closed plants have transferred, so GM would have to hire more workers and, more important, fill up the plants somehow with new products. But that's basically the UAW's point: GM should commit to this size workforce, something no carmaker has been able to do for decades.
This strike doesn't threaten GM's immediate future. Its dealers have enough cars in stock to last three months, and GM has earned money more or less steadily over the past five years. But some shakiness is beginning to show up in auto sales. If the rate from the first half of the year holds up, car companies are on track to sell 16.9 million vehicles in 2019, according to Automotive News, the industry trade publication. That sounds like a lot, but it would be the first time since 2014 that the companies sold fewer than 17 million vehicles. You can argue that a slowdown is to be expected after the long sales boom the industry enjoyed this decade. But this strike over maintaining the status quo doesn't seem to be taking into account those wobbles - or, in fact, any of the social changes that are swirling outside car plants.
Bill Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford and now the company's executive chairman, has said repeatedly that Detroit's future will be far different from its past. In 2018, Ford made headlines when he bought the dilapidated Michigan Central train station in Detroit, with plans to transform it into a development center for "urban mobility services" as well as electric and autonomous vehicles. "The urgency has never been more apparent," he wrote in a Medium essay last year.
Americans have begun to get around in ways that don't involve owning cars. Walkability has become a real estate selling point; new condo buildings and hotels are being built without parking or with fewer spaces than they once had. People ride bikes and scooters, hail rides from Uber and Lyft, and use public transportation, depending on availability. These modes are a long way from replacing car ownership, but the age of the average car owner keeps going up. It's 55 now, and buyers that age and older account for the majority of new auto sales. Millennials, who seemed slow to get into the market a decade ago, are picking up their buying pace, but car companies are starting to worry about Gen Z, those born after 1995. These buyers are the ones with a range of transit choices that their parents and older siblings didn't have.
As the UAW well knows, Detroit has always looked for the silver bullet: the all-in gamble that will result in good times for everyone; the technology that will simplify the way vehicles are built; the vehicles that customers are clamoring for. Sometimes, the car companies are right, as they were during the first SUV boom, in the early 1990s. The union reaped the benefits in constant overtime shifts and year-end profit-sharing.
But repeatedly, the carmakers have gotten it completely wrong. GM was convinced that its 1984 purchase of Electronic Data Systems, the tech company founded by the late H. Ross Perot, would bring it a revenue stream that would shield it from the vagaries of the car market. Instead, it got into constant battles with Perot over the way it ran its auto business and ended up ditching EDS and Perot altogether in 1995. GM has made multiple efforts to overhaul Cadillac, only to see German, Japanese and even Korean carmakers take slices of the lucrative luxury car market away. And strong car dealer lobbies blocked it from eliminating lagging brands, like Pontiac, Hummer and Saturn, until the government forced it to do so as part of its bankruptcy after the financial crisis.
Every time Detroit is wrong, workers suffer, as jobs are cut and plants are closed. Last fall, it seemed like GM had its act together, with the right number of factories and jobs. Then, it blindsided the UAW and the American public by announcing that it planned to close four factories, including its only production center in Detroit.
Likewise, the past 25 years have seen GM lurch through a series of environmentally friendly vehicles, even when its heart clearly wasn't in the task. In the late 1990s, it marketed the EV1 electric car, beloved by its owners, then fully retreated. In 2008, hoping to win congressional help, GM executives vowed that the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid, was the key to its future. It killed the Volt in December but promised it would speed up the development of electric vehicles.
Last weekend, according to Automotive News, GM promised the union that electrics would help revive two of its doomed factories - with an electric pickup truck at the Hamtramck factory in suburban Detroit and a battery cell manufacturing project in Lordstown.
You can't blame the union for being skeptical: It doesn't believe that GM knows what the future holds. By walking off the job, the UAW is showing it doesn't want to help GM find out. But the future is coming for the industry, whether the company - or its workers - want it to or not.

Texto completo: The Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, Connecticut, had 10 patients in its close observation unit on a recent afternoon. Visitors could hear the steady ping of pulse monitors and the hum of ventilators.
The hospital carefully designed these curtained cubicles to include windows, so that patients can distinguish day from night. It also placed soothing artwork - ocean scenes and landscapes - on the ceilings for those who can’t turn over and look outside.
All these patients had undergone a tracheostomy - a surgical opening in the windpipe to accommodate a breathing tube attached to a ventilator - when they arrived from a standard acute-care hospital. Some had since been weaned from the ventilators, at least for part of the day.
The facility is called an LTCH, a long-term care hospital (also known as a long-term acute care hospital). It’s where patients often land when an ordinary hospital is ready to discharge them, often after a stay in intensive care. But these patients are still too sick to go home, too sick even for most nursing homes.
“It’s truly a hidden segment, even to most people in health care,” said Dr. Anil Makam, a hospitalist and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.
Take the man in his 60s slowly making his way down the hallway, supported by a large wheeled apparatus that had also lifted him out of bed. Two physical therapists and two aides accompanied him. He had been in the nonprofit Hospital for Special Care for about a month, on top of 30 days in a standard hospital, trying to recover from a brain hemorrhage and spinal cord injuries after a fall down the stairs in his home.
He had finally come off the ventilator the week before, although he might need it again. “Setbacks are very common,” said Dr. John Votto, a pulmonologist and former chief executive of the hospital, watching the patient’s progress.
In one cubicle lay a woman with severe emphysema who had endured six hospitalizations in five months. “She’s off the vent, but she’s very tenuous, in and out, in and out,” Votto said. She hadn’t been home since January.
Close to 400 such hospitals operate around the country, some free-standing, others within other hospitals, most for-profit. They provide daily physician visits, high nurse-to-patient ratios and intensive therapy.
In 2017, they accounted for about 174,000 hospital stays. Medicare covered about two-thirds of them, at a staggering cost of $4.5 billion, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has reported.
Dismal odds
Yet the odds look dismal for older adults who enter an LTCH, Makam and his colleagues reported in a recent study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.
Sampling 5% of Medicare data, they identified more than 14,000 patients who had been transferred to such hospitals and tracked them for five years, from 2009 through 2013. Most had not needed mechanical ventilation. Only 45% of Medicare patients were alive a year after admission, the study found; fewer than 1 in 5 survived for five years.
The researchers defined “recovery” as logging 60 consecutive days without entering a hospital or nursing home - “a pretty low bar,” Makam said. But over five years, more than half of Medicare patients in an LTCH never reached it.
Moreover, “true recovery rates - getting back to thinking clearly and functioning well - may be lower,” Makam said.
In fact, despite the prevalence of aggressive, life-prolonging procedures like feeding tubes, ventilators and dialysis, LTCH patients spent two-thirds of their remaining lives (the median survival period was 8.3 months) in institutions, including hospitals, skilled nursing homes and rehab facilities.
“A little over a third of people never make it home,” Makam said. “They go back and forth between the LTCH and hospitals and nursing facilities, and they die in one of them.”
Younger patients in their 60s and those admitted with musculoskeletal diagnoses, like complications from a hip fracture or joint replacement, fared better. But 41% of this population was 80 or older, and “the older old do exceptionally poorly,” Makam said.
‘Afterworld’ of care
A few years back, Dr. Daniela Lamas, a critical care specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, found herself wondering about what she calls “this afterworld,” one she knew little about.
At an LTCH, she interviewed 50 patients, with an average age of 63, who had undergone tracheostomies, or family surrogates (when patients couldn’t communicate), asking not-very-medical questions about goals, fears and understandings.
Patients described their quality of life as poor, complaining of hunger, thirst, difficulty communicating. “People were bored,” Lamas said. “They couldn’t move. There was a deeper sense of being alone, feeling trapped.” Their families felt anxious and stressed.
Most patients expressed optimism about returning to their former lives, and hadn’t talked with their LTCH doctors about what would happen if they encountered setbacks.
But when discharged, only 20% went home; most moved to nursing homes or returned to acute-care hospitals. Just 38% were at home after a year; 30% had died.
“When we put people through things with a goal that’s not achievable, that allows people to suffer without a purpose,” Lamas said. “There are ways to allow people to keep their hopes but also face reality.”
Once a growing sector
Once, the LTCH was among the fastest-growing sectors of the health care industry. Their numbers jumped from 97 hospitals in 1992 to 388 in 2005, “a period of explosive growth spurred by overpayment and inappropriate admissions,” the advisory commission said.
Medicare responded with moratoriums on new facilities and stricter patient criteria for reimbursement. The growth of Medicare Advantage plans, less likely to reimburse for LTCH care, has also hurt revenues.
As a result, more of these hospitals have shut down than opened in recent years, and the National Association of Long Term Hospitals expects further closings.
“Some people may change directions and choose hospice care instead,” Makam said. But compared with patients in the general Medicare population, far fewer LTCH patients enroll in hospice, although many would qualify as terminally ill.
“It’s easy for this move to be like a train you get on until it stops,” Lamas said of LTCH stays. “But the doors can open at any point.”
She urged patients and families to arrange for periodic re-evaluations: “At four weeks or eight weeks, where do we hope we are? We can reassess.”
Votto, also chief medical officer of the industry association, endorsed that idea. “You’re at a level of illness where there’s not a lot of good outcomes, no matter what,” he said.
But, he added: “Most people don’t look at the percentages. They say, ‘Maybe I’ll be one of the 20%’” who leave an LTCH and go home.

Texto completo: An explosive intelligence whistleblower complaint claims that President Trump improperly tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic front-runner Joe Biden - and lawmakers are probing if the White House threatened to kill a $250 million aid package if the country's leaders refused to dig up dirt.
The unidentified operative officially complained that Trump bullied his Ukrainian counterpart to step up a probe into Biden's supposed involvement in a business deal involving the ex-vice president's son, the Washington Post and The New York Times reported.
The campaign to gin up the Biden probe in Ukraine was the centerpiece of a campaign spearheaded by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Trump denounced the whistleblower probe as the work of "radical left Democrats" and insisted he did nothing wrong. He called his conversation with the Ukraine leader "pitch perfect!"
"It doesn't matter what I discussed," Trump told reporters at a later photo op.
The Walls Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported that the president pressed Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky eight times to give the former city mayor a hand.
Giuliani admitted on CNN Thursday night, that he warned Ukraine officials to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.
In a combative appearance, the former mayor said Trump would be within his rights to threaten to cut off aid to force Ukraine to act against the Bidens, a move that would presumably bolster Trump's 2020 reelection prospects against the Democratic front-runner.
"If the president of the United States said to the president of Ukraine: 'Investigate the corruption in your country' .... that's what he's supposed to do," Giuliani told host Chris Cuomo.
Congressional Democrats are demanding details about the complaint, which was deemed "urgent" by the intelligence community's inspector general. That determination would normally mean it must be divulged to Congress, but Trump's handpicked newly appointed acting director of national intelligence ordered the inspector general not to do so.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), head of the House Intelligence Committee, has threatened to sue to obtain details of the still-anonymous whistleblower's complaint.
Lawmakers also want a transcript of the call to Zelensky.
"We must be sure that (Trump) and his administration are conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the president's personal interest," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.
Hillary Clinton accused Trump of trying to enlist foreign help in an election battle with Democrats, like his famed "Russia, if you're listening" speech in 2016.
"The president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again," Clinton tweeted.
Inspector General Michael Atkinson gave scant information about the complaint in a closed-doors hearing Thursday. Acting national intelligence chief Joseph Maguire, who was tapped to replace Dan Coats after he quit along with his deputy around the same time as the complaint was filed, is expected to testify about the matter on Capitol Hill next week.
Congress was already investigating Giuliani's controversial aborted trip to Ukraine in May, which was intended to spur action against the Bidens.
Giuliani has claimed that Trump was unaware of his involvement with Ukraine before it happened, contradicting the Journal's report, and did not order him to put pressure on the country's new leader, a former comedian who was elected in May.
Around the same time, Trump ordered aides to put a hold on $250 million in aid to Ukraine, a package that was designed to help it resist Russian pressure, Politico reported. He finally released the funding last week.
Presidents and other U.S. officials are supposed to act in the best interests of the country and not use their foreign policy decision making power to further their own partisan political interests.
Hunter Biden was director of a Ukraine-based gas company during the time that his father was vice president. Joe Biden pressured Ukraine at the time to fire a prosecutor who was hounding the company, but denies even knowing of his son's involvement in the firm or that the prosecutor was targeting it.

New 5G cellular waves need more safety research

Texto completo: Linda Mason Hunter of Des Moines shuns smart phones in favor of an old-style flip phone, and prefers her devices be wired rather than cellular. "I've lived here 42 years," says the blogger who does a radio talk show," Green Zone" on KFMG and was an editor for Meredith and Rodale Press. She calls the Kingman Boulevard house she shares with her husband "a healthy home." She wrote a book on how to make homes healthy.
But Hunter has grown alarmed about the next generation of wireless cellular technology known as 5G (G stands for generation, not to be confused with the 5G in your router which refers to gigahertz, or GHz). She warns that even people who don't buy those phones could be susceptible to negative health effects from the infrastructure being installed across communities.
"Numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies show that this type of radiation has both immediate and long-term health effects, including increased cancer risk, cellular stress, changes to DNA, memory deficits, neurological disorders, and insomnia," Hunter wrote. On top of which "there is growing evidence of serious risk to the planet — birds, plants, animals, every living thing, the entire ecosystem."
The new cellular technology involves emissions from relatively low-energy radio waves, microwave radiation, and pulsed millimeter waves which have the most energy, with frequencies from 30 to 100 GHz. (Existing cell phones have 2.4 GHz.) Scientists worry most about the high frequency microwave radiation and pulsed millimeter waves, which weaken the membrane around cells, transmitting radiation deeper into the body," said Dr. Magda Havas, professor emeritus at Trent University in Canada at a recent 5G Summit. She said sweat ducts and fluid in the eyes, as well as metal implants in the body, act as "antennae." lnside the cell, electromagnetic radiation can be a precursor to cancer, turning off antioxidants and allowing free radicals to build up and cause toxicity, she contended.
Industry heads don't dispute 5G will increase electromagnetic frequencies and microwave radiation manifold through transmission devices — boxed antennae installed on light and utility poles, described as a network of millions of cell sites close to the ground. They say they're meeting Federal Communications Commission guidelines.
But in a Feb. 6 Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing on the future of 5G, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) said he had written the FCC commissioner asking for safety studies and received only general statements echoing the Food and Drug Administration, which shares regulatory responsibility for cell phones. The FDA claims to urge businesses to undertake health studies, but when Blumenthal asked industry representatives at the hearing if they'd funded any such studies, they hadn't.
Verizon is already providing 5G home internet in 11 cities and plans to bring it to Des Moines before year's end. Its website boasts connectivity 20 times the speed of 4G. But opponents warn even the microwave radiation produced from exposure to cell phones and tablets close to the body hasn't been tested in 22 years. Besides threatening human and animal health, they say, 5G technology could interfere with weather satellites and enable surveillance.
So Hunter, who has never organized a protest before, began a petition drive and voiced her concerns in a letter to Des Moines City Manager Scott Sanders, among others. He replied that cities and states are prohibited under the federal 1996 Telecommunications Act from regulating placement, construction or modification of personal wireless service facilities over environmental concerns, as long as the facilities comply with FCC regulations. State law, Sanders wrote, forbids a city from rejecting an application based on perceived effects of radio frequency emissions.
Hunter, however, contends those laws relate to radio wave frequencies but not to pulsated microwave frequencies, which are most harmful. She sent Sanders an opinion from her husband, Bob Hunter, a law professor emeritus at Drake University, faulting corporations for trying to rush 5G through with FCC assistance. He said nearly 80 cities and counties are suing in federal court claiming the FCC is exceeding its power by limiting local authority.
Verizon spokesman David Weissman said the company follows FCC guidelines. Though declining to address the health concerns, he referred me to a July 16 New York Times piece that contends "mainstream scientists" see no evidence of harm from cellphone radio waves. The article critiques a 2000 study by physicist Bill P. Curry that suggested tissue damage increases with rising radio-wave frequency. It says Curry failed to consider "the shielding effect of human skin" in protecting cells inside the body.
In the recent summit critiquing 5G, Environmental Health Trust scientist Devra Davis referred to 1994 studies showing DNA damage to the brain cells of rats exposed to very weak pulsed signals from cell phone radiation. Studies on humans have detected rare cancers to the brain and nerves from cell phone exposure, she said. A Nov. 1, 2018, New York Times piece acknowledged evidence of links to cancer in male rats, but suggested the higher frequencies of current 4G and 5G cellphones make it harder for those radio waves to penetrate bodies.
As one not swayed by conspiracy theories, who believes children should be vaccinated, I'd paid little attention to 5G until Hunter contacted me. But I look back to when microwave ovens were first introduced in the 1980s, and consumers were warned not to stand in front of them while cooking. "Today, we have phones with the same frequency as a microwave oven, on all the time," said Stephanie McCarter, a Dallas environmental medicine specialist at the summit.
The bottom line is, until we have proper studies, we really don't know what's at stake here, and the government agencies created to protect us don't really seem to care. So it's up to communities to push for better answers.

DEMOCRATS WANT TO IMPEACH KAVANAUGH? GO FOR IT

Texto completo: The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.
No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Justice Kavanaugh than most of the candidates demanded Justice Kavanaugh's impeachment.
"These newest revelations are disturbing," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Justice Kavanaugh's "place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro and former congressman Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and "follow the evidence to wherever it leads." That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Justice Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Justice Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Mr. Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Justice Kavanaugh faced.
Let's relive how Democrats accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties - all without a shred of corroborating evidence.
Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ms. Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ms. Ford.
Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Justice Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sex predator.
That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Justice Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas.
As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were "like an adrenaline shot" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this is a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Justice Kavanaugh's impeachment to "get real." "We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'" Mr. Durbin said. "It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said "no."
Mr. Durbin and Ms. Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Justice Kavanaugh are a godsend for Donald Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could "restructure" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections - packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Justice Kavanaugh or Mr. Trump, they are hurting themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016, "26% of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same." As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

Texto completo: PARIS -- Months after fire engulfed Notre-Dame and the 460 tons of lead on its roof and spire, alarming levels of lead are still being found after decontamination efforts, including at the Paris Police Headquarters -- raising new concerns that the authorities have not fully tackled the problem.
The environmental group Robin Hood said on Friday that lead levels up to 20 times above the safety guidelines had been found on the balcony of an apartment in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés area, on the left bank of the Seine.
And at Police Headquarters on the Île de la Cité, law enforcement measurements in early September showed lead levels reaching 40,000 micrograms per square meter in the courtyard, or over 3,700 micrograms per square foot, the group said.
Such levels are eight times above the safety guidelines issued by regional health authorities.
"The levels we obtained are extremely worrying, and we can be sure that more apartments are in the same situation," Jacky Bonnemains, the head of Robin Hood, said of the apartment.
Frédéric Guillo, a police officer and union representative, confirmed the levels revealed by the organization for the police headquarters. "It proves once again that the lead contamination caused by the Notre-Dame fire is a serious, long-term problem that authorities need to protect their citizens from," Mr. Guillo said in a phone interview.
The police courtyard was cleaned the after the fire, but the authorities ordered additional decontamination after the high levels were found, Mr. Guillo said. He added that the headquarters' courtyard had been accessible to the children of officers who go to a police day care center.
A New York Times investigation found that police officials had closed their own day care centers in the immediate aftermath of the fire, while it took a month for the authorities to start conducting tests in public schools. The Paris police did not respond to requests for comment about the new findings.

Flames engulfed Notre-Dame in mid-April, and the billowing smoke carried huge quantities of toxic particles across the city. Over the summer, the authorities faced growing accusations of neglecting, if not covering up, the risks of lead contamination.
After Robin Hood filed a lawsuit against the state, and test results of the construction site leaked in the French news media, the health authorities began to give a new threshold for concern about lead contamination outdoors, using 5,000 micrograms per square meter instead of the previous 1,000 micrograms, and citing "background pollution" in Paris.
Lead exposure poses the greatest risk to young children, pregnant women and nursing mothers, who can pass on lead contamination to their children, and many parents in Paris have grown worried that they may have not taken enough precautions because of the lack of communication by the authorities.
On Friday, Mr. Bonnemains of Robin Hood said the measurements for lead on the apartment balcony the Saint-Germain-des-Prés area had been made earlier this month at the request of the family.
On the terrace, a mile away from Notre-Dame, another measurement showed levels 14 times above the recommended threshold. On furniture in the house, lead levels four times above the threshold for buildings hosting children were found, Mr. Bonnemains said. He added that the family would test a 3-year-old child in the coming days.
The measurements were conducted by independent contractors, not commissioned by the public authorities, so the method has yet to be verified, said Nicolas Péju, the deputy director of the Regional Health Agency.
"We need to analyze the results before weighing in," Mr. Péju said.
Officials have faced intense criticism for not having encouraged enough families to test their children. As of Aug. 31, of about 400 children tested, six showed lead levels above the risk threshold of 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood. An additional 8.5 percent of those children showed levels at or above the French regulatory threshold for concern, which is between 2.5 micrograms and 5 micrograms.
Charlotte Nithart, the spokeswoman for Robin Hood, said more children should have been tested. "There are thousands of children in the area," she said. "Maybe they're not contaminated, and I hope so. But if we don't look, we won't find out."
Mr. Péju said several hundred more children had had their blood tested since early September.
City officials have argued that the fire revealed that Paris faced a wider lead issue. But Mr. Bonnemains said other cities with old monuments were not immune to similar problems from lead contamination.
"What happened to Notre-Dame could well happen in Rome, in Bilbao, in Mexico City," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, was invited for a rare state visit to the White House on Friday with a red-carpet welcome that included a twinkling Rose Garden dinner, a cordial news conference and a televised presidential screed about the latest scandal involving his administration.
The military-filled arrival ceremony had barely concluded when President Trump escorted Mr. Morrison into the Oval Office and, in front of a group of journalists, began disparaging a whistle-blower's complaint that put his ability to conduct himself appropriately with fellow world leaders into question. The prime minister had little choice but to jump into the fray.
As Mr. Trump derided the complaint, which is said to be about his repeatedly pressing the Ukrainian president to talk with Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer who has been calling for an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family, he looked over at Mr. Morrison.
"I've had conversations with many leaders," Mr. Trump said. "They're always appropriate. I think Scott can tell you that."
Finding himself all but ordered to praise Mr. Trump's behavior with allies created an odd situation for a fellow world leader who had been invited to take part in only the second state visit of Mr. Trump's administration. As a more damning picture of Mr. Trump's conduct with Ukraine came into focus, both men made efforts to keep it from overshadowing the ceremony, capping off a day full of announcements of sanctions against Iran and a small troop deployment to the Middle East with a state dinner that resembled a cross between a Mar-a-Lago patio gathering and a black-tie political rally.
As the day went on, Mr. Morrison seemed to signal repeatedly that he was an ally just as happy to help as he was to stay out of Mr. Trump's way.
"Mr. President, Australia may often look to the United States but we have never been a country that been prepared to leave it to the United States," Mr. Morrison said to the president just after he arrived alongside his wife, Jenny. "We don't. That's not our way. We pull our weight."
Mr. Morrison mirrored Mr. Trump's "we'll see what happens" stance on the idea of using further military force against Iran, and let Mr. Trump take the lead in his aggressive pursuit of a trade deal with China, a country the president called a "threat to the world" in a news conference on Friday. For his part, Mr. Morrison said he would like a deal to be reached in the name of global stability.
When it comes to managing the president's mercurial instincts, some of his foreign allies have tried the bromance approach to get what they want. Others have tempted him with royal trappings, like the British did by invoking the actual queen of England. Twice. In his own state visit, Mr. Morrison's pragmatic approach was a marked difference from the way Emmanuel Macron, the French president, participated in the Trump administration's first state visit last year.
During that visit, the two leaders made a show of how much they seemed to personally like each other, even though Mr. Macron had made it clear he had hoped to sway Mr. Trump against pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal.
In the end, their performative bonding proved unable to preserve that pact, and the situation in Iran had devolved into a diplomatic tinder box by the time Mr. Morrison's limousine pulled up to the White House. Mr. Morrison told reporters on Friday that Australia had not been asked to engage further in the conflict in Iran beyond protecting ships from Iranian threats in the critical Strait of Hormuz.
Faced with a list of pressing global matters, Mr. Morrison, for his part, seemed to embrace his status as a just-happy-to-be-here ally. During their visit, the two leaders spoke at length about the shared military history between the two countries. Mr. Trump even gifted the prime minister with a model of a battleship.
"In the First World War, our bond was sealed in blood," Mr. Trump said in his welcome speech.
"We see the world through the same lens," Mr. Morrison agreed.
Later, at a state dinner held in the Rose Garden that Mr. Trump decided to open to reporters, the two men again reiterated the ties between them while seeming all but unaware of the larger conflicts in the world.
Mr. Trump, dressed in a tuxedo, basked in the attention as he walked through the tables, shaking hands and patting backs. Mr. Morrison looked up at the president and beamed. As a military orchestra played Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the U.S.A.," a Trump supporter anthem, Palm Beach socialites mingled with Supreme Court justices and Fox News personalities.
And Mr. Giuliani, the president's lawyer, literally laughed off the escalating situation involving Ukraine as he showed up at the White House, and strolled into the Rose Garden with a date on his arm.

Texto completo: President Trump did not mince words about his feelings on recent reporting that a whistleblower from within the U.S. intelligence community filed a complaint against him.
"Another media disaster," Trump said in response to the question in the Oval Office on Friday. The president had earlier stated that the unknown individual was a "partisan whistleblower," though he admitted that he did not know who it was.
The anonymous accuser alleged that Trump had a conversation with a foreign leader that involved a "promise" that alarmed him and encouraged him to report the incident to the intelligence inspector general. Trump has not further explained the alleged conversation and has firmly denied any wrongdoing.
Trump also spoke of the controversy surrounding the New York Times reporting of allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which involved unsubstantiated claims and a major correction by the newspaper. "This is one of the worst weeks in the history of the fake news media," Trump said to the pool of reporters. "You're a joke."

'More money into the hole': UC insurance meets resistance

Texto completo: "Safeguarding the lives, health and safety of our students and our wider community is the reason
we require our students to carry health insurance
with certain minimum coverages."
Phil Diller
Senior associate dean at UC's College of Medicine
Elizabeth Spatz feels like she's being bilked by the University of Cincinnati.
The senior marketing major, who carefully monitors fees tacked on to her tuition each semester, must buy UC student health insurance for $2,360 total for the school year. Due to an outstanding balance on her account, her status as a student was placed on hold, which prevents graduating and accessing transcripts.
Here's the rub for Spatz: She already has insurance through her mother's plan. But it doesn't meet the minimum requirements set by UC's Board of Trustees.
The requirements include coverage for emergency services, ambulatory patient services and prescription drugs – all areas Spatz has covered under her mother's plan.
But because her mother's plan lacks maternity and mental health coverage, Spatz has no choice but to opt in to UC's plan, too.
Spatz, 21, is not pregnant. She doesn't use substances. And she's less than nine months from graduating.
"Although I'm covered with health insurance, it's not deemed acceptable," Spatz said. "More money into the hole."
But Phil Diller, a professor of family and community medicine and senior associate dean at UC's College of Medicine, said in a statement that "safeguarding the lives, health and safety of our students and our wider community is the reason we require our students to carry health insurance with certain minimum coverages."
Without comprehensive insurance, Diller added, debt from a medical event could preclude a student from graduating, or an illness could spread through the UC community.
Spatz contends her existing coverage is ample. She points to free counseling and psychological services already offered to students.
All students have access to an initial counseling visit and three individual therapeutic conversations, UC spokeswoman M.B. Reilly wrote by email. Group therapy sessions are always free, but Reilly added the program does not include psychiatric care, inpatient or outpatient care or access to hospitalization.
Young adults (aged 21-25) had the second highest incidence of mental illness in 2018 among all age groups, at 27%, according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
Why do universities require insurance? UC has offered or required student health insurance since at least 1978, according to the Ohio Administrative Code. Currently, all students enrolled in six or more credit hours are automatically brought into UC's plan, but they can submit a waiver request to opt out. As part of the request, which is due on the 15th day of each semester, students must prove their existing insurance meets all minimum requirements as set by board rule.
Many colleges and universities in Ohio and nationally require full-time students to carry health insurance, said Reilly.
These mandates, she added, are to ensure a medical event doesn't prevent students from continuing their education. Reilly wrote that UC had "less than five" appeals of waivers denied this fall. And UC's insurance includes benefits such as no charge for primary care visits.
Spatz contends the rule's goal – to keep students in school – may actually be hindered by the rule itself.
She knows several classmates who have dropped out due to general affordability issues.
Adding a mandatory second health insurance premium could hurt students already struggling, Spatz said.
Many universities provide primary care services to students, according to the New York Times. The University of Michigan offers such services for a $10 co-payment, which is covered by a mandatory student fee.
No such fee exists at UC.
Carol Spatz, Elizabeth's mother, became a widow in 2014. Her late husband's employer allowed her to remain insured through his plan for three years. After that, things got trickier for the family.
Carol Spatz is self-employed with no employees, so is ineligible for insurance through her business, she said. She's too young for Medicare.
She has an insurance policy through UnitedHealthcare's Golden Rule plan.
She forwarded emails she sent to UC officials to The Enquirer, in which she seeks a waiver for her daughter.
"This mentally healthy young woman works to help cover her college expenses while maintaining her grades to Dean's List consistently," Carol Spatz wrote to the official.
"Since she will graduate in April 2020 and is not pregnant, even if on the remote chance she were to become unintendedly (sic) pregnant, it would not impact her course of action to graduate."
The official told Spatz she could seek supplemental coverage for maternity and mental health services, to avoid buying into UC's plan.
UC did not have a cost estimate for that contingency.
Carol Spatz finds UC's insurance policy "discriminatory for the people who can't afford a really great plan because of their circumstances."
Her daughter believes it shouldn't be UC's role to monitor its students' health insurance needs.
"I don't see why that's any of their business anyway," she said, "because I'm paying for my education."
"Safeguarding the lives, health and safety of our students and our wider community is the reason
we require our students to carry health insurance
with certain minimum coverages."

Democrats want to impeach Brett Kavanaugh? Go for it! They don't get it: When they make threats like these, they're hurting only themselves.

Texto completo: The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.
No sooner had The New York Times published a unproven new allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, than most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment. "These newest revelations are disturbing," Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter, adding "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Sen. Kamala Harris declared that Kavanaugh's "place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached." Joining in with impeachment calls of their own were Sen. Bernie Sanders, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded that Congress open an investigation and "follow the evidence to wherever it leads." That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that this supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sex predator.
That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up Republican seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were "like an adrenaline shot" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this is a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to "get real."
"We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every prob- lem,' " Durbin said. "It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said "no."
Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could "restructure" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections - packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are hurting only themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016, "26 percent of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same." As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

Lawyers argue presidential immunity

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Lawyers for President Trump argued in a lawsuit filed Thursday that he cannot be criminally investigated while in office, as they sought to block a subpoena from state prosecutors in Manhattan demanding eight years of his tax returns.
Taking a broad position that the lawyers acknowledged had not been tested, the president's legal team argued in the complaint that the Constitution effectively makes sitting presidents immune from all criminal inquiries until they leave the White House.
The president “cannot be subject to criminal process . . . while he is serving as president," the lawyers wrote in the complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court.
While it is unclear how a judge will view the argument, the case is likely to delay the latest attempt to secure Trump's financial records.
The lawsuit was filed in response to a subpoena issued late last month by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to Trump's accounting firm. The subpoena sought eight years of the president's personal and corporate tax returns as the office investigates the role that Trump and his family business played in hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.
Both Trump and the company reimbursed Michael Cohen, the president's former lawyer and fixer, for money Cohen paid to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who said she had an affair with Trump. The president has denied the affair.
Federal prosecutors said in a court filing in July that they had “effectively concluded" their investigation into possible crimes committed by the president's company, the Trump Organization, or its executives. Neither the company nor any of its leaders were charged. However, the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is exploring whether the reimbursements violated any New York state laws.
The lawsuit filed Thursday was the latest effort by the president and his legal team to stymie multiple attempts to obtain copies of his tax returns, which Trump initially said he would make public during the 2016 campaign but has since refused to disclose.
Trump's lawyers have sued to block attempts by congressional Democrats and New York state lawmakers to access his tax returns and financial records. But their arguments in those cases had been made on narrower grounds.
It is an open question whether sitting presidents are immune from prosecution while in office. The Constitution does not explicitly address the issue, and the Supreme Court has never answered the question.
Federal prosecutors are barred from charging a sitting president with a federal crime, because the Justice Department — in memos written during the Nixon and Clinton administrations — has interpreted the Constitution to implicitly grant presidents temporary immunity while they are in office. Those memos, however, do not bind the hands of state prosecutors.
New York Times
White House adds many to list not subject to subpoena
WASHINGTON — The letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee by the White House on the subject of Corey Lewandowski's testimony makes for startling reading.
It claims immunity from congressional subpoena for the following list of people and classes of information:
■ Aides to President Trump, of course, such as Kellyanne Conway, who the White House claims is "absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony."
■ People who aren't aides and have never been aides but have advised the president, such as Lewandowski.
■ People who may not have been aides or advised the president but have provided information to him "in connection with the discharge of his duties."
■ Communications, not just between the president and his advisers, but between his advisers and anyone else, "relating to information or advice that will inform the discharge of the President's responsibilities."
By this standard, Kim Kardashian and her husband Kanye West, who advised the president on the fate of rapper A$AP Rocky after his arrest in Sweden, among other matters, could be considered as immune as Conway.
No president likes headline-grabbing congressional oversight. They all consider it unfair and many resist, stall, and occasionally obstruct. But none have asserted such sweeping exemption from oversight by a coequal branch of government as Trump.
Administration lawyers insist that their claims are "well settled." Legal scholars question that assertion.
"There is no constitutional basis" for the administration's position on testimonial immunity, said Mark Rozell, dean of George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government and author of a definitive study of executive privilege.
It's "nothing more than a self-serving rationale by the executive to wall off Congress from open testimony. This administration, though, has taken the argument to the next level by maintaining it has the right to immunize any and all persons of interest from testifying any time it wants to," Rozell said in an e-mail, "even non-governmental persons who may have direct knowledge of executive branch wrongdoing."
By the standards urged by Trump's lawyers, presidents could have stymied any of the famous oversight hearings in modern times, including the Senate probe of the Watergate scandal, the hearings on the Iran-contra controversy during the Reagan administration, the "Whitewater" probe by committees of both the House and the Senate into real estate dealings of Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the long-running "House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi."
That's because t he president's lawyers argue that they get to decide whether Congress's stated reason for seeking information is "the real reason," as the Office of Legal Counsel said in its opinion justifying noncompliance with a law allowing the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to see the president's tax returns.
If the White House thinks the Congress's motives are phony, it can refuse its demands, the office argued.

Back-to-school PSA shows students running, hiding, fighting gun violence Sandy Hook parents' nonprofit releases video announcement

Texto completo: Familiar back-to-school supplies such as pencils, scissors and gym socks are recast as emergency survival tools in a new public service announcement from the Sandy Hook Promise, an anti-violence nonprofit founded by the parents of victims of the Sandy Hook shootings in 2012.
In the PSA, "Back-to-School Essentials," young students breezily show off their new school supplies before the tone veers into something much darker: A boy marveling over his new sneakers is running down the hallway not to dodge a hall monitor but a gunman. The ad reflects a grim reality for the network of survivors from the more than 228,000 students who have experienced a school shooting since the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999.
The video debuted on NBC during the Wednesday morning broadcast of the "Today" show, paired with an interview of Sandy Hook Promise co-founder Nicole Hockley. Hockley's 6-year-old son, Dylan, was among the 20 children and six adults who were killed in the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
"At the end, the girl with the phone gets me every time," Hockley said on "Today," referencing the ad's final scene, in which a young girl huddles in a bathroom stall to text her mom "I love you" as she hides from an off-screen shooter.
"We don't want people to turn away from it, so pretending it doesn't exist is not going to solve it," Hockley said, explaining the group's motivation for choosing an ad that she says is hard to watch.
The video is the latest installment of anti-violence PSAs the group releases each year. This year's ad promotes "Know the Signs," a campaign for teaching students and school staff members how to recognize and intervene when someone shows warning signs of behavior that could lead to shootings or other forms of violence in schools.
The goal, as Hockley explained, is prevention. She wants people to understand how they can recognize troubling behavior and intervene to stop violence like school shootings before they happen. Other tactics have been more reactive: Sales of bulletproof backpacks for kids have grown every year since 2016.
"I will never put a bulletproof backpack on my kid," Hockley said on "Today." "I think it sends totally the wrong message: He's not a soldier going off to war; he's a boy going off to math class."
The campaign is expanding beyond print and digital to include radio and outdoor advertising, according to Adweek. The ad, The New York Times reported, is expected to receive a boost from $2 million worth of donated media placements from organizations such as the AMC theater chain, Condé Nast and CNN. Democratic presidential candidates including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Andrew Yang and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock have shared the PSA on Twitter.
Previous spots from the campaign have won advertising awards, with the 2016 PSA "Evan" being viewed more than 11 million times on YouTube.

Reaching the century mark hasn't slowed her down Grit, good company and bridge

Texto completo: At 83, Virginia Stephan, armed with only a dust mop, chased a blood-covered intruder out of her home.
These days she gets most of her excitement from her favorite soap opera, "The Bold and the Beautiful," and that's just fine with her.
On Sunday, Stephan celebrated her 100th birthday with family and friends.
She still lives in the home, she and her husband, Robert, built in 1954. Still drives the silver Audi, her son surprised her with in 2005, and frequently completes the New York Times crossword puzzle, in pen, within 30 minutes.
"I clean my own house," she said. "I like to clean. I do my own grocery shopping, too."
Stephan was asleep in her bed in 2002, when she woke to the sound of someone rifling through a desk in a nearby room.
She'd forgotten to secure the rear slider door.
"I never forgot that again!" she said.
An intoxicated man had crashed a stolen car, climbed up the steep hill to Northwest Boulevard, and entered her home.
Did she cower in her bed? Call the police?
Nope.
"I grabbed the dust mop out of the closet and shouted, get the hell out of here!" Stephan recalled.
She scared the intruder so badly; he broke the front door in his haste to get out of the house.
Then she called the police, who found him cowering in some bushes about a block away.
A terrifying incident like that might make some women flee their homes.
Not Stephan.
"I love my house," said Stephan. "I wasn't going to let some guy chase me out of it."
She honed that grit and resolve growing up on a farm in Shelby, Iowa. Stephan was born September 15, 1919, the youngest of five.
Her earliest memory is boarding the school bus. Her maiden name is Best and the bus driver's name was Charlie Best.
"But he was no relation to me," she said, chuckling.
The farmhouse had no electricity or running water, and one of Stephan's chores was bringing in the coal to heat the house.
They ate what they raised on the farm and in her mother's expansive garden. She attributes her longevity to that wholesome diet.
"We didn't have all those insecticides and additives back then," she said.
After graduating as valedictorian in her class of 32, she moved to Iowa City, to live with her sister and attend business college.
She met Robert (RJ) Stephan at a fraternity dance, and they married May 12, 1942, two days after he graduated from dental school at the University of Iowa.
She still has the fitted blue suit she wore at her wedding.
"He was a really good dancer and so was I. We loved to jitterbug," Stephan said. "We just got along good. He played the bass fiddle in a band, and his brother played the saxophone."
A draft notice from Uncle Sam arrived shortly after the wedding. When Robert sailed for Europe on the Queen Mary, Stephan was expecting their only child.
Her husband was from Dillon, Montana, where his father was the town doctor, so Stephan settled into an apartment there. On Nov. 23, 1943, her father-in-law drove her to Butte, where she gave birth to Robert (Bob) Best Stephan.
Two years would pass before his father met him.
"RJ had enough points to come home, but they didn't have a replacement for him," Stephan recalled.
Her husband was a dental flight surgeon with the 384th Bomb Group. When he finally came home, Stephan went to meet his train, and almost didn't recognize him.
"He got dysentery in Southern France," she said. "He was so gaunt!"
RJ established dental practice in Butte, before moving to Spokane in 1950, where he opened an office on Indiana Avenue. His son, Bob, also a dentist, worked at the same office, as did his daughter-in-law, Linda.
Stephan fixed a hot lunch for her husband every day.
"You gotta feed 'em," she said.
And while he enjoyed golf, she said, "I golfed a little, but I didn't have time for it. I was here, mowing the lawn!"
When RJ retired they traveled frequently and enjoyed snowbirding in Arizona during the winter months. He died in 1993 and Stephan still misses him.
"I wish he'd come back," she said. "I'd dance with him."
Stephan said her husband's death forced her to be independent. Nowadays, she only drives during the daytime when the weather is good, but she never misses her weekly bridge group.
"I use to have two groups, but people died and it's hard to find replacements," she said.
She still sets and colors her own hair, and doesn't take any prescription medication - just vitamins.
"I eat an apple a day - half at lunch and half at dinner," she said.
She doesn't own a computer.
"If I needed one, I'd get one."
She reads the newspaper, National Geographic, and less erudite publications.
"I read the tabloids," she said, grinning.
Stephan said her son and daughter-in-law are a tremendous help to her.
"I do get lonely," she said. "But then I work a crossword, or watch television or read the newspaper."
To those who aspire to reach the century mark, Stephan offers this advice.
"Eat your vegetables and take your vitamins."
Then she grinned, and added, "And don't get into trouble!"

Texto completo: Dancing violinist Lindsey Stirling, who mixes classical music with electronica, hip-hop and pop, and whose albums have topped the dance, classical and indie charts, will return to Wind Creek Event Center for a Christmas show, it was announced Wednesday.
Stirling will perform her Warmer in the Winter Christmas Tour at 7:30 p.m. Dec. 9.
Tickets, at $39.50-$99.50, go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday at the event center box office at 77 Wind Creek Blvd., Bethlehem, at www.windcreekeventcenter .com and 800-745-3000.
The tour is in support of her first holiday album, "Warmer in the Winter," which also topped the Classical and Holiday charts when it was released last October and ended up being the No. 2 holiday album for the year.
A statement said the tour will include original songs such as "Christmas C'mon" and "Warmer in the Winter," as well as holiday classics such as "I Wonder as I Wander," "Santa Baby" and "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."
Stirling has more than 12 million YouTube subscribers and has amassed more than 2 billion views on her YouTube channel.
With her combination of modern classical meets dance and electronica music, Stirling is known for her ballerina dance moves and fairy appearance as she plays onstage.
Four of her songs have topped the Classical/Digital singles chart, and two - 2012's "Crystalize" and 2014's "Shatter Me" (featuring Lzzy Hale) - sold gold.
Her most recent album, "Artemis," released Sept. 6, already has topped the Dance, Classical and Indie charts and debuted at No. 22 on Billboard's overall Albums chart - the week's fourth-best debut.
It already has placed two songs, - the title track and "Underground" - in the Top 40 of the Dance/Electronic chart.
Her 2012 self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on the Dance and Classical charts and sold gold, and "Crystalize" crossed over to Top 20 on the Dance/Electronic chart. Her 2014 sophomore album "Shatter Me" hit No. 2 on Billboard's overall Albums chart, went gold and contained the gold Top 10 Dance/Electronica title track.
Her third disc, 2016's "Brave Enough," hit the Top 5 and had the No. 1 Classical/Digital single "Something Wild" (featuring Andrew McMahon). That album went on to top Billboard's year-end Top Dance/Electronic Album list, and made Stirling No. 6 on the Billboard Top Dance/Electronic Artist year-end list.
Stirling also has collaborated with Weezer's Rivers Cuomo and Christina Perri, and her cover version of Imagine Dragons' "Radioactive" with a cappella group Pentatonix won Response of the Year in the first YouTube Music Awards in 2013.
Stirling, 32, got her start as a quarterfinalist on the TV show "America's Got Talent" in 2010.
In 2017, she finished second on TV's "Dancing With the Stars" Season 25.

Texto completo: TOKYO -- When Miki Dezaki decided to make a documentary for his graduate thesis, he examined a question that reverberates through Japanese politics: Why, 75 years later, does a small but vocal group of politically influential conservatives still fervently dispute internationally accepted accounts of Japan's wartime atrocities?
Specifically, Mr. Dezaki focused on what historians call the Imperial Army's sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Korean women and others in military brothels during World War II. He explored in detail the conservatives' case that the so-called comfort women were in fact paid prostitutes.
Ultimately, Mr. Dezaki was unpersuaded -- he concluded that the conservatives were "revisionists," and used terms like "racism" and "sexism" to characterize some of their claims. Now, five of them are suing him for defamation.
The conservatives whom he interviewed in the movie are part of a group that has influence at the highest levels of the Japanese government. They have helped shape what Japanese children are taught, what works of art can be shown, and, perhaps most significantly, how Japan conducts important aspects of its foreign policy, most notably with South Korea.
[Video: The trailer for "Shusenjo," the film by Miki Dezaki. Watch on YouTube.]
Any reference to the women can raise the conservatives' ire. Last month, organizers of an international art fair in Nagoya closed an exhibition after receiving terrorist threats over a statue symbolizing one of the Korean comfort women.
Mr. Dezaki, his supporters and outside historians say the lawsuit over his film shows how nationalists seek to silence those who challenge them, while at the same time using any outlet they can to spread views that run counter even to an official 1993 Japanese government apology to the comfort women.
"The overarching theme of the film is, why do they want to erase this history?" the 36-year-old Mr. Dezaki said.
The 1993 apology has been a festering wound for those on the political right, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who have insisted that the Korean women were not sex slaves because there is no proof that they were physically forced into the brothels.
Diplomatic, economic and security ties between Japan and South Korea have reached their lowest point in years, a rupture that can be traced to the long-raging dispute over what Japan still owes for abuses committed during its colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula, including its treatment of the comfort women.
The conservatives have generally avoided the kind of reckoning that Germany has undergone in atoning for the Holocaust, as they argue that the actions of Japan during the war were no worse than those of other nations, and should not damage national pride.
Many of the most vocal right-wing critics of the mainstream view of comfort women are older Japanese, but a younger cadre of social-media-savvy activists regularly pounce on those who describe the women as sex slaves.
"It is an issue that people get wild-eyed over," said Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and a specialist in Japanese war memory.
She said passions also run strong in South Korea, where activists accept no deviations from the narrative that the women were brutally enslaved. In 2015, a court ordered a South Korean scholar to redact numerous passages from a book that suggested that the relationship between soldiers and the comfort women was more complex.
Mr. Dezaki's two-hour documentary, "Shusenjo: The Main Battleground of the Comfort Women Issue," has been shown commercially in Japan and South Korea and will be shown on college campuses in the United States this fall.
When he began his research, Mr. Dezaki, a second-generation Japanese-American who grew up in Florida and learned little about the comfort women from his Japanese immigrant parents, said he wondered whether historical accounts in the Western news media "had gotten it wrong somehow."
To understand the mainstream view, he interviewed historians, advocates and lawyers who described their evidence. Documents have proved the Japanese military's direct role in managing the brothels, and hundreds of women have described harrowing conditions in so-called comfort stations.
But the mainstream experts Mr. Dezaki interviewed were also open about the lack of direct proof that the Japanese military physically abducted the women -- a fact that the conservatives seize on -- and forthright about the wide-ranging estimates of the numbers of women involved.
In the film, Mr. Dezaki highlights a 1944 American Army document, cited by the conservatives, in which 20 Korean comfort women interviewed in Burma are described as "nothing more than" prostitutes who were "attached to the Japanese Army for the benefit of the soldiers." That same document says the women were recruited under "false pretenses."
Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a retired history professor who uncovered key documents describing the military's management of the brothels, said that by "denying one point," the conservatives "seek to deny the big picture."
Much of the film dwells on the nature of coercion. In the end, Mr. Dezaki said, he was persuaded by the scholars who say the women were forced or deceived into providing sex to soldiers against their will. In the movie, he concludes that to remember the comfort women is to fight "against racism, sexism and fascism."
"I did not defame them," Mr. Dezaki said of the conservatives. "I made a film that documents the issue and the people involved."
He added: "Information is revealed in the film, and how the audience interprets this information is up to them."
But those suing Mr. Dezaki say he is biased. "'Revisionist' is a word with the greatest malice," said Nobukatsu Fujioka, vice president of the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, whose business card reads "Let's create Japanese who are proud!"
Another plaintiff, Shunichi Fujiki, wrote in an email, "I believe this is a fight to clarify who is the one fabricating history." He added that in the United States, liberals "label conservatives as 'segregationists,' 'KKK!' 'the Nazis!' 'Hitlers!' etc., but in actuality, the segregationists they're referring to are themselves."
Kent Gilbert, an American lawyer and celebrity television commentator who has lived in Japan for more than 30 years, said that the film did not misrepresent his views, but that it was "a propaganda hit piece." The comfort women, he said, were just prostitutes.
"Everybody knows that," he said. "If you want to see prostitutes, look for the Koreans. My land, they've got prostitutes all over the world."
In addition to defamation, the lawsuit accuses Mr. Dezaki and Tofoo Films, the distributor, of breach of contract, saying the plaintiffs agreed to be interviewed only for his graduate thesis, not a commercial film. The plaintiffs are demanding compensation and a suspension of all public screenings.
All of the interviewees signed release forms giving Mr. Dezaki full editorial control and copyright, said Makoto Iwai, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Dezaki and the film's distributor. The New York Times reviewed two versions of the release.
Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo who was one of Mr. Dezaki's professors and appears in the movie, said he believed that the plaintiffs were looking for a reason to bring a suit because the film's "interpretation doesn't fit entirely what they like."
Audiences in Japan and South Korea have said the film helped them understand the comfort women controversy in a new way. At a showing in Seoul at Sogang University late last month, Chae Min-jin, 26, said she "realized that we Koreans didn't really know the context and the logic in which the right-wingers in Japan asserted themselves after all."
In Japan, some audience members said the movie revealed information unavailable in their history textbooks. Tsubasa Hirose, a freelance copywriter, wrote on her movie-reviewing blog that she had always thought comfort women "treated people at the hospital, like nurses."
"I didn't know anything," she wrote, "and I wasn't given any opportunity to."
Mr. Dezaki said he did not consider the debate closed.
"My conclusion is not final," he said. "I don't know everything. I feel like I can defend my conclusion based off what I know." But, he added, "I'm always aware that there's a possibility that one of the factors in my argument might not hold."

Texto completo: When was America founded?
The New York Times is trying to “reframe” American history and its teaching by marking the introduction of African slaves into Virginia in 1619 as the year of our “true founding.” This effort denigrates our shared history and ignores the full American story.
Nothing can negate or excuse the horror of slavery. As Abraham Lincoln said, “If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.”
But focusing single-mindedly on the introduction of slavery in 1619, and the legacy of oppression and discrimination against African-Americans that followed, ignores the reasons for hope that have driven generations of Americans. It disregards the fact that many of the original colonies were settled by individuals escaping religious persecution in Europe. And it ignores the fact that many who followed later also were fleeing oppression.
Worst of all, it relegates to the back seat of American history the true miracle of our country’s founding, when citizens with varying backgrounds, interests, and philosophical and religious beliefs came together to create a new form of government never before seen. They came together not on prejudice or passion but on the self-evident truth proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence: That all people “are endowed by their Creator” with the same rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
For the first time in world history, a genuine conversation took place about establishing a government dedicated to liberty and justice. As Alexander Hamilton said, all other countries before America were the product of “accident and force”; only our country had a constitution created by “reflection and choice” of the people.
True, “we the people” did not include everyone at the time — but 1776 laid the foundation for such inclusion. Consider what happened to slavery during our founding. Under British rule, slavery was legal in every colony in 1775. When the Americans started to rule themselves, slavery came under attack. By 1808, the slave trade had been outlawed; slavery had been prohibited in the Northwest Territories; and, slavery had been abolished or put on the path to extinction in eight of the original colonies.
In his fight against slavery, Abraham Lincoln looked back to 1776 for inspiration. In his 1863 Gettysburg Address, he reminded us that “four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”
This is a history worth teaching.
Yet The New York Times and its allies want to push it aside. To them, the introduction of slaves in 1619 is the single most-important event that shaped American history. Everything else, they apparently believe, either flows from that — or is of secondary importance.
There is clearly a need to teach the full story of America’s Founding and our tumultuous and sometimes bloody struggle to live up to its principles. We cannot ignore slavery: its terrible past and continuing legacy is part of the American story. But centering our story on 1619 instead of 1776 is just as misleading as ignoring slavery, creating a warped view of the America that we should all get to know.
Jeffrey Sikkenga is interim executive director of the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.

Texto completo: History will record that Wisconsin's Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Sen. Ron Johnson, RTrump, split on the question of whether to approve President Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, a Bushadministration political fixer who lacks the temperament to serve on the highest court in the land, should never have been considered. And after it became clear that Kavanaugh had lied repeatedly to the Senate over the years, it became clear that no honest senator could vote to confirm him. Baldwin recognized this and, despite the fact that she was in the midst of an intense re-election race, she took a firm stand against the Kavanaugh nomination. Unfortunately, despite accusations of abusive acts committed by the nominee (including the powerful testimony of professor Christine Blasey Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee), a dishonest and irresponsible majority of Republicans in the U.S. Senate put Kavanaugh on the court. Johnson was part of that majority, and he shamed himself and his state. Among the many reasons for removing him from office, this vote belongs at the top of the list.
That fact was driven home by revelations contained in a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. The book provides extensive evidence of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at Yale including corroborating evidence for allegations from Deborah Ramirez regarding an incident the nominee sought to deny and dismiss during Senate Judiciary Committee questioning. The reporters write: "During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been 'the talk of campus.' Our reporting suggests that it was."
Critics of the Kavanaugh nomination pleaded with senators to take more time to investigate whether Trump's pick was telling the truth. Instead, Ron Johnson and his colleagues rushed to judgment. We do not know how Sen. Johnson can look at himself in the mirror. But we do know that the voters of Wisconsin should be wary of this reckless and destructive partisan.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Robert O'Brien, the new White House national security adviser, played a pivotal role in the release of rapper A$AP Rocky from Swedish custody over the summer. Here's what you need to know about President Donald Trump's newest senior aide:
A$AP Rocky negotiation
In July, American rapper A$AP Rocky, 30, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, made international headlines after he was arrested for allegedly assaulting a 19-year-old man in a street brawl in Stockholm. Trump intervened, sending O'Brien, a special envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department, to win the rapper's release from a Swedish jail.
A$AP Rocky's presidential intervention: Why Trump loves to hate Sweden
A judge released A$AP Rocky, pending an outcome in the case, and a court found him guilty in August. The rapper was ordered to pay damages but did not have to spend any additional time in jail.
'Peace through strength'
O'Brien's worldview may be found in his 2016 collection of essays, "While America Slept: Restoring American Leadership to a World in Crisis," in which he sharply criticized the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy.
In an online description of the book, O'Brien advocates for a "peace through strength" strategy "that will allow the next president to make America great again. "
O'Brien steps into the role as Trump's fourth national security adviser and will take on several global disputes, including rising tensions with Iran, an escalating trade war with China and potential new talks with North Korea over its nuclear program.
Hostage specialist
The high-profile release of A$AP Rocky is not O'Brien's only success. The Los Angeles lawyer helped extricate Americans from Turkey and Iran. He played a key role in the release of Danny Burch, an American held in Yemen, this year. Burch was working for an oil company in Yemen when he was kidnapped by gunmen in the capital city of Sanaa in 2017, his family told The New York Times.
American held hostage in Yemen freed: Trump says U. S. citizen Danny Burch returned to family
He helped secure the release in 2018 of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor imprisoned in Turkey for two years and accused of plotting to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. Brunson, who lived in Turkey for more than two decades, rejected the allegations. The case caused a rift between the two countries, leading Trump to slap sanctions and tariffs on Turkey to pressure Erdogan over Brunson's release.
His background as a negotiator is a contrast to the bombastic John Bolton, who clashed with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo before he was ousted as national security adviser.
O'Brien praised Trump during a meeting with Brunson and Vice President Mike Pence in March.
"This wouldn’t happen with all of these hostages and detainees without the support of the president," O'Brien said during the Oval Office meeting. "The president has had unparalleled success in bringing Americans home without paying concessions, without prisoner exchanges, but through force of will and the goodwill that he’s generated around the world. "
Advised Mitt Romney in 2012
O'Brien served as a foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential bid as well as for former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2016.
He has extensive experience in national security and diplomacy, working under Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton as the co-chairman of the State Department's Public-Private Partnership for Justice Reform in Afghanistan. The partnership focused on training Afghan judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers.
He was appointed by George W. Bush as a U. S. representative to the U. N. General Assembly in 2005, where he worked with Bolton, who was the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations.
GOP praise
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , commended the president on his pick despite a tussle over Trump's approach to Iran after Tehran downed a U. S. surveillance drone in June.
“He understands the world for the dangerous place it is,” Graham said of O'Brien on Wednesday. “He’s got great negotiating skills as our hostage negotiator, and I think he’ll be a very sound policy adviser to the president. ”
Sen. Cruz, whom O'Brien advised in his 2016 presidential bid, released a statement calling him "exceptionally qualified. "
"I am confident he will advance our national security during this time of heightened global tension, when enemies like Iran and rivals such as Russia and China are challenging us with new dangers, and I look forward to working with him in confronting those dangers," Cruz said.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul this week said he would reject a settlement agreement with opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma under its reported current terms and announced a lawsuit against several other opioid manufacturers.
In April, Raoul’s office filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of the opioid OxyContin and defendant in thousands of other lawsuits from local municipalities and states affected by the opioid epidemic.
Raoul’s suit alleged the company "dispatched sales representatives to Illinois hundreds of thousands of times" between 2008 and 2017, and "funded third-party publications under the guise of educational materials to promote opioids and downplay their risks."
Raoul alleged these tactics more than tripled prescriptions of Purdue’s opioids in Illinois. In a news release, he pointed to Illinois Department of Public Health statistics that showed more than 2,000 Illinoisans were killed by opioid overdoses in 2017. IDPH also reported instances of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which can be caused by opioid exposure, increased by 64 percent from 2011 to 2017.
In August, Raoul expanded the suit against Purdue to include members of the Sackler family, which founded and operates Purdue Pharma.
"The Sackler family knowingly misled the public and continued pushing Purdue’s addictive opioids without care or consideration of the death and destruction their product caused," Raoul said in a statement Wednesday.
Raoul’s statement was in response to media reports that detailed a tentative settlement between Purdue and thousands of municipal governments and more than 20 states.
The New York Times reported the deal, for which final details are still being negotiated, would compel Purdue to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and dissolve. A new company would be formed that could continue selling OxyContin and other medicines, but its profits would be used to pay the plaintiffs in the suit, which was reported to be worth $12 billion.
Purdue would also be required to donate drugs for addiction and overdose treatment, and the Sackler family would donate $3 billion in cash over seven years but would not be forced to admit any wrongdoing.
Raoul, however, was among at least 20 attorneys general who told NBC News they had not agreed to the deal.
"My office is prepared to hold the Sacklers accountable, regardless of whether or not Purdue declares bankruptcy, and I am pleased that a majority of states will continue to fight," he said in a statement.
According to the news release, Raoul’s expanded suit asks the court to "prohibit Purdue and the Sacklers’ deceptive conduct" to ensure "it does not happen again in the future," and to assess penalties against the defendants. Raoul is also asking the court to require the defendants to pay to help remediate the opioid problem and forfeit profits resulting from the alleged misconduct.
"I reject in the strongest terms, any agreement that does not adequately hold the Sackler family accountable for the irreparable harm their actions caused to families in Illinois and across the country," Raoul said in the statement. "My office expanded our lawsuit against Purdue Pharma to include the Sacklers because as the family behind Purdue, their ruthless pursuit of profits destroyed other families and communities throughout Illinois and the nation."
Raoul filed a similar lawsuit Tuesday against 16 other opioid manufacturers, alleging they "carried out unfair and deceptive marketing campaigns that prioritized profits over public health."
The companies’ actions, Raoul’s office said in a news release, "resulted in unprecedented levels of opioid prescribing, while the distributors irresponsibly flooded Illinois with opioids, failing in their role as gatekeepers in preventing the diversion of opioids."
Raoul’s lawsuit seeks similar results as the one against Purdue: to "abate and remedy the statewide public nuisance," prohibit the manufacturers’ and distributors’ "deceptive and unfair conduct" and force penalties on the companies.
The companies named in the suit are Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Endo Health Solutions Inc.; Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.; Cephalin Inc.; Allergan Finance LLC; Actavis Pharma Inc.; Actavis LLC; Watson Laboratories Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Cardinal Health Inc.; and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation.

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the alleged victim in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by the Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Where the Supreme Court stands today Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5-4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5-4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.
Protests erupted across Washington, D.C., last year in opposition and support of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, and views have changed little a year later.

In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by the Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Where the court stands today Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5-4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5-4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy.
Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
Protests erupted across Washington, D.C., last year in opposition and support of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, and views have changed little a year later.

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the alleged victim in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.

"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.

Chao target of House panel inquiry

Texto completo: The House Oversight Committee said Monday it is investigating whether Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao acted improperly to benefit herself or her family's shipping company.
Two Democratic leaders sent Chao a letter asking her to turn over documents and communications related to the New York company, Foremost Group. Chao's father and sisters own the company, which transports material to and from China.
The New York Times and Politico have reported that Chao may have used her Cabinet position to benefit the company and increase its influence and status with the Chinese government. China has extended hundreds of millions of dollars in low-interest loans to the company for the purchase of foreign-flagged ships.
Chao has denied wrongdoing.
Democratic Representatives Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said they are examining Chao's statements and actions and whether she complied with ethics rules. Cummings chairs the Oversight panel, while Krishnamoorthi heads an economic and consumer policy subcommittee.
A Transportation Department spokesman said Monday the department has received a letter seeking information on a variety of topics based on publicly available information and news coverage. "We look forward to responding to the committee's request," said spokesman Stephen Bradford.

McCabe lawyers say attacks make fair trial impossible
Andrew McCabe, the former acting FBI director, and his legal team have waged a vigorous campaign to dispute allegations that he lied to investigators about a media leak.
In recent months, McCabe's attorneys shared with federal prosecutors and top Justice Department officials a point-by-point rebuttal of what they view as flaws in a possible criminal case against McCabe.
They argued that prosecuting McCabe would be unprecedented, politically driven, and contrary to the very legal thinking that Attorney General William Barr outlined when he decided President Trump should not be charged with obstruction of justice in the special counsel investigation, according to an analysis provided to The Washington Post by McCabe's team, the substance of which was communicated to the Justice Department.
McCabe's attorneys threatened to mount a no-holds-barred defense, arguing that the case should be thrown out because of Trump's frequent personal attacks and raising the prospect that they would demand information that might show investigators were influenced by political bias.
McCabe's team was told Wednesday that Deputy Attorney Jeffrey Rosen had rejected one of their last attempts to get the Justice Department to abandon the case. The team had been told last month that line prosecutors had recommended moving forward, and Jessie Liu, a US attorney for the District of Columbia, had endorsed their recommendation.
But as of Monday morning, no charges had been filed, and there was no sign of the grand jury that had been hearing evidence in the matter previously. That panel was suddenly called back in to the D.C. federal courthouse last week after a monthslong hiatus.

Warren in NYC, makes case for her presidential run
Senator Elizabeth Warren hailed the political power of female-led organizing in a speech Monday night that invoked the deadly 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire to argue that outrage can spark positive change — and to make the case for her own presidential ambitions.
Warren, Democrat from Massachusetts, has long faced doubts from some Democratic leaders and voters who wonder if she would be able to defeat President Trump, because of her outspoken liberal message and voters' possible reluctance to embrace a woman as president. Monday's speech, and the big crowd it attracted, was in part an attempt to rebut such doubts by arguing that liberal women have won big change before.
The Washington Square Park event in New York City, which the campaign said attracted more than 20,000 people and was among her largest crowds, had been heavily promoted by the Warren campaign in the preceding days.
"I wanted to give this speech here — but not because of the arch behind me or the president this square is named for," Warren said, blocks from where the Triangle fire killed more than 140 workers, including many young immigrant women. "We're not here today because of famous arches or famous men," she said. "In fact, we're not here because of men at all — we're here because of some hard-working women."
The event came as the campaign enters a new phase in which voters will be paying closer attention and the field is narrowing, and as Warren is looking for new ways to show off her momentum.
Washington Post
Judge won't toss charge over Muslim candidate threat
A federal judge refused on Monday to throw out a case in which a North Carolina man is charged with anonymously threatening to lynch a Muslim-American man campaigning for a state Senate seat in Virginia. Joseph Cecil Vandevere is charged with interstate communication of a threat to injure a person in connection with a tweet directed at candidate Qasim Rashid. The tweet included a picture of a lynching and read, "VIEW YOUR DESTINY."
Vandevere argued his indictment must be dismissed on First Amendment free speech grounds, claiming the communication in question was not a "true threat." However, US District Judge Max Cogburn Jr. said he cannot rule as a matter of law that the alleged threat was "political hyperbole" or that "no reasonable person would interpret this communication as a serious expression of intent to do harm."

CNN reporting is super reliable, we know because CNN reporters and anchors tell us so

Texto completo: I am starting to think CNN operates under a different definition of “reliable.”
CNN’s chief media correspondent, Brian Stelter, hosted CNN’s chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto this weekend to praise Sciutto’s disputed Russia “scoop,” which alleges the U.S. government “extracted [a] top spy from inside Russia in 2017.”
Good news, guys: CNN says CNN’s reporting is solid. Also, according to Stelter, anyone who claims otherwise of Sciutto’s Russia report is a pro-Trump operative.
“Many pro-Trump outlets, commentators tried to tear down that reporting and say, ‘it might not be true,’” said Stelter, whose show is ironically titled Reliable Sources. “Do you stand by that reporting now, about a week later?”
“One-hundred percent,” said Sciutto, explaining further that stories about covert operations are generally really “difficult” to report.
“And that’s the reality of these situations,” the host of CNN's Reliable Sources agreed. “Different news outlets make different choices about how much to share and how much not to share.”

Sciutto agreed with Stelter’s assessment that his work was basically flawless, adding further that conservative media believe incorrectly that reporters are “spoon-fed” their stories.
I should pause here to note that neither the host nor his guest has made any mention of the fact that the Washington Post and the New York Times’ reporting on the alleged 2017 exfiltration incident explicitly contradict Scuitto’s version of events.
Sciutto reported specifically that the decision to remove the informant was driven “in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.” CNN's reporting stresses the extraction took place in 2017 shortly after the president “discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. The intelligence, concerning ISIS in Syria, had been provided by Israel.”
Sciutto alleges further that "the removal happened at a time of wide concern in the intelligence community about mishandling of intelligence by Trump and his administration.” The CNN report clearly suggests that Trump’s 2017 meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak was the catalyst for the removal of the high-level CIA asset.
But the Times alleges the CIA's efforts to extract the informant date back to 2016. Trump was not even president until 2017. The Times claims also that the American press, not the Trump administration, was responsible for compromising the informant's cover.
The Times reports:
As American officials began to realize that Russia was trying to sabotage the 2016 presidential election, the informant became one of the C.I.A.’s most important — and highly protected — assets. But when intelligence officials revealed the severity of Russia’s election interference with unusual detail later that year, the news media picked up on details about the C.I.A.’s Kremlin sources. C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia. The situation grew more tense when the informant at first refused, citing family concerns — prompting consternation at C.I.A. headquarters and sowing doubts among some American counterintelligence officials about the informant’s trustworthiness. But the C.I.A. pressed again months later after more media inquiries. This time, the informant agreed.
The Washington Post outright contradicts CNN’s story, stating that Trump’s 2017 disclosure of classified information to Lavrov and Kislyak “was not the reason for the decision to remove the CIA asset.” The Times similarly contradicts CNN's version of events, reporting that "former intelligence officials said there was no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source, and other current American officials insisted that media scrutiny of the agency’s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction.”
This weekend, as Sciutto and Stelter agreed that Sciutto’s reporting on the matter was great, the first mention of the Post and the Times’ contradictory reporting came approximately six minutes into their discussion of the matter. It was the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser who finally brought up the elephant in the room, and she did so mostly to argue that the reports are actually not “in dispute."
Sciutto then said, “The prior consideration of exfiltrating this source was also in our story."
No, the "prior consideration" was not mentioned in the CNN story. Even the updated version of his report still does not mention that the agency offered to withdraw the agent back when Barack Obama was still president. Sciutto’s report states only that at the end of the Obama administration, U.S. intelligence officials “expressed concerns about the safety of this spy and other Russian assets.”
Sciutto, who is himself an Obama administration alum, continued, declaring it a dirty Trump White House tactic to question his reporting.
“And what happened, as you know, is that with stories like this, that particularly involve the president, that the messaging machine, including Fox News, sadly, it’s a fact, moves into motion and cites details to the advantage of a counternarrative, right?" asked the reporter.
“Right!” responded Stelter.
Stelter then added, “It is a reality of the world we live in … a troubling reality that there’s this spin machine that’s very powerful these days. But the facts in your story and the Times and the Post — all lot of them pretty much all line up!”
True, the facts “pretty much all line up,” if you ignore all the parts that don’t.

Texto completo: Las páginas en español del New York Times llegaron a su fin este martes.
El periódico anunció que cerró el proyecto lanzado de manera autónoma en 2016. La imposibilidad de monetizarlo obligó a la medida.
“ Lanzamos NYT en Español como parte de un experimento que expandió nuestra cobertura a diferentes idiomas, en un intento de alcanzar y atraer más lectores internacionales”, dijo el periódico en una nota editorial. “Si bien el sitio Español atrajo a una considerable nueva audiencia hacia nuestro periodismo, y produjo regularmente artículos de los cuales estamos orgullosos, no demostró ser financieramente exitoso”.
El medio publicaba artículos en español tanto originales como traducciones de los grandes reportajes de su edición principal. Entre los colaboradores estaban reconocidos autores como Martín Caparrós y Jorge Carrión .
El New York Times en Español tenía una redacción en Ciudad de México. El diario aclaró que se seguirán traduciendo artículos y que se mantendrá activa la dirección www.nytimes.com/es.
Los periodistas de la redacción lamentaron el fin del proyecto.
“Ha sido un camino de mucho aprendizaje y, como bien lo dijo Patricia Nieto, no podría estar mejor acompañada en este periplo. Sigo creyendo que escribir en español siempre es un buen negocio… y el tiempo lo dirá”, escribió Paulina Chavira en Twitter.

Texto completo: Hip-hop star Lizzo was “stayin[g] strong on the road" at the Boston University Fitness and Recreation Center on Tuesday afternoon before her concert in Boston, according to the 31-year-old rapper's Instagram story.
Around 3:30 p.m., Lizzo posted a video of herself squatting in Nike workout clothes at 915 Commonwealth Ave.. She was performing next door to the gym at Agganis Arena as part of the Lizzo: Cuz I Love You Too Tour.
The brief black-and-white video doesn't include any music or speaking by the star, just the voice of a man — apparently a trainer — instructing Lizzo, “Breathe in, breathe out," as she exercises.
Lizzo's performance at the arena was scheduled to start at 8 p.m. She has 16 scheduled tour dates through late October in venues across the country.
Lizzo's songs “Truth Hurts," “Good As Hell," “Juice," and “Tempo" have all made it to the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. “Truth Hurts" marks her first chart-topping song.
The singer made her acting debut Sept. 13 in “Hustlers," in which she plays a stripper in a New York club. The movie made about $33.2 million domestically in its opening weekend, according to the New York Times.
Most recently, Lizzo was in the midst of social media controversy after she publicly accused her Postmates driver of stealing her food on Twitter. “Hey @Postmates this girl Tiffany W. stole my food she lucky I don't fight no more," Lizzo wrote Monday in a since-deleted tweet.
Lizzo apologized in a tweet Tuesday for “putting that girl on blast".
“I understand I have a large following and that there were so many variables that could've put her in danger. Imma really be more responsible with my use of social media and check my petty and my pride at the door," Lizzo wrote.

For its 20th birthday, 'How to Cook Everything' is getting a not-so-minimal update

Texto completo: “How to Cook Everything" has made its way into more than a million first apartments, college dorms, and family homes since it debuted. Guided by author Mark Bittman's chatty, relaxed coaching, countless cooks have used the book to get comfortable in the kitchen. “Anyone can cook, and most everyone should," wrote Bittman in its 1998 introduction. Recipes relied on pantry staples, and built aptitude in basic techniques.
If your vintage copy is hanging on by the pancake batter, you're in good company — and help is on the way. Twenty years after its first release, a completely revised anniversary edition will feature updated recipes, color photos, and an emphasis on sustainability.
On a recent afternoon from his Hudson Valley kitchen, Bittman reflected on the two decade mark.
“You know, 'How to Cook Everything' was never intended to be, 'This is the best way to do this, and this is the best way to do that,' " he said. “It's more, 'This is a really good way to do this that's not going to drive you crazy, and it's going to work.' "
Cleaning up from lunch, Bittman could see his small flock of chickens from the kitchen window. As he clattered, it was impossible not to wonder how the cookbook author and former New York Times “Minimalist" columnist stocks his own pantry.
Bittman reports he's in what he calls “spend-down mode," the time of year when he works through the “10 or 15" types of beans and whole grains on his shelves, augmented by his own garden bounty. He's an avid bread baker and enjoys making tortillas; his simple spiced lentils went over well with recent dinner guests. In essence, he practices what he preaches.
“I do think that's the strategy," he said. “It's not 'go to the store and buy haddock.' It's 'go to the store, buy what looks good, and then I'll help you figure out how to cook it.' "
The 1998 edition reversed baroque tendencies of the 1970s with a simpler “come as you are" approach to cooking. Instead of delivering complicated shopping lists and unwieldy techniques, “How to Cook Everything" invited readers to make the best they could with what they had.
The 20th anniversary edition introduces color photography, something the debut did without, instead relying on Bittman's calm narration to bring recipes to life.
“That was a very conscious decision in the original 'How to Cook Everything,' and it's an equally conscious decision to put them in," said Bittman.
At the heart of the update is how people consider meat.
“If [I] speak in front of an audience and I say, 'Who's eating less meat than they were 10 years ago?' every single person, except for the people who want to appear rebellious, raises their hand." said Bittman. “Not only do people eat meat less frequently, we tend to eat less meat at each serving."
The revised book reflects that change, reducing the emphasis on meat-centric courses, and shrinking the portion size of those dishes — a shift that began in 2008 in a 10-year anniversary update, which launched alongside a vegetarian edition.
“Certainly [for] people of my generation, everybody ate a steak when you sat down to eat beef," said Bittman. “Now in my experience, we cook a steak and divide it two or three or four ways."
A desire to reduce meat intake is part of Bittman's broader thinking around not just how we cook, but the impact of our consumption. He first began writing “How to Cook Everything Vegetarian" as soon as he completed the debut book. This past spring, Bittman launched a new Medium publication called “Heated," which he aims to serve as a platform for more complex food conversations, beyond simply pleasure and nourishment.
“For years, food has not been taken seriously," he said. “We talk about the economy. We talk about politics, we talk about, to some extent, the environment. But we haven't talked enough about agriculture, where food comes from, and how it's produced."
All of that takes root in the kitchen. In the 1998 edition, Bittman lamented the creeping prevalence of convenience food in our diets. “Why are people eating so much junk?" he asked at the time. “Why are they eating in restaurants so much, and why is home cooking dying? That was my crusade."
Since then, he sees some things changing for the better. “I used to have to drive across town to buy soy sauce and olive oil. . . . And now, obviously, those kinds of things are in every supermarket," he said. But disappearing farms and an increase in monoculture means that while local ingredients may be easier to find, prices are higher, and overall, he said, food quality seems to be lower.
That's bad news for our tastes and our diets alike.
“Everyone in the United States has been raised to have problems with food, because we're encouraged to eat junk food, animal products, and sugary food from the time we're born," he said.
“That's how our palates have developed, and study after study show those styles of eating in general are, if not addictive, highly habitual. To break those habits is the work of a lifetime."
But it's possible.
Back in the '90s, Bittman mused that he'd be successful if he could convince Americans to eat rice and beans once a week. Now, he said that's not so lofty a goal — whole grains and legumes once a day could be a new target.
“It seems to me the change happens slowly, even in your own kitchen," he said. “It happens by seeing that there's a different way, and moving towards that."
Still, there are bigger forces in play.
“To put all of this change on individuals is to ignore that our choices are limited to what's out there," he said. For instance, if the majority of supermarket products are made from monocropped corn and soybeans, “We're not getting the kind of choices that we ought to get."
That's too much for any one home cook to solve, he said. “It's sort of the same thing as saying, 'Buy a Prius, turn off your lightbulbs, decrease your food waste,' or whatever other perfectly sound ideas are out there about reducing your carbon footprint."
What we need, said Bittman, are policy changes that impact the way we farm, process, and produce food. “Those changes can't be made for the most part by individuals. They have to be made by regulation, by government, by mandate."
So what's for dinner these days? Two decades later, the Minimalist himself is still simplifying.
“Julia Child once said to me, 'I don't get what's going on with Italian food — all they do is put a few herbs and olive oil on stuff and stick it in the oven.' And that's exactly right," he said.
“Not to take to anything away from her, because obviously, she turned zillions of people on to cooking — but back then it was, 'how elaborate can I make this dish?' and now it's kind of, 'how simple can I make this dish?' and I think that's real progress."
He chuckled. “I would say that."
For many, progress looks like a book so well-loved it has a calorie count of its own. Don't feel too bad if your copy has seen better days — it turns out that it's not entirely your fault.
“The bindings were just terrible!" said Bittman. “People thought, 'Oh my God, I really abused this book!' But in fact, they fell apart immediately."
Veteran readers and fledgeling home cooks alike will have a chance to start fresh when the 20-year edition hits shelves next month. This time, the book takes on a new flavor for Bittman.
“I had no idea this was going to happen, that I was going to write this arguably staple cookbook for a generation or two," he said. “That's a totally cool thing. And it's equally true that there is a broader world out there in the world of cooking."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. , introduced an impeachment resolution against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after a new report of alleged sexual misconduct.
“I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors,” she said in a statement to Boston public radio station WBUR.
Pressley referred to the two women who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his contentious nomination process last October.
“Sexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation’s highest court, and Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation process set a dangerous precedent,” Pressley told WBUR. “We must demand justice for survivors and hold Kavanaugh accountable for his actions. ”
The two-page resolution asks the House Judiciary Committee to investigate the possibility of impeachment.
Democratic leadership seems to have little appetite for a fight over impeachment, and the resolution is unlikely to go anywhere.
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. , the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told Politico on Monday, "We’ve got to get beyond this ‘impeachment is the answer to every problem. ’ It’s not realistic.
"If that’s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we’re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families," he continued.

An essay published in The New York Times on Sept. 14, adapted from a forthcoming book about Kavanaugh, included reporting about a newly surfaced misconduct allegation, as well as potential corroborating evidence for another allegation. The report sparked calls among Democrats for the justice's impeachment and investigation.
The New York Times added an editor's note to the article about information on the allegation that Kavanaugh's "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student" that had been left out of the article originally. "The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident," the Times said.
Kavanaugh has denied the previously reported allegation and declined to be interviewed by the Times about the new allegation.

Any attempt to impeach Kavanaugh is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , called impeachment a "laughable suggestion" Monday. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , vowed that Kavanaugh will not be impeached "over these scurrilous accusations. "
Only once has a Supreme Court justice been impeached. Samuel Chase, a Federalist justice appointed by President George Washington, was impeached by a Democratic-Republican House in 1804 for "arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust" decisions on the court.
The Senate declined to remove him from office.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- As the F.B.I. began looking into allegations of sexual assault against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings last year, a Democratic senator wrote to the director of the bureau saying that he had "information relevant" to the inquiry, but that the F.B.I. apparently failed to follow up.
The letter, sent early last October by Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, to Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has come to light after a forthcoming book by two New York Times reporters surfaced a new allegation of sexual impropriety by a young Mr. Kavanaugh.
The revelations have reopened the bitter partisan debate over the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, just as he is coming up on his first anniversary on the Supreme Court, and raised fresh questions about how the F.B.I., under the direction of the White House, handled its investigation of the nominee.
Democrats, then and now, argue that the inquiry was insufficient and geared more toward clearing President Trump's Supreme Court pick than toward uncovering the truth. Some of them, including several presidential candidates, seized on the new information to call for Justice Kavanaugh's impeachment, or a new inquiry into the investigation that preceded his confirmation.
In his missive, Mr. Coons told Mr. Wray that he and his colleagues had heard from several people who wanted to share information about Justice Kavanaugh, but "have had difficulty reaching anybody who will collect their information."
The F.B.I. inquiry was an extraordinary turn in the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh, who appeared to be on a glide path toward confirmation until Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had groped her and pinned her on a bed when the two were teenagers in suburban Maryland. Mr. Trump, under pressure from Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona and a member of the Judiciary Committee whose vote would be crucial to the confirmation, ordered a one-week inquiry.
In his letter to Mr. Wray, Mr. Coons told the F.B.I. director that several people had come to him with additional allegations. In particular, he asked Mr. Wray for "appropriate follow-up" with a former Yale classmate of Justice Kavanaugh's who had information that might have buttressed a claim by another classmate, Deborah Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez had alleged that Justice Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken dormitory party in 1983, their freshman year. Justice Kavanaugh has vigorously denied all the allegations against him.
The bureau pledged to look into the Ramirez allegations, but Justice Kavanaugh's detractors pointed to the Coons letter as evidence that her claims were given short shrift, and that corroborating witnesses were ignored. The F.B.I. declined to comment on Monday, but pointed to Mr. Wray's testimony last year before Congress, where he defended the bureau's handling of the supplemental investigation into Justice Kavanaugh, noting that it had been directed by the White House, which had asked for a narrow inquiry. Under standard protocol, the bureau responds to background investigation requests from the White House, not members of Congress.
Mr. Trump and other backers of the justice furiously defended him, and excoriated The Times, which published an essay in its Sunday opinion pages by the authors of the new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," by the reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. Theirs is one of a spate of coming books about the Kavanaugh confirmation.
"What's happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, quoting the conservative commentator Dan Bongino, who appeared on the president's favorite television program, "Fox & Friends." "This guy is not a good man, he is a great man. He has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him, a disgrace!"
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who is one of the leading architects of Mr. Trump's transformation of the federal judiciary, called the new accusations part of a "deliberate effort to attack judicial independence" by Democrats.
"There they go again, Mr. President. There they go again," Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. "Senate Democrats reopening the sad and embarrassing chapter they wrote last September. The latest allegation was blasted out by a major newspaper despite the apparent lack of any, any corroborating evidence whatsoever."
In a copy of Mr. Coons's letter, obtained by The Times, the name of the classmate with information about Justice Kavanaugh is redacted, but a spokesman for Mr. Coons, Sean Coit, confirmed that it was Max Stier, who runs the Partnership for Public Service, a Washington nonprofit. Mr. Stier, whose résumé includes a stint as one of the lawyers who defended President Bill Clinton during his impeachment, was first identified in the book by Ms. Pogrebin and Ms. Kelly.
"I cannot speak to the relevance or veracity of the information that many of these individuals seek to provide, and I have encouraged them to use the F.B.I. tip portal or contact a regional F.B.I. field office," Mr. Coons wrote, adding, "However, there is one individual whom I would like to specifically refer to you for appropriate follow-up."
In their book, Ms. Pogrebin and Ms. Kelly write that Mr. Stier saw Justice Kavanaugh expose himself to another female student at a different alcohol-soaked party, where friends pushed his penis into the woman's hand. Mr. Stier reported the episode to the F.B.I. and to senators, according to the excerpt published by The Times. Mr. Stier did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.
The F.B.I. acknowledged receiving the letter from Mr. Coons. The two top senators on the Judiciary Committee at the time -- Chairman Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and the top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California -- were copied on the letter.
Mr. Grassley insisted in a speech on the Senate floor on Monday that his "office never received anything from Mr. Stier or his unnamed friends, and we never received an allegation against Kavanaugh like the one referenced in the report over the weekend."
Ms. Feinstein told reporters that "the F.B.I. did not do the investigations that we had hoped they would do," adding, "We do need to clear this up."
The authors have not said whether they interviewed Mr. Stier. An early version of the essay failed to note that the female student declined to be interviewed and that friends of hers have said she did not recall the episode. The newspaper later updated the article to include that information, which exposed The Times to sharp criticism from Republicans.
"The New York Times withheld crucial facts that undercut its own reporting," Mr. Grassley, who presided over the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, said Monday on the Senate floor. "We now have an uncorroborated accusation, rooted only in unnamed sources with no direct knowledge of the event and that the alleged victim doesn't even remember."
Ms. Kelly, speaking on behalf of both reporters, said that while she would "take issue" with Mr. Grassley's "characterization," she "can't get into who our sources were" to protect their confidentiality.
Democrats, though, argued that Mr. Stier's account echoed the episode that Ms. Ramirez described.
"There should certainly be a full, fair investigation, as was never done at the time," said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. "It was a sham, as we said then, and there should be a full inquiry now."
In their book, Ms. Pogrebin and Ms. Kelly recount an episode in which Mr. Coons, deeply frustrated about the scope of the inquiry, called the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, on his cellphone to complain. Mr. McGahn told the senator that the investigation would be conducted "by the book."
"So I said: 'Don, thank you, this is great. Send me the book,"' the authors quoted Mr. Coons as saying. In an interview Monday, Mr. Coons said that he felt then, and still feels, that the inquiry was inadequate, adding that it "turned out to be a brief, cramped and narrow additional investigation."
Despite the calls for Justice Kavanaugh's impeachment from the left, Democrats in Congress who could investigate and initiate proceedings to try to remove him from the court signaled they were cool to the idea on Monday.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told WNYC in New York that he viewed the F.B.I.'s background investigation as a "sham" and said he planned to ask Mr. Wray about it when he appeared for a regular oversight hearing next month. But Mr. Nadler did not promise any additional action before then.
Mr. Nadler had promised last year, around the time of Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation, that he would use his panel to conduct a full-scale investigation of the accusations against the nominee if Democrats won control of the House.
But on Monday, he said, "It's too early to form a judgment one way or another" about a possible case against Justice Kavanaugh, adding, "Frankly, we are concentrating our resources on whether to impeach the president."
Adam Goldman and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

'Extraordinarily Dangerous': Former CIA Moscow station chief blasts leaks on Russian informant

Texto completo: The CIA’s former Moscow station chief blasted leaks to CNN and others about a United States informant inside the Kremlin — which led to the source’s possible identification — calling the disclosures agenda-driven and “extraordinarily dangerous.”
“It looks to me like somebody had an agenda which was to run this through the political meat grinder and use it for political purposes,” CIA veteran Dan Hoffman told the Washington Examiner. “And that’s not why we run intelligence operations.”
A CNN story last week reported a high-ranking informant close to the Kremlin, who’d been passing information along to the U.S. about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direct involvement in the country's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, was pulled out sometime around May 2017. The decision to exfiltrate the informant, amid worries he might be exposed, happened after Trump met with Russian officials in the Oval Office in May 2017 and disclosed some classified information to them, the story alleged.
The CIA immediately pushed back. “Misguided speculation that the President's handling of our nation's most sensitive intelligence — which he has access to each and every day — drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate,” CIA spokeswoman Brittany Bramell said last week.
But the New York Times later reported the CIA first tried to pull the source out in 2016, citing sources who insisted media scrutiny alone — not Trump’s actions — jeopardized the source.
Russian media, then U.S. outlets, reported the former Russian official’s name and that he was living openly under his own name just outside Washington, D.C., with journalists showing up at his home only to be turned away, likely by government agents. The alleged Russian spy is believed to have moved, though it hasn’t been confirmed he is the source.
Hoffman said he wasn't criticizing CNN's Jim Sciutto but the leakers.
"It looks to me like someone was giving him information about sensitive CIA clandestine operations," he said.
“That’s all just extraordinarily dangerous,” Hoffman added.
Russians suspected of working for the West face danger from Putin, he said.
Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer who worked as a British double agent, was poisoned along with his daughter by Novichok, a Russian-developed nerve agent, in March 2018 in England. Former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who also defected to the United Kingdom, was killed in London in 2006 after being poisoned by Polonium-210, a radioactive isotope. Russia is suspected of being behind both attacks.
And the former CIA officer pointed to concerns that this source’s outing might make others less likely to trust that their identifies would remain secret.
“We know more about a source than we do about the people who are exposing the guy, and I don’t think that’s right,” Hoffman said.
This isn’t the first time alleged Russian sources working for the U.S. within the Kremlin were reported. A number of stories in 2016 hinted at it, and British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier — compiled at the behest of the Clinton campaign-funded opposition research firm Fusion GPS and widely circulated to journalists — alleged that information within it was gleaned from Kremlin sources.

The U.S. intelligence community assessment released in early January 2017 concluded “Putin ordered” Russia’s efforts and “Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.” It was speculated that information this specific might mean the U.S. had a mole in the Kremlin.

An article from the Washington Post in June 2017 — around the same time the informant was exfiltrated — revealed the existence of a Kremlin source close to Putin who claimed that Russian interference was directed by him. CIA Director John Brennan allegedly fed this sensitive material to President Barack Obama and a small circle of aides.
A day after Trump granted Attorney General William Barr broad declassification authority in his review of the Trump-Russia investigation in May 2019, the New York Times hinted at fears that Barr’s investigation of the investigators might put U.S. sources at risk, though the source mentioned in the story apparently left Russia two years prior.
“I am confident that the attorney general will work with the intelligence community in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly sensitive classified information,” then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said at the time.
After the Kremlin mole was named this week, the Russian government weighed in.
“I can only say that he was an employee and he was fired, but whether or not he was a spy, we don’t know,” Putin’s press secretary said. “This is an issue for the special services, who are doing their work.”
Russia’s Foreign Ministry sent a request to Interpol to locate the alleged defector, and Russian outlets and officials have pushed innuendo about him, while U.S. intelligence experts warn this could be Russian disinformation to discredit him.

“As a former CIA director I don’t talk about things like this very often,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said of the CNN story on Tuesday. “It is only the occasions that I think put people at risk, when the reporting is so egregious as to create enormous risks to the United States of America, that I even comment the way I just did.”

Liberal Media Scream: Morning shows push questionable Kavanaugh charge

Texto completo: There they go again.
This week’s Liberal Media Scream finds two Monday morning network news shows pushing a sexual misconduct allegation against Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh made in the New York Times, even after the paper put up a correction that watered down the claim.
ABC’s Good Morning America and NBC’s Today opened their Monday shows by hyping a new allegation against Kavanaugh, despite the New York Times' update that the alleged college victim “declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.”

Nonetheless, Cecilia Vega teased on Good Morning America: “Supreme Court chaos. The new report about Justice Brett Kavanaugh alleging another case of sexual misconduct while in college. The 2020 candidates now calling for impeachment as President Trump comes to his defense.”
On Today, Hoda Kotb announced: “Under fire. Calls to impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after a new allegation of sexual misconduct. This morning, our exclusive interview with the reporters who broke that story.”
Tweet
Craig Melvin set up a subsequent segment: “Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is facing growing calls to be impeached in the wake of a new allegation of sexual misconduct when he was a student at Yale. That and more is detailed in a new book from two reporters from the New York Times, and NBC’s Stephanie Gosk sat down with them exclusively.”
Media Research Center Vice President of Research Brent Baker explains our weekly pick: “This is why no one can trust the media. They are so invested in a storyline — in this case, the quest of liberals to ruin the reputation of a Supreme Court justice whom they disdain and want to remove — that they plow forward with a damaging allegation even after its premise has been undermined. They just can’t let go, showing they are liberals first and journalists a distant second.”
Rating: Four out of five screams.

Texto completo: The College of DuPage Fine Arts program, in collaboration with the Cleve Carney Museum of Art, welcomes six artists to campus for lectures and workshops as part of the 2019-2020 Visiting Artist Series.
All lectures are free and open to the public and take place in either the Playhouse Theatre or Belushi Performance Hall of the McAninch Arts Center on the Glen Ellyn campus, 425 Fawell Blvd. To learn more, visit www.cod.edu.
In its fifth year, the Visiting Artist Series provides opportunities for the community to engage with leaders in the fields of contemporary art, design and culture.
This year’s series highlights artists who are committed to engaging with materiality through diverse mediums and practices.
The Visiting Artists Series begins at 1 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 18, with a lecture by messenger, artist and educator Nick Cave in Belushi Performance Hall.
Cave, described as a Renaissance artist, works between the visual and performing arts through a wide range of mediums, including sculpture, installation, video, sound and performance. His solo exhibitions have expanded globally from the United States through France, Africa, Denmark, Asia, South America and the Caribbean.
Cave is most famous for creating "Soundsuits," sculptural costumes enveloping the wearer’s body in everyday objects. "Soundsuits" camouflage the body, masking and creating a second skin that conceals race, gender and class, forcing the viewer to look without judgment.
Cave also works as a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
* Multidisciplinary artist Mie Kongo discusses how her work is driven by a sense of curiosity, discovery, realization and learning through everyday life at 11 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 22, in Belushi Performance Hall.
Kongo creates multidisciplinary work with diverse materials, including ceramic sculptures, installations and porcelain designed objects. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including recent exhibitions at the Arts and Literature Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, 4th Ward Project Space in Chicago, Grunwald Gallery of Art at Indiana University Bloomington and the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago.
Her residencies include Shigaraki Ceramics Cultural Center in Japan, the European Ceramic Work Centre in the Netherlands and Intonation Deidesheim in Germany. She is an adjunct associate professor in the ceramics department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
* Artist Aden Kumler shares her extensive knowledge of medieval art history at 11 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 20, in Belushi Performance Hall.
Kumler is an associate professor in the departments of Art History and Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of Chicago and an affiliated faculty member of the University of Chicago’s Medieval Studies program, Center for the Study of Gender & Sexuality and Divinity School.
She is the co-editor of the International Center of Medieval Art’s "Viewpoints" book series, a new forum for experimental books on medieval art history, co-published by the International Center of Medieval Art and Penn State University Press.
* Installation artist Paola Cabal discusses the intersection between physics and perception at 11 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, 2020, in the Playhouse Theatre.
Cabal is best known for her rigorous observational studies of daylight over time — movements the artist photographs on-site, then paints directly into spaces trompe l’oeil-style using spray paint.
As an artist and educator, Cabal co-teaches a course called "Articulating Time and Space" alongside astrophysicist Kathryn Schaffer at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Cabal has received a fellowship from the Illinois Arts Council, an Individual Artist award from the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation, a joint commission for the Chicago Transit Authority and the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and a residency at the Chicago Cultural Center.
* Visual artist Mary Mattingly discusses her work that explores issues of sustainability, climate change and displacement at 1 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, 2020, in Belushi Performance Hall.
Based in New York, Mattingly creates photographs, sculptures and large-scale public art projects addressing climate change by drawing connections between the social and economic forces that make up the current political ecology impacting our environment.
In 2016, she launched a floating food forest on a barge called "Swale," a social sculpture where people are invited to pick food from an edible landscape in order to circumvent public land laws in New York City that disallow public foraging.
Mattingly recently transplanted a group of edible palm trees to upstate New York to show that the introduced vegetation accounts for predictions in climatological shifts. Mattingly’s artwork has been featured in The New York Times, Le Monde, New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal, as well as on CBS, BBC, NBC and PBS’s Art21.
* Chicago-based architect Vladimir Radutny closes out the series with a discussion about his architecture studio’s belief that architecture is an art form at 11 a.m. Wednesday, April 8, 2020, in the Playhouse Theatre.
In 2008, Radutny founded his Chicago-based architecture and design studio. Radutny’s multidisciplinary architecture practice focuses on innovative design solutions that challenge the conventional interpretations of space, function and material use.
His studio’s approach is idea-driven, relying on imagination and experience to identify the creative nuances within each project. He believes in architecture as an art form with capacity to not just alter space, but to change perceptions, feelings and habits, transcending the workplace, home or in-between.
His practice has been recognized with numerous AIA design awards and, in 2017, Radutny was awarded the Dubin Family Young Architect Award. In addition, he teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology College of Architecture.

Texto completo: In 2017, President Donald Trump was ridiculed by Mayor Bill Peduto for saying, "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." The president's word choice was colorful and easy to attack. Many, including Mr. Peduto, pointed out that Hillary Clinton carried the city of Pittsburgh vote by a wide margin. Mr. Peduto leaped into action and penned a New York Times op-ed with the mayor of Paris about climate change.
Unlike the president, Mr. Peduto did earn the votes from the majority of voters in Pittsburgh. He was undoubtedly elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh. Not India, Tokyo, Cambodia or Israel. The mayor has traveled to all of these places in 2019, according to his own Instagram posts.
The citizens of Pittsburgh deserve a mayor who places his or her primary focus on our unique problems and opportunities.
As both a Downtown resident and businessman, I have witnessed first-hand the deterioration of Downtown safety. I would ask - beg - Mr. Peduto to represent me.
Mr. Mayor, represent the people who are invested, financially and personally, in making Downtown thrive. Work with everyone to solve our problems. Don't blame others. Tackle these issues head-on. Be here, physically and emotionally. Be focused on the problems you can try to solve. The current Downtown violence does not have an easy answer. It may be an unsolvable puzzle. But please try.
Mr. Mayor, place the safety of our citizens and the prosperity of our city above your insatiable addiction to soundbites that play well in uber-liberal circles. As a member of society, I agree that we must help and respect those among us who have fallen into addiction or are homeless or downtrodden. Please don't ignore everyone else. You were, after all, elected to represent all of us.

Texto completo: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — NFL investigators will meet with Antonio Brown's accuser on Monday, a source confirmed to the Globe, officially launching the league's investigation into sexual assault and rape allegations made against Brown by his trainer, Britney Taylor, in a civil lawsuit in Florida.
Brown was permitted by the NFL to play in the Patriots' 43-0 win over the Dolphins on Sunday, and Brown caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown in his debut.
Brown did not make himself available to comment following the game, violating NFL protocol by leaving the Patriots' locker room before it opened to the media.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick would not discuss the decision to play Brown after the game.
Patriots publicist Stacey James told reporters after the game Brown would answer questions, but Brown had quickly vanished, the nameplate above his locker removed.
But Brown's status could change following Monday's meeting between Taylor and NFL investigators, who will ask Taylor to tell her side of the story and if she has any further evidence beyond what she presented in her lawsuit.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will not be present at the meeting, as he is not involved in the league's investigative work.
If Taylor presents compelling evidence, the NFL's personal conduct policy allows Goodell to place Brown on the commissioner's exempt list (the equivalent of paid leave) for an indefinite amount of time. But the meeting with Taylor also could be just the beginning of the NFL's investigation, and Goodell could allow Brown to continue to play until the investigation or the legal process advances further.
As of Sunday night, the NFL has not yet scheduled a meeting with Brown, according to two league sources.
But Brown's attorney, Darren Heitner, has vehemently denied all accusations and said Brown will cooperate with any NFL investigation.
The alleged sexual assaults happened two years ago, and Brown and Taylor have been in confidential settlement talks since April, a league source confirmed.
The latest round of talks ended with an offer of around $2 million for Taylor to end the claims against Brown, with a deadline of last Sunday night. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday.
But Brown chose not to sign the agreement, and instead wants to fight the claims and clear his name.
Brown was also not aware that Sunday was a hard deadline, as there have been several other offers and deadlines throughout the months of negotiation.
Brown did not know the lawsuit would be coming last week, and he found out about it on Twitter via an article from the New York Times.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vigorously defended Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday following a new allegation of sexual misconduct during the Supreme Court justice's college years, as some leading Democratic presidential contenders raised fresh suspicions that Kavanaugh was untruthful during last year's Senate hearings leading to his confirmation to the high court.
In an early-morning tweet, Trump called on the Justice Department to "come to Kavanaugh's rescue," and accused critics of trying to deter the justice from rulings favorable to the administration. The president's angry ripostes came a day after The New York Times reported that a male former classmate at Yale had told the FBI about witnessing an episode similar to, but separate from, an already publicized account by a female classmate, Deborah Ramirez, who said an inebriated Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face during a Yale party in the 1980s.
The authors of The New York Times story said Kavanaugh did not speak to them about the newly reported allegation.
Many of the Democrats who want to challenge Trump in 2020 have frequently referred to the string of sexual-misconduct allegations against the president himself, but there has been little appetite for making the Kavanaugh case a major campaign talking point, in part because the episode was so polarizing. In the ensuing months, the president has often invoked the case at fiery rallies, insisting that Kavanaugh was the wronged party.
But with the campaign season now underway in earnest, the previous allegations, coupled with newly reported information, are again becoming part of the discourse.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California both called for impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying he supported "any appropriate constitutional mechanism" being used against the newest justice.
Warren tweeted that the new allegation was "disturbing," adding: "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Harris declared on Twitter that "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," and Sanders said on Twitter that he should never have been nominated.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who, like Harris, sits on the Judiciary Committee and is seeking the Democratic nomination, repeated her deep misgivings about Kavanaugh in an interview Sunday on ABC's "This Week," citing his judicial views on the power of the presidency as well as the past and current sexual misconduct allegations.
On Twitter, Trump blasted "Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media" for targeting Kavanaugh and "talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment."
"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he urged that the justice sue for "liable," later correcting the spelling to "libel." Trump also accused Kavanaugh critics of acting out of unhappiness over high court rulings.
"They are trying to influence his opinions," the president tweeted.
Many commentators, however, called the situation yet another troubling instance of the president seeking to politicize the Justice Department and federal law enforcement by calling on the department to intercede on Kavanaugh's behalf.
The New York Times article focused on Ramirez's student days and her account of a party at which Kavanaugh, then a freshman, "pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it." The story said the FBI had failed to interview witnesses who may have been able to provide corroborating testimony, and that the paper's 10-month investigation suggested there was evidence to support Ramirez's account.
The New York Times also disclosed a previously unreported allegation: "A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." The article said Stier, who heads a nonprofit organization in Washington, has not come forward publicly with his account, but notified senators and the FBI at the time.
The authors of the Times story said Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about Stier's account, and the article said the FBI did not investigate his claim.

Kathy Peck spares music lovers from hearing loss

Texto completo: Headnote S.F. LIVES
If ever you've asked for, and received a pair of earplugs at a local club when the music got a little too loud, you can thank Kathy Peck. Her organization H.E.A.R. (Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers) has helped destigmatize hearing loss and made way for thousands of musicians and music lovers to receive help through education and referrals.
H.E.A.R. is why in the City of San Francisco, music venues with a dance floor and a capacity of over 500 must make earplugs and fresh drinking water available.
"I think I nurtured people in the education process," said Peck. "Almost all the clubs were compliant," even before the practice became law in 2002 with the help of several city departments, task forces, commissions and then-supervisor Mark Leno. She's also assisted in national hearing health efforts, as in the recent Affordable Hearing Aid Act pushed forward by Senator Elizabeth Warren.
"It's unbelievable I've been able to do all the things in my life that I have," said Peck who is hard of hearing. As the executive director of H.E.A.R. for over 30 years, she still makes her own music and participates in improving civic life: She supports the effort to preserve old growth trees and green space organized by her neighbors, Save Laurel Hill.
"San Francisco used to be the place where they cared about beauty," she said.
"One of the first things the founders of The City did was build Golden Gate Park. Our green space, the air we breathe, the shade, the calm, the peace...instead of dark, concrete blocks and smog."
Peck is a Texan who arrived here just in time to be among the first wave of '70s punk musicians to make, perform and distribute their own music without waiting for a venture capitalist to say yes.
"You just did it," she said.
As bassist with the Contractions, Peck and her bandmates drummer, Debbie Hopkins and guitarist, Mary Kelley started out in Kelley's studio, Truth and Beauty Labs. They found an audience among like-minded artists and at willing venues, like Filipino supper club, The Mabuhay Gardens, and The Deaf Club, a storefront where people with hearing problems gathered. By 1984, the band had graduated to the mainstream, opening a show at the Oakland Coliseum for Duran Duran.
"That changed my life," said Peck, though not in the way you might expect: The combination of the arena's sound system, teenage girls screaming, and her own congenital hearing defect conspired to blow out her ears.
"The ringing was really bizarre. It was like I heard bongo drums outside the door," she remembered. She has since had surgery to partially correct the loss and still writes music though she doesn't play live much. She learned to lip read at the San Francisco Hearing and Speech Center.
Following the incident, she consulted with Flash Gordon, M.D. of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic. "Flash noticed musicians were complaining about their hearing," she said. "We started hanging out and he wanted to do a benefit."
They organized an event at the Rock 'n' Bowl on Haight Street, and H.E.A.R. was born.
"We had the metal bands, Exodus and Testament, playing pool against each other. The lanes were filled with bands and club owners competing. Chris Isaak was walking around, Marga Gomez was telling jokes, and we had a guy doing magic tricks," Peck said. There were also speech pathologists and audiologists to take questions and distribute information. But no one expected to see a line around the building with reporters from Time, Newsweek, People, The Today Show, The New York Times and the Japanese press waiting to speak to Peck about H.E.A.R.
"That was when I realized, this is much bigger than the San Francisco Haight Ashbury crowd," she said. "I physically felt like there was a snowball beside me starting to roll. I just have to hold on and say yes to the ride."
As she remembered the night, so did I: Peck so thoroughly educated locals that when I moved to other cities expecting to find earplugs at the bar, I was disappointed. Peck taught a community of listeners we should care about our ears.
Before the '80s ended, Dr. Gordon asked The Who's Pete Townshend to lend a hand (the guitarist had gone public with his own tinnitus).
"He became a founding donor with a $10,000 gift," said Peck. Other music professionals like concert mogul Bill Graham and the Mabuhay's talent booker Dirk Dirksen, offered ongoing support and gave away free H.E.A.R. plugs; guitar innovator Les Paul became a sounding board and friend.
"His foundation helped our school program," said Peck who has made "tens of thousands" of earplugs, encouraging the once-skeptical hearing device industry to invest in prevention, though she's never sought a patent. "I do education foremost," she said. She brings hearing education to our local colleges with music programs and other institutions, serving new students, alumni and educators at San Francisco Conservatory of Music, SFJAZZ, San Francisco Symphony and the San Francisco Opera Orchestra, among others.
"Other things besides loud music can contribute to hearing loss like medications and diet. It can become a perfect storm," she said.
Peck did some of her initial research at UCSF which gave her an office at the Laurel Heights campus. She conducted the first 10-year study on musician's hearing, published and presented at an early conference of the American Academy of Audiology. She still sees clients, not far from the Muni Presidio yard and the UCSF campus at 3333 California St. which a developer has acquired: The proposed flexible use plan could replace the historic, mid-century modern building and surrounding trees with a nine-story structure and excavation project.
"There used to be a cemetery there," said Peck of Laurel Hill, shuddering at the thought of 15 years of upheaval, the likes of which she and the Save Laurel Hill group hope to prevent.
"I love my neighbors and community," she said. "I've been here 28 years. This house is from the 1880s, built before doorknobs," she said, pointing to its French doors. "Osbourn Dorsey patented the first doorknob. He was a freed slave," she added. "I doubt he was ever paid for his invention."
The Haight's Rock 'n' Bowl is Amoeba Music. The Free Clinic is closed and supporters like the Mab's Dirksen and Bill Graham are long gone. But Peck remains a unique San Franciscan with her own spot in local rock history. As I leave, reflexively reaching for the doorknob, she drops a final piece of knowledge for me to ponder.
"Sometimes hearing loss is not the culprit," she whispered. "You'd be surprised how many people just need to try cleaning out their ears."

Texto completo: A photo circulating on social media shows former President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office meeting with a group of men in turbans and, in a Twitter post that includes the photo, the caption reads: "NeverTrumpers, a president meeting with the Taliban, this is horrific!" A Facebook post of the photo falsely claims, "Ronald Reagan meets with the Taliban. ‘These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers’ — Ronald Reagan, 1985."
The item is untrue on many levels, said PolitiFact.com.
The Taliban didn’t form until the mid 1990s, years after Reagan was out of office. The photo wasn’t taken in 1985, and Reagan never compared the group to the Founding Fathers. The photo is from a Feb. 2, 1983, meeting between the president and Afghan freedom fighters to discuss Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan, PolitiFact said. The quote was likely taken from a Reagan speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1985, PolitiFact said. Reagan was talking about Nicaraguan rebels when he said, "I’ve spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they’re fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance."
The Twitter post, which showed up after President Donald Trump recently announced he had called off a meeting with the Taliban, has been shared more than 1,700 times, PolitiFact said.
Harris didn’t sue Exxon as California AG Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, during a recent climate town hall broadcast on CNN, told viewers she would fight big oil companies that "profit off of harmful behaviors."
Moderator Erin Burnett asked the California senator how she would fight.
"Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?" Burnett said.
Harris claimed, "I have sued Exxon Mobil."
That statement falls short of the truth, according to PolitiFact.com.
In 2016, when Harris was California’s attorney general, her office investigated Exxon over allegations the organization lied about the risk to its business from climate change, PolitiFact said. But there is no public record and nothing her campaign could provide to show she filed a lawsuit.
"(Harris) launched an investigation into Exxon," campaign spokesman Ian Sams told PolitiFact.
In fact checks other media did on the subject, The New York Times said, "An investigation, yes. A lawsuit, no." CNN said, "Though Harris has sued other big oil companies, she has not sued ExxonMobil."
Cinderella’s Castle not dismantled for hurricane A photo showing the spires being removed from the Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, has been shared hundreds of times on social media.
A caption with the photo reads, "BREAKING: Workers have begun removing spires of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom ahead of Hurricane Dorian."
The image has been flagged by Facebook as part of its effort to combat false news and misinformation, according to PolitiFact.com.
"It’s just another iteration of a long-running hoax about Florida hurricanes," PolitiFact said.
In the false photo, a crane appears to be lifting a spire off its base and another spire is completely gone. However, in the original photo, the crane is in the same position while it was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights, PolitiFact said. Both spires are intact. In the altered photo, it appears someone cloned the blue sky and placed it over part of one spire and completely removed the other spire from the picture.
Disney World told PolitiFact on Sept. 4 that the theme park would not dismantle the castle in preparation of Hurricane Dorian.
According to PolitiFact, Snopes.com debunked this story in October 2017, but it can be traced back as far as 1997 to a Chicago Tribune story headlined "25 secrets of the Magic Kingdom," which aimed to dispel a rumor that the castle could be taken apart and said the castle is built to withstand hurricane winds.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha salido este domingo en defensa de Brett Kavanaugh, el juez la Corte Suprema señalado por conducta sexual indebida . Trump ha animado a Kavanaugh a demandar por injurias y asegura que, en caso contrario, el Departamento de Justicia puede salir en defensa del juez.
Tras una investigación de The New York Times que vio la luz este sábado, varios precandidatos demócratas han pedido un juicio político para Kavanaugh . El reportaje de The Times es el borrador de un libro que publicarán en breve periodistas del diario neoyorquino y que asegura confirmar los argumentos de Deborah Ramirez , compañera de universidad del actual juez.
Ramirez afirma que Kavanaugh le mostró el pene durante una fiesta con alcohol cuando ambos eran estudiantes . Al menos siete personas, entre ellas la madre de Ramirez, aseguraron a los periodistas que habían oído hablar de dicha conducta indebida de Kavanaugh antes de que este se convirtiera en juez. El juez negó las acusaciones durante su audiencia de confirmación en el Senado el pasado otoño.
La nota de The Times también revela una cuenta que se hace eco de la historia de Ramirez. El también antiguo compañero del juez en la Universidad de Yale describe cómo Kavanaugh empujaba durante una fiesta sus partes privadas hacia las manos de una compañera . Según el diario, el hombre informó sobre el incidente a senadores y al FBI pero la agencia no investigó.
Algunos d emócratas que se enfrentan a Donald Trump en las elecciones de 2020 dieron su opinión sobre la investigación.
“Las revelaciones de hoy confirman lo que ya sabíamos: durante su audiencia, Kavanaugh enfrentó acusaciones creíbles y probablemente mintió al Congreso”, dijo el senador Bernie Sanders .
The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019
“Brett Kavanaugh mintió al Senado de Estados Unidos y, lo que es más importante, al pueblo estadounidense. Debe someterse a un juicio político”, sentenció Kamala Harris , miembro del Comité Judicial.
I sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.
He must be impeached.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019
“Confirmación no es exoneración. Y estas nuevas revelaciones son inquietantes. Igual que el hombre que lo nombró, Kavanaugh debería enfrentar un juicio político”, dijo la senadora Elizabeth Warren también en Twitter”.
Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019
Otros candidatos demócratas como Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar o Julián Castro también se pronunciaron al respecto. A todos ellos, el presidente Trump les contestó llamándoles “demócratas de izquierda radical” y culpándoles (junto a los “medios ineptos”) de perseguir a Kavanaugh. “¡Solo quieren asustarlo para que se vuelva liberal!”, sentenció.
Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019

We Are Not Alone: Dueling Area 51 Events

Texto completo: A wildly popular Facebook joke about "storming" Area 51 inspired plans for an enormous alien-themed party in the Nevada desert. Now there are three events in the works, including one in Las Vegas sponsored by Bud Light.
The aliens, if they're watching, probably have some questions for humanity. You might, too, so here's a closer look at what's happening.
The Joke
There's not much to it: In late June, Matty Roberts, a college student, created an event on Facebook called "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us."
The event, scheduled for Sept. 20, was meant as a joke about making a run on the mysterious and well-protected military test site in southern Nevada, fabled to be dedicated to the research of real, honest-to-goodness alien spacecraft.
The joke caught fire.
Within three weeks, more than a million people marked themselves down as planning to attend. (By mid-September, the number had reached 2.1 million.) Even the Air Force noticed and, in July, a spokeswoman told The New York Times that "any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous."
Concerned that some might take the call to action seriously and be arrested or hurt, Mr. Roberts decided to plan a sizable "Alienstock" music festival nearby as an alternative, according to reports, teaming up with Brock Daily, a co-host of the Facebook event, and Connie West, of the Little A'Le'Inn, in rural Rachel, Nev., which is home to fewer than 100 residents.
The Drama
Mr. Roberts and Mr. Daily parted ways this week with Ms. West, according to Frank DiMaggio, an event planner who is now working with the two men. Ms. West has said that the party in Rachel is still on, according to The Las Vegas Review-Journal. But according to a statement, the three men say that it's poised to be "FYREFEST 2.0," a rerun of a famously hyped party in 2017 that failed spectacularly.
Instead, they are directing their followers on Facebook and elsewhere to an event on Sept. 19, hosted by the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center and sponsored by Bud Light, which will sell limited-edition alien-themed beer at the event as well as elsewhere in Nevada, Arizona and California. About 8,000 people are expected to attend, according to a spokeswoman for the center, which can hold up to 12,000.
It was a relatively easy move for Mr. Roberts and Mr. Daily because the Las Vegas event was already in the works as a sort of pregame to the bigger desert party, according to Mr. DiMaggio.
"It was exactly what they wanted to happen out in the desert, but all the infrastructure's there," he said.
According to Mr. DiMaggio, the Rachel event had been plagued by a lack of infrastructure, poor planning and secrecy, which had led to concerns among Mr. Roberts and Mr. Daily.
"We are not interested in, nor will we tolerate any involvement in a FYREFEST 2.0," the three said of the festival in Rachel in a statement on the website for the Las Vegas event. "We foresee a possible humanitarian disaster in the works, and we can't participate in any capacity at this point."
In a letter on Thursday, reviewed by The Times, a lawyer representing Mr. Roberts and Mr. Daily asked Ms. West to stop promoting the "Alienstock" event that had been planned in Rachel.
Some of those living in the area were glad to hear that the two men were directing visitors elsewhere, according to Joerg Arnu, one of the fewer than 100 Rachel residents. "We are very, very relieved," he said.
Mr. Arnu accused Ms. West of keeping residents in the dark about the event, while Mr. DiMaggio said she did the same to her fellow organizers.
Ms. West did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Thursday and Friday by email and left with the staff at the inn.
In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Cody Theising, manager at the Little A'Le'Inn, disputed the concerns raised by Mr. Roberts, Mr. Daily and Mr. DiMaggio, noting that permits were approved, parking and camping sites were being sold, and musical acts and ambulance services had been lined up. The commissioners of Lincoln County also voted to declare a state of emergency if things in Rachel got out of hand, according to the news organization.
A Party of the Third Kind
While the Rachel event was in the works, another group of organizers was planning a gathering for Sept. 20 and 21 in nearby Hiko, home to the Alien Research Center, a gift shop.
While that event, the Storm Area 51 Basecamp, will feature food, drink and music, it also includes a lineup of speakers intended to appeal to those interested in aliens and the secretive military base.
"We're focusing on the true believers, we're not looking for a rave in the desert," said Keith Wright, managing partner of Production Specialists of Las Vegas, an events company, and one of the organizers of the Basecamp event.
The speakers include Jeremy Corbell, the director of a movie on Netflix about Bob Lazar, who says he reverse-engineered alien spaceships at Area 51 -- both of whom reportedly served as inspiration for Mr. Roberts's Facebook post.
In an interview, Mr. DiMaggio gave his blessing to the Hiko event and said that Mr. Roberts was considering checking it out.
"They're cool people and they've got a killer event," he said.
Mr. Wright said he and the other organizers were spending about $ 200,000 of their own money and planned to bring myriad amenities into the desert, including about 80 portable bathrooms, generators, food trucks, security and emergency services, and a semi truck filled with bottled water.
Mr. Wright said that he hoped to host no more than 5,000 people at the event in Hiko, which he also said was on the way to both Rachel and Area 51.
"From everything that we're being told, the people are coming," he said. "All we have to do is capture them."

Planned Parenthood and Former Chief at Odds

Texto completo: Leana Wen, the recently fired former president of Planned Parenthood, appears headed toward an increasingly contentious exit, after accusing the organization's leadership of trying to "buy my silence" in a dispute that threatens to prolong and magnify an acrimonious transition at the top of the nation's best known women's health care and reproductive rights group.
Dr. Wen has been engaged in two months of fraught negotiations over her severance package since she was fired in July. She led Planned Parenthood for less than a year and accused the organization of withholding her health insurance and departure payout as "ransom" to pressure her to sign a confidentiality agreement.
She made the accusations in a barbed 1,400-word letter to Planned Parenthood's board of directors this past week, which was obtained by The New York Times. "No amount of money can ever buy my integrity and my commitment to the patients I serve," Dr. Wen wrote.
The public airing of internal discord comes at an inopportune time for Planned Parenthood as both the organization itself and its abortion services have come under assault by the Trump administration and Republican-controlled statehouses.
Planned Parenthood disputed Dr. Wen's characterizations.
"Dr. Wen's recent allegations are unfortunate, saddening, and simply untrue," said Melanie Newman, a senior vice president for communications at Planned Parenthood. "The attorneys representing the board have made every good faith effort to amicably part from Dr. Wen, and are disappointed that they have been unable to reach a suitable resolution regarding her exit package."
Ms. Newman noted Dr. Wen has remained on payroll during the negotiations and will be salaried through mid-October, with health benefits through the end of that month under COBRA. Ms. Newman said Planned Parenthood had offered Dr. Wen a full additional year of salary and health benefits "under terms that are standard and consistent with her employment agreement and any reasonable executive exit package."
The dispute, in many ways, is a classic and familiar one: A fired executive seeking compensation and the organization seeking a non-disclosure agreement.
In a statement on Saturday, Dr. Wen said that, "There should be no dispute regarding the terms of my employment contract, which are clearly spelled out," and that she was disappointed her letter had leaked. People familiar with the matter said a Monday deadline had been set for Dr. Wen and Planned Parenthood to strike an accord.
The internal drama comes as Planned Parenthood is increasingly under external political duress. Last month, Planned Parenthood said it was withdrawing from the federal program that provides services to poor women rather than comply with a new Trump administration rule which forbids referrals to doctors who can provide abortions. The program, known as Title X, had provided $ 60 million annually to the group.
The board of Planned Parenthood fired Dr. Wen, 36, in July after sharp disagreements over what officials there described as her abrasive and flawed management style. Dr. Wen blamed her sacking on disagreements over her reorienting the organization further from abortion politics and more toward its role as a women's health provider.

In her letter, Dr. Wen wrote she believed that de-emphasizing "abortion care is the best way to protect it." "However," she went on, "there is a vocal minority" including many national staff and board members "who prefer a stridently political, abortion-first philosophy."
Dr. Wen said she had "no desire to harm the organization," though some of her July comments about the politics of abortion were quickly seized by conservatives seeking political advantage.
Much of her Sept. 9 letter focused on more personal matters. Dr. Wen accused the two board chairs of preventing her from addressing the full board and wrote that she had declined to sign "a permanent gag on my voice" when she was fired July 16, "despite extraordinary pressure and substantial financial incentives."
Before her July termination, Dr. Wen and the board had been involved in weeks of intense negotiations, according to people familiar with the matter; around that time Dr. Wen also suffered a miscarriage. She wrote about that experience in the Washington Post without informing Planned Parenthood's leadership.
In her recent letter, she left open the possibility of legal action. "I have no desire to file claims against Planned Parenthood for defamation, retaliation, or discrimination," she wrote ominously.
She said that Planned Parenthood was demanding her silence "in exchange for my contractually-guaranteed severance and continued health insurance coverage," calling the efforts "unjust" and "unethical."
Dr. Wen went so far as to invoke the recent Trump administration rules to accuse Planned Parenthood's board of hypocrisy.
"It is deeply hypocritical," she wrote, that Planned Parenthood, "would attempt to enforce a gag order on its immediate past President/CEO while fighting the Trump administration's gag rule on Title X providers."
Ms. Newman said Planned Parenthood had in fact "proposed language to reasonably meet her concerns about the scope of the confidentiality clause."
"We had expected to reach resolution and finalize the package in the coming days," Ms. Newman said, alluding to its potential as a distraction at a pivotal moment. "Our work is more necessary than ever, and we have never been more committed to it than we are today."
On Thursday, Dr. Wen posted on Twitter that she had a new position as a visiting professor at George Washington University and that she was pregnant.

Opioid Defendants Seek to Disqualify Judge

Texto completo: Scarcely five weeks before a landmark federal civil trial in the opioid epidemic, the giant retail pharmacy chains and drug distributors that are defendants in the bellwether Ohio case are seeking to disqualify the judge from overseeing it and nearly 2,300 other opioid-related lawsuits before him.
In a brief filed in federal court at 1:24 a.m. on Saturday, the defendants' lawyers claimed that over the past 21 months, Judge Dan A. Polster has shown his bias against the defendants by making extensive comments about his intention to settle the sprawling case and bring relief as quickly as possible to local governments and individuals hit hard by crisis.
He made such remarks at the first public hearing in the case, in January 2018, when he announced his goal of settling the case rather than having lengthy, costly trials, whose results would almost certainly be appealed.
He continued to press his goal of settlement in public appearances and comments to the media. Articles in The New York Times with quotes from the judge are among those cited in the lawyers' brief.
The two groups of defendants who filed the motion include the retailers Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid and CVS, and the giant drug distribution companies Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson.
Despite Judge Polster's initial statement that he wanted to resolve the case within a year, not only has that deadline long passed, but he also has moved the litigation along two parallel tracks. One is aimed at settlement. But the other is directed at litigation, featuring the trial scheduled to begin next month.
Legal experts said they were surprised at the timing of the move to disqualify the judge, as well as what they called the extraordinary nature of the request. Although there is precedent for the recusal of federal judges, rarely are such motions granted so late in the process.
Howard Erichson, a Fordham law professor who is an expert on complex litigation and legal ethics, noted that the request came after a recent flurry of pretrial decisions against the defendants by Judge Polster.
"If recent rulings had been going the defendants' way, they wouldn't be seeking to get rid of the judge, despite his remarks to the press," Mr. Erichson said.
Lawyers for the retailers and drug distributors argued that Judge Polster had gone to unusual lengths to wade into settlement talks himself, which they said showed a bias toward such a resolution and against the defendants' position. Most recently this week, Judge Polster signed off on a novel negotiation structure that would bind more than 30,000 local governments nationwide that have not yet filed lawsuits.
The motion comes at a time when a group of attorneys general, led by Dave Yost of Ohio, has asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to halt the bellwether trial, in which the plaintiffs are two Ohio counties, arguing that it usurps the power of the states.
Notably, no drug manufacturers joined in the request to disqualify Judge Polster, although they have not opposed it. Several named in the trial, including Allergan, Endo Pharmaceuticals and Mallinckrodt, have already settled.
The defendants' motion comes before a critical hearing on Monday in Cleveland before Judge Polster. The defendants will argue that a central, contested legal theory in the case should be heard by a jury. The plaintiffs maintain that the judge alone should hear the theory, which argues the drug industry has created a "public nuisance" affecting the health and well-being of the counties' citizens, which it must abate.
Peter H. Weinberger, a lead plaintiffs' lawyer in the upcoming trial, said that the executive legal team representing all the cases before Judge Polster remains "confident the judiciary will swiftly respond to yet another attempt by the opioid defendants to delay the trial."
Mr. Erichson thinks the effort has only a slight chance of working, not least because the question first goes to Judge Polster for a decision.
Given the likelihood that the effort will fail, Mr. Erichson said, the strategy behind the 11th-hour gambit heading could be to push Judge Polster to rule more favorably for defendants during the trial, by making him feel exposed to scrutiny.
But the move is very risky, he added, because it could merely manage to irritate the judge.

Texto completo: When will the next recession arrive?
Economists are evaluating such factors as President Trump's endlessly shifting tariff policy, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and such "leading indicators" as the yields in the bond market.
It is good to look at these things. They provide insights about the state of the markets and the economy, but they have severe limitations as forecasting tools. This approach will not produce a definitive advance reading of a major shift from growth to contraction: a recession.
Forecasting such a shift is extremely difficult. But if we are to have a chance at success, it is critical to insert into the discussion another factor entirely: an examination of the popular narratives that may be infecting individual economic decision-making.
The probability that a recession will come soon -- or be severe when it does -- depends in part on the state of ever-changing popular narratives about the economy. These are stories that provide a framework for piecing together the seemingly random bits of information that one picks up from friends, the news or social media.
For consumers these narratives affect decisions on whether to spend or save, whether to take a demanding or an easy job, whether to take a risk or stick with something safer. For businesspeople the prevailing narratives affect deliberations on whether to hire more help or lay off employees, whether to expand or retrench or even start a new enterprise.
For most people, such important decisions are fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty. Hardly any of us have precise formulas to decide our plans. So we allow ourselves to be influenced by the emotions, theories and scripts suggested in the stories we hear from others.
Fortunately, the widespread digitization of text, combined with enhanced capabilities for natural-language processing, is beginning to give us new insights into the history of economic narratives. We are beginning to develop a new economics, one that studies these changing economic stories and metaphors systematically.
In my new book, I describe narratives that can periodically surge into epidemics and are capable of changing the economy's direction or of turning small booms and recessions into big ones.
These narratives cluster around several issues:
■ Public confidence or the lack of it.
■ Social norms regarding extravagance or modesty in consumption.
■ The rise or fall of monetary standards of value.
■ The replacement of manual workers by machines.
■ The threat of artificial intelligence to all human labor.
■ Real estate booms and busts.
■ Stock market bubbles.
■ Profiteering by big business.
■ Wage-price spirals that are pinned on labor unions.
Changes in the current environment may cause a subtle mutation in these perennial stories, causing them to go viral and sometimes increasing their contagious effects or extending the period in which they expand. Much as epidemiologists study infectious diseases, we economists can study the spread and transformation of these powerful stories.
The last recession 10 years ago was exceptionally severe, and it is worth examining closely for insights into how the spread of economic narratives drove human behavior.
It now appears that while Sept. 15, 2008, was a logical moment for the start of a panic, that's not really what happened. That was when Lehman Brothers, an old-line investment bank, failed, and while this was a major economic event, the evidence suggests that it did not foster a viral narrative among the broad population.
Since Lehman was an investment bank, and did not accept deposits from small savers, most people weren't much moved by its demise. Instead, the big change seems to have come on Sept. 25, 2008. That was when the government seized Washington Mutual -- a giant savings and loan association, known as WaMu, that had suffered a sudden mass exodus of depositors -- and sold its assets to JPMorgan Chase for $ 1.9 billion.
That event was often seen to resemble the Great Depression and the collapse of the banking system in 1933. People feared the possibility of spreading bank failures and therefore of personal tragedies.
The public was transfixed when President George W. Bush spoke from the White House Rose Garden on Oct. 10, 2008, about the risk of a serious economic downturn.
While Mr. Bush did not utter the word "depression," he used language that closely resembled that of the first inaugural address of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, perhaps the worst time of the Great Depression.
Roosevelt's memorable words, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," became, in Mr. Bush's Rose Garden speech, "Anxiety can feed anxiety." The New York Times noted that parallel then. It seemed to many people, in real time, that the Great Depression might be repeating itself.
Even before Mr. Bush's speech, Great Depression narratives had been emerging strongly. For example, the number of articles in the ProQuest News & Newspapers database containing the words "Great Depression" rose fivefold from 2007 to 2008. The term, with its emotional resonance, had exploded into an epidemic.
In contrast, other big historical events, like the panic of 1907, have been almost totally forgotten by the public and are unlikely to develop into a big new epidemic.
But the Great Depression narrative is still alive, though it does not dominate at the moment. President Trump's exuberant speeches, if one believes them, still encourage big spending and confidence. Yet older, troubling narratives are waiting to become viral again.
New crises that shake up the economy often surprise economists because no exogenous cause appears to be a sufficient explanation for a downturn. People begin to suddenly frame current events in the context of stories they had heard many times before.
This may seem puzzling until we realize that an old narrative has renewed itself in an epidemic, and people have begun to respond reflexively in their day-to-day decisions. If enough people begin to act fearfully, their anxiety can become self-fulfilling, and a recession, sometimes a big one, may follow.

What's it like to be a woman in rock? Don't ask.

Texto completo: For her 13th birthday in 2001, Sadie Dupuis received a Fender Stratocaster to take to summer camp - something she knew most girls didn't get to experience.
"Every 13-year-old boy, when I was a kid, was handed an electric guitar. Girls weren't really pushed in that direction unless they guided themselves toward it or had really cool parents," she said. "For a lot of kids, their gender [got] in the way of them having access to certain genres of music."
Lindsey Jordan was almost one of those kids. In 2007, when she was 8, her older sister showed her a bill from the Warped Tour. It seemed to her at the time that the entire lineup was male - did you have to be a boy to be in a band, she wondered? Then her sister brought her to a show by Paramore, whose lead singer/keyboardist was a woman. "I saw Hayley Williams and her outfit and she's killing it, and she's so punk, and I was like: That's the coolest thing I've ever seen," Jordan told The Washington Post last year.
Dupuis now fronts the highly acclaimed rock band Speedy Ortiz, while Jordan, recording as Snail Mail, is one of the hottest new artists in guitar-based music. They are two of several female musicians often cited as proof that the gender disparity in rock music is shrinking. And if you scour any critic's best-of list these days, you'll find it all but dominated by women - Mitski, Sharon Van Etten, Robyn, Snail Mail and Boygenius, the supergroup made up of Julien Baker, Lucy Dacus and Phoebe Bridgers.
Yet by almost any measure, women still enjoy far less success in the industry, and female artists say they contend with unspoken quotas that keep them off playlists and festival bills as well as a culture that persists in viewing them as women first and musicians second.
Only 7.7 percent of inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame are women, according to research by Evelyn McDonnell, the director of journalism at Loyola Marymount University who edited "Women Who Rock: Bessie to Beyoncé. Girl Groups to Riot Grrrl." In 2017, Pitchfork found only a quarter of artists booked at the 23 biggest music festivals were women. Since then, more than 190 international festivals pledged to have a 50/50 gender split by 2022, but as of 2018, the magazine found that still "seven out of 10 artists on festival bills are men or all-male bands." And this week, only two of the top 40 songs on Billboard's rock chart are by female-fronted bands.
These numbers aren't relegated to rock. A 2012 study helmed by Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at the University of Southern California and the founder of its Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, surveyed the top 600 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 from 2012 to 2017 and found that 22.4 percent of them were performed by women. Only 12.3 percent were written by women, and only 2 percent of a 300-song subset were produced by women. "When it comes to women's ability to contribute and to lead," Smith told the New York Times, "they're being shut out of the process."
Yet whenever several notable female musicians emerge around the same time, headlines scream their tired refrains.
"Rock's Not Dead, It's Ruled by Women," the New York Times crowed in late 2017. "Women are now at the forefront," declared Pitchfork, "injecting DIY rock of the past with fresh perspectives."
In the 1980s, the music industry hype machine proclaimed Joan Jett and Pat Benatar as the future of rock. A decade later, Alanis Morissette, the Breeders and Bikini Kill had critics declaring that women had finally arrived - a narrative that drew a scoff from Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders.
"Year of the woman rocker?" she asked the Chicago Tribune 25 years ago. "Is that like the year of the pig?"
In fact, "there have always been women at the center of rock music," said McDonnell - from Bessie Smith, with her deep influence on the blues (thus, rock); to Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a pioneer of electric gospel (thus, rock guitar); to Big Mama Thornton, who recorded "Hound Dog" well before Elvis Presley and helped set the pace for rock vocals as we came to know them.
"It's funny," said singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus, who often finds herself lumped into women-in-rock stories. These pieces always state, " 'Women are making such good music right now.' Endquote," she said. "But it's like, [what about] Janis Joplin? Billie Holiday? Ella Fitzgerald?"
Sharon Van Etten - who grew up on PJ Harvey, Liz Phair, Portishead, Hole and Sleater-Kinney - said that while she's glad women in music are getting media attention, she "struggle[s] with wanting to say 'Yeah, women! You've heard of us. We've been hanging out. We can do things like you can.' "
"As a female musician, you get dumped in your little pink sidecar before you've even stepped into your own shoes," agreed Emily Haines, who records as a solo artist, fronts Metric and plays in Broken Social Scene.
Wait a minute. Is this one of those stories?
Admittedly, yes. Yet a number of female rockers grudgingly choose to talk about gender because they feel a duty to ensure women remain visible in their profession.
"It's boring and frustrating to have similar conversations [again and again]," said Julia Cumming of Sunflower Bean. "But at the same time, if there's still girls that don't feel comfortable playing, and they still need to see someone out there to do it, then it's still important to talk about."
Laetitia Tamko, the Cameroon-born multi-instrumentalist known as Vagabon, wasn't sure she wanted to be involved with this story at all - the premise seemed to her "a weird form of sensationalism while being extremely reductive." But she felt a responsibility to represent black women and spread some attention to bands who don't often get national press, such as Mal Devisa, Tasha and Black Belt Eagle Scout.
Plus, the stories might have impact.
"If Lollapalooza or Coachella knows . . . that there's going to be a big article that shows the percentage of women or people of color on their lineup, those are things making really positive changes," said Michelle Zauner, who records as Japanese Breakfast. And increasingly, she's been heartened to hear the discussion move "beyond just women playing music - who are the engineers? Who are the stage managers? Who is the security?"
In truth, unfortunately, those are still mostly men. Behind the scenes, women make up only 5 percent of all audio engineers, according to Sound Girls, a nonprofit organization working to increase that number.
Regardless, the phrase "women in rock" has left many artists with the sense that female musicians are considered interchangeable. "The first thing anybody wants to do is find another woman to compare you to," Haines said. "I've always found that incredibly insulting to everyone and have been waiting, and am still waiting, to be correctly compared to artists of my caliber that, perhaps, are men."
Last year, Sunflower Bean faced an uphill battle taking a new single to radio. "Stations say, 'We like the song, this is a great song. [But] we have too many women in rotation right now,' " Cumming said. "Stations will have about three women they keep in main rotation, and if you are a woman trying to get into that rotation, that means that they're going to kick another woman off. Men's music is still considered music. Women's music is still considered other music, even though women are being photographed, used on the Spotify banners and written about."
Some hope that the rise of streaming might help women sidestep the hard-wired biases of the radio industry. Dacus remembers discovering St. Vincent on Spotify and the thrill of having her entire discography a click away, "when I wasn't making money, and I was eating a banana and a can of fish everyday as my two meals, [and] I couldn't buy music."
"The decentralization of gatekeepers via the Internet has allowed a lot of non-men to find other non-men role models in music," she said. "Maybe there's such a big propping-up of confident, female songwriters because we've all been able to witness that on our own time, and really excessively, on the Internet."
Even streaming services, though, might be imbued with gender bias. A detailed report in the Baffler by culture writer Liz Pelly analyzed both Spotify's biggest playlists along with the ones the service curates for individual users and found its "most popular and visible playlists to be staggeringly male-dominated."
On Today's Top Hits, Spotify's most followed playlist, Pelly "found that over the course of one month, 64.5 percent of the tracks were by men as the lead artist, with 20 percent by women and 15.5 percent relying on collaborations between men and women artists." On her personal Discover Weekly and other playlists curated for individual users by the service's algorithm, she found 79.2 percent of the songs were by men and 12.5 percent were by women. (Male-female collaborations made up 5.8 percent, while 2.5 percent were by unidentifiable artists.)
In the end, many female rockers are frustrated that the conversation so often focuses on what it's like to be a woman with a guitar rather than the actual music .
"I don't sit around and think about being a woman," Zauner said. "I sit around thinking about what kind of music I want to write and what the themes of the album are going to be and what lyrics are going to be interesting to tackle and what plugins to use."
Perhaps St. Vincent summed it up best in a fake television interview she created to promote her 2017 record "Masseduction." She's sitting in a green room, answering questions that flash across the screen.
"Insert question about being a woman in music," the title screen reads.
"What's it like being a woman in music? Very good question," St. Vincent says, as the camera zooms in on her fingernails, which are painted bright yellow with black lettering reading, "F--- off."
It probably goes without saying that she declined an interview request for this story.

Texto completo: Among the gravestones at the Fort Lincoln Cemetery, just over the District line in Brentwood, Md., is one marking the final resting place of James Percy Ault : born 1881, died 1929. Ault was, the marker notes, "Cmdr. of the Carnegie."
Answer Man prefers a different title: magnetician.
Like the researchers Answer Man wrote about in this space last week, J.P. Ault worked for the Carnegie Institution for Science off Broad Branch Road in the District's Northwest. While those other scientists plumbed the mysteries of the atom, Ault studied the invisible magnetic forces that enshroud our planet.
He did this by captaining one of the oddest ships ever to sail the seas. Tragically, his life ended aboard it.
Ault and his colleagues in the institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism studied a vexing problem: The north that a compass points toward usually isn't true north. If you don't know the exact variation between what your compass reads and what it should read, you'll have trouble figuring out exactly where you are. Over the course of a sea journey, these errors can put mariners far off their intended course.
To make accurate charts, Carnegie Institution researchers first chartered a yacht called the Galilee, which sailed from 1905 to 1908. But the iron and steel in the ship affected the researchers' readings.
Louis A. Bauer , Carnegie's director, suggested a new kind of vessel: a ship virtually free of ferrous metal. And thus was born the Carnegie, a "nonmagnetic" ship constructed at the Tebo Yacht Basin in Brooklyn, N.Y., and launched in 1909.
The Carnegie's hull was wood. So were many of the nails holding her together: spikes of hard locust. Other fasteners were bronze or copper. So was the stove and most of the engine, which was powered by gas produced from coal, though most of the motive power came from the 12,900 square feet of sail.
The anchors were bronze and lowered not on chains but on lines made from thick hemp. The crew of 25 ate with silver cutlery.
"The sailors may not carry jackknives nor are observers permitted to carry about with them any iron or steel," wrote the New York Times. "Steel belt buckles, for instance, are taboo. Some wit has gone so far even as to say that a man with an iron constitution is not allowed aboard."
The Carnegie was 155 feet long and weighed 246 tons. That included a negligible 600 pounds of iron and steel. Ironically, a boat funded by a steel magnate - Andrew Carnegie - had as little steel as possible.
"The ship itself was kind of like the space shuttle of its time," the Carnegie Institution's Shaun Hardy told Answer Man.
When the Carnegie paid a visit to Hamburg, 3,000 people were waiting at the dock to welcome it and take a tour.
The Carnegie was at sea for years at a time. On its seven voyages, it covered nearly 300,000 miles crisscrossing the oceans.
Its crew took regular measurements with finely calibrated compasses. The readings were entered in logbooks. Copies were sealed in buoyant, waterproof barrels that were marked with instructions to forward them to the nearest U.S. Consulate. The barrels were then dropped in shipping lanes with the expectation they'd be picked up by passing vessels.
"That's how they transmitted the data back to Washington," Hardy said.
On May 1, 1928, the Carnegie left its berth at Washington's harbor for what would turn out to be its final voyage. The ship had been extensively refitted, an operation that included swapping out its old engine for a new one that ran not on coal gas, but on gasoline.
On Nov. 29, 1929, the Carnegie lay anchored in the harbor of Apia, the largest city on the Pacific Ocean island of Samoa. Ault sat in a deck chair as gasoline was pumped into a holding tank.
A spark ignited fumes in the hold. The explosion blew Ault into the water, killing him and cabin boy Tony Kolar . The Carnegie burned to the water line.
As Ault's body made its long journey back to Washington, The Washington Post eulogized him: "The record of Capt. Ault and of the Carnegie will not be written in water, but in something more enduring, as science and mankind in general learn to appreciate what they have done to add to the knowledge of the world."

Texto completo: "State capture" is a form of systemic corruption in which private companies have improper influence on the state: They use their money to "buy" whole parts of the bureaucracy to ensure that laws and regulations fit their needs. It's an expression the World Bank invented to describe some of the economies in the post-Soviet world.
"Autocratic capture" - a newer phrase invented by Ian Bassin, a lawyer and the director of the activist group Protect Democracy - is something like the opposite. It's a form of systemic corruption in which politicians have improper influence on private companies. They use government power to put pressure on businessmen and to force them, or their employees, to toe a political line.
The term describes, for example, how countries such as Russia, Turkey, Egypt and Hungary deny licenses or contracts to businessmen who have any contact with opposition politicians, or who fund independent media, or who speak out in any way. In the past year, I've watched as Polish businessmen, including some personal friends, have withdrawn from any association with politicians or political life, fearing retribution from an illiberal government that, increasingly, practices autocratic capture, too.
I doubt very much whether President Trump has ever heard the expression autocratic capture, nor do I imagine he cares much about how politics or business operates in Turkey or Poland. But instinctively, it's the policy he pursues. We saw his first attempt at using political power to undermine business in the spring of 2018, when - angry at this newspaper - he attacked its owner, Jeff Bezos, and threatened to have the Postal Service penalize the company Bezos founded and heads, Amazon. He even issued an executive order designed to do exactly that - thanks to which, at one point, Amazon's market capitalization plunged.
We saw it again in September 2018, when Trump launched a round of tweets attacking NBC News and demanding the revocation of its license - something he doesn't, in fact, have the power to do - although apparently the threat was enough to create some unease among television executives. He did it again a few days ago, when he tweeted his approval of a major investment into AT&T, which owns CNN's parent company. An off-the-record spokesman for the investor, Elliott Management, has emphatically denied any political motivation; though a Republican donor, its chief executive, Paul Singer, is not closely affiliated with Trump. Nevertheless, Trump expressed the wish that the company would crack down on CNN and "put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible 'anchors.' "
So far, these kinds of threats and Twitter rages have been mostly aimed at media companies whose employees write about the president. But others are watching, too. Last week a group of CEOs - from companies including Levi Strauss, Gap, Twitter and Uber - sent a letter to Senate leaders calling for expanded background checks for those who want to purchase guns. A New York Times article about the letter noted the absence of several prominent chief executives whose companies are subject, or could be subject, to government regulation. According to the Times, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not sign the letter, although he agrees with its content, because of his fear it would focus negative political attention on his company. Google made the same decision, even though a mass shooting took place at YouTube, a company it owns, last year.
Although these are small incidents, Bassin, whose organization has filed numerous lawsuits designed to enforce democratic norms (I am an adviser to Protect Democracy), fears that this is the canary in the coal mine and that the political chill might spread. Trump's behavior might already be shaping the relationship between the business community and government regulators in ways we can't yet see. How far are we from the moment when a company's CEO feels he or she has to publicly - or privately - praise Trump to get an important license or a better rule? How far are we from the moment when chief executives avoid associating with Democratic politicians for fear it will hurt their bottom line?
There are other side effects to Trump's behavior, too. Internet regulation, including antitrust legislation, is already on the agenda in Europe; in a sane world, it would be on the agenda in the United States, too. But it is not easy to see how good regulatory decisions will be made - in this sphere or any other - if the government's primary interest is pleasing the president, and tech companies' primary interest is avoiding a presidential tweet.
Many Americans, but Republicans in particular, long opposed the nationalization of industry and state-controlled companies that are more common in Europe. Instead, they were proud of the American commitment to both economic and political freedom. How ironic, how tragic, that a Republican president is now undermining both.

Texto completo: Deborah Ramirez’s claims against Brett Kavanaugh about an incident that happened while the two were at Yale University has been echoed in a previously unreported allegation about Kavanaugh shared by another Yale classmate.
New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly have written a book regarding the allegations against the current Supreme Court justice, titled “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.” An essay from the book was published by the Times on Saturday.
Ramirez, who grew up in Shelton, claimed that Kavanugh pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her at a party during her freshman year, according to the Times. When that happened, the Times reported, Ramirez tried to swat him away and inadvertently touched his penis.
The essay also mentions the allegations brought against Kavanaugh by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who went to a Washington-area high school near his. During their 10-month investigation, Pogrebin and Kelly wrote in the essay that although they found Ford’s allegations to be credible, Ramirez’s story was more fully corroborated.
During his Senate testimony, Kavanaught said if the incident described by Ramirez happened, it would’ve been the talk of the campus. Pogrebin and Kelly said their investigation suggested that it had been.
“At least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez’s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge,” the essay states. “Two of those people were classmates who learned of it just days after the party occurred, suggesting that it was discussed among students at the time.”
Poerebin and Kelly said they also uncovered a previously unreported story about Kavanaugh from his freshman year that “echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation.”
According to the essay, a classmate named Max Stier saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. He alleged that he told senators and the FBI, but the FBI never investigated the claim. Although the NYT reporters said they did not communicate directly with Stier, they spoke with two officials who have communicated with him to corroborate the claim.
The reporters said in the essay that Kavanaugh did not speak to them because “we could not agree on terms for an interview.” Still, the reporters made it clear that Kavanaugh has denied the allegations brought against him by Ford and Ramirez. The reporters said he declined to answer questions about Stier’s claims.
Ramirez was never asked to testify at Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings.
“Her efforts to backstop her recollections with friends would later be cited as evidence that her memory was unreliable or that she was trying to construct a story rather than confirm one,” the essay states.
Ramirez’s legal team apparently gave the FBI a list of at least 25 people who might have had corroborating evidence for her allegations. But, despite many of those potential witnesses trying unsuccessfully to reach the FBI on their own, none of them were interviewed.
According to the essay, two FBI agents interview Ramirez and told her they found her to be “credible.”
During her time at Yale, Ramirez told the reporters she felt she never properly fit in with her classmates. But after her allegations against Kavanaugh were brought to light, the Yale community’s support for her came rushing in.
More than 3,000 Yale women signed an open letter to her, praising her courage for coming forward with her allegations. Two days latter, more than 1,500 Yale men issued a similar letter.
Kavanaugh was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice on Oct. 6, 2018. The vote was 50-48.

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is facing a new sexual misconduct allegation that appears to echo a previous accusation lobbed against him.
A New York Times exposé published on Saturday revealed the account of one of Kavanaugh's male classmates at Yale University, who says he witnessed the justice make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student. Max Stier told the outlet he "saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Stier notified the FBI and senators about the incident, but the FBI did not investigate it. Stier has not otherwise discussed it publicly, but two officials who have communicated with him corroborated the story to the Times.
As noted by the Times, Stier's account echoes that of Deborah Ramirez, who previously accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis into her face at a drunken dormitory party, prompting her to swat it away and accidentally touch it in the process.
During his contentious confirmation process, Kavanaugh denied the allegation, saying it would have been the "talk of campus" if it were true. The Times, however, noted that "least seven people" heard about the incident long before Kavanaugh was a federal judge.
The latest accusation follows not only Ramirez's account, but also several other sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court justice, including that of Christine Blasey Ford, who testified during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings that he had attempted to force himself on her at a high school party in the 1980s.
Ford's father reportedly privately expressed his support for Kavanaugh despite his daughter's allegation.

Texto completo: FOXBOROUGH — In one week, Antonio Brown has asked for and received his release from the Oakland Raiders, signed a deal with the Patriots, received an invitation to room at the Brady-Bundchen residence, been accused in a lawsuit of sexual assault and rape by a former trainer, denied the allegations through a lawyer and through his agent in an appearance on “SportsCenter," begun practicing with the Patriots, changed his jersey number, gone on Instagram Live with Alex Guerrero from the TB12 Center, noted gleefully that 17,000 people were watching that broadcast, been dropped by the helmet manufacturer Xenith, which had been sponsoring him since solving his helmet issues in Oakland this summer, and apparently has gotten the green light to play against the Dolphins Sunday.
The Patriots have discussed none of it.
“No," said Phillip Dorsett. “It's the Dolphins."
So, with each new story rising long before the sun each morning, spawning headlines, drawing reporters who might otherwise be covering government or world affairs to Foxborough, and furthering the uncertain circumstances around one of the best receivers in football, that was it. Inside Gillette Stadium, there was no big team meeting called, no edict given from Bill Belichick, according to multiple players. It did not come up in an official capacity.
It had taken a while for Belichick and the coaching staff to even acknowledge the signing of Brown. When they finally did Tuesday, their comments were comically understated.
“Well, we think he'll help our team, but until we start working with him . . . ," Belichick said.
“Just an overall solid player that has done a lot of good things in our league," added offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.
Among the good: 11,207 receiving yards in nine seasons. Four All-Pro selections. A league-leading 15 touchdowns just last season.
But then the bad came.
A little after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, the New York Times broke the news that a woman named Britney Taylor, who met Brown in college and trained him in 2017 and 2018, had alleged in a civil suit that Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions, one of which was described as forcible rape. Included in the lawsuit are messages apparently from Brown to Taylor that describe one of the alleged assaults and contain disturbing, misogynistic language.
At 8:43 p.m., Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, released a statement on Twitter in which he claimed that Brown denies all the allegations and that all sexual activity between Brown and Taylor was consensual.
At 11:49 p.m., the Patriots made a statement in which they said that they were aware of the lawsuit and Brown's reaction, that they do not condone domestic violence, and that the league would be investigating.
Wednesday morning, Belichick walked out of his scheduled news conference after 3 minutes and 50 seconds of back-and-forth. He usually goes for 15-20 minutes. He spoke 151 words total. On Friday, he spoke 231 in one answer about offensive line depth.
He said Brown would be at practice but would not say if he knew Brown was about to be called a sexual abuser when he decided to make him a part of the team. The news conference ended after an exchange in which Belichick was asked what conversations he's had with Brown.
“Yeah, I mean I'm done with that, OK? Anything else on Miami? Any other questions?" Belichick said.
The reporter asked what Belichick meant by “done with it."
“Yeah, and I just answered that question," Belichick answered.
“Well, actually you didn't," the reporter said.
“Actually, I did," Belichick responded, then walked out.
Meanwhile, it was still Wednesday, a big day in Foxborough. The middle of the week is when the padded practices happen. Players are in full install mode getting ready for Sunday.
“It's been the same," said Stephon Gilmore. “Just trying to really break down our opponent. We've got a couple new guys, so we're trying to get to know the new guys. It's been a normal week, we're just going to try to get better. There hasn't been a change."
It went unspoken, but the message had come down from coaches to players that football was their only business. A few select veterans had the OK to speak about the allegations, but only to say that they were serious but people shouldn't rush to judgment.
“It's serious," said Devin McCourty. “I don't think anybody doesn't realize how serious that situation is and everything, but I think from a football standpoint, we've got to be prepared to go out and play against the Dolphins on Sunday because that's what our job calls on us to do."
“I don't want to minimize the serious nature of [the allegations], but I don't feel as though I'm qualified to really speak to it because I don't know anything about it," Matthew Slater said.
Slater, when asked what advice he'd give a new player, did offer one message for Brown that felt a bit pointed.
“No one is bigger than the team," he said.
When that's true, it works both ways. Patriots players tend to surrender some of their individualism and agree to strict rules to be part of the team. If they have a personal issue, they can count on their teammates mostly leaving them alone about it.
“We don't care about that stuff," Gilmore said. “We just try to focus on our job. Stuff happens, you've got to let the coach handle it. Players try to play our game the best that we can and go from there."
Dorsett said he couldn't think of a time when he felt like a teammate was distracted by another teammate's personal issue. If he saw that happening, he'd let coaches handle it.
Slater said he does think some players carry the responsibility of keeping everyone on track, but that the myopic focus in Foxborough mostly trickles down from coaches, namely Belichick.
So while the rest of the world agreed that the most important news was off the field, the Patriots were on to Miami. The task with Brown was to determine which of the plays he'd been taught over the course of the week would make their way into the final game plan.
“That's the question," Belichick said Friday morning. “That's the question we're asking ourselves, too. So, you go through the week like we've done. We've done different things. Now as we get to Friday, Saturday, we'll decide what things we feel comfortable with. We may eliminate some of the things that we've done and concentrate on a certain group. Whether that's five plays, 20 plays, I don't know."
The night before, Brown had gone on Instagram Live from the TB12 Center, where he was working out with Guerrero.
“No matter what they say. No matter what they hate, somebody's still gotta go to work," Brown said in the video.
Brown did not bring up the lawsuit specifically.
“Call God . . . In a time of crisis all I ask is love, dedication, and focus. Stay focused. The devil gonna try to bring you down when you get closer to your goals," Brown said. “The key is, don't let them."
On Friday, Belichick was asked if he had any comment on the video.
“Yeah, I'm just here to talk about the game," he said.
For the last two weeks, the NFL has been trying to keep the attention on its celebration of its 100th season. History, honor, triumph, those sorts of things. Brown has taken the microphone, though, and replaced them with drama and, now, serious scandal. It seems the only focus he hasn't swallowed up is that of his own team.

Texto completo: There's a new deadly menace stalking America: vaping. Health authorities blame it for sickening at least 380 people so far and killing six of them. So President Trump is moving to ban most flavored e-cigarettes.
Good for him.
But he's still doing nothing about a far deadlier plague that America has known about for much longer.
About 100 Americans die every day, on average, from guns. That means some 2,000 lives have been lost in gun-related incidents since the first report of a vaping death. In 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 39,773 gunshot fatalities.
Those deaths included five widely publicized mass shootings, among them at the Fort Lauderdale airport, which took five lives, and the Las Vegas massacre that claimed 58. Data for 2018, incorporating the 17 deaths at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, are yet to come.
While it's the mass shootings that have spread terror across the land and are forcing school children to "learn active shooting drills before they've learned to read," as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg observed during the Democratic debate Thursday night, it's the killings you rarely hear about that take the greater toll on lives and on society. Gang and domestic violence. Street crime. Suicides. Children who find guns at home and other accidents.
Sen. Cory Booker, a former mayor of Newark, put that into a staggering perspective during the same debate.
"We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined, from the Revolutionary War until now," he said.
No one proposed solution can put it a stop to it, but collectively all would help. Taken together, they might end our disgrace as the only advanced nation where anarchy rules.
It's an anarchy forced upon 327 million people by the self-interest of the National Rifle Association, which once supported responsible gun legislation but is now a tool of manufacturers who need to sell ever more guns - a notably durable product - to stay in business.
The NRA owes its power not to reason or common sense but to its perverse influence over Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and other pusillanimous politicians.
Writing in the New York Times, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, plugged for red-flag laws. But killers don't necessarily flash warning signals and when they do, they're sometimes ignored. Rubio needs to dial up the courage for more than that.
Although no one law would be a cure-all, universal background checks are the most obvious and, theoretically, the easiest response to our national crisis. They are already required before sales by licensed dealers, but private sales and gun shows are glaring exceptions.
Background checks do work. According to the chief sponsor in the House, every day they block legal sales to 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers. But the determined ones can find a private sale or a gun show.
A ban on assault weapons, or at least the high-capacity magazines that make them even deadlier, is also essential. Beginning with Columbine High School in 1999, there have been 37 mass shootings costing 443 lives and hundreds more dreadful injuries. At Dayton, Ohio, last month, it took only 30 seconds for someone to kill nine people and injure 27 before police who were on the scene shot him dead. He fired at least 41 shots in that half-minute, which he could not have done with a six-shot revolver - a weapon that was banned even in the frontier days at Dodge City.
According to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, 89 percent of Americans favor universal background checks and 86 percent approve of "red flag" laws to take guns away from people who are demonstrably dangerous to themselves or others.
Despite the unprecedented public opinion, McConnell still refuses to let the Senate vote on the House-passed bill to expand background checks or on any other gun legislation.
The only opinion he cares about is Trump's.
And Trump has been dithering, promising on one hand to seriously consider legislation and on another - his last word - to "protect the Second Amendment."
Deference to the chief executive is not how any representative government, let alone ours, is supposed to work.
"In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates," wrote the anonymous author of Federalist 51. It was either James Madison or Alexander Hamilton.
To check the Congress, however, the Constitution gave the president the power of veto. And because it might be "perfidiously abused," they gave Congress the ability to override a veto.
Congress should do its job and let the president do his job to reduce the country's biggest threat: gun violence.

Texto completo: Early last year, Kevin Roose wrote an article about Andrew Yang's entry into the 2020 presidential campaign. At the time, Yang's candidacy was quixotic -- he was not well known and had never held elected office -- and Kevin's tone was skeptical.
After interviewing Yang about his platform, Kevin called him "a longer-than-long-shot" candidate and figured his campaign would more or less fizzle out over time.
Fast forward almost two years. Yang is running an unexpectedly robust campaign, addressing the perils of automation, that qualified him to stand on stage alongside Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
For Kevin, the question was inevitable: What had he missed?
"Daily" producers wondered if Kevin could somehow answer that on the show. We asked him to re-interview Yang and, afterward, talk to me about what he had learned since his original story.
Kevin flew to Houston, where Yang was preparing for Thursday night's debate and met the candidate at a nearby studio. Kevin began the conversation with a dose of humility. "It seems like there was something in your message that I didn't expect to become a sort of a kitchen table issue for America."
From there, the episode unfolded as a searching conversation about Yang's ideas, especially his plan to give every American $ 1,000 a month (a concept called universal basic income, or U.B.I.); the thinking that lay behind the idea; and why it has resonated with so many Democratic voters.
The episode ended where it began, with Kevin articulating what he failed to foresee in his article back in 2018, when he called Yang's platform a longshot.
"Since then, he's been able to turn it into a discussion about what it means to be a human -- about what we would do if we weren't so worried about making ends meet," Kevin explained. "And I think that's the part that I didn't see when I first met him was that this argument -- this sort of wonky economics argument about automation and U.B.I. and G.D.P. and all these other three-letter acronyms -- that he could make it appeal to people on an emotional level by saying this is not just about giving you free money. But instead, he's saying it's not about the money. It's about what the money can allow you to do. And that's the part that I think I missed."
Throughout the coming months, we will keep finding new ways to introduce you to the 2020 presidential candidates. We welcome your feedback on the best ways to do that.

In the Studio with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey
In the course of breaking open the Harvey Weinstein investigation, which helped spark the MeToo movement, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey uncovered a hidden system around the allegations of sexual assault by powerful men. It's a system more messy and complicated than previously reported -- one that empowers victims and silences them at the same time. That system is now at the center of their new book, "She Said," which was just released. Next week on "The Daily," Jodi and Megan will be our guests, sharing their new reporting about how that system operates.

Hong Kong’s summer of heroic dissent

Texto completo: HONG KONG — The masked men who recently tossed firebombs at Jimmy Lai’s home targeted one of this city’s foremost democracy advocates. Lai, a 71-year-old media billionaire, calls this summer’s ongoing protest “a martyrdom movement” and “a last-straw movement.” It has an intensity and dynamic that bewilders the protesters’ opponents in Beijing and in Hong Kong’s Beijing-obedient city administration.
Today’s mostly young protesters will be middle-aged in 2047, at the expiration of the 50-year agreement that ostensibly accords Hong Kong protected status as an island of freedom. Beijing attempted to whittle away that status with a proposed 2003 law against “subversion.” And by devaluing suffrage by the 2014 requirement that candidates for the chief-executive receive approval from a Beijing-loyal committee. And by this year’s extradition bill that would have facilitated sweeping Hong Kongers into China’s opaque criminal-justice system.
Monday’s New York Times carried a full-page ad paid for by “the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China.” Which means, effectively, by the Chinese Communist Party. The ad said: “We are resolutely committed to ‘One Country, Two Systems’ which provides the constitutional guarantee for Hong Kong’s continued development and success as a free and open society.” The ad pledged “dialogue to talk through differences and look for common ground with no preconditions.”
But the “one county, two systems” formulation, agreed to in 1997, when British authority ended, as a 50-year framework for Hong Kong’s relations with the PRC, is an inherently menacing precondition. And Beijing’s consistently sinister behavior reveals a determination, as implacable as it is predictable, to incrementally nullify “one nation, two systems” by reducing Hong Kong to just another jurisdiction wholly subservient to China’s deepening tyranny.
For Leninists such as Xi Jinping wielding a party-state, nothing is more important than the party’s unchallenged primacy. Another “Tiananmen Square” — a Hong Kong massacre — would be calamitous for China’s Leninists, but less so than weakening the Communist Party’s primacy. The party is, Lai says, “detached from reality” and “will always make the wrong decision” as it tries to become “the most absolute dictatorship in human history.”
In 1940, Winston Churchill warned against “a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.” That is China’s aspiration with “digital Leninism,” an application of science through manipulative technologies that neither Churchill nor his contemporary, George Orwell, anticipated. With a steadily refined repression apparatus, aptly called “cyber-totalitarianism,” China’s surveillance state is enmeshing everyone in a “social credit” system. Individuals’ cumulative commercial and social-media transactions give them a score that determines their access to education, housing, clinics, travel and more, even including pet ownership. Although China’s published statistics are as untrustworthy as the regime itself, there are reasons to believe that in this decade China has spent more on “stability maintenance” than on its military. Hong Kong is watching this.
And Hong Kong is reading Ma Jian’s dystopian novel “China Dream,” which is banned in mainland China but not here. The protagonist is Ma Daode, director of the fictional (so far) China Dream Bureau, which aspires to “replace all private dreams” with one communal dream. Ma Daode hopes to develop “a neural implant,” a device whereby “just one click of a button and government directives will be transferred wirelessly into the brains” of the governed. This is not much more Orwellian than China’s evolving reality.
In her 1951 “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Hannah Arendt argued that a tyrannical regime, wielding bureaucracy and mass media, could achieve permanence by conscripting the citizenry’s consciousness. This echoed Orwell’s foreboding: “Imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever.” In 1956, Arendt thought her theory had been refuted by a fact — the Hungarian Revolution, which demonstrated that no state can interrupt “all channels of communication.” Hong Kong sees Beijing using new technologies in the service of an evil permanence.
“To see what is in front of one’s nose,” wrote Orwell, “needs a constant struggle.” Belatedly, the world is seeing. The Economist recently editorialized: “The West’s 25-year bet on China has failed.” The wager was that “market totalitarianism” is an oxymoron. Embedding China in the global economy supposedly would open it to the softening effects of commerce, which would be solvents of authoritarianism. The West’s tardy but welcome disenchantment is, as the Economist says, “the starkest reversal in modern geopolitics.” If Hong Kong’s heroic refusal to go gentle into Beijing’s dark night is accelerating this disenchantment, the summer of dissent has been this decade’s grandest and most important development.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – ABC says that 14 million viewers watched the third Democratic debate in Houston, Texas, according to the debate's total viewership across ABC and Univision.
About 12. 9 million viewers watched the debate on ABC, and 1. 1 million on Univision.
ABC says that the debate was the most-watched non-sports program of the night.
It also drew a large number of viewers online.
The network noted in a release that ABC's coverage online "drew 2. 9 million unique visitors and 11 million video views," and Univision's livestream on Facebook "reached over 21 million users and generated more than 5 million video views. "
The ratings mean Thursday night's debate was the second most-watched of this year's Democratic debates. The first debate in Miami, Fla. , which had been hosted by NBC and MSNBC and drew about 15. 3 million viewers. The second debate in Detroit, Mich. , which had been hosted by CNN, drew about 8. 7 million viewers.

Amazon is facing questions from Capitol Hill over the safety of its vast delivery network and how the e-commerce giant has evaded responsibility for its role in deaths and serious injuries in crashes involving contractors delivering Amazon packages.
In a letter sent on Thursday to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Sen. Richard Blumenthal decried the company’s “evasive practices and moves to cut regulatory corners,” citing recent investigations by ProPublica and BuzzFeed.
Amazon’s promise of rapid delivery has come with a steep human toll. The ProPublica investigation, which was co-published last week with The New York Times, identified more than 60 crashes since June 2015 involving Amazon delivery contractors that resulted in serious injuries, including 10 deaths.
Amazon has repeatedly said in court that it is not responsible for the actions of its contractors, citing agreements that require them, as one of the documents puts it, to “defend, indemnify and hold harmless Amazon.”
In recent years, Amazon has built a huge logistics operation to get more goods to customers’ homes in less time. To reduce its reliance on legacy carriers like United Parcel Service, the retailer has created a network of contractors across the country that allows the company to expand and shrink the delivery force as needed, while avoiding the costs of taking on permanent employees.
In his letter to Bezos, Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, demanded information about the contracts Amazon has with third-party delivery companies.

Word of the Week: 'Crazy-making'

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 12 Sep 2019.

Texto completo: The pessimistic premise of the Word of the Week is that there is a giant posse of self-deputized language policers organizing themselves around the idea that by making moronic demands about how we should use language, they can fix the world. The optimistic premise is that these people can be ignored or told to get bent. Because, usually, language policing is really just some mediocrity’s power trip.
Certain weeks seem to emphasize the pessimistic premise over the optimistic one, though. This was one of them. In the New York Times, the screenwriter Walter Mosley recounts a crazy-making tale of being dressed down by human resources because he, a black guy, had told a true personal story in the writer’s room about being called the N-word. Somebody anonymously reported it. He was told he could write it in the future, but not say it, and that he couldn’t face his accuser to discuss the matter. Luckily, he was in a position to just throw up his hands and walk out on the job.
Recall a recent WOTW in which I wrote: “Philosophers and grammar nerds respect a key distinction between actually employing a word’s meaning and simply referring to it or saying its syllables — the ‘use/mention distinction.’”
The point is that it is only growing more important to simply ignore the demands of insane and linguistically barbaric people. Because it will get more insane. See, for example, a dictionary.com blog post this week on “redefining” the word “Black”:
“...we will be capitalizing Black throughout the entry when it is used in reference to people. Why capitalize Black in this context? It is considered a mark of respect, recognition, and pride. This is common practice for many other terms used to describe a culture or ethnicity. Not capitalizing Black in this context can be seen as dismissive, disrespectful, and dehumanizing.”
According to this allegedly authoritative reference, I have “dehumanized” Mosley above by describing him exactly as I would have last week, to no protest.
I’ve apparently committed many more wordcrimes in this column. What about the fact that I just used “moronic,” “crazy-making,” “idiotic,” “insane,” and “barbaric”? These were among the terms I saw being handcuffed and booked by the king of cretinous cops, David M. Perry, after Kamala Harris got in trouble for laughing at a supporter using the word “retarded" about President Trump. (The president of the United Snowflakes has, reportedly, also gotten angry at his erstwhile daughter-in-law Vanessa for calling him the same thing.)
Perry even got the legitimately famous broadcaster Soledad O’Brien to repent and march off to Problematic Prison for this sort of “othering” of the “neurodivergent,” to use some chic words that will almost certainly not be in use in two years.
This is the same mode of thinking which prevailed at Harvard University in 2015, when the title of house master fell out of use because of its association with slavery, though it comes from the Latin word for teacher: “magister”. (The dominant cognates of “dominus” for actual slave masters were not similarly canceled.)
If this all seems a bit arbitrary, that’s because it is. It’s always arbitrary when cops are allowed to enforce the law on their own judgment. Luckily, though, these are fake cops with fake power. If they come for you, resist arrest.

Russian propaganda machine belittles possible CIA informant

Texto completo: The Russian government has denigrated the man who may have been an informant for the CIA, who is now said to be living in the United States after being extracted.
Several American news outlets have detailed how a Russian mole, who has not been named by the U.S. government, led the CIA to conclude President Vladimir Putin ordered interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Russian state media and government officials have identified the alleged spy as Oleg Smolenkov, presenting him as a drunk who abandoned his sick mother and had no access to Putin.
Current and former American officials told the New York Times that the Russian accounts should be considered disinformation and the information about Smolenkov should not be trusted.
Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, said Smolenkov had been fired years ago from his Kremlin position “that did not belong to the category of senior posts.” The position “did not provide for any contacts with the president at all,” Peskov said.
Peskov said he could not confirm whether Smolenkov was the alleged informant extracted from Russia by the CIA in 2017. He called reports in American media “pulp fiction.”
“I never saw him, never met him, and didn’t follow either his career or his movements. And I don’t want to comment on rumors,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.
Russian politician Aleksei Pushkov mocked Smolenkov as someone who “supposedly knew everything about everyone.”
A former colleague told state media that Smolenkov’s duties at the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., were mostly tasks like buying cars for the embassy car pool and goods for its store. The colleague said Smolenkov “often” drank a “bit more than usual.” Another former colleague said he complained about his salary.
Smolenkov was sent to Washington more than a decade ago to work under the then-Russian ambassador Yuri Ushakov, who later became a foreign policy adviser to Putin in the Kremlin. Smolenkov returned to Russia to serve as an adviser to the government and around 2012 was hired as an aide to Ushakov.
Whoever the CIA’s intelligence asset was, he led the intelligence community to believe with “high confidence” that the Russian government was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee during the election.
Details have not been reported as to how the CIA recruited the informant decades ago.

California 'fair pay' bill goes to governor

Texto completo: In brief
NCAA: The NCAA's Board of Governors is urging Gov. Gavin Newsom not to sign a California bill that would allow college athletes to receive money for their names, likenesses or images.
The state Assembly and Senate sent the bill, known as the Fair Pay to Play Act, to the governor on Wednesday in Sacramento, California, without a dissenting vote in what Republican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley said was "a loud and clear message to the NCAA."
In a six-paragraph letter to Newsom, the NCAA board said the bill would give California schools an unfair recruiting advantage. As a result, the letter says, the NCAA would declare those schools ineligible for its events.
The board is especially concerned because the bill puts no restrictions on how much athletes could make and they believe the proposal also would violate the federal Commerce Clause.
Newsom has 30 days to sign or veto it. If he does nothing, the bill would become law.
Report: Justify failed drug test before Triple Crown
Horse racing: The New York Times says Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed postrace drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby.
The newspaper reported that Bob Baffert-trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont stakes to complete the Triple Crown.
The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case.
The newspaper said test results, emails and internal memorandums show how California regulators waited nearly three weeks, until the Kentucky Derby was only nine days away, to notify Baffert of the positive test. Then, two months after the Belmont victory, the board disposed of the inquiry altogether.
The Times said Baffert didn't respond to multiple attempts seeking comment.
Patriots' Brown practices; status for Sunday unclear
NFL: Patriots receiver Antonio Brown practiced with the team for the first time on Wednesday, a day after his former trainer filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions.
Before the practice session, coach Bill Belichick declined to answer numerous questions about Brown, including his status for Sunday's game at Miami. He deferred to the Patriots' statement late Tuesday in which they said they were aware of the lawsuit and "take these allegations very seriously."
In the less than 5-minute portion of practice open to the media, Brown wore a No. 1 jersey and his helmet while going through warmup drills with teammates. Brown has worn No. 84 throughout his previous nine NFL seasons, but that number is currently being worn by Patriots tight end Ben Watson.
McIlroy tops Koepka
for PGA player of year
Golf: Rory McIlroy was voted PGA Tour player of the year over Brooks Koepka after posting the most top-10 finishes and winning the FedEx Cup.
It's the third time McIlroy has won the Jack Nicklaus Award, and the first without having won a major.
McIlroy had three victories among his tour-best 14 finishes in the top 10, including The Players Championship. He also won the Canadian Open and the Tour Championship, giving him the FedEx Cup for the second time.
Koepka also won three times, including the PGA Championship.

Texto completo: Justify failed a drug test one month before the 2018 Kentucky Derby, and the California Horse Racing Board decided to dismiss the case after the colt went on to win the Triple Crown, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
Justify tested positive for scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April '18, and qualifying for the Kentucky Derby in the process.
Scopolamine is a banned substance that can enhance performance. Such a result should have resulted in a disqualification, purse forfeiture and the removal of his Kentucky Derby entry. Instead, California regulators waited until April 26, nine days before the Kentucky Derby, to inform Bob Baffert, Justify's Hall of Fame trainer.
Baffert had a second sample tested by an independent lab, and it confirmed the results three days after Justify won the Kentucky Derby.
The board decided that the test results could have come from contaminated food. However, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission's former drug lab chief, Rick Sams, said the amount of scopolamine in Justify's system suggested it "has to come from intentional intervention."
Two months after dismissing the Justify case, the California board changed the penalty for a failed scopolamine test from a DQ to a fine and a possible suspension

Texto completo: Friends are hard to find and even harder to replace. Just ask U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur.

Last week, the longtime Democratic House member lost a best friend. The relationship ended suddenly after 14 years.

The friend in this case is a discontinued Ford sedan that met an unceremonious end after colliding with the business end of an excavator, rendering it totaled.

Now the search is under way for its replacement.

What's she looking for? Something reliable and American-made, in the exact mold of its predecessor. Preferably the same make and model.

What a design, Miss Kaptur said of the 2005 Ford Five Hundred, a full-size sedan that made up for in space and practicality what it lacked in sleek design and general attractiveness. Ford should have never stopped making it.

Above all, Miss Kaptur credits the car with saving her life on Sept. 4 after an excavator's bucket slammed into the roof on the driver's side. She had been traveling through a construction zone on her way to a food pantry to drop off vegetables from her garden.

The engine didn't stop running. The seat belt didn't strangle me. The driver's seat was like an astronaut's chair, Miss Kaptur said, describing the car's suspension seating.

First responders were able to rescue her through the driver's side door, and she emerged virtually unscathed and ready to head back to Washington this week after Congress's summer recess.

He pushed the handle and the door opened, and his jaw dropped, she said of the first responder. He couldn't believe it.

Miss Kaptur continues a long tradition of lawmakers backing American automakers and driving their cars. Before becoming President, Barack Obama drove a Ford Escape hybrid and Chrysler 300C, and had said after leaving office he would purchase a Chevy Volt. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Bowling Green) drives a Ford and a Chevy and Republican Sen. Rob Portman drives a Chevy pickup truck, their offices said. Sen. Sherrod Brown drives a 2017 Jeep Cherokee, the last model year made in Toledo.

Since entering the U.S House in 1983, Miss Kaptur has been a strong supporter of labor interests and domestic auto workers. She voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement and has concerns about President Trump's proposed replacement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

Judging from a quick search online, Miss Kaptur won't have trouble acquiring another Five Hundred, if she chooses to go that route. It would come cheap and used.

Ford only made the car between 2005 and 2007, envisioning it as a replacement to its Taurus and Crown Victoria sedans, both of which have also been discontinued in the United States.

Reviews of the Chicago-made Five Hundred weren't glowing. The New York Times described it as tall, spacious and bland, the automotive equivalent of the color beige.

But Miss Kaptur doesn't mind that. She's just happy to be healthy and back at work.

In an interview with The Blade, she mentioned wanting to track down the Ford engineer who designed the Five Hundred to personally thank them for making the vehicle, which departed her garage that day in mint condition and with only 110,000 miles after more than a decade on the road.

It really, really performed, in the most unexpected manner, she said. I mean, who thinks you're going to be greeted by a bucket? They don't teach you about that in driver's school.

Plame faces scrutiny following campaign ad release

Texto completo: Congressional candidate Valerie Plame was questioned in national media outlets Monday night and Tuesday about claims made in her new campaign ad and about retweeting articles from a website identified with anti-Semitism.
Plame, who is running for New Mexico's 3rd Congressional District, said in her video released Monday that former Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, leaked her identity as a CIA operative in 2003.
"Dick Cheney's chief of staff took revenge against my husband and leaked my identity," Plame says in the video. "His name: Scooter Libby. Guess who pardoned him last year?" The video then shows an image of President Donald Trump.
The Washington Post, however, published a fact-check article Tuesday giving the video "three pinocchios," which is the newspaper's rating for a claim that has "significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions."
According to the Post, there is no evidence Libby disclosed Plame's identity to Robert Novak, the columnist who publicly disclosed her role. Rather, it was then-Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage who gave the information to Novak, who then confirmed Plame's identity with former White House aide Karl Rove and a CIA spokesman, the newspaper said.
The Post said it didn't give a rating of four pinocchios because "one can possibly draw a fuzzy line from Libby's inquiries about Wilson's role, the State Department memo and Libby's conversations with administration officials to the eventual leak of Plame's name."
Joseph Wilson was Plame's husband and a former U.S. ambassador to nations in Africa. Novak's 2003 column said Plame had suggested sending Wilson to Niger to investigate whether Saddam Hussein had sought uranium in Africa. The claim about a uranium deal in Africa was a justification used by the Bush administration to invade Iraq.
"Administration officials were certainly eager to try to discredit Wilson, who had emerged as a damaging critic about the failed search to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq," the Post added.
A Plame campaign spokeswoman said Tuesday that neither the candidate nor representatives had a comment on the matter.
However, Daniel Garcia, a Plame spokesman, told the Post, "From his trial, it was clear that Libby gave Valerie's name to New York Times reporter Judith Miller."
"Please recall that Scooter Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice because he attempted to hide information from the prosecutors," the Post quoted Garcia as saying. "He obstructed justice, perjured himself and was held accountable until Donald Trump pardoned him. No one suggested he leaked it."
Separately, CNN host Chris Cuomo questioned Plame on Monday evening about her sharing of articles on social media from the website UNZ Review in 2017, including one titled "America's Jews Are Driving America's Wars."
The article said, among other things, that "rich and powerful" American Jews were "happy to deliver" a war with Iran, and that the media should label American Jews at the bottom of television screens in a way that "would be kind-of-like a warning label on a bottle of rat poison."
Plame told Cuomo that she had apologized "profusely" for the matter.
"It's not who I am and it's not what I believe," she told Cuomo.
When he pressed her on why she retweeted it, Plame said she "didn't read the article all the way through."
Cuomo then noted Plame had shared content from the site on multiple occasions.
"Why would you have anything do with a website that is operated or at least provided by a guy that's a Holocaust denier?" he asked.
"Because social media and Twitter can be a pretty hateful environment, and it doesn't exactly lend itself to thoughtful discussion or reading all the way through," Plame replied. "I made a terrible mistake, and I hurt people whose beliefs I respect, and I apologized for it."
Plame is running in a crowded Democratic primary race that has 10 candidates, including First Judicial District Attorney Marco Serna, Santa Fe lawyer Teresa Leger Fernandez and former New Mexico Deputy Secretary of State John Blair.
Other announced candidates for the Democratic primary include Kyle Tisdel, a Taos attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center; Sandoval County Treasurer Laura M. Montoya; state Rep. Joseph Sanchez of Alcalde; former Navajo Nation presidential candidate Dineh Benally; Gavin Kaiser of Santa Cruz and Cameron Alton Chick Sr. of Rio Rancho.
Three Republicans -- Audra Lee Brown, Alexis Johnson and Karen Bedonie -- have registered as candidates for the seat now held by U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., who is vacating it to run for the U.S. Senate.

Kamala Harris’ criminal justice reform plan can’t be trusted

Texto completo: “I know the system from the inside out, so trust me when I say we have a problem with mass incarceration in America. Trust me when I say we have a problem with accountability. Trust me when I say we have to take the profit out of criminal justice.” These are the words of presidential candidate Kamala Harris in an interview with the New York Times on her recently-unveiled criminal justice plan. She asks voters to put their faith in her because of her experience, but it’s her experience that shows voters exactly why they should think twice about that.
Harris’s new plan begins with an introduction that attempts once more to paint the self-portrait she’s persistently pushed throughout her campaign: one of a reform-minded prosecutor who “has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.” She’s seen them alright—and personally contributed to them. As Tulsi Gabbard aptly noted in the last debate, Harris was far from a reformer during her prosecutor days. In fact, she was notoriously tough on crime.
But she’s apparently had a pretty recent change of heart.
In her new plan, Harris proposes ending the war on drugs, claiming marijuana legalization is the first step toward that. It’s an excellent proposition and fairly mainstream among the Democratic candidates, but it’s certainly not something that Harris has always stood by.
Historically, she opposed the legalization of marijuana, and as a San Francisco District Attorney, she oversaw hundreds of marijuana convictions. Although she may not have been directly involved in the convictions, she had immense power to direct her attorneys which marijuana cases to prosecute, and what punishments to pursue. Yet, despite how sorry she is for all of the lives she’s had a part in ruining during her tenure as lead prosecutor, she’s done nothing to help those particular people.
Among her plans, too, we find a proposed effort to expunge marijuana-related criminal records and create a grant program from marijuana sales tax to help those most adversely affected by the drug war. Sure, these policies are noble, but they’re not a total ceasefire in the drug war by any means. After all, this is where Harris’s plan here falls flat. Aside from legalizing marijuana, she supports reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That’s a change that is certainly important, but, in terms of drug reform, it’s low-hanging fruit.
Proposing pre- arrest diversion programs, legalizing safe injection sites, descheduling drugs and loosening academic study restrictions are all strong policies that would help end the drug war. But she didn’t make any of those suggestions.
As a San Francisco District Attorney, Harris opposed the use of drug courts for those charged with drug related crimes—another action which is not cohesive with ending the drug war which she now supports. Drug courts are great, because they’re set up to provide an alternative sentencing route for individuals so they can be connected with the resources and treatment they need, rather than sticking them straight into prison.
But as Reason Magazine reports, Harris complained that people “learned how to manipulate the system by simply claiming to be addicts.” She proposed barring individuals from drug court if they had ever sold any quantity of drugs in the past—even if they needed addiction help. This means prison time for low-level drug offenders who, somehow, she’s had a wild change of mind about.
That same goes for her stance of the cash bail system. Money bail disproportionately harms low- income individuals, because they can’t afford to buy their way out of pretrial incarceration the way the wealthy can. They remain in jail—sometimes for months on end—until they can find a way to post bail or until their court date comes around.
Though Harris has sponsored legislation to end cash bail, this fight may dwindle when she becomes president. She previously supported hiking the rates of cash bail, but, of course, this is the exact opposite of what she’s saying now.
Sure, Harris’s criminal justice plan has a lot of good proposals. It even calls for accountability by granting the U.S. Department of Justice explicit authority to conduct investigations into prosecutorial offices that commit misconduct.
It’s a bold policy that stands among many other needed reforms outlined found in her plan. But none of this changes the fact that she spent so many years of her life locking people up for the things she’s claiming to be dovish on now. And that’s when she wasn’t trying to become president.
Harris has been caught lying for political gain before, so what’s stopping her from doing it again—especially if it could win her the Oval Office?
For the sake of those who spent years of their lives sitting in prisons because of her terrible policies, it’s a question worth seriously considering.

Spy forced to flee was key asset

Texto completo: An American spy forced to flee Russia after President Trump spilled key classified information was reportedly a key mole inside the Kremlin whose departure marked a major setback for intelligence efforts, according to a New York Times report.
The spy was pulled out of Russia in 2017 amid concerns that Trump would endanger his safety due to his cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin (photo) - a shocking new sign of how the mercurial president is hurting U.S. interests, the newspaper reported.
The informant had given the CIA a window into the highest levels of Kremlin decision-making including Russia's efforts to meddle in U.S. elections in 2016 on behalf of Trump, the Times said.
The operative initially resisted efforts to leave Russia out of fears his family could face retaliation. But he eventually agreed to leave and is now in hiding in the U.S. under government protection.
After the spy's dramatic departure, American intelligence had much less insight into Putin's push to influence the 2018 midterms and any effort to boost Trump's reelection push in 2020.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who headed the CIA at the start of the Trump administration, denied the report without being specific.
"Suffice it to say that the reporting there is factually wrong," Pompeo said Tuesday.
The ouster of the operative was also dismissed as "pulp fiction" by Putin's aides even as details emerged that he was an invaluable asset who funneled information to American handlers for decades.
Putin aide Dmitri Peskov pooh-poohed the spy drama as "pulp fiction" and said the spy was a low-level Kremlin worker who had no access to Putin and left his post in 2017.
"This is more the genre of pulp fiction, crime reading, so let's leave it up to them," Peskov said Tuesday.

Should Emanuel jump into presidential race?

Texto completo: Should former Democratic Chicago mayor turned TV talking head Rahm Emanuel just drop the punditry nonsense and get into the presidential race himself?
It's worth a thought. Emanuel is a multimillionaire -- there are obvious benefits to public service -- though he's not as rich as enviro-billionaire Tom Steyer, who has qualified for the Democratic presidential candidate debate in October.
But Rahm knows politics, and he displays his knowledge of these dark arts weekly on that ABC Sunday morning talk show, the one I don't watch that is hosted by Clinton Donor Zero.
If he were a presidential candidate, Rahm just might be able to save the Democratic Party from Joe Biden, who's set to appear under the withering lights at the third Democratic presidential debate.
Admit it, with all his gaffes, old Uncle Joe's campaign is teetering. Though he's the last hope of the old Democratic establishment, Biden is just a drop or two of blood in that already bloody eye of his from absolute disaster.
"I want to be clear," Biden said the other day in addressing his confusion about whether he was in Vermont or New Hampshire, and sniping at pesky reporters insisting on questioning his mental health. "I'm not going nuts."
OK, Joe. You're not going nuts. What time do you want your Jell-O?
Think of it: President Rahm Emanuel.
President Rahm as boss of America's vast intelligence apparatus, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the FBI and don't forget the Internal Revenue Service. Democrats wouldn't mind. And since most journalists are Democrats, we wouldn't have a "revolution," or scribes suffering from Emanuel Derangement Syndrome.
Emanuel's career ended when Chicago realized he'd sat on that police video of black teenager Laquan McDonald being shot 16 times by a white Chicago cop.
But think of what he could accomplish with the FBI, CIA and IRS at his beck and call?
Hollywood stars would love him, since his uber agent brother Ari is the boss of Hollywood. And he'd be the first president to hang a portrait of himself as a Hollywood gangster in the White House.
The portrait, which I presented to him, is called "The Rahmfather," and it shows Rahm in the Al Pacino pose from the movie poster for "The Godfather." He placed it proudly on the wall of his City Hall office.
Could Rahm Emanuel defeat President Donald Trump?
He's vicious enough to go for the throat. Or, more likely, he'd have his contacts at The New York Times and the Washington Post go for his enemies' throats.
Though Rahm has little in common with Trump, they do share a unique superpower:
All they have to do is open their mouths, and leftist political heads explode across America.
Just days before the Democratic presidential debate in Texas, Emanuel went on the attack, trying to draw blood from the Democratic Party's dominant left wing by targeting a serious vulnerability.
Rahm lashed out at progressive candidates -- authentic lefty Bernie Sanders and faux lefty Elizabeth Warren, who is playing the Hillary Clinton role this cycle -- for supporting government health care for everyone, including people in the country illegally, whether they want it or not.
"We've taken a position so far, the candidates have ... few have not, about basically 'Medicare for All,' which is we're gonna eliminate 150 million people's health care and we're gonna provide health care for people that (have) just come over the border," Emanuel said on ABC, which pays him for his wisdom.
"That is an untenable position for the general election," Emanuel said. "This is reckless. You don't have to take the position to win the primary and you're basically, literally hindering yourself for the general election."
The "Medicare for All" plan embraced by the left would, critics say, yank private insurance away from Americans, including union workers who once formed the backbone of the Democratic Party.
Voters may have forgotten that, in a previous debate, Democratic presidential candidates were asked to raise their hands to virtue signal that they supported health care for undocumented immigrants who crossed the borders illegally and that they didn't think crossing the border illegally was a crime. For this, they were bathed in applause.
Sanders supports full health care for undocumented immigrants because he sincerely believes it to be right. Warren supports it because she's pandering for Sanders' progressive votes, while privately assuring Democratic establishment bosses that she's really one of them.
Biden tentatively raised his hand too. But he raised it as if he were some milquetoast at a wedding banquet, trying to catch the bartender's eye to order a Brandy Alexander, then deciding he might as well pretend to scratch his ear.
Rahm is already on record telling Americans that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. And so is video of idiotic and pandering hand-raising on untenable political positions.
He also knows that Trump's campaign won't waste the footage.
An avid bike rider, who cuts a striking, lithe figure in bike shorts, Emanuel talked in his Sunday morning segment of his summer spent bicycling around Lake Michigan.
"No one in a diner ran at me and said, 'Take my health care away.' Nobody," Rahm said. "You don't have to take this position to win the primary, and you're literally hindering yourself for the general election."
Get in the race, Rahm. Run for president. Save your party.
But first, would you bring Joe Biden his Jell-O?

Texto completo: Rep. Doug Collins questioned "whose side" CNN is on and called for an investigation into the network in response to a recent report from Jim Sciutto of the network.
Sciutto reported Monday morning that the CIA extracted a Russian spy who was close to the Kremlin back in 2017. The reporting cited Trump's handling of classified information as the reason behind the decision to pull the asset. However, the New York Times followed up CNN's story, but "media scrutiny of the agency's sources" came up with a different reason for the spy to get pulled out of Russia.
CIA Director for Public Affairs Brittany Bramell went so far as to characterize CNN's reporting as "misguided speculation."
Collins appeared Tuesday on America's Newsroom to discuss the report.GOP Rep. questions 'whose side' CNN is on and calls for investigation after CIA-Russia report"My response is first let's talk about who actually wrote broke the story: CNN, this is the same group that hired [former FBI deputy director] Andy McCabe, who is one of the disastrous parts of the cabal that started against the president, as a commentator. To put this out at this time and to put it such a way the CIA actually had to come out and respond to this is really a disturbing part," he answered.
“I really question whose side is CNN on," Collins continued. "This is a problem that we’re seeing. I think it needs to be investigated.”
CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

After string of mass shootings, Democrats begin new push for gun control

Texto completo: House Democrats, seeking to seize the momentum after recent mass shootings and to pressure Republicans to embrace gun safety measures, will push forward Tuesday with a new package of restrictions, including a bill that would ban the manufacture and sale of large-capacity magazines.
The House Judiciary Committee is expected to approve the package, the first step toward bringing it to the floor for a vote. It includes a so-called red flag law aimed at making it easier for law enforcement to take away guns from those deemed dangerous by a judge; a measure barring people convicted of hate crimes from buying guns; and legislation barring, for civilian use, magazines that can accept more than 10 rounds.
But the fate of the legislation — and of the broader effort to enact gun safety measures as massacres continue unabated — remains murky, with President Donald Trump sending mixed signals about where he stands. Leading Republicans, who are reluctant to endorse any such measures without assurances that Trump is fully on board, are to meet with the president at the White House on Tuesday afternoon.
In the meantime, Democrats are making an intense push to pass their full wish list of gun safety measures, while also laying the foundation for making gun violence a central issue in their 2020 campaigns should a compromise falter.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leaders, are demanding that Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, take up a House-passed bill extending background checks to all gun purchases, including those at gun shows and over the internet. Pelosi is also expected to appear Tuesday at a forum on gun violence legislation, convened by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., who heads a task force on gun safety.
“We will make this issue too hot for him to handle,” Pelosi said, referring to McConnell, at a news conference Monday afternoon, adding that gun safety groups “have upped the ante even further, to say that if this bill is not passed, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate and the president will have hell to pay.”
The central figure in the debate, though, remains Trump. The president’s statements on gun safety have been “all over the lot,” Schumer said Monday, and McConnell has said he will not bring any measure to the floor for a vote unless the president says he will sign it.
The president initially expressed support in early August for “very meaningful background checks” after a pair of deadly mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, but stopped short of endorsing the bill passed by the House. Then, as has been his pattern in the past, Trump’s stance appeared to soften after talks with gun rights advocates.
The White House has been in talks with a bipartisan group of senators on a series of gun-related measures, including a red flag law and expanding background checks, as well as others measures that might be more palatable to the National Rifle Association. Senate Democrats involved in the talks said they expect White House aides to present Trump with his options as early as Wednesday and remained unclear on what he might accept.
“It’s encouraging — they’re still talking,” said one of those Democrats, Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who is a chief sponsor of a background checks bill that fell to a Senate filibuster in 2013. That measure, which is slightly less restrictive than the House bill, would include certain exemptions for guns sold to friends and relatives.
But Sen. Christopher S. Murphy, D-Conn., who is also involved in the talks, sounded a note of pessimism, saying he feared that if Republicans or the White House demanded a package of measures — as opposed to a stand-alone vote on a background checks bill — the entire effort would collapse.
“I’ve expressed my worry to the White House the package could get so big that it could all fall apart,” he said.
Gun safety has burst onto the Washington agenda in the wake of a string of mass shootings in August — three in Texas alone. Democrats returning from their August recess say that it has been a huge issue in their districts, especially for young people and parents sending their children back to school.
“The number one item to purchase for your back-to-school kids should not be a bulletproof backpack,” Thompson said. Referring to the background checks bill that has not been brought up for a vote in the Senate, he added, “This is absolutely insane, and Sen. McConnell can do something about it.”
Yet even as they push for measures beyond the background checks bill, Democrats are stopping short of their most ambitious goal: an assault weapons ban. A proposed ban is circulating in the House, but its chief sponsor, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, estimated he is six or seven votes short of the 218 required for passage.
The Judiciary Committee will have a hearing on that bill later this month. Cicilline conceded that passage may be a heavy lift.
“Every other bill that we’ve done tries to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,” Cicilline said. “This is the one piece of legislation that keeps a particular weapon out of the hands of law-abiding citizens. A lot of people have enormous objections to that.”

Is government trying to undermine science? Cantwell wants hearings on political pressure by administration on scientists

Texto completo: In the wake of allegations that a federal agency was ordered to back up President Donald Trump's erroneous claim that Hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama, the Senate should investigate whether the administration is trying to "undermine science for political reasons," Sen. Maria Cantwell said Monday.
The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation should hold an oversight hearing on a range of proposals and actions by the administration, said Cantwell, who is the ranking Democrat on the committee.
"From compromising the spectrum used by weather satellites to political interference with official hurricane advisories, the Trump administration's attacks on science get more and more harmful and outrageous every day," she said in a news release. "We cannot allow science to be censored by politics or politicians."
Cantwell has criticized Federal Communications Commission plans to auction off portions of the 24-gigahertz spectrum for commercial broadband transmissions, which could interfere with the ability of weather satellites to collect data used to forecast the weather. The FCC has said the use of that spectrum won't cause problems, but NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disagree.
But her request for a hearing comes after a week of back-and-forth over what some in Washington, D.C., are calling "Sharpiegate." On Sept. 1, Trump warned in a tweet that Alabama was among states "likely to be hit (much) harder than anticipated" by Hurricane Dorian. The National Weather Service sent out a tweet shortly afterward saying Alabama would not see any impacts from Dorian because the storm would stay farther east.
Trump, however, insisted he was correct. On Sept. 4, he held up a map that showed the possible track of the storm, which clearly indicated the track enlarged with a black semicircle, drawn with a Sharpie pen, to include Alabama. The map was from April 29, three days before Trump's initial tweet. The president claimed he didn't know where the black semicircle came from.
NOAA issued an unsigned statement late Friday afternoon that the president had received some graphics between Aug. 27 and Sept. 3 saying parts of Alabama had a chance of experiencing tropical-force winds. But Alabama was not among the states or Canadian provinces mentioned in advisories by the National Hurricane Center between Aug. 27 and Sept. 2, the Associated Press reported.
The New York Times reported that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire NOAA staff who did not back up Trump's statements about the hurricane.
Over the weekend, a top scientist at NOAA wrote to staffers that the Friday statement wasn't based on science, but "external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political," the Washington Post reported.

Texto completo: Political tribalism keeps getting worse. The demand for unthinking and uncompromising loyalty keeps getting louder. Individuals or institutions that try to maintain a sense of fairness and balance, that don’t want to choose sides in our Uncivil War, are branded as weak-kneed, fainthearted heretics. Two recent events highlight this dangerous development. First, Fox News was excoriated by President Donald Trump for daring to interview a Democratic Party official. And second, The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants.
The parallels, of course, are imprecise. Trump has been eviscerating the press as a campaign strategy for years. But the similarities are still striking.
The president and his leftist critics share an instinct for intolerance: a deep disdain for anyone who strays from the party line, a demand for purity combined with a towering self-righteousness. You have to be on the Red Team or the Blue Team, a Loyalist or a Resister. Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. We belong to no tribe, root for no team. And if that sounds musty and old-fashioned, well, so does the Constitution, which not only protects a free press but defines it as essential to a healthy democracy.
Over on the left, the latest brouhaha was trigged by a Times headline over a story about a Trump speech that read, "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism." The words were technically accurate, but not nuanced or skeptical enough, and Times editors acknowledged the problem and changed it after the first edition. But that was not nearly enough to quell the bombastic blowback.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the headline served as "a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by — and often relies upon — the cowardice of mainstream institutions."
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media. They see a racist liar in the White House, and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar."
At a meeting of New York Times staffers, one told editor Dean Baquet that the paper was "actively misleading" readers by being too soft on Trump. But Baquet, hit back. "Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden," he told the staff meeting. "They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president. And our job is to figure out why, and how, and to hold the administration to account. If you’re independent, that’s what you do."
Baquet told CNN that there is a "generational divide" in the newsroom, and the meeting made clear there’s a racial one as well, with reporters of color among the loudest critics of their own bosses. But Baquet — the first African American editor of the Times — is determined to resist their pressure. "Our role is not to be the leader of the resistance," he insists.
We believe deeply in the traditions that Cavuto and Baquet are defending. No news organization is perfect, but at their best, they don’t work for the right or the left — for Trump or his rivals, for the Reds or the Blues. They are not Loyalists or Resisters.
They are simply journalists — fact-finders, truth-tellers — and more valuable than ever.

Texto completo: With deep sadness, the family of John Robert Suisman announces his passing on September 9, 2019. His passion for golf and professional sports was only surpassed by his love for his family. His marriage to Kathryn Lehman Suisman of 54 years was filled with laughter and admiration. John was a proud father to Lisa Parsons, Carolyn Shaughnessy, Stacey Keenan and Jennifer Suisman and their husbands, Ned Parsons, Sean Shaughnessy, Matt Keenan and Jack Holmes. John had a truly special relationship with each of his grandchildren: Will and Charlie Parsons; Thomas and Emily Shaugnessy; Sam, Ned and Ellie Keenan. John is also survived by his brother Richard and predeceased by his parents Edward and Etta Suisman and his brother Michael.
Born and raised in West Hartford, Connecticut John graduated from Loomis and Yale University. An English major, John had a passion for literature, was an avid reader and there wasn't a day that he missed the New York Times crossword puzzle. A gifted amateur golfer, John was a two-year captain of the Yale golf team and counts among the highlights of his golfing career qualifying and competing in the US Amatuer in 1960 and winning numerous club championships.
John's business career started as a partner of Suisman Blumenthal, followed by a metal brokerage business which he founded. Later on he and his brother Richard developed real estate together in the Greater Hartford area. John was active in the Hartford community where he and his family gave back to a wide range of organizations and causes including serving as President of Mt. Sinai Hospital, Campaign Chairman of the Hartford Jewish Federation and Renbrook School. He served on the Executive Committee of the United States Golf Association and served on the board of the Hartford Stage Company and The First Tee of Connecticut.
In 1993, John's life changed dramatically when he lost his legs in a car accident. Despite the challenges that he met in his daily life, John never let his accident define him. He learned to channel his energies in different directions including working closely with an amputee support group helping others adjust to the changes in their lives at the Mount Sinai Rehab Hospital.
A fiercely loyal New York sports fan, whether it was the Yankees or the Giants, John also loved nothing more than cheering on his teams in the company of his good friends. But nothing brought more joy to John's life than spending time with his family. He had a special relationship with each of his 7 grandchildren who deemed him all time quarterback from his wheelchair. John defined resilience and dignity and inspired his family and friends with his determination in the face of adversity. His dry wit, his warm smile and his generosity will be remembered by all who came in contact with him and we will love him and miss him forever.
Services will be held Wednesday, September 11 at 1:30 pm at Beth Israel Temple, 701 Farmington Avenue, West Hartford, Connecticut. Burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to: Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Hospital, 114 Woodland Street, Hartford, CT. http://www.stfranciscare.org

Texto completo: The Kelleys were considering moving out of state before tragedy hit Thousand Oaks. What kept them here was the support they saw after the Borderline Bar & Grill mass shooting and the Woolsey fire.
“The support, immediate, massive and ongoing support,” said Mike Kelley on Monday. “This is home.”
“Home” is getting a “Healing Garden” at Conejo Creek North Park in Thousand Oaks to honor 12 innocent lives lost.
The Garden began its march toward completion Monday as crews began construction on the Thousand Oaks memorial, with a goal of finishing it by Nov. 7, the one-year anniversary of the Borderline mass shooting.
A skip loader moved dirt just south of an existing pond, home to turtles and koi. And soon, the sounds of loaders and crews will give way to a place of reflection.
The Healing Garden will be built at Conejo Creek North Park, the city’s most popular park.
It will honor:
* RON HELUS : The Ventura County Sheriff sergeant was shot running into the Borderline Bar to help.
* CODY COFFMAN : The 22-year-old had been meeting with recruiters and planned to enlist in the Army.
* JUSTIN MEEK: He worked as a promoter at Borderline Bar. The 23-year-old was a former student at Cal Lutheran.
* NOEL SPARKS: She was a Moorpark College student who liked horseback riding.
* ALAINA HOUSLEY: The 18-year-old was a Pepperdine University freshman who aimed to study law.
* TELEMACHUS ORFANOS: He had the misfortune of being at the Las Vegas mass shooting and the one in Thousand Oaks.
* SEAN ADLER: He was a security guard at the bar, but he has just opened his dream business: a coffeehouse.
* DANIEL MANRIQUE: He was an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet.
* BLAKE DINGMAN: This 21-year-old Newbury Park resident played high school baseball at Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks.
* JAKE DUNHAM: He always answers his phone, his father said, but it just keeps ringing.
* KRISTINA MORISETTE : She graduated from Simi Valley High School and reportedly worked as a cashier at the bar.
* MARKY MEZA JR .: He worked as a busboy and food runner at the bar and would have turned 21 in less than two weeks.

A group comprised of city and park officials, Ventura County sheriff’s officials and Cal Lutheran staff recommended building the memorial at the park by the one-year anniversary of the shooting.
Thousand Oaks Mayor Rob McCoy said officials were unwilling to let the building of a memorial languish for years, as it has for the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
“We wanted to have that in place (in Thousand Oaks) because we’ll never forget that day,” McCoy told the Daily News in June, when the garden’s design was unveiled. “While it’s a place for the families to come, it’s a place for the entire city to come. Every resident, over 160,000 residents were affected.”
And so, officials are on a fast track to having it completed by that November anniversary date.
When it’s done, the “Borderline 12” will be represented by a fountain feature with 12 vertical jets in the center of a pond, according to the city’s plan.
The scene will symbolize the broader community. There will be a contemplation area, where a shoreline will include seating and landscaping. A large Oak will be planted bordering the garden area. A boulder will introduce visitors to the Healing Garden at its entryway.
There will be 12 large natural stone-slab benches along the plaza — granite to illustrate the strength of the community. A unique color will designate 248 pavers in a scene that will represent the number of survivors from that night. And at the site’s north end, the existing Lakeside Pavilion will offer space for community events and other gatherings.
On June 25, the city of Thousand Oaks approved a grant agreement with Conejo Recreation and Park District for $250,000 to provide funding for the construction.
Since November, Borderline has itself become a place of reflection.
Kelley touched one of twelve crosses at the makeshift memorial outside the closed club. It was there for Jake Dunham, one of the 12 victims and Kelley’s Newbury Park neighbor. Kelley and his wife watched Dunham grow up.
“He was a force,” Kelley said of the young man who rode motorcycles and worked on his truck with friends in the family garage.
“Watching his mother light his lantern (one of 12) and set it free was the single most emotional event I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelley said.
The question is where will all the photos, bibles, cowboy boots, rocks, hearts and the ceramic “Love” and “Peace” sculpture end up after the formal memorial is built.
Since the Borderline massacre, 2019 has continued to be a year in which gun violence in the United States is taking a deadly toll.
According to Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot (but not necessarily killed), there have been 352 such incidents in the United States this year.
And of those, according to the New York Times, which compiled MST’s and other data for a report, there were 38 shootings by the end of August in which three or more people were killed (the Department of Justice defines a mass killing as an episode in which three or more are killed). That number — 38 — includes the shooting in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, in which 22 were killed.

New York Times deletes glowing Mao Zedong tweet, claims it lacked 'historical context’

Texto completo: The New York Times’ attraction to murderous dictators continues apace.
The paper of record on Monday reminded everyone of the glowing, heroic coverage it gave Mao Zedong 43 years ago on the day of his death.
“Mao Zedong died on this day in 1976,” the Times archive’s Twitter account said in a since-deleted note published on social media. “The Times said he ‘began as an obscure peasant’ and ‘died one of history’s great revolutionary figures.’”
A regular Jesus Christ, that Mao.
Never mind the fact that his disastrously conceived (and named) "Great Leap Forward" killed an estimated 45 million human beings. Then there were the political purges, the labor camps, the exterminations, the execution quotas, etc. In all, Mao is suspected of killing an estimated 70 million people with his brand of genocidal totalitarianism. But other than all of that, yes, he was “one history’s great revolutionary figures.”
It was not long before social media users noticed and took exception on Monday to the Times’ weirdly glowing description of the 20th century’s most prolific mass murderer. The pushback became such that the paper deleted the tweet eventually, issuing a sort of half-hearted mea culpa.
“We’ve deleted a previous tweet about Mao Zedong that lacked critical historical context,” the account tweeted Monday.
Which is to say, 'Ah, yes. The murders. We forgot about the murders.'
To the Times’ credit, its stupid Mao Zedong tweet lasted for roughly three hours before it was deleted and disavowed. That's a massive improvement from the nearly 60 years it took for the Times to disavow Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty and his efforts to obscure and cover-up the brutal realities of Stalinism.
Now if someone at the Times would like to do something about the paper's past softball coverage for Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Un, that would be great.

Former White House chief of staff: Biden was 'confused' when leading Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings

Texto completo: KINGSTON, New Hampshire — Joe Biden was "confused" as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman during the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings, vacillating on whether to give accuser Anita Hill a public hearing or not, said John Sununu, White House chief of staff for President George H.W. Bush.
Sununu recalled the episode in a Saturday interview, saying Biden, the future vice president under President Barack Obama and now a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, was “relatively useless” during the October 1991 events. Thomas, nominated by Bush for an open Supreme Court seat, faced sexual harassment allegations against Thomas from University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill, who had worked with him at the Department of Education and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Thomas denied the allegations when Hill brought them before the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the lawmakers’ questions about him a “high tech lynching.”
The Democratic majority Senate eventually confirmed Thomas on a 52-48 vote, after days of contentious and often graphic hearings.
“Well, the Congress confirmations were interesting," Sununu, 80, told the Washington Examiner, ahead of a state Republican party event with his son, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, 44. "One of the reasons it got so difficult is that the chairman of the committee was relatively useless.”
Biden, Sununu said, “was confused. He didn't know whether he wanted to do the right thing or whether he wanted to cave into the liberals that were trying to really, in a very disgraceful way, ruin the reputation of a very good man, currently Justice Thomas.”
Biden in the nearly 28 years since the Thomas has taken heat from figures across the ideological spectrum over his handling of the hearings.
In April, Hill told the New York Times that Biden, 76, had called her ahead of his presidential campaign announcement to apologize for what she went through during the hearings. In an interview after Biden's phone call, she told the Times, "I hold him responsible certainly for what happened in 1991, and to the extent that many of the same things that happened in 1991 followed in 2018, there is a connection."
Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat and supporter of a 2020 presidential rival of Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, told the Washington Examiner she blamed Biden for Thomas' confirmation. Wilson is urging Harris to make a bigger issue of it on the campaign trail.
"If Joe Biden had done what was fair, Clarence Thomas would not be on the Supreme Court,” Wilson said in late August. "Every time I see or hear Clarence Thomas's name my mind goes back to Joe Biden. Everyone else's mind goes to Anita Hill, but I think of Joe Biden.”
Wilson said that Thomas, the only black justice on the court, is the “worst Supreme Court Justice” for his conservative opinions on a range of issues."

Texto completo: 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren endorsed a congressional challenger who is running against a Democratic incumbent.
The Massachusetts senator backed immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros on Monday who is going up against Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar for Texas's 28th District. The congressman's campaign responded to the endorsement by blasting both Warren and his opponent.
Warren called Cisneros, 26, who interned under Cuellar five years ago, a "fighter" and added that the district is "ready for systematic change and deserve a Democrat that will be on the side of working people; not the side of big money and obstructionist Republicans," according to the Texas Tribune.Tweet"Senator Warren and our opponent have a lot in common. Both of them have been living in the Northeast region the last few years, both have a job-killing agenda that would eliminate 108,000 energy jobs in our area, both support a healthcare plan that would kill negotiated benefits for millions of union members nationwide, and both have been less than honest about their past," Colin Strother, Cuellar's campaign spokesman told the Washington Examiner.
He went on, "We are focused on our own campaign and perhaps if Senator Warren did the same thing she would be polling higher than 10% in Texas."
Cisneros has been backed by Justice Democrats, the group that helped get prominent progressive Democrats elected, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. They helped her raise more than $100,000 in the first 48 hours of her campaign, the New York Times reported.
Cuellar is widely considered to be one of the most pro-Trump Democrats in Congress. FiveThirtyEight tallied that he votes in line with the president on 48.9% of votes so far in the 116th Congress.

Texto completo: The day the self-described “little brown woman with a big mouth” wakes up and no longer has anything to say is the day national political commentator Michelle Malkin will stop spouting her views.
That day hasn’t come for 48-year-old Malkin, who moved from outside Washington, D.C., to the Colorado Springs area in 2008.
“After 25 years, I haven’t run out yet,” she said during an interview in her home in El Paso County, where she lives with her husband of 26 years, Jesse, and their teenage son and young-adult daughter, who is studying to be an esthetician.
“My problem is I have way more topics and not enough time to get to all of them,” Malkin said.
Her fiery, stalwart ideology, which falls “between libertarian and conservative,” has long presaged current headlines. Malkin was sounding off about problems she saw with America’s immigration policies years before Donald Trump started firing celebrities on TV.
The Fox News and C-Span pundit’s first book, “Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces,” was published in 2002 and became a New York Times bestseller.
Her newest book — her seventh and the third on immigration — “Open Borders Inc.: Who’s Funding America’s Destruction?” will be released Tuesday.
In it, Malkin examines what she perceives to be the global forces behind illegal immigration, from Pope Francis to George Clooney, and George Soros to the Koch brothers, to Silicon Valley.
“Follow the money” to get the real story, is her mantra.
Legal immigration is personal to Malkin, whose parents came to the United States from the Philippines and naturalized.
“The two things that were the keys to my family’s American dream: Electing to come here, knowing what a privilege it was, and empowering themselves with the pursuit of their education, to improve themselves.”
Malkin was born in Philadelphia and grew up in South Jersey. She played the piano for 14 years, which remains a centerpiece in her home today. Her 15-year-old son performs musical theater, and her daughter demonstrates her artistic genes by sometimes doing Malkin’s makeup before television appearances.
Oberlin College — where Malkin met her husband, a retired health economist who books her speaking engagements and helps run her business — gave her a taste of how she could use her words and wit to give wings to her thoughts. And people listened.
She became an editorial writer and columnist for the LA Daily News and then the Seattle Times.
“The years I spent at metropolitan newspapers were the most valuable years of my life,” Malkin said. “We had to do on-the-ground reporting and bring that back to the editorial board. I had so many mentors.”
The Malkins moved from North Bethesda, Md., to Colorado Springs 11 years ago because Malkin said the East Coast was becoming “too toxic” of an environment.
“I hated the power moves, the back-scratching, the cliques.”
The quality of life, cost of living and education system were the biggest draws of El Paso County, she said.
At her daughter’s private school in Baltimore, Malkin had objected to the first-grade math curriculum. The textbook had been dropped by other schools, she wrote in a syndicated column.
Malkin was summoned to the principal’s office, where a lawyer told her if she didn’t agree to not write about the topic anymore, her daughter would be kicked out of the school.
Parents in Colorado Springs, she discovered in her research, had been exposing flaws in the same curriculum.
Malkin also liked that Colorado is a choice education state, and that some parents were fighting against Common Core academic standards and protecting the data privacy of children, issues dear to her heart.
“Education is a place you can find liberal and conservative parents who can unite to effect change in your school system,” she said. Parental autonomy and local control of education are two subjects she believes cross party lines.
Many people told Malkin she was committing career suicide by moving far from the nation’s capital. But the advent of the internet meant she “didn’t have to be tethered to the swamp” of Washington, D.C., which she said she found “liberating.”
From 1992 to 2015, Malkin says politics was “pretty predictable.”
The Trump presidency ushered in a new era for political analysts, one that she said can be either incentivizing or disruptive, depending on attitude.
“Our jobs are interesting every single day — every day we wake up and think ‘What’s going to happen today?’” she said. “A lot of horrible things are happening; a lot are not attributable to Donald Trump.”
She has met Trump only once, in a green room before the president did an interview.
“He muttered, ‘Good job, Michelle,’ as I walked past,” Malkin said.
The chance encounter came after a public Twitter spat, during which Trump called Malkin a “dummy,” over a column she wrote, calling him out for eminent domain practices in commercial development.
She has set the “silly tweets” aside. “I agree with his larger worldview and nationalist agenda. He has a fundamental bedrock patriotism that resonates with me.”
Does Malkin think Trump is a racist?
No.
“He’s a lot of other things — he’s vulgar, crass, mercurial,” Malkin replies.
But not racist.
“You go back and look how he was embraced by minority Democrats, in states, in New York City, for years,” she said. “Knowing members of his family and the positions he takes, I do not doubt that he loves this country and he thinks he’s doing the best he can for it …”
Malkin said she has seen, heard and felt more than her share of racism.
“I’ve experienced it from people all across the political spectrum,” she said. “All the time I face it. On social media, it’s a cesspool.”
Her first blog hit the web waves in 2000, and in her 2006 book, “Unhinged,” Malkin devoted a chapter to hate mail she’d received.
“I’m a trifecta, being a woman, a minority and a conservative,” she said, “which is practically being a unicorn. The combination triggers people.”
At first, the nastygrams and mud-slinging jabs bothered her.
A decade ago, in what she calls a “blatant show of misogynistic hatred,” MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann compared her to a “mashed-up bag of meat with lipstick on it.”
Now, she said, “It doesn’t faze me. It’s the price of being on this kind of media.”
In May, Facebook censored Malkin for posting a photo of herself with fellow conservatives who had been banned from the site.
Malkin said she’s “terrified” voices are being silenced and fears for what will happen.
“If we cannot communicate freely in defense of our nation, if we cannot publish vital information on the threats we face, who is funding them, how we stop them, if we cannot gather in public places without fear, we will no longer be a sovereign nation.”

Texto completo: There's near-universal support for requiring background checks on all gun sales in the United States, according to a new nationwide poll from USA TODAY and Suffolk University, but only 23 percent said they think Congress will pass gun control legislation in the next year.
Ninety percent of poll respondents said they were in favor of requiring background checks, according to the poll, which was conducted in late August and released on Monday as Congress returns from recess.
The poll also found support for other gun control measures, including banning high capacity magazines (58 percent), banning the sale of some assault weapons, including the AK-47 and AR-15 (60 percent), and establishing “red flag" laws that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns from people deemed a risk to themselves or others (69 percent).
But the survey found respondents did not have high confidence in Congress to pass such meaures. Asked whether they believed Congress will pass “any significant gun-control legislation" in the next year, 68 percent said no.
Gun control is at the center of the conversation as Congress returns from a six-week recess that saw mass shootings in Odessa, Texas, El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. All told, 38 people were killed in those shootings and dozens more wounded.
An AK-47 was usedin the El Paso shooting, and the guns used in the Odessa and Dayton shootings have been described as “AR-15-style" weapons. The poll was conducted before the Odessa shooting happened on Aug. 31.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would not bring any gun control legislation to the floor without assurances that President Trump would sign it. But Trump has backtracked after expressing support for background checks and other measures.
The USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll was conducted Aug. 20 through Aug. 25 among 1,000 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.

'It Chapter Two' Dominates Box Office

Texto completo: Like the lone entertainer at a desolate children's birthday party, "It Chapter Two" and its killer clown effectively took over movie theaters this weekend, making more money than the rest of the top ten movies combined.
The only major newcomer at the box office, "It Chapter Two" sold about $ 91 million in tickets at domestic theaters Friday through Sunday. It picked up an additional $ 94 million overseas this weekend, according to the studio.
Those figures are a success for Warner Bros., the film's distributor, even if they lag behind the record-breaking opening that the first "It" had when it debuted to roughly $ 120 million in North American ticket sales in 2017. They're also a welcome jolt for theaters, where last weekend a small group of holdover movies had been jockeying for fumes.
The original "It" followed a group of children haunted by a demonic clown in small-town America in the summer of 1989. The movie's wide appeal -- abetted by its recognizable villain (Bill Skarsgard's clown, Pennywise) and a "Stranger Things"-like formula, in which kids face supernatural mysteries in the 1980s -- was a large factor in 2017 becoming the biggest box office year ever for horror.
Like the first movie, "It Chapter Two" was adapted from the Stephen King novel and directed by Andrés Muschietti. It is set 27 years after the events of the first film, with adult actors including James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader playing grown-up versions of characters from the original. They are reassembled in their hometown to address the return of the dangerous and mysterious Pennywise (Skarsgard).
While reviews for "It Chapter Two" weren't exactly weak, the movie didn't do as well with critics as the first one -- the sequel currently holds a 64 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Its predecessor holds an 86.
In his review of "It Chapter Two" for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that "this 2-hour-49-minute movie drags more than it jumps, wearing out its premise and possibly also your patience as it lumbers toward the final showdown."
[Read our critic's review of "It Chapter Two."]
The first "It" ran two hours and fifteen minutes. In addition to shifting the pace, the sequel's longer running time might have turned off some potential audiences -- though the runaway success of "Avengers: Endgame" (running time: three hours and one minute) earlier this year is an argument against that notion.
"It Chapter Two" certainly didn't have much serious competition. In a distant second was "Angel Has Fallen," a Gerard Butler thriller from Lionsgate and Millennium that saw about $ 6 million in domestic ticket sales this weekend, its third in theaters. Next best was Universal's comedy "Good Boys," which brought in about $ 5.4 million during its fourth weekend. Rounding out the top five were Disney's "The Lion King," which in its eighth weekend managed roughly $ 4.2 million, and Sony's "Overcomer," which sold around $ 3.8 million in tickets during its third weekend.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

It’s imperative we face the truths about slavery

Texto completo: The New York Times’ recent 1619 Project is as ambitious an undertaking as a modern journalistic outlet has made in recent years. This is not just because of the diversity of content and media contained under its auspices, but because of the subject matter itself: slavery.
Slavery is often described as our country’s original sin; this is inaccurate. Original sin is the story of something gone broadly awry, an act that fouled something untainted. Rather, slavery is our country’s foundational sin. It may have been wrong, yes, but its practice on this continent and the unique and brutal form it took in this country cannot be treated as incidental or accidental.
The United States of America would not have existed without slavery. Further, the concepts that necessarily underpinned the belief that an entire race of people ought to be subservient to another are with us today.
Take, for example, fundamental mistruths about the biology and psychology of people of African descent that doctors still believe today — including the startlingly common belief that we have less sensitive nerve endings or thicker skin, or are more prone to addiction, and so are less likely to have our pain taken seriously or addressed with medication. Take the thorny notions about black criminality and sexuality that inform our criminal justice system and even our everyday interpersonal interactions.
Perhaps more ambitious than attempting to cover the breadth and depth of the subject of slavery is attempting to convince many Americans that it matters. This is difficult. As I said, slavery is foundational to America, and so an indictment of slavery is an indictment of America. The 1619 Project is named for the year the first recorded slave ship landed in Colonial America, delivering 20 or so enslaved Africans to Virginia. That we need to convince Americans that slavery matters on its putative 400-year anniversary in this country is difficult to comprehend.
It lays bare certain hypocrisies about our defining ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. English abolitionist Thomas Day noted one such contradiction in the era of the American Revolution, calling the American patriot “ridiculous” for signing “resolutions of independency with one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.”
It’s hard, perhaps, to hear our founding patriots called ridiculous. It’s harder perhaps to embrace the truth that they were human traffickers, known to be guilty of participating in what we know now is a crime against humanity.
As an African American, just one, it’s hard to know that many of the same founders who owned slaves felt perhaps that the practice should be eliminated but could not be so moved as to eliminate the practice on their personal estates or in their own lives. It’s difficult to know that I walk on streets or look up at statues named for men who certainly would have considered my liberty subaltern to their own — and that’s the kindest possible way they would have regarded said liberty.
This is not unusual to the American experience, this alacrity to discard or abandon another’s rights for the sake of our own desires; it is endemic. This is not to say that I am an unhappy or unproud American — though I find it frustrating that one must constantly restate that before offering any reasonable critique.
I love my country, the country that was my mother’s, though she could not go to certain schools or drink at certain fountains when she was a child. I love my grandfather’s country, though it sent him off to a war from which he returned disabled and continued to treat him as third-class at best.
These moral discrepancies are difficult to confront. We want to know that our progenitors were good, that we are good, that our country is good, wholly. At least, we believe that their sins should be listed second in their epitaph — though to what human trafficker would we offer this kindness today? So, we deny and equivocate.
We claim that slavery in America was “not so bad,” despite laws that literally forbade offering slaves any form of generosity — e.g., the slave codes of South Carolina — or teaching slaves to read. We argue that slaves should have been grateful for the food and clothing they received, under what I can only guess is collective amnesia about the whippings, sexual assaults and family separation.
We go to plantations built by slaves and are upset because the discussion of slavery disrupts our romantic and idyllic vision of antebellum life (I am sure the slaves who resided on those plantations, too, were quite disappointed).
We repeat the refrain that slavery was too long ago to matter, despite ending after the American Revolution, which was certainly not too long ago to matter. We want to inherit only credit, never debt. This is not unreasonable, but it is unrealistic.
We do not wish to inherit slavery — who would? — but we have. The greatest value of the 1619 Project is that it asks us to consider the many ways in which slavery and the lived experience of the enslaved infiltrates forward into our daily lives, no matter if we are second-generation Americans or sixth.
Segregation, the racial wealth gap, disparities in American health care (consider the disproportionate mortality rates of black women in childbirth), our prison system, the excesses of American capitalism, the relationship between NBA players and team owners, etc. — all of these have whole or partial roots in the economic system of racial enslavement and oppression that prevailed here for over two centuries.
The continual project of forming a country together requires facing hard truths about ourselves, our neighbors and our history. If we can’t do that, then the project — America — is already lost.
Really confronting those truths, on the other hand, often seems like tearing open an old wound, but the truth is that the wound never really healed — it just sort of festered and was bandaged over.
As evidenced by race killings and hate crimes, the prevalence of affection for white nationalism not seen since the 1930s, and slavery revisionism — which portrays that barbaric institution as benevolent — we are in desperate need of surgery.

Texto completo: There exists a collective of readers who long for escape to a place where the women walk barefoot on wooden floors as they cook homemade meals, and their men are strong, steady and hardworking providers.
This is the surprisingly popular world of Amish romance fiction, or “bonnet rippers,” as they’re known, where fans are typically evangelical Christian women over 40, according to a 2015 Newsweek story. Two of the genre’s most successful authors, Beverly Lewis and Wanda Brunstetter, were close to selling more than 30 million books combined in 2015, Newsweek reported .
New York Times best-selling author and Colorado Springs resident Shelley Shepard Gray has earned her own seat at the proverbial table. She’s written dozens of novels in the Christian romance subgenre, including her latest, the Walnut Creek Series. “The Loyal One,” No. 2 in the series, was released in August, following the April release of “The Patient One.” The series follows a group of seven people who reunite after the suicide of one of their friends.
“... This is a pleasing story about recovering from grief and a solid beginning for a new series,” wrote a reviewer for the website Publishers Weekly.
Amish romance covers are a far cry from those of iconic Harlequin books, with their bare-chested, swashbuckling male protagonist wrapping his bulky arms around an impossibly tiny-waisted, long-haired woman.
Instead, imagine demure and playful-looking women in long, plain cape dresses, aprons and white head coverings, standing withing touching distance of men in overalls and wide-brimmed hats.
Excerpt
From Shelley Shepard Gray's 2019 Amish romance novel "The Loyal One"
"Her gaze flickered to his lips. She didn't say a word, only smiled.
Leaning in, he placed his free hand around the back of her neck, glancing at her to make sure she wasn't unsure.
Her eyes were bright. Her lips were slightly parted.
He needed no more encouragement. Very gently and carefully, he brushed his lips against hers. She yielded against him and fluttered her eyes closed.
And then she kissed him back.
When he at last pulled away, Katie was wearing a stunned look. Her lips were a little swollen — like she'd just been thoroughly kissed."
What attracts readers to the genre is the same thing that attracts Gray: a sense of hope and the feeling of being transported to another world, one populated not only with the simple-living, plain-dressing and technology-eschewing Amish, but also Mennonites, who differ in their use of technology, among other issues, and Englishers, or non-Amish people. And as you might suspect, this subgenre of books features zero sex and zero questionable language.
“It’s nice spending my days writing about people who are basically positive and caring,” said Gray, who relocated from Cincinnati to the Springs with her husband late last year. “I feel like they’re my next-door neighbors because I know them so well.”
The former sixth-grade teacher, who lived in Denver and taught in the Douglas County School District in the ‘90s, didn’t set out to write Amish romance. Her writing career began one day during a lunch break, when she realized she’d forgotten to bring one of her beloved romance novels to pass the time.
“It was either make something up or grade papers,” she said. “I always thought maybe I could do it. I decided to take up writing the way some people might take up running or quilting. It would be my little hobby I did for fun.”
Three years and multiple manuscripts later, she sold her third book, and made real her lifelong dream of becoming a Harlequin romance writer.
“They were short,” she said. “I read fast and they had happy endings.”
After writing a dozen books for Harlequin’s American Romance and Heartwarming lines under the pen name Shelley Galloway, the Lutheran woman found herself naturally gravitating toward inspirational books where her characters wound up with causes and storylines about saving people. Her editors tried to reel her back in, telling her she was getting off the “boy meets girl” track, but Gray’s agent encouraged her new direction.
She went on to write a big historical Western set after the Civil War, in which everyone found redemption. Though it received almost two dozen rejections, an editor at Harper Collins noticed her writing ability and where she lived — southern Ohio, which is home to Holmes County, where about 40,000 Amish folks live — and asked her to come up with a story about them.
“Hidden,” about a woman who flees an abusive relationship by stowing away in an Amish bed and breakfast, was released in 2008.
“I wasn’t sure about it, but I lived an hour from the Amish community, so I’d already been going over there to get the cinnamon rolls,” said Gray with a laugh.
Researching the simple-living and plain-dressing people has been a yearslong process. It started with books and websites and reading the canon of authors such as Lewis and Brunstetter, and extended into visiting Amish communities around the country. In doing so, she’s made good friends, including Clara, an Old Order Amish friend who, if they were neighbors, “would be gossiping every morning,” said Gray. She’s able to ask her questions and seek advice, and always sends her one of the first copies of each new Amish romance she writes.
Nowadays she writes two Amish books every year, in addition to other projects, including the Bridgeport Social Club series, noninspirational, non-Amish, contemporary romances with a ballroom dancing theme.
“I love writing about people who are faith-driven, and not worried about their computer, the news, all the outside noise, cellphones, their Facebook,” Gray said. “They’re more interested in their friends next door.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Both the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump and the presidential campaign of former Rep. Joe Walsh, one of Trump's GOP primary challengers, are fundraising off the controversy surrounding an altered map of Hurricane Dorian’s path that Trump displayed in the Oval Office Wednesday.
As Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas and threatened parts of the United States, Trump has held firm on his Sept. 1 claim that the storm would threaten Alabama, despite being contradicted by the National Weather Service on Sunday soon after his original tweet.
After a week of Trump seeking to bolster his original assertion regarding Alabama, including the release Thursday of a statement by a homeland security adviser, "#SharpieGate" took another turn Friday when NOAA released a statement disavowing Sunday's statement by a local station of the National Weather Service.
More: White House aide says he briefed Trump about Alabama and Hurricane Dorian
"From Wednesday, August 28, through Monday, September 2, the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama," the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a statement Friday, that also pointed to a number of its advisories during that period.
"The Birmingham National Weather Service’s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time," NOAA also said in the statement.
Even before the agency's effort to substantiate Trump's claim, the president's campaign saw the value in keeping the controversy alive.
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale announced on Twitter earlier Friday that the campaign was offering "the official Trump marker. "
“Buy the official Trump marker, which is different than every other marker on the market, because this one has the special ability to drive @CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy! #KeepMarkersGreat,” Parscale tweeted.
The markers are seemingly an effort by the Trump campaign to both capitalize on and simultaneously make light of what could have been a relatively minor controversy if not for the president doubling down on his remarks multiple times this week.
A pack of five markers is $15, and the markers are emblazoned with the president’s “signature in gold” according to the campaign's website.
Former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill. , who is challenging Trump for the GOP nomination, is also selling markers on his campaign's website where they are offered as part of making a contribution of $25 or more
“Sometimes the president needs to be reminded. . . so we used his favorite writing tool: a Sharpie!” his website reads. The Walsh sharpie is emblazoned with “DON’T LIE”
“Since the guy in the White House is a pathological liar, we customized his favorite marker to give him some advice: “DON’T LIE. ” Walsh tweeted Friday.
Walsh, a onetime syndicated conservative talk show host said in August that he's running a primary challenge against the president because Trump is "unfit" and "somebody needs to step up. "
Walsh, who was backed by the Tea Party during his time in Congress, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in which he said a Republican should challenge Trump “from the right. ” He also said Trump “can’t be trusted. ”
“The fact is, Mr. Trump is a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects,” Walsh wrote.
Trump hit back at Walsh late last month soon after Walsh announced his primary challenge, calling Walsh, among other things, "a one-time BAD Congressman from Illinois. "
The hashtag "#SharpieGate" trended on Twitter as users posted their own Sharpie illustrations after the president presented the altered hurricane forecast map on Wednesday.

After slowly reducing my dosage, I'm now heading into my third week of cold turkey. It's not a debilitating feeling -- I spent months preparing for this moment. But it's very unpleasant.
Ask my colleagues if I've been crankier and more irritable than usual. Ask my editor.
My experience with antidepressants mirrors the struggle many people face in trying to wean themselves from powerful prescription drugs -- drugs that can play a positive role in your life until you realize you're hooked.
"One thing we've learned from the opioid epidemic is that many patients believe if a drug has been prescribed by a doctor, it can't harm you," said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.
"These are strong drugs," he told me. "They can do a lot of good. They can also do a lot of harm."
Painkillers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, tranquilizers, stimulants -- each can affect users' bodies so intensely that severe withdrawal symptoms are possible, even likely, if you stop taking them.
Such symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, nausea, mood swings and other conditions that can make daily life miserable. In some cases, suicidal tendencies can occur.
Adam Bisaga, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, said that "most people aren't prepared for the changes these drugs can cause to the body."
"It's easy to just take a pill every day," he said. "To come off a drug means you're going to have to do a lot more work."
Don't get me wrong: These drugs aren't inherently bad. For many, a painkiller or an antidepressant can be the difference between a functional life and a life of unrelenting despair.
"Users themselves must decide about meds' helpfulness in their own lives," said David Cohen, a professor of social welfare at UCLA.
I'm not saying what's right for anyone else.
I am saying, though, that Americans are currently more medicated than at any time in our history.
In 1997, according to Consumer Reports, 2.4 billion prescriptions were written by doctors. By 2016, that number had nearly doubled to 4.5 billion prescriptions.
For the pharmaceutical industry, that means record profits. Worldwide spending on prescription drugs reached $1.2 trillion last year, according to the medical data firm IQVIA. By 2023, global spending on drugs could top $1.5 trillion.
At any given time, about half the country is taking at least one prescription med, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly a quarter of the population is taking three or more prescription drugs. About 12% is taking five or more.
The number of opioid prescriptions dispensed by U.S. pharmacies almost tripled from 1991 to 2011, rising to 219 million prescriptions, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. By 2017, nearly 58 opioid prescriptions were being written for every 100 Americans, says the CDC.
Meanwhile, roughly 13% of Americans age 12 and over have been prescribed antidepressants, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. That rate has tripled over the last two decades.
In many cases, such treatment is warranted. But not always. Or not forever.
"There are a lot of people getting prescriptions to drugs who shouldn't be," said Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital.
My adventure in addiction began after I was diagnosed in 2007 with Type 1 diabetes. That's the genetic kind (it runs in my family) as opposed to the kind typically associated with obesity.
Studies have found that diabetes can more than double your chances of clinical depression. This is due in large part to coping with a chronic disease. It also can be a factor of your body's natural chemistry becoming imbalanced.
I went through a grieving process for my suddenly kaput pancreas and sought the assistance of a therapist for a few weeks. But it wasn't depression that drove me to seek help from my endocrinologist. I couldn't sleep.
I've never been a good sleeper. Diabetes turned my nights into minefields, tossing, turning, lying awake for hours.
My endocrinologist wasn't surprised. Insomnia is common among Type 1s, he said.
He wrote me a prescription for an antidepressant and said this would likely straighten out whatever systemic imbalance was keeping me up at night.
And it did. I started sleeping better within a few weeks. As an added benefit, my wife said I'd become mellower and more pleasant to be around. Like the old ad slogan declared, better living through chemistry.
Then the New York Times went and ruined everything with an extraordinary investigation last year that detailed the agony faced by many people who tried to end their dependence on antidepressants. It's called "discontinuation syndrome."
"Patients who try to stop taking the drugs often say they cannot," the paper found. "About half who wound down their prescriptions rated the withdrawal as severe. Nearly half who tried to quit could not do so because of these symptoms."
That frightened me. On rare occasions when I forgot to take my daily pill, I would feel groggy and disoriented by early afternoon. I'd feel and hear a whooshing in my head, as if my pulse was pleading for its fix.
What if there was an earthquake or some other disaster and I couldn't get my pills? What if the withdrawal symptoms were more than I could handle? How would I cope?
Moreover, how much is enough? Yes, I liked sleeping better. Yes, I liked that my wife felt I was more pleasant to be around.
But who was I? Was I me or was I the product of chemical enhancement? If I came off the drug, what would happen?
By this time I had a new endocrinologist. He'd read the same newspaper story and we agreed that antidepressants seemed more troublesome than once thought.
He also said that after years of taking the pills, it's possible my body had corrected whatever had been out of whack.
Or not. It could be that, as with my lifelong dependence on insulin, I'll just be happier taking antidepressants.
So we worked out a long-term program of reduced doses, a process known as "tapering." And now, finally, I've reached the point where I've stopped taking the med altogether.
That was two weeks ago.
At first I felt a bit better. Now I feel worse -- sluggish, moody, short-tempered. I've even started thinking about going back on antidepressants.
Anything to not feel this way.
Humphreys, the Stanford professor, was sympathetic. "Cold turkey is brutal," he said.

Texto completo: Not that long ago, Naomi Osaka was struggling to adapt to the shifting tradition in tennis of using hugs instead handshakes as the gesture of grace at the end of a match.
"I'm told that I give out the worst hugs," Osaka said last year, after winning the United States Open at 20 years old. "The thing is, I'm used to handshakes," she added. "Every time someone comes for a hug, I'm very confused."
By Saturday night, after the third match of her title defense, Osaka had more than perfected her take on the new brand of sportsmanship.
She not only hugged a tearful Coco Gauff, the 15-year-old sensation she had just knocked out of the Open -- she took Gauff completely under her wing. Osaka consoled the younger player, encouraging her to address the crowd in an on-court interview that typically belongs to the winner, and assuring her that it would be better to keep crying openly in front of the fans than to retreat inconsolably to the showers.
The scene was extraordinary but hardly unique for a 21st century Grand Slam tournament. When Novak Djokovic, suffering from a sore shoulder at the Open, retired midmatch against Stan Wawrinka on Sunday night, the two draped their arms around each other's necks.
And there was a moment of affection last year that became an instant meme. After Djokovic beat Juan Martín del Potro to win the Open, they skipped the traditional post-match handshake.
Instead, Djokovic and del Potro embraced for several seconds, as if they were long-lost brothers seeing each other for the first time in years. The image was replayed on screens throughout the world.
"I think it's because we both love each other," said del Potro, who missed this year's U.S. Open with a knee injury. "We have a great relationship, and we always play the great battles. The people love when the two players are fighting until the last point. A huge hug means a lot to the crowd and to us as well."
There was a time when the end of a tennis match required nothing more than a firm handshake and maybe a few kind words before both players gathered their belongings and left the court. The same held true for men and women.
Today, hugging has become the new handshake, providing a level of intimacy that may make post-match meetings at the net as unrecognizable to past players as innovations like the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system and serving time limits.
"We never hugged," said Pam Shriver, who played throughout the 1980s against Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. "The closest I came was when I beat Martina, who was my friend and doubles partner, in 1982. I only beat her three times out of 42. It was a huge upset. We still shook hands, but we put an arm around each other as we walked to the umpire's chair. It was such a big deal that the picture ran, above the fold, in the next day's New York Times."
In 1980, Bjorn Borg sank to his knees after outlasting John McEnroe in a classic fourth-set tiebreaker in the Wimbledon final. After he arose, Borg did little more than approach the net with his head down and share a limp handshake with McEnroe before walking off.
In an awkward moment after Pete Sampras beat Andre Agassi in a five-set semifinal at the 2000 Australian Open, the two looked as though they were actually going to hug. But their arms got jumbled, and they ended up settling for a traditional handshake.
Eighteen years later at the Australian Open, when Caroline Wozniacki beat Simona Halep to win her first major, their prolonged embrace looked more like two camp friends saying goodbye at the end of the summer than two top-flight athletes after a fierce battle. Same when Sloane Stephens defeated her close friend Madison Keys to win the 2017 U.S. Open. As they waited for the trophy presentation, Stephens and Keys sat side by side, laughing.
So why has on-court hugging become a thing? Has everyone on tour suddenly become BFFs?
"You're not going to do it with everyone," said Kevin Anderson, the 2017 runner-up at the U.S. Open. "But most guys know that we're out there working as hard as we can. We're all competitors, but we're also friends."
For Djokovic, hugging has become part of his mental routine, the result of time with Pepe Imaz, a Spanish spiritual guru who specialized in a technique with meditation and prolonged hugs called Amor y Paz ("Love and Peace").
Allen Fox, a California-based sports psychologist who has counseled athletes for more than 40 years, said hugs now are "part and parcel of every athletic competition, no matter the sport."
"Back in the day, athletes were trying to be classy, so they kept their emotions in check, shook hands at the end of a match and left the court," he said. "Men, in particular, were taught to be strong, not to share their personal struggles and to be quiet about their issues. They were trained not to be sappy out there, to take a loss with a stiff upper lip.
"Now people think nothing of hugging and crying after their matches."
Even when post-match hugs aren't warranted or wanted, most players now opt for a modified "bro-shake" -- a bring-it-in handshake that turns into a one-armed hug. It is often accompanied by chest pats or back pats, especially among the men.
"I really think these handshakes become hugs when you have matches that are long, physically and emotionally draining," said Michael Chang, the 1989 French Open champion. "Seeing them embrace is really a sign from both players that says, 'If we could have two winners, that would be my choice."'
Chang said his generation learned from the generations before: "Can you imagine McEnroe, Connors and Lendl ever hugging each other?"
Now, though, an embrace doesn't bother Lendl, who has coached Andy Murray and Alexander Zverev.
"Personally, I view it as a sign of mutual respect between opponents in a big battle on the court," Lendl said.
Some players on the WTA and ATP tours aren't close friends, and that is reflected in their behavior. Others cling to the older standards.
Serena Williams relied on the new custom to get through one of the toughest moments of her career -- the immediate aftermath of her loss to Osaka in last year's U.S. Open final. Osaka's victory was overshadowed by clashes between Williams and the chair umpire, who penalized Williams a point and then a game, infuriating the crowd.
Seeing Osaka approach the net on the verge of tears with her head down, Williams pivoted quickly from her frustration, flashed a sweet smile and threw her arms around the young champion.
A year later, Osaka took similar care of Gauff.
"Psychologists have taught their athletes: You're a better person for wearing your heart of your sleeve," Fox, the psychologist, said. "That's supposed to improve your self-esteem. Giving someone a hug at the end of the match doesn't make the loss less painful, but, at that moment, it might make both players feel a little better."

Stephen King, Optimist?

Texto completo: Stephen King wouldn't still be in business if all he had to sell was fear.
Within every terrifying story about a shape-shifting killer clown, homicidal father in a haunted hotel or super flu that depopulates the planet, the relentlessly prolific writer has filled his pages with equally powerful supplies of strength, selflessness and even hope. That may be why so many readers, many of whom discovered his books when they were kids themselves, have remained loyal over 45 years of storytelling.
The author is about to turn 72 as he publishes his 61st novel, "The Institute," about children who display supernatural abilities being forcibly rounded up for study by a shadowy organization that brutally discards them when their usefulness is exhausted. Those who think of King primarily for horror may be surprised by how much warmth there is in a book that sounds so coldblooded.
The concept for the book dates back more than two decades, when King -- who has depicted similar psychic characters as loners in books such as "Carrie," "The Shining," "Firestarter" and "The Dead Zone" -- pictured an entire schoolhouse filled with such kids. When he began writing the book in March 2017, he thought of it not as a horror story but as a resistance tale, with 12-year-old telekinetic genius Luke, teenage mind reader Kalisha and 10-year-old power-channeler Avery forming a rebellion inside their detention center.
"I wanted to write about how weak people can be strong," King says, speaking by phone from his home in Bangor, Me. "We're each on our own island, and at the same time sometimes we can yell to each other and get together, and there is that sense of community and empathy. I love that. I love that in stories."
"It never really works in a homily," he adds. "It sounds saccharine sweet if you just say, 'friends make things better,' but when you tell a story, people understand. Everybody wants to have a friend because this is basically a lonely business, life."
King acknowledges "The Institute" shares that theme with his 1986 epic "It," which has sparked a resurgence of film and TV adaptations of his work after the blockbuster success of the 2017 movie version. A sequel, "It: Chapter Two," which adapts the grown-up half of his novel, opens in theaters on Sept. 6. The plots of "It" and "The Institute" are completely different, but at the core of each story is something the author says matters more and more to him these days: not creating fear, but dispelling it.
"One of the challenges when you've been around as long as I have and you think you've explored all the corners of the room, you have to say to yourself, 'What are the things that really concern me? What are the things that I care about?"' King says. "Well, I care about friendship. I care about a government that's too big and that will try to do things where the ends justify the means. I care about defenseless people who try to find a way to defend themselves. All those things are in 'The Institute."'
He can still pen gruesome and harrowing scenes, but King's friends say they've noticed a change in his stories. "In general, a lot of Steve's recent work has become more optimistic," says Bev Vincent, the author of "The Stephen King Illustrated Companion" and co-editor, with King, on the short story anthology "Flight or Fright." He cites King books like last year's "Elevation," a comedic novella about a man who literally sheds the weight of the world and begins to drift away, and "Gwendy's Button Box," the collaboration King wrote with the Cemetery Dance publisher Richard Chizmar, about a contraption that delivers good fortune by inflicting misfortune elsewhere.
"They had happy endings. They had optimistic viewpoints about humanity, both individual people and groups of people, even when there were jerks in the mix," Vincent says. "Is he mellowing with his viewpoint of the world, or in the earlier books might that have always been there? Ultimately maybe there's a positive outlook on humanity underlying it all."
[ "The Institute" is one of our most anticipated September titles. Read more about it and the other 16 . ]
These days King is less enamored of his bleakest stories, like "Pet Sematary." When the directors of last spring's remake were devising a closing shot for the film, he proposed an idea that spared the young character he killed off in the original novel. (They didn't go for it.)
While he usually keeps a distance on adaptations of his work, he's making an exception with 2006's "Lisey's Story" -- an otherworldly love story about a woman putting together the pieces after her husband's death -- and writing every episode of the J.J. Abrams-produced Apple TV series that will star Julianne Moore. For the upcoming CBS All Access adaptation of his end-of-the-world saga "The Stand," he has penned a new ending that sounds like a happily-ever-after for two survivors of Armageddon. "Had it for years," he says wistfully. "I always wanted to find out what happened to Stu and Frannie when they went back."
Chizmar sees a lot of his friend and collaborator in the children of "The Institute." "I think Steve's a big kid," he says. "You have adults with power, and kids who represent good and innocence, and they band together to take that power back. He's a grandfather now, and he dedicated the book to his three grandsons, and I think he has a little bit of cynicism for the old guys, but hope for the youth."
For a while, King considered making the villains of "The Institute" the same group that hunted the pyrokinetic Charlie McGee in 1980's "Firestarter."
"I thought at first, 'Well, O.K., I'll make this The Shop. The Shop is locking these kids up,"' he says. "But then I thought, 'No, I don't really want it to be a government deal."' Instead, he decided the antagonists should be privately funded zealots.
Then, as King neared completion of the book last summer, things got weird. The broad strokes of "The Institute" began to parallel what was happening in real life: Children, seeking asylum at the border, were being removed from their parents under the administration's family separation policy. "All I can say is that I wrote it in the Trump era. I've felt more and more a sense that people who are weak, and people who are disenfranchised and people who aren't the standard, white American, are being marginalized," King says. "And at some point in the course of working on the book, Trump actually started to lock kids up." At least seven children have died while in immigration custody since the policy was enacted. "That was creepy to me because it was really like what I was writing about," King says. "But I don't want you to say that was in my mind when I wrote the book, because I'm not a person who wants to write allegory like 'Animal Farm' or '1984."'
As any of King's 5.4 million followers on Twitter can attest, he prefers to save his soapbox for social media. Novels are a place to explore human nature, not current events. "But if you tell the truth about the way people behave, sometimes you find out that life really does imitate art," he says. "I think in this case it really has."
King doesn't claim to have psychic abilities or experience visions of the future, but he may possess one extrasensory power that seems to be in short supply: empathy.

MSNBC anchor wonders if Trump should be compared to 'people who are delusional'

Texto completo: MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace speculated that President Trump should perhaps be compared to "people who are delusional" instead of "other presidents who were normal" during her show.
Peter Baker of the New York Times made the claim on Wallace's Wednesday show that while many presidents try to control the story, Trump's narratives are "impervious to outside facts."
"Listen, I think that the value of people that have been around other administrations is the capacity to compare Trump to that which is normal," Wallace responded. "But I wonder if that’s the wrong exercise with Trump? I wonder if we should be comparing him to other people who are delusional instead of other presidents who were normal?"
MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace wonders if Trump should be compared to 'people who are delusional'
"Yeah, I don’t think you can compare him to another president in the modern era," Tim O'Brien, the executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion followed up.
"Liz Smith, a New York gossip columnist once said to me, she was from Texas, you know honey, the only thing you need to know about Donald Trump is that he’s a seven-year-old who never grew old," he continued. "That’s a pretty good working way to understand where he’s coming from. Because kids when they get into a fight don’t think about what’s good in the long term. How should they constructively work their way out of this to get to a good resolution? What he thinks is there’s a thing in front of me now, I don’t like it, I’m going to strangle it to the ground. Even if it’s not in my self-interest to do this."

Texto completo: President Trump doesn’t like long spiels from anyone, including his close advisers, at White House sessions. He has a short attention span if he thinks he’s being lectured.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has found a way to grab Trump’s attention and hold it. I’m told he starts with this: “Mr. President, this is about your reelection.” With the 2020 election 14 months away, nearly every issue touches on his reelection.

The two-year budget that was being negotiated at the White House in August certainly did. The president was told he had three options to choose from: a government shutdown, a series of short-term continuing resolutions that would cause problems for the military, and an agreement that featured an expensive hike in spending.
Mr. Trump knew how strongly Mr. McConnell opposes government shutdowns. And the president himself is wary of causing difficulties for the military. That left one option, a deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.


The media hasn’t been much help in explaining why so many House Republicans are retiring. There are some who fear enduring a grueling fight for reelection, and then losing. But there may be more who fear winning.
How could this be? In last year’s midterms, Democrats captured the majority, 235-197. In the House, Republicans are living a nightmare. That’s what being in the minority amounts to in the “lower chamber.” They have practically no power. The press doesn’t bother with them as important players, only as critics of Democrats. Otherwise, they are politically invisible.
Being in the minority is painful for Republicans after basking in the majority since 2010, when they won 63 seats. For eight years, they ran the show — the committees, the House floor, occupying the biggest and best offices. Now the Democrats have all that as they concentrate on finding reasons to impeach Trump.

Just for the record, the Senate is a paradise in comparison, even for the minority. The Senate is 52-47 Republican. Yet the media take Senate Democrats seriously. They can credibly run for president. Not so, House members. Minority senators can filibuster Republican bills and sometimes block them. Think of all the politicians who were nobodies in the House, starting with JFK and LBJ, but became famous as senators.

Poor presidential candidates are good at casting their campaigns in a favorable light. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is an example of this phenomenon. “My campaign may well have been ahead of its time,” she told the New York Times when she became the first of the six women running for the Democratic presidential nomination to drop out.
That’s not the reason she flopped. Gillibrand had too many shortcomings to be taken seriously as a potential president. First-time candidates often stumble when they seek the presidency, and she did. Joe Biden crashed in his first two presidential races.

Gillibrand’s background was a problem. As a House member from Upstate New York, she fashioned herself a moderate Democrat, notably outside the liberal camp on the gun issue. She got a high rating from the National Rifle Association. This was not forgotten in the political community, even after she switched 180 degrees to become a gun control advocate.
It was one of many flip-flops. As a presidential candidate, she joined the pack in trying to make sure no candidate got to her left. But in two presidential debates, Gillibrand had trouble speaking credibly as an orthodox leftist. She vowed to ban money entirely from politics and campaigns and boasted about being the only candidate to do so. But she failed to understand how far-fetched she sounded. Liberals have tried and failed for decades to keep private money out. The more realistic of them have now given up, concluding that money will always play a role in politics.
A front-page piece by Lisa Lerer in the New York Times said Gillibrand “attempted to distinguish her candidacy by offering the most outspokenly feminist message of the field.” But “more female candidates in a race can help voters see women as viable political leaders without making one campaign a referendum on gender equality.”
As an outspoken feminist, Gillibrand was quite credible. But it didn’t give her the political boost she needed.

Republican strategists are worried about the low approval ratings of senators seeking reelection next year.
Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, for instance, polls in the low 20s.
Who do the strategists blame for this? President Trump. He dominates the news so thoroughly that Republicans one rung below him in the Senate are all but shut out. This also occurred in 2018. But this year, it’s worse.

Charles M. Blow: Stop lying about gun control

Texto completo: Beto O’Rourke has easily emerged as my favorite presidential candidate on the issue of gun control.
He has done so because he is speaking openly, passionately and honestly about what he would like to do to stem our epidemic of gun violence, a stance that is surprisingly rare in my estimation.
I long ago tired of hearing politicians who are supposed to be in favor of smarter gun laws and reducing American gun deaths and injuries pull their punches so as not to upset the gun lobby and gun lobbyists.
Among other things, O’Rourke’s “gun safety” plan includes declaring gun violence a public health emergency, creating a national gun licensing system and registry, requiring universal background checks, implementing red flag laws and banning “the manufacturing, sale and possession of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.”
Other candidates agree with some of these proposals, and others have additional ones, but I like the full-throated way O’Rourke responds to being challenged on this front.
This week in Charlottesville, Virginia, a reporter asked O’Rourke, “How do you address the fears that the government is going to take away those assault rifles — if you are talking about buybacks and banning?”
O’Rourke didn’t skip a beat: “I want to be really clear, that that’s exactly what we’re going to do. Americans who own AR-15s, AK-47s, will have to sell them to the government. We’re not going to allow them to stay on our streets, to show up in our communities.”
This was not the first time O’Rourke’s buyback plan has been challenged. Two weeks ago, the USA Today editorial board complained, “Anything smacking of confiscation would breathe life and energy into the not-from-my-cold-dead-hands crowd, endangering law enforcement and likely putting a full stop to any further gun safety measures.”
When asked this week on CNN about that criticism, O’Rourke responded, “This triangulation, calculation, poll-testing every move — that’s what got us here in the first place.”
Finally, a breath of fresh air.
Listen, I don’t know if O’Rourke’s full slate of gun policies are all right, but I do know that we have to start taking deliberate and thoughtful action to deal with this problem. For instance, a mandatory buyback could be met with a constitutional challenge. A voluntary buyback might be most doable.
The scope of the problem is enormous.
According to a Washington Post report in 2018: “There are more than 393 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, or enough for every man, woman and child to own one and still have 67 million guns left over.”
Furthermore, The New York Times reported in December:
“There were 39,773 gun deaths in 2017, up by more than 1,000 from the year before. Nearly two-thirds were suicides. It was the largest yearly total on record in the CDC’s electronic database, which goes back 50 years, and reflects the sheer number of lives lost.”
To my mind the goal is as simple as the task is daunting: We must reduce the overall number of guns in the population, especially those considered weapons of war; we must shrink the market desire for new weapons; and we must set a course to not only pass a new law in a moment but build in the expectation that federal legislation around guns will be the never-ending, ever-adjusting reality.
People interested in reducing gun violence in America have to stop lying about what that would require. Opponents of new gun legislation will accuse its supporters of seeking the worse no matter what they do.
But also, the opponents are right in some of their arguments. Can I or anyone else point to a specific proposal and say it would have affected this or that specific mass shooting? Occasionally yes, but often not. But that’s not the point. The point is to see a reduction in all shootings. And that argument actually reinforces a need to aggressively fund studies to figure out which measures would work best.
They are right when they say that restrictions on new purchases would place a burden on responsible gun owners — the overwhelming majority of gun owners — when only a tiny fraction participate in shootings. To that I say: AND?! Nearly 40,000 people in 2017 were killed by guns in this country. If a reduction in that number comes with more red tape for you, then so be it.
This is a public health crisis, as O’Rourke points out, and anything we can do to prevent guns from being used in a crime, to prevent a child from accidentally shooting a sibling, to prevent a depressed person from putting a barrel in his or her mouth, must be a consuming priority for all of us.
The people resisting regulation say that any new legislation is a slippery slope for an aggressive agenda to massively restrict guns. I say my great desire is to thoroughly hose that slope with oil.
Even in the radical District of Columbia v. Heller Supreme Court decision in 2008 that established the right to bear arms as an individual right, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the majority opinion:
“Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”
Guns can be effectively and constitutionally regulated in this country. People who want to do so should be upfront and honest about how far they truly hope to go in that regard.

Nicholas Kristof: A war with China could begin with a blackout

Texto completo: TAIPEI, Taiwan — If the United States gets embroiled in a war with China, it may begin with the lights going out here in Taipei.
Tensions are rising across the Taiwan Strait, and there’s a growing concern among some security experts that Chinese President Xi Jinping might act recklessly toward Taiwan in the next few years, drawing the United States into a conflict.
Xi’s hard line toward Hong Kong is alarming Taiwanese and further reducing the chance, if there ever was any, of a peaceful unification of China. China seems to be abandoning its effort to win hearts and minds on Taiwan, and it has steadily improved military capabilities — thus prompting the fear that Xi might eventually use them.
“We are very concerned,” Taiwan’s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told me. He said that one concern was that a slowing economy and other troubles in China might lead Xi to make trouble for Taiwan as a distraction. “This is the scenario that is constantly playing in the minds of the key decision-makers” on Taiwan, he said.
The main worry of military planners here isn’t so much a full-scale amphibious invasion. Rather, they fear the mainland sowing chaos and disrupting the economy as a way of trying to bring Taiwan to heel.
Hence the concern about a cyberattack that would take out Taipei’s electric grid. Or sabotage of the underwater cables that bring data and internet to Taiwan. Or interference in the South China Sea with tankers carrying oil to Taiwan.
Wu added that China could also step up military pressure by increasing patrols in the area, or by holding military exercises. Even a partial blockade would have a substantial impact if it raised insurance costs and damaged confidence in the island’s future.
Government officials in Taiwan were cagey about how they would respond to provocations in cyber and other realms, but Wu said that military officials “are planning for defense and offense.” Another senior government official said that retaliation could include airstrikes on China’s Fujian province.
That fits with the belief that Taiwan would promptly escalate to bring the war to China. If that happens, no one knows quite what the U.S. would do, including the U.S. itself. A 1979 American law suggests that the United States is committed to Taiwan’s defense, but the law is ambiguous about just how committed.
China has been vastly improving its military capabilities, including its ability to strike aircraft carriers. I’m told that in 18 of the last 18 Pentagon war games involving China in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. lost. Still, that can be misleading, because the war games are much more limited than real life would be. For example, the United States could interrupt China’s oil supplies from the gulf.
Beijing has also been nibbling away at Taiwan’s international presence, blocking it from participating in the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies, and even barring Taiwanese from taking tours of the U.N. and Taiwanese journalists from getting U.N. accreditation.
President Donald Trump has generally been more supportive of Taiwan than his predecessors, and that’s worked well so far. But this has to be done very carefully. While Taiwan and China may know each other’s red lines, I worry that American politicians may try to help Taiwan in ways that increase the risk of triggering a crisis. Nothing can be so dangerous as a well-meaning American.
Aside from its efforts to isolate Taiwan, China also appears to be borrowing from the Russian playbook and using Facebook and other platforms to interfere with Taiwan’s democracy in the run-up to crucial elections in January.
“China is trying to discredit and dismantle Taiwan democracy,” said Ketty Chen of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.
A war between the United States and China over Taiwan would be a cataclysm. But it would also be a catastrophe if Taiwan were blockaded or squashed into submission, because it is a pillar of technology (the source of more than 90% of the most advanced computer chips), a pillar of democracy and an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” standing in the way of any Chinese projection into the Pacific or toward, say, Okinawa.
There are steps the U.S. can take that might reduce the risk of a crisis. Washington can emphasize to Beijing that Taiwan will not take any unilateral action, such as declaring itself an independent country — unless China makes a military move, in which case it will do so at once. The U.S. can also caution Beijing that if the electricity goes out in Taipei, the same may happen in Shanghai, and that if Taiwan-bound ships are harassed, they may be reflagged as American vessels.
But that means thinking through what might happen in the next few years and making clear to Xi that he will pay an extremely high price if he messes with Taiwan’s freedom.

Cal Thomas: Comey’s actions now being revealed

Texto completo: One doesn’t have to be a cynic to be cynical about the Justice Department’s decision not to hold former FBI Director James Comey accountable for what an Inspector General report called his violation of FBI policies and his setting a “dangerous example” in order to “achieve a personally desired outcome.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
This pretty much characterizes many of the president’s critics, who fully expected Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 election and have become seemingly deranged in their responses ever since.
Comey reportedly broke several rules for which he will not be prosecuted. He took home memos detailing private meetings he had with the president and then disclosed their contents to a friend who he believed would leak them to The New York Times. His motivation was to make sure a Special Counsel would be appointed to investigate alleged “collusion” between Russia and the Trump campaign.
The Justice Department decided not to prosecute Comey, citing a lack of evidence that he “knew and intended to violate laws on handling classified information.” As FBI director, how could he not know of these things? Of course he had to know. If you think this mirrors Comey’s explanation of why Hillary Clinton would not be held legally accountable for her mishandling of classified information, you would be right. At the time, Comey said Hillary Clinton did not “intend to break the law.”
Is this the new standard? If it is, the prisons should be emptied because I’m sure every inmate would then claim he or she didn’t intend to break the law and therefore should be released.
The Inspector General noted: “By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employee, and the many thousands more former FBI employees, who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information.”

Taking to Twitter, Comey claimed the IG report vindicates him. That dissembling is reminiscent of some of Bill Clinton’s lies and Hillary’s, too.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee issued a statement: “(Comey’s) actions were disgraceful and part of a wider effort within the Obama Justice Department to undermine President Trump.” Who can credibly deny that, though many partisans will.
This isn’t over and Comey’s actions may yet be used as part of Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s continuing investigation (expected to be concluded sometime this month) into whether false information was used to secure a FISA surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. As The Washington Post reported, “That surveillance was based on the FBI’s suspicions that Page could be an agent of the Russian government. Page, who was never charged with a crime, has denied the accusation and accused the FBI of politically motivated surveillance that violated his civil liberties.”
The motivations behind Comey’s actions and those in the media who fanned the flames of collusion are now being revealed and should not come as a surprise. If the FISA warrant is shown to have been based on wrong information and the federal judge who issued it is shown to have been lied to, will the liars be prosecuted? They should be, but in the Comey-Clinton “no intention of breaking the law” era, I’m not betting on it.

Texto completo: I've mentioned this before, but one of my all-time favorite podcasts — the "Slate Culture Gabfest" — ends each episode with what they call "endorsements," nothing more than a recommendation or two from each of the three hosts of something he or she thinks are worth your time.
I've long suspected they might secretly award one another bonus points for eccentricity. For instance, in the most recent episode, Julia Turner, Slate's editor in chief, endorsed Chris Burden's "Metropolis II," an art exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the La Brea Tar Pits. Guest host Iassc Butler endorsed a new investigative thriller game with non-linear storytelling called "Telling Lies." The game is available for iPhone in the App Store and on PC via Steam. So Stephen Metcalf, Slate's critic at large, followed that up by doubling down on a remote and obscure wood-fired pizza place called Pizza on Earth. Located in Charlotte, Vermont, the farm-to-table pizza place is only open from 4 to 7:30 p.m. Fridays, and your pizza can be enjoyed outside on a Vermont hillside. Metcalf also endorsed "My Wood," a short piece of prose by E.M. Forster.
And, while all of those things are great — particularly if you should find yourself in northwestern Vermont late on a Friday afternoon — I wanted to offer a short list of my own endorsements as we step into the fall. Whether you're standing in line as you wait to have your chile roasted, waiting in the stadium for a football game to begin or just want to settle in for a cozy weekend of binge-watching, here's what I'd like to endorse:
"Designated Survivor" on Netflix: My dad has been singing its praise for a year now, and I finally broke down and binge-watched all three seasons. It's good. Kiefer Sutherland plays Tom Kirkman, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development secretary selected to be the "designated survivor" during the State of the Union address. When the U.S. Capitol is blown up in a terrorist attack — killing both houses of Congress, the entire Supreme Court, and all of the Cabinet — Kirkman, the 11th person in succession to the presidency, is sworn in as leader of the free world.
"Aaron Burr — villain of 'Hamilton' — had a secret family of color, new research shows," by Hannah Natanson for the Washington Post: This well-researched article profiles University of New Mexico law professor Sherri Burr and her familial ties to Aaron Burr. Sherri is descended from John Pierre Burr, who is almost certainly Aaron Burr's son, according to the Post. "John Pierre is the most prominent member of a larger family of color whom Burr kept secret and who flew under the historical radar — except as titillating gossip — until now." It's a fascinating read, and she has a new book out called "Complicated Lives: Free Blacks in Virginia, 1619-1865." She is working on a new book, according to the Post, to be called "Aaron Burr's Family of Color," which will go into even more detail.
"The 1619 Project" from The New York Times Magazine: Marking the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first African slaves in America, this project "aims to reframe the country's history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are." It's thorough, well-researched and provocative.
If fall provides you with a little additional leisure time, I hope you'll take the time to check these out. I don't think you'll regret it.

Texto completo: Dorothea Benton Frank, the bestselling novelist and grand dame of Montclair's close-knit community of writers, died Monday evening after a short illness. She was 67.
The news was posted to her Facebook page, along with an obituary from The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina. The Montclair resident has a second home on Charleston's Sullivan's Island and her 20 novels are set in the area.
According to the obituary, the cause was myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, a type of cancer similar to leukemia.
Her 2000 debut novel "Sullivan's Island" has over a million copies in print and has been translated into 10 languages. She had published a new book each year since. "Queen Bee," published in May, reached No. 2 on the New York Times bestseller list.
"She was honestly the most disciplined person I have ever met," said friend and former Montclair resident Christina Baker Kline, bestselling author of "Orphan Train," and "A Piece of the World."
At the same time, Kline says, Frank was "so much fun to be with, a very loving, generous, warm, down-to-earth person."
While Charleston held a special place for Frank, Montclair did too, according to Kline. "Dottie had a beautiful home in Montclair and loved to entertain and have friends over. But even when she did, she was up and at 'em the next day, writing."
The dramatic Montclair home of Dorothea Benton Frank and her husband Peter Frank, where they raised their two children, was featured this year in Montclair magazine and on NorthJersey.com. Though it is still the Frank's primary residence – Peter works in finance in New York City – the house has been on the market for the last couple of years, according to the couples' broker Sam Joseph. The listing price is $3.35 million.
Frank was active in the community. She has served on the boards of the Montclair Art Museum, Montclair Film Festival, Whole Theater, Drumthwacket Foundation and the NJ State Council on the Arts. She holds an honorary degree from Bloomfield College.
She was also an invaluable mentor and inspiration to fellow novelists in town, said Kline.
"She knew the industry and was really helpful to people like me who had a million questions and weren't as experienced as she was.
"When MEWS (Montclair Editors and Writers) held an event Dottie would always be there with a colorful cocktail," Kline said. "She made it it seem fun to be a writer."

The 10 best new shows coming to TV this fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

You Know Her Story. Now Learn Her Name.

Texto completo: For four years, the woman whose Stanford University sexual assault case caused a public outcry, has been known only as "Emily Doe." In her new memoir, "Know My Name," which charts her life since then, she reveals her real name: Chanel Miller.
In 2016, Ms. Miller's case made headlines after BuzzFeed published the statement she read at the sentencing hearing for Brock Turner, the Stanford student convicted of the assault.
Mr. Turner, then 20, was found guilty of three counts of felony sexual assault, for which the maximum sentence was 14 years. But the presiding judge, Aaron Persky, sentenced Mr. Turner to six months in county jail, of which he served three. Judge Persky's ruling drew criticism from those who viewed it as too lenient, and he was recalled by voters in 2018.
"I just remember being in my kitchen and reading this incredible, riveting piece of work," Andrea Schulz, the editor in chief of Viking, the book's publisher, said about reading the victim impact statement in the summer of 2016. Soon after, Philippa Brophy, a literary agent who represents Ms. Miller, contacted Ms. Schulz to say her client was interested in writing a book.
"I jumped out of my chair to acquire it," said Ms. Schulz, who declined to say how much Ms. Miller had been paid, "because it was just obvious to me from the beginning what she had to say and how different it was and how extraordinarily well she was going to say it. She had the brain and the voice of a writer from the very beginning, even in that situation."
Although Ms. Miller's case preceded the #MeToo movement, her statement and Mr. Turner's sentence became part of the intense debates around rape, sexism and sexual misconduct over the past years. In addition to the judge's recall, the first time California voters took such an action in more than 80 years, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill imposing mandatory minimum sentences in sexual assault cases. Ms. Miller's statement was read aloud on CNN and on the floor of the House of Representatives.
Ms. Miller started working on the book in early 2017, and since then it has shifted and expanded as conversations about sexual violence moved increasingly to the fore. The process of writing "Know My Name" was also, in part, a way for Ms. Miller to piece together the totality of what happened the night she was assaulted. She read pages of court documents and transcripts of witness testimonies she had not been allowed to hear during the trial. She and Ms. Schulz had weekly calls to discuss what Ms. Miller was discovering and how it would shape the book.
The cover art for "Know My Name" is inspired by the Japanese art of kintsugi or "golden repair," in which broken pottery pieces are mended using lacquer and powdered gold. It's a process that makes a new, beautiful object out of what's been broken, emphasizing where it has cracked. The association is meant to represent Ms. Miller's recovery, from the assault as well as the trauma of a trial, Ms. Schulz said.
"It is one of the most important books that I've ever published," she added, because of its potential to "change the culture that we live in and the assumptions we make about what survivors should be expected to go through to get justice."
"Know My Name" is scheduled to come out Sept. 24.

Frank Bruni: When did college become so cruel?

Texto completo: Paul Tough’s important new book on the broken promises of higher education begins with a chapter that he succeeds in making as suspenseful as the prologue of any serial-killer novel and as heart-rending as the climax of an epic romance. It describes a high school senior who is waiting to hear if she has been accepted at Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania.
Her name is Shannen. She’s from a poor family in the Bronx. She has worried so much and worked so hard that she’s underweight and permanently exhausted. And she believes — based on all the conversations around her, all the cultural cues — that her entire future hinges on the answers from these institutions. Her worth as a person hangs in the balance. The thought of college doesn’t flood her with excitement. It reduces her to a sobbing wreck.
I won’t tell you where she ends up, because that’s a spoiler. It’s also not the point of her story or of “The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us,” which will be published next week. Shannen exemplifies how college — once a bright beacon of promise and potent engine of advancement — has turned into something that’s often dysfunctional and downright cruel.
At its best, it remains a ladder to higher earnings, greater economic security and dreams fulfilled. For some lucky students, it’s still an exhilarating and enormously fun rite of passage. And America’s standout schools inspire envy around the world.
But for too many students, college is a letdown, betrayal or taunt. And Tough — whose previous book, “How Children Succeed,” was an influential bestseller — explores the various reasons and the toll on young adults at every socioeconomic level, though it’s poor and middle-class strivers who are the most badly served by far.
In an increasingly pessimistic country with fewer manufacturing jobs than decades ago and a widening chasm between the haves and have-nots, college looms enormous in young people’s psyches. But the mechanics of getting to and through it are messier than ever. As Tough writes: “A generation ago, earning a four-year college degree was rightly seen as a way for individuals to move up in the world. Today, for many young Americans, a BA is simply an insurance policy against moving down.
“ That dark fact has changed the way many of us think about college,” he continues. “It means that when young people make their decisions today about college, they often are motivated less by hope and more by fear.”
He introduces student after student whose route to college and experience there are rocky in the extreme. There’s Shannen, tortured by how much social, cultural and financial importance is attached to a school whose acceptance rate is no higher than 10% and whose yardsticks for applicants favor those from backgrounds exponentially more privileged than hers.
There’s Clara, who should be joyful — she has no financial worries and many excellent college options — but is bullied by her parents to bypass Middlebury, which she prefers, for Yale, which is yet more exclusive. Hers isn’t a sob story, I know. But it’s a dispiriting confirmation of the bragging rights and brand obsession that pervert higher education today.
Along with Shannen’s distress, it may also help explain why more and more college students report and seek help for mental health issues. According to the American College Health Association, the percentage of students who profess a degree of anxiety that affects their studies has risen to 27.8 from 18.5 a decade earlier. The percentage who say that about depression has risen to 20.2 from 11.6.
In rural North Carolina, Tough meets and interviews Kim, whose working-class family doesn’t do much to encourage her ambition. She gets into Clemson all on her own. Then she can’t go, not right away, because the math of paying for it just doesn’t work. Her optimism collides with — and is put seriously to the test by — the punishingly high cost of college in a country where, according to the Federal Reserve, there are more than 44 million borrowers who owe $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.
KiKi nets the scholarships and financial aid she needs for Princeton. But she finds herself in such a tiny minority of poor students there that she feels culturally adrift. She’s routinely reminded of and stressed by the social and economic divisions between her and other students. Tough’s reporting makes clear how painfully common this experience is, because despite the most elite schools’ pledges and boasts about diversifying their campuses, they’re still theaters of extraordinary affluence, with screening practices that keep them that way.
All in all the landscape of higher education in America is forbidding to students of limited means. Many of them enter college academically behind their wealthier peers, who got better K-through-12 educations, and schools do too little to help them catch up. Many are lured to for-profit institutions that rake in money while failing to deliver on their promises.
And that has dire consequences not just individually but also nationally. To spur innovation, compete globally and nurture prosperity in a country where factory jobs have ceased to be the answer, we need more, better college graduates. So why aren’t we doing more to create them?

Texto completo: Danielle Welch, 52, grew up in New Mexico butchering her own meat. She came from a family of hunters — skinning, slicing and trimming animals was expected. || Imagine her family's fury when, as a teen, she became a vegetarian. She was cutting through the sinew on a hunk of venison one day and suddenly became nauseated by the blood. From that day on, she couldn't stomach meat. || "I couldn't get the smell of blood out of my skin for weeks," Welch said. "That was it for me." || For the next 13 years not a single bite of spicy sausage, tender sirloin or crispy chicken passed through her lips. Every time she smelled meat, all she could think of was deer blood. Until one day she changed her mind while visiting friends.
"They made steaks, and they actually smelled good to me instead of like blood. So, I decided to eat one," she remembered. Her disgust at meat was gone. In its stead was more focus and energy brought on by the protein her body was benefiting from, she said. She bid vegetarianism farewell and has been a carnivore ever since.
Is vegan healthier? Not necessarily In a world of scare-tactic documentaries, dewy-skinned vegan Instagrammers and bogus health blogs, it's no wonder many think veganism and vegetarianism will lead to a trim waist, glowing complexion, laser-sharp focus, perfect health, and the ability to do hundreds of V-sits in a row. But science and experience say otherwise.
"There's still a lot of junk food that's vegan," said Dawn Cascio, director of food and nutrition at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey. "There are vegan chocolate chip cookies. A lot of processed foods like potato chips are vegan. If you don't focus on fresh fruits and veggies and unprocessed grains, you could gain a lot of weight."
As a vegetarian, Welch turned to pasta and bread to supplement her diet and wound up packing on pounds. "You're having so many starches and grains," she said. "Our bodies are not meant to break all those down. We're not cows."
Sometimes cutting out meat and dairy can be dangerous. For proof, look no further than the infamous case of YouTuber Yovana Mendoza Ayres, or Rawvana as she's known. Ayres runs a vegan blog and YouTube channel, where she extols the virtues of raw vegan living (eating only plant-based foods that aren't cooked). She also sells raw vegan meal plans on her website.
But her goose was cooked when earlier this year she appeared in a fellow YouTuber's video eating (cue dramatic music) ... fish! Ayres took to the internet to do some "splaining." She said in a video that after beginning her raw vegan diet she stopped getting her period.
Doctors told her that her "hormones were out of wack." She needed to eat more fat and cook her food. She was anemic and her thyroid levels were low. Then she got SIBO, a small intestinal bacteria overgrowth that can lead to malnourishment. After some advice from a nutritionist, she reintroduced eggs and fish into her diet to regain her health, all the while maintaining to her fans that she ate only raw vegan food.
'There's no one-size-fits-all diet' Of course, eating less meat and more plants for good health isn't all phooey. According to Cascio, thorough research shows a link between eating processed meats and an increased risk in developing cancer and heart disease. Eating less meat also shrinks one's carbon footprint and can reduce cruel farming practices. Just ask Beyonce, or rather her personal trainer Marco Borges. Borges, a nutrition author who recently released the plant-based recipe book "The Greenprint," has pioneered a 22-day vegan nutrition challenge, best known for being used and endorsed by Queen B and Jay-Z.
Borges also conducted a clinical study with Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey. He found that over 22 days, people who ate a whole foods (foods grown out of the ground) vegan diet saw positive results. When compared with people who ate a vegetarian diet, their BMIs (body mass index) went down five times more, their body fat reduced by four times more and their cholesterol decreased 400%.
If this study is any proof, cutting out meat and dairy can shed pounds and be good for your heart. But not all vegan diets are made the same.
"It's really important to distinguish between whole food plant-based and being vegan. ... A whole food plant-based diet is vegan, but vegan isn't always whole-food plant based," Borges said. "Whole foods come from the earth like rice, whole grains and beans. Not waffles, Impossible burgers and french fries, which are also vegan."
Dr. Iris Erguder-Saman agrees. She's a doctor in family medicine and the director of integrative medicine at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. Erguder-Saman works with people who are looking to make big changes to their diet. Her tips? Avoid processed foods like veggie burgers and talk to a doctor before cutting major food groups out of your diet. "There's no one-size-fits-all diet. Some diets work for some individuals," she said. "It's all about having a conversation and consulting with a healthcare professional."
Getting back together with meat Kassandra Gutierrez, 28, owner of the meal prep and food delivery service The Malleable Palate based out of Paterson, New Jersey, says she felt "lighter" and "better" as a vegan. A trained chef, Gutierrez knew which foods to substitute into her diet to stay healthy.
When she was 20 she decided to go pescatarian (eating only fish and plant-based foods), then vegetarian, then vegan, after watching the documentary "Forks Over Knives." The film advocates eating plant-based proteins instead of animal proteins, claiming the switch will reduce diseases like cancer and diabetes. But something was missing.
"I enjoy the umami flavor. I craved steak the most when I was pescatarian, seafood when I was vegetarian, and probably cheese when I was vegan," she said. After six months of being vegan, she went back to eating meat.
Jennifer Levine of Montclair, New Jersey, went vegetarian while attending UMass Amherst because the food that came with the plant-base dining plan looked better than the others. When she graduated, Levine decided to stay vegetarian. "It became a habit," she said.
About eight years later she went to a deli with her boyfriend. She was about to order her usual meatless sandwich when her boyfriend suggested something life-changing – "Why don't you try the turkey sub?"
"It was radical. That was kind of a turning point," Levine said. She ordered the turkey sub. Then started eating meat again. Levine noticed she had more energy from that point on.
"As a vegetarian, I was carb-loading. I wasn't getting adequate protein," she said. "Since I've started eating meat again, I have a much more refined awareness of what I'm eating."
Oscar-winning actress (and fellow New Jerseyan) Anne Hathaway scrapped veganism after a fateful dinner with her husband, Adam Shulman, and Matt Damon. The three were dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Iceland. Shulman and Damon asked to eat whatever the chef was making. Hathaway asked if the salmon they were serving was local.
"And they said: 'Do you see that fjord?'" she told the publication Tatler. "So I had a piece of salmon, and my brain felt like a computer rebooting."
As a vegan, "I just didn't feel good or healthy ... not strong," she said later to Harper's Bazaar. Even Jane Brody, personal health columnist and longtime specialist in medicine and biology for the New York Times, weighed in in her 2017 column "Good Vegan, Bad Vegan." Her article was published in The Times in response to the "misstatements" made in the popular Netflix documentary "What The Health."
Eating an egg every day is just as bad as smoking five cigarettes? Eating one serving of processed meat a day raises your risk of getting diabetes 51%? All things the documentary claimed. All wrong, Brody said.
In the column she pointed to studies published by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and Harvard's Department of Nutrition. Both found that eating a primarily plant-based diet would reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, but left room for "various amounts of animal products" in their subjects' diets, Brody wrote.
She also drew the distinction between good vegan food (read: broccoli) and bad vegan food (read: vegan chocolate chip cookies). The former will most likely be a positive for your health. The latter most likely will not. "Eating is so personal and cultural," Cascio of Valley Hospital said. "Everybody is different and needs to find a diet they personally feel great on. ... If you feel like crap on it, it might not be for you."
Non-meat burgers like the Impossible Burger aren't as healthy for you as they may seem. They're made with chemicals and processed foods.

Pentagon Will Divert Billions From Projects To Pay for Wall

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon will delay or suspend 127 military construction projects so that $ 3.6 billion can be diverted to shore up President Trump's border wall, Defense Department officials said Tuesday.
Pentagon officials on Tuesday began notifying congressional representatives from areas that house the affected projects, and the decision to divert the funding prompted outcry from Democrats over what they viewed as a violation of Congress's authority to set spending.
The move is part of President Trump's declaration in February of a national emergency in order to gain access to billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build a wall along the border with Mexico. After losing a battle with lawmakers over that funding -- a fight that led to a partial government shutdown -- the president argued that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from Mexico constitutes a national security threat that justified using the military without specific approval from lawmakers.
Defense Department officials declined to publicly identify the affected projects until lawmakers had been notified, but they said that about half of the $ 3.6 billion would be taken from planned military construction projects overseas. The remainder would come from planned projects in the United States.
The United States Military Academy at West Point is one such project, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. In a statement, he called the decision "a slap in the face to the members of the armed forces who serve our country that President Trump is willing to cannibalize already allocated military funding to boost his own ego and for a wall he promised Mexico would pay to build."
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper signed off on the diversion of funds, his aides said. In a letter sent to lawmakers that was obtained by The New York Times, he identified 11 projects that the money would go toward, including new construction and some fencing replacement along the southwestern border.
The projects would span Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, with the largest amount of new pedestrian fencing -- about 52 miles -- slated for Laredo, Tex., along the Rio Grande. And while Mr. Esper did not use the word "wall" in the letter, it is likely to serve as evidence for both the president and his re-election campaign that he is upholding his promise to build one.
The projects, Mr. Esper wrote, will reduce the demand for "personnel and assets at the locations where the barriers are constructed and allow the redeployment of D.o.D. personnel and assets to other high-traffic areas."
While Mr. Esper did not detail which military construction initiatives would lose funding, he said in the letter that the money would not be taken from any family housing, barracks or dormitory projects.
Since Mr. Trump's emergency declaration, the Defense Department had been examining an expansive $ 12.9 billion list of projects in nearly all 50 states and more than two dozen countries where American troops are stationed.
Department officials insisted on Tuesday that the military construction projects were only being delayed, not canceled. But regaining money for those projects will be up to Congress, which would have to approve new money to fund them, something that Democrats who control the House are loath to do.
"My view of it is that stealing money from military construction, at home and abroad, will undermine our national security, quality of life and morale of our troops, and that indeed makes America less safe," Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told members of her caucus on a private call on Tuesday, according to a Democratic official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss a private phone call.
Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, who leads the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees military construction, said on the same call that the committee would continue to resist replacing the diverted funds, according to the Democratic official.
"Every project that has been affected has gone through a rigorous multiyear review of the appropriateness and necessity of the construction process," said Representative John Garamendi, Democrat of California, who oversees the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee. In an interview, he said he had not yet spoken with Mr. Esper, but warned "it will not be a pleasant conversation for him."
Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, in a letter to Mr. Esper on Tuesday night, demanded more information about how the decision was made and "why a border wall is more important to our national security and the well-being of our service members and their families than these projects."
Several groups have challenged the Trump administration over the president's efforts to divert funding for the wall. But in July, the Supreme Court gave Mr. Trump a victory in a separate but related case, overturning an appellate decision and ruling that the administration could tap money to proceed with wall construction while the matter proceeds. The court said the groups challenging the administration did not appear to have a legal right to do so, in an indication that the court's conservative majority is likely to side with the administration in the end.

Texto completo: BEHIND THE BYLINE Nicholas Casey
Our Andes Bureau Chief on the One Thing Every Correspondent Prays For in an Emergency
Interview by Lara Takenaga
______
Leer en español
The Reader Center has started an interview series, Behind the Byline , to introduce you to Times journalists. Is there a reporter, photographer or editor whom you would like to get to know? Tell us in the form below.
As The Times's Andes bureau chief, Nicholas Casey has crisscrossed South America to cover some of the world's biggest news events in recent years, including Venezuela's economic crisis and the end of Colombia's decades-long war with the FARC.
But his work has also taken him far off the beaten path. From deep within the Amazon jungle to Easter Island, he has transported readers to places that few experience firsthand.
Here, he talks about his work in conflict zones, the very different career path on which he started and his unending quest to find a working A.T.M.
You were barred from returning to Venezuela and faced online harassment in Colombia because of your work. How do you weigh the dangers of your job, and how do you push your reporting forward in moments of adversity?
People's reaction to the truth can be very unsettling.
This year, after I published a story on kill orders from Colombia's military that were leaked to me, a powerful right-wing senator there released pictures of me and a photographer and claimed we had been paid by rebels for the story. Lesser accusations in Colombia, where I live, have gotten many people killed. This wasn't an easy time for me, the photographer or our editors.
But I always ask myself: If this is what countries are capable of doing to me, as a Times reporter, what are they capable of doing to their own citizens? Far worse, and I've seen it.
So I focus on the human rights problems I see in other places, which puts my situation into perspective. The most common question I'm asked by friends is if I'm worried about the danger. But there's never been a conflict zone I've worked in where I didn't find people living and children playing on the street. If these people feel they can build their lives there, then I feel I should be able to visit them and get to know their story.
[Watch Nicholas Casey on the latest episode of our new TV show, "The Weekly," as he traces the origins of tainted gold to illegal mines in Colombia.]
What has been your most memorable reporting trip?
I once got invited to the Bolivian Amazon by a group of chefs from fancy white-tablecloth restaurants who had rented a riverboat. It got stranger when I asked why: Their goal was to locate the Tacanas indigenous people during their annual hunt for caiman, a relative of the alligator, and find a way to ship the meat back.
It was a lovely nine days during which I saw the full range of what people ate in the jungle, including river turtles and tapirs (herbivores that resemble pigs). Some of the communities we met still held on as hunter-gatherers, living in a different cultural universe from the one I know.
But the chefs also had their own subculture. I clearly remember a young Tacana man and one of the cooks comparing their tattoos. It was a beautiful moment.
What's something about your life as a correspondent that might surprise readers?
The amount of time I spend trying to pull money out of an A.T.M.
Ninety-five percent of the world still doesn't accept credit cards, especially when there's an emergency. You can identify the correspondent as the person after the earthquake who has found the one working A.T.M. on the outskirts of town, and is sending a prayer up each time there's that familiar sound of the machine counting the cash.
How does it feel after you publish a big story?
It's humbling. The impact of The Times is still hard for me to believe -- its reach, its readership, its impact.
But it's humbling in another way, too. I work in a home office, not in a busy newsroom like in the movies. The New York Times isn't printed in Colombia. Sometimes even when I'm sending the largest story to my editor, it can feel no different than another long email to my boss. You have to pinch yourself to remember this is real.
If you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be?
I probably would have tried to be a classical musician. I didn't find journalism until after college. Before that I played the viola. It was kind of a religion for me during those years, and very much the opposite of what I do today.
Reporting takes you out among so many people in the world, but classical music keeps you largely alone for many hours in your own mind, where your company is enigmatic and beautiful music written by someone who died hundreds of years ago. You don't talk much. There's a wonderful side to that life that I miss.
I stopped playing the viola after becoming a journalist because I really think you can only truly devote yourself to one thing at a time.
How do you spend your time when you're off duty?
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time with books by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist, and by myself learning to meditate. I'm not sure where this has headed, but it has made me feel well many days -- and left me wondering if you can actually devote yourself to more than one thing.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "A Lost Job, a Chaotic Chase and a Shooting Spree That Killed 7 in West Texas" (news article, Sept. 2):
In 2012, when I was 12, Sandy Hook had the entire nation plastered to their televisions for hours. Now, we receive almost daily notifications of mass shootings. We take a moment to grieve, then move along with our day, accepting that this is what the world has come to. Parkland. Vegas. Odessa. Tomorrow will surely bring another.
I was raised in a generation that prepared more for mass shootings in schools than fires. Our hearts can break and our leaders may pray, but it is clear that these prayers are not being heard. Inaction is never the solution for any issue, especially one that is taking the lives of Americans daily.
I am 18 now and simply frustrated by our nation's broken leadership.
Noah Batease
Gloversville, N.Y.
To the Editor:
As a gun owner, a life member of the N.R.A. and author of scores of articles on shooting and a few books on hunting, I'm responsible in part for the weekend's heinous mass murders and maiming in Texas. It's up to us gun owners to ensure that the sports we enjoy bring no harm to others.
What to do? Everybody has an idea. Some are feasible -- enhanced school security, universal background checks, improved mental health screening and appropriate sharing of records. Some are much less so -- repealing the Second Amendment, eliminating all assault-style weapons, banning high-capacity magazines. Resolving gun violence will not happen without determined and bipartisan action and money.
The latter is where I can best exercise my responsibility to protect the lives of my grandchildren and my neighbors. I am willing to pay for the development, implementation and ongoing assessment of policies and programs to reduce gun violence in America, through a user fee on gun and ammunition sales like the Pittman-Robertson excise tax that restored much American wildlife.
Owning and using guns is my right. Paying associated societal costs is my responsibility.
John Ross
Asheville, N.C.
To the Editor:
Those who resist gun control argue that if prospective shooters know they may face resistance, they will be less likely to attack. Further, if there is an attack, the shooter can be taken down with someone with a gun. So goes the argument.
Two mass shootings in the past month took place in Texas, a state with among the least restrictive gun laws in the country -- and legislation that took effect the day after the Odessa killings loosened the gun laws further.
The notion that someone might be armed did not stop either shooter. Polls show even National Rifle Association members support universal background checks.
Alice Cande
North Adams, Mass.
To the Editor:
Many have said that we must not just talk but also act to end the daily loss of lives due to gun violence. Appeals for action are great, but our politicians are not acting. Are they not acting because we are shielded from seeing the effects of gun violence on our children?
What would we and our politicians do if we actually saw the damage done to bodies of wounded and dead children by assault weapons? Would The New York Times and other media publish pictures of the effects of gun violence on our children if parents of wounded and dead children consented?
Let's have the courage to show and see what we are permitting to happen to our children by our unrelenting protection of not them, but the Second Amendment.
Steven Bell
Kew Gardens, Queens
To the Editor:
I agree with President Trump when he says that strengthening background checks would probably not have prevented the recent mass shootings. That is all the more reason to pass legislation that bans all assault weapons.
Michael Gilman

Texto completo: For as long as Brad Johnson can remember, he has never been able to sleep more than six hours a night. Most nights, he sleeps even less. Johnson, 63, always wakes without an alarm clock, feeling rested and ready for the day.
“If you paid me $100,000 to sleep eight hours tonight, I couldn’t do it,” he said.
He’s not the only one in his family like this. Two of his seven siblings also are natural short sleepers. He suspects that their father was one, too.

‘See Jane Win’: A riveting political deconstruction of 2018

Resumen: Caitlin Moscatello’s “See Jane Win” dives deep into the triumphs and pitfalls encountered by novice women politicians in the 2018 elections.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=%26lsquo%3BSee+Jane+Win%26rsquo%3B%3A+A+riveting+political+deconstruction+of+2018&amp;author=Kevin+O%E2%80%99Kelly&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-09-03&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;issn=0882-7729&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Ahispanicnews_

Texto completo: By any measure, the 2018 elections were historic: A record 117 women were elected to Congress, including the first two female Muslim representatives; almost 1,900 women (another record) were elected to state legislatures, nine to state governorships, and countless to local office. The New York Times declared 2018 the “Year of the Woman.”
They were largely reacting to the election of President Donald Trump, but other factors played a role. Hillary Clinton’s defeat, as well as the Republicans’ attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and threat to overturn Roe v. Wade also propelled women into action. If the press and pundits talked endlessly about the tendency of women to devalue their qualifications and underestimate their abilities – known as “imposter syndrome” and “the confidence gap” – then this group of women were going to prove them wrong. 
In “See Jane Win: The Inspiring Story of the Women Changing American Politics,” award-winning journalist Caitlin Moscatello examines the resulting wave of first-time women candidates, focusing on four in particular. Former CIA agent Abigail Spanberger, a mother of three, decided to run for the House of Representatives against a conservative incumbent in a district that hadn’t elected a Democrat since 1971. London Lamar was a 26-year-old African American reproductive rights activist running for the Tennessee state legislature in defiance of local Democratic politicians who considered her too young. Catalina Cruz, an immigration lawyer who had grown up undocumented, set her sights on a seat in the New York State Assembly. And Anna Eskamani, an Iranian-American political activist and Planned Parenthood employee in Orlando, Florida, embarked on an unabashedly liberal campaign for the Florida House of Representatives in a centrist district.
Moscatello’s accounts of each campaign vividly illustrate how much harder most women have it than men when they run for office. Spanberger had to devise interview strategies to squash any impression that she was neglecting her children – something it’s unlikely a father would have had to worry about. Eskamani received an email falsely accusing her of having performed in an adult film, and threatening to out her if she didn’t end her campaign. And for women of color the challenges of racism ranged from the cosmetic to the potentially life-threatening. When Ayanna Pressley was campaigning for Congress in Massachusetts, she was encouraged to change her hair because her preferred style (Senegalese twists) wasn’t “polished enough.” When Sheila Stubbs, an African-American candidate for the Wisconsin State Assembly, was campaigning door-to-door with her mother and eight-year-old daughter, someone called 911 to report a suspected drug dealer in the neighborhood.
Women must also walk a fine line that would be unheard of for most male candidates. If a woman emphasizes her qualifications, she’s often perceived as arrogant. She must appear confident, compassionate, and approachable. Moscatello’s account of how these women pulled off this balancing act makes “See Jane Run” a primer on campaigning. 
For example, Catalina Cruz had enjoyed a notable career in public service before she ran for an assembly seat. But to show a more personal side, she was advised to ask her mother to write a letter addressed to the public about how proud she was of her daughter. It was a sentimental tactic, but it worked: People called Cruz’s campaign office to say the letter from her mother was why they were voting for her. 
Then there’s money. Women candidates often don’t have access to potential donors in highly lucrative fields, so fundraising requires them to ask more people for small amounts, or work harder to leverage their existing networks. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee doesn’t help matters for novice candidates: They allocate money to the campaigns they think will win and they measure the likelihood of winning by previous success in fundraising. None of this makes fundraising impossible, just more difficult for women. Ironically, small donations can ultimately be more valuable. As one political consultant put it, “a small donor is not just a donor, they are a voter, and they will likely not go to the polls alone.”
It’s a tribute to Moscatello’s skill as a writer that she can make topics like fundraising and myriad other facets of campaigning interesting. And the story she tells is a much needed on-the-ground account of the obstacles women entering politics face, and the victories that are possible. Readers of “See Jane Win” will be fascinated, enlightened, outraged and, ultimately, inspired.

On The Beach: A Gull’s-eye View

Texto completo: Here are three good things about gulls:
1. They are devoted parents.
2. Males share child care equally with females. That includes sitting on the eggs during incubation.
3. And they have figured out a way - actually many ways - to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. Some eat clams, some eat fish, some are attracted to landfills.
Of course, a few will divebomb you at the beach or boardwalk to steal a french fry, or the cheese on your cracker, or an entire slice of pizza.
The beach pirate approach to survival is, of course, where humans and gulls clash. And the outcry from humans is almost as loud and outraged as the cries of the gulls themselves. Several recent news articles have chronicled the predations of gulls and some possible remedies.
Ocean City, New Jersey, is bringing in hawks, and some scientists have suggested staring directly at gulls to fend them off. Though that is hard to do when the birds sneak up behind you.
There are some reports of more serious trouble. In England, a woman said a gull carried off her Chihuahua, and in Russia, a pilot was hailed as a hero for safely landing his plane after a collision with a flock of gulls. In the New York area, thousands of birds, including gulls, have been killed in the decade since the Miracle on the Hudson crash to clear the skies for airplanes, without an apparent reduction in bird strikes.
But it is at the beach where tempers flare. And in times like these, with heightened human-gull tensions, very little has been written about the gulls’ point of view.
Is there a Lorax who speaks for the gulls? Admittedly, gulls have quite a strong voice of their own, it’s just that it’s pretty unintelligible to most of us.
I called Christopher Elphick, an ornithologist at the University of Connecticut. He spends a lot of time studying sparrows but has a soft spot for gulls.
“They’ve found a way to succeed in the world,” he said. “So much biodiversity is suffering and disappearing and being lost. A part of me wants to just celebrate the fact that there are some organisms that can adapt and do well.”
There are more than 100 species of gulls worldwide, and they are doing well, by and large. Some live nowhere near the sea, which makes birders and ornithologists allergic to the term sea gull, although renegade friends of common language have called this attitude “birdsplaining.”
A few, like the ivory gull in the Arctic, which is near threatened, and the black-billed gull in New Zealand, which is endangered, are in trouble, but most are not.
The gulls that people are most likely to encounter on northeastern beaches in August are herring gulls, great black-backed gulls, ring-billed gulls and laughing gulls. Some of their populations are declining, but that is probably because they reached historic highs in the 20th century.
Before that time, some of those gulls were not found in New York or New Jersey. Herring gulls were first spotted nesting on Long Island in 1931, for instance. They began to spread in the 1960s and peaked in the ’80s.
Elphick said, and ornithologists and birders speculate, that the closing of open landfills like Fresh Kills on Staten Island may have something to do with the drop in numbers since then.
Sarah J. Courchesne has been part of a summer gull research program at the Shoals Marine Laboratory on Appledore Island, Maine, since 2008.
She admits that the herring gulls and black-backed gulls there do not always take kindly to visitors. But these are breeding colonies, and the researchers take young birds off the nest, examine them and put identification bands on them.
“This is like somebody walked into your house in the night and picked up your child and tried to walk off with them,” she said. “You would be alarmed.”
As are the gulls. So much so that the volunteers wear bike helmets and sometimes ponchos. Gull poop can ruin a shirt.
“Some gulls are just kind of psycho and others are really chill,” she said. Some birds sit quietly on a nest and allow themselves to be lifted off by volunteers who check the babies.
And the same variation occurs in how any given gull makes a living. Thousands and thousands forage for clams, follow fishing boats and shop at the local landfills.
“We have gulls that are never seen on beaches, and we know that because we have GPS loggers on them and they just never go near people,” Courchesne said. “They are 100% out at sea fishing for their own food.”
“I can’t deny that there are gulls that are stealing food,” she added. “And I can’t deny they are really good at it.”
But the thieves are specialists. And to give credit where it is due, they have worked at their trade. “If you’re dealing with a gull that is really talented at stealing food,” Courchesne said, “that gull has perfected the technique, possibly over the course of years.”
Also, the behavior that bothers humans so much begins with humans themselves.
“Everybody who goes to the beach and gets aggravated by a gull has previous humans to thank for it,” Courchesne said. You may not have given the gulls food, but somebody else did, and gulls are fast learners. At nearby beaches on the mainland, she said, “You’ll see people drive up to the beach and they’ll just dump an entire container of french fries out their window so the gulls come.”
Elphick agreed. “We’re slobs,” he said. “If we didn’t leave food lying around, they wouldn’t be doing what they’re doing.”
Courchesne, a veterinarian, teaches biology at Northern Essex Community College as well as being one of the leaders of the gull program at Appledore. (Her students often volunteer for the gull program.) She came to gulls partly because she loved birds, and even in veterinary school she knew she would not be treating pets.
She often hears from the public, since a major part of the research at Appledore involves banding young gulls and getting reports about where they turn up. She tries to turn correspondents into gull admirers or, at least, gull tolerators.
“People say: ‘So here’s a bird, it tried to steal my sandwich. It has a band on it, so I guess you want to hear about it,’ ” she said.
“We’ll tell them the whole history. Some of these birds are 12 to 15 years old.” She tells them how many offspring they have and what devoted parents they are, and how the “mother” that they saw may well have been a male helping his young.
Late August is “high time for harassment,” she said, because the young have fledged and their adult parents take them to foraging spots, which include beaches and boardwalks, to find food and to teach them the ropes. The gulls, like the humans, bring their whole families. “They’re being so pushy for food because they’re such committed parents,” she said.
“I have really come to love them. They’re my favorite birds. They’re so scrappy, and they’re overlooked.”
What does she recommend that the public do about gulls?
“I would recommend to people that they spend some time just bird watching,” Courchesne said. “Sit back and watch what they do.
“If you give them a little time and devote your attention to them, you will see this great intelligence behind that eye and this caginess, and this generalist sensibility that I think is very relatable to a human. Because it’s kind of the same way we go through the world.”

The labor value of parents at home

Texto completo: As the Labor Department styles it, Labor Day "constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our country." But there's one category of labor that tends to get overlooked - the uncompensated labor of moms and dads whose primary occupation is raising children and managing their households.
As any stay-at-home parent will tell you, there's little down time. There's the obvious work of caring for a child, which is particularly intensive in the years before he or she starts school. But the job also typically requires maintaining a household, fulfilling a host of duties such as cleaning, shopping, meal prep and managing the family's finances and schedules. It's not uncommon, either, for stay-at-home parents to take on elder-care duties when relatives become infirm.
So how would an economist calculate the value of a stay-at-home parent? The most straightforward way would be to focus solely on the child-rearing element and use day-care costs as a proxy. After all, the other stuff stay-at-home parents do - the cooking, cleaning and planning - has to get done regardless of whether both parents work.
In Washington, for instance, infant care averages out to about $24,000 per year, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. The average cost for a year of day care for a 4-year-old is about $19,122. Multiply those figures by the number of kids in the home and you get a pretty good sense of the economic value of stay-at-home parenting.
That kind of labor has been shrinking for years. In 1975, fewer than half of mothers were part of the paid workforce, according to the Labor Department. By 2018, that number had jumped to 71.5 percent. Because about 80 percent of stay-at-home parents are mothers, their workforce-participation rate is a decent proxy for the decline of stay-at-home parenting. Last year, the Pew Research Center estimated that about 18 percent of American parents did not work outside the home.
Economic considerations apparently affect that tally. In 2018, the gap between the number of children women say they want and the number they actually have was at a 40-year high. When the New York Times subsequently surveyed Americans on their reasons for not having as many children as they wanted, financial concerns topped the list.
There's a fairly large body of research demonstrating the benefits for children who spend more quality time with their parents, especially for children in two-parent, middle-income households.
American moms' decades-long push into the labor force is also a reflection of the gains women have made. They have career opportunities now that were previously closed off to them because of a combination of sexist attitudes and traditional notions about how families should be structured. But the gap between the number of children people are having and the number they want - with financial worries wedged in between - suggests another factor is at play: As wages stagnated in the second half of the 20th century, mothers who might have previously stayed home with their children opted to enter the workforce simply to make ends meet.
That's the thesis that undergirds "The Two-Income Trap," the 2003 book by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). It's also where the traditional labor concerns of fair pay and an adequate safety net intersect with the choices families make around work and child care. Viewed through this lens, stay-at-home parenting has become rarer, in part, because wages haven't kept pace with the rising costs of raising a family.
In this way, the big-labor objectives of the current moment, such as the fight for a higher minimum wage and the push for universal health care, can also be seen as a fight to give parents the financial leeway to spend more time with their children.

Texto completo: “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics. ”
Mark Twain popularized that quote over a century ago. It couldn’t be more true now.
Pundits constantly bombard investors with wild economic and stock market claims backed with charts and data. Much of it is bunk. But it isn’t hard to see through it if you're armed with a few simple tricks.
Those tricks come from one of my all-time favorite books: Darrell Huff’s 1954 classic, "How to Lie With Statistics. " It’s humorous, illustrated and non-academic – a great guide about how people torture data to force them to fit their argument. Here are its five most useful nuggets.
1. Beware stats from surveys
Surveys are only as good as their representativeness. But most have baked-in biases and aren’t truly representative. Political polls, wrong in so many recent elections, prove this. So do opinion surveys of all stripes. As Huff writes: “No conclusion that ‘sixty-seven percent of the American people are against’ something should be read without the lingering question, sixty-seven percent of which American people?”
2. Don’t take “averages” at face value
According to the Social Security Administration, average U. S. annual wages in 2017 were both $48,251. 57 and $31,561. 49. How? Technically there are different kinds of averages. The higher figure is the arithmetic mean. The lower is the median – the number in the middle, with half of wages higher and half lower. Both are “right,” but the mean average often gets skewed by outliers. You can’t assess an average until you know what kind it is and what skew it may hide. Keep this in mind when digesting climate stats. As Huff showed, Oklahoma City’s average temperature from 1890 – 1952 was a cool 60. 2 degrees—but temperatures in that window ranged from -17 to 113.
3. Consider “axis” fraud
Usually, in economic graphs, the horizontal line or “axis” shows dates and the vertical axis shows quantity or size. It’s easy to make anything look way wilder than reality simply by stretching the vertical axis scale or skipping a whole chunk of it. In 2014 someone did this with the Dow to make that year’s market movement look just like the run-up to the 1929 crash. It went viral – scaring many. Properly graphed, the two periods looked nothing alike. Blatant fear-mongering, lying with charts.
What could the next recession feel like?: Stories from past downturns are a guide
AI at work:: Machines are training human workers to be more compassionate
4. Know your profits.
Does an article about corporate profits report earnings per share? Or does it talk about gross operating profit margins? Is it discussing return on assets? Or on equity? As Huff explained, “You can, for instance, express exactly the same fact by calling it a one percent return on sales, a fifteen percent return on investment, a ten-million dollar profit, an increase in profits of forty percent (compared with 1935-39 average), or a decrease of sixty percent from last year. ” Writers and companies will often pick the one that best suits their angle.
5. No correlation without causation
As Huff explained, once upon a time, a study showed non-smokers got better college grades than smokers. But did not smoking help students get better grades? Or did bad grades drive more people to smoke? Is it a mere coincidence? Tyler Vigen’s hilarious website, Spurious Correlations, shows how easy it is to draw false conclusions between two totally unconnected things. Did you know annual per-capita cheese consumption correlates with the number of people who died from tangled bedsheets? Or that U. S. chicken consumption correlates with oil imports? People pull similar stunts with market data every day. That’s where we get seasonal myths.
For more, get the book. It’s cheap and a breezy 144 pages. Your 401(k) will thank you.

Texto completo: It was 1975 and I was upset. Rhoda had just gotten married and suddenly her career seemed to have disappeared. It wasn’t as if being a free-lance window dresser were an inflexible, 24/7 job, and she didn’t even have any children to keep her busy at home. And yet she was getting subsumed into her marriage to Joe.
It’s true that Rhoda was a fictional character in a TV sitcom, but that made no difference to me. In fact it made it worse in a way: Here was a story that could be told any way the writers wanted, and my hopes for a feminist heroine were fading.
What happened next reveals so much about a time many women today can’t fathom: I typed an earnest, frustrated letter to the "Rhoda" show and received an earnest, frustrated reply from an "executive script consultant" named Charlotte Brown. Also typewritten.
Rhoda's career was 'backsliding'
All this resurfaced like a message in a bottle with the death of Valerie Harper, the star of "Rhoda. "
“Thank you so much for your sincere concern regarding RHODA,” Brown wrote. “I’m very sorry that we’ve been ‘depressing’ you with Rhoda’s ‘typical’ behavior. Yes, she has done some laundry, yes, she has done some cooking, but we have tried like hell to keep her out of the kitchen. "
The letter goes on to explain the responsibility the show felt to define Rhoda’s new marriage as two people “who love each other but who refuse to lose their individual identities in marriage. ” Brown went on, “Rest assured, Jill. We are filming a show next week … and it concerns just the situation you mention in your letter. ” That is, Rhoda’s concern about “backsliding” in her career.
“I think this will answer your objection to any ‘atrophy of the intellect’ or ‘alienation from people in general,’ ” Brown said, and thanked me for watching.
I don’t have my own letter, but this and other sections of Brown’s response make my mood and tone pretty clear: young, annoyed, fiercely feminist and extremely disappointed.
The 1970s 'Squad' wimps out
Why was I so put out? Twitter user Freddie Johnson got at part of it when he said of a photo of Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman, “In 1974, this was The Squad. ” And The Squad, in my view, was wimping out.
March of women's progress: #MeToo and inclusion riders are great. But should I worry about my son?
Strange but true, young and not-so-young women, it was not always the norm for married women to work. And when they did, before changes over “the past several decades,” the Labor Department noted in 2011, “women's work outside of home and marriage was restricted to a handful of occupations such as domestic service, factory work, farm work and teaching. ” It wasn’t until the very late 1960s that newspapers like The New York Times and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stopped running separate male and female “help wanted” ads.
So it was unusual in the 1970s for women to work in a TV newsroom (like Mary Tyler Moore’s Mary Richards) or dressing windows (like Harper’s Rhoda). And it was especially revolutionary to see women like this on television. You need only look at the fare from the 1960s (with the possible exception of "Get Smart") to see what a departure these shows represented. In Moore’s role as a housewife during that decade on "The Dick Van Dyke Show," one of her revolutionary contributions apparently was wearing capri pants and flats at a time when most housewives still wore dresses and heels. At least on TV.
Letter writer was a feminist pioneer
Charlotte Brown, it turns out, was a full-fledged member of the 1970s Squad. “Virtually every series that I was hired to write on, I was the first woman the producer had ever hired,” she said in a WHOA! Network interview posted on YouTube, and the first woman in the writers' rooms “that wasn’t taking dictation or a lunch order. ” Though she never checked it out, she said, "when I started producing 'Rhoda,' I was supposedly the first woman writer-producer of a multicamera comedy. ”
Oscar nominee Regina King: My commitment to gender equality must only be the beginning
Brown is now 75 and no doubt has long forgotten the letter she wrote to an anxious young woman trying to escape a dead-end job and break into political journalism, another field that was not exactly overrun with women in 1975.
But America was on the cusp of a transformational era in the lives of women. Feminists like Brown and me and Valerie Harper were fortunate to be around at that moment, pushing for change and benefiting from the opportunities we helped create.

Salman Rushdie’s ‘Quichotte’ is a splendid mess of memory

Texto completo: A modern Don Quixote lands in Trumpian America and finds plenty of windmills to tilt at in Salman Rushdie’s “Quichotte.”
Mix Rushdie’s last novel, “The Golden House” (2017), with his 1990 fable, “Haroun and the Sea of Stories,” and you get something approaching this delightful confection. An aging salesman loses his job as a pharmaceutical rep, fired, with regret, by his cousin and employer.
The old man, who bears the name Ismail Smile, Smile itself being an Americanization of Ismail, is “a brown man in America longing for a brown woman.”
He is a dreamer — and not without ambition. Borrowing from both opera and dim memories of Cervantes, he decides to call himself Quichotte, though fake news, the din of television, and “the Age of Anything-Can-Happen” and not dusty medieval romances have made him a little dotty.
His Dulcinea, Salma R, exists on the other side of the TV screen, so off Quichotte quests in a well-worn Chevy, having acquired as if by magic a patient son named Sancho, who observes that Dad does everything just like it’s done on the tube and in stories: “So if the old Cruze is our Pequod then I guess Miss Salma R is the big fish and he, ‘Daddy,’ is my Ahab.” By this point, Rushdie has complicated the yarn by attributing it to a hack writer, another Indian immigrant, named Sam DuChamp (read Sam the Sham), who has mixed into the Quixote story lashings of Moby-Dick, Ismail for Ishmael, and the Pinocchio of both Collodi and Disney (“You can call me Jiminy if you want,” says an Italian-speaking cricket to Sancho along the way), to say nothing of the America of Fentanyl, hypercapitalism and pop culture and the yearning for fame.
It’s a splendid mess that, in the end, becomes a meditation on storytelling, memory, truth and other hallmarks of a disappearing civilization: “What vanishes when everything vanishes,” Rushdie writes, achingly, “not only everything, but the memory of everything.”
Humane and humorous. Rushdie is in top form, serving up a fine piece of literary satire.
(Rushdie will speak at 7 p.m. Friday at First Baptist Church, 901 Trinity St. Information: bookpeople.com.)
A surprising account of the sea
In “The Outlaw Ocean,” anarchy reigns on the high seas as New York Times investigative reporter Ian Urbina travels the world’s oceans.
Early on, Pulitzer Prize and George Polk Award winner Urbina writes that the stories he turned up while roaming from port to port “felt less like journalism than an attention deficit disorder,” so bewildering and untidy did they seem, so without unalloyed heroes and villains.
One figure in the narrative, for instance, is a law-trained, poetry-writing sailor whose job is to sneak into ports where ships have been impounded and, on behalf of their owners, steal those ships away; the work is dangerous and utterly demanding.
“He struck me as an older Tintin,” writes the author. The good guys in the story are beleaguered, outnumbered and often outmaneuvered.
As Urbina writes of Palau’s efforts to halt maritime poaching, a former captain of an interdicted pirate ship arrested in 2016 was back as an ordinary deckhand six months later, making the effort “more myth of Sisyphus than David and Goliath.”
If there are villains in the story, they are perhaps the unnamed owners of fishing fleets that put out to sea for long periods of time, for they are inspected and policed only in port.
Urbina engagingly chronicles his travels from one trouble spot to another: oil rigs erected on continental shelves, just outside the territorial zones of neighboring nations and subject to little governance; pirate-rich Somalia, where he became a persona non grata; and Djibouti, one of the places where ship owners — in this case of a Thai fleet — “shop around for the most lax registries with the lowest prices and fewest regulations.”
Urbina’s book ranks alongside those by Mark Bowden and Sebastian Junger, fraught with peril and laced with beer, the smell of sea air and constant bouts of gaming an inept system.
A swift-moving, often surprising account of the dangers that face sailors and nations alike on the lawless tide.

Trump's EPA keeps trashing the planet

Texto completo: In the face of any serious and growing problem, three options are available. You can do more to solve it. You could do the same thing as you've been doing. Or you could do things to make it worse.
When it comes to combating climate change, the Trump administration cannot be accused of foot-dragging. The problem is that it is marching briskly in the worst possible direction.
Methane is rocket fuel for global warming. It amounts to only 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but in its first 20 years in the atmosphere, it traps 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide. There's an upside: Cutting methane emissions yields quicker benefits in slowing climate change. But Donald Trump cares nothing for that project.
The Environmental Protection Agency has responsibility over such matters, but Trump turned it over to Scott Pruitt, a darling of fossil fuel billionaires and political donors Charles and (recently deceased) David Koch. After scandals forced Pruitt's departure, Trump replaced him with Andrew Wheeler, a lobbyist for the coal industry. In their minds, the "P" in EPA stands for "persecution."
The oil and gas industry is the biggest single source of methane emissions. Barack Obama's EPA issued regulations to reduce methane leaks from new wells, pipelines and processing facilities -- emissions that come not from energy that is used but energy that is wasted. The change also forced companies to take measures to stop discharges from old equipment.
The rule proposed by Trump's EPA would undo this whole effort, sparing companies the tedious obligation of frequent inspections and monitoring to detect methane leaks. Its proposal comes even though a study last year in the journal Science found that this leakage was 60% higher than Obama's EPA thought.
The administration also ignores the evidence from Colorado. Since the state mandated more frequent inspections, leaks have been cut in half -- while oil and gas production has set records.
It's clearly possible to be more vigilant about pointless, damaging emissions without hindering the production, transportation or use of natural gas. Don't take my word for it: ExxonMobil, Shell and BP, among the nation's biggest gas producers, all oppose the reversal.
"ExxonMobil strongly encourages the agency to continue regulating methane emissions at new and modified sources, and to expand methane regulation to existing sources," Matt Kolesar, regulatory manager at its XTO Energy, said in March. "With the experience we have gathered across our operations, we know how to reduce our methane emissions in a cost-effective manner."

Some of its competitors, however, claim that being forced to cut down on leaks would be ruinously expensive. Reported The New York Times: "Lee Fuller, executive vice president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said the smaller operators that his group represents could not absorb the costs that Exxon or Shell could, particularly when it came to inspecting and repairing older wells."
Maybe it is cheaper for these companies to save money by letting methane escape. But so what? Their prosperity should not come from causing unnecessary damage to the environment and humanity in general. If they can't afford costs that Exxon and Shell can, they are welcome to sell out to Exxon and Shell so the job can be done right.
Even the EPA doesn't pretend the change would be financially significant. It estimates the net savings at no more than $19 million a year. That's the equivalent of zero in the oil and gas industry, whose 2017 revenue totaled more than $135 billion.
If barring companies from indiscriminate spewing put some of them out of business, the effect on consumers would be invisible. Natural gas output in the U.S. has been so high that pipelines can't handle it all.
The EPA sees no need for the Obama-era rules because, it says, companies will police leaks on their own. Said Assistant EPA Administrator Anne Idsal, "There's every incentive for industry to minimize any type of fugitive methane emissions, capture it, use it and sell it down the road."
She should tell the operators in West Texas that have been burning off $1 million worth of excess gas every day just to get rid of it. Oil companies in North Dakota have been flaring some 20% of the natural gas they bring up.
If you aim to protect the planet from needless harm, a policy of ignoring methane leakage and accelerating climate change is hard to understand. If you don't care about that mission, of course, it makes perfect sense.

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because a Ken Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

A new niche Producer Will Packer finds success by treating every movie as though it's his first

Texto completo: Producer Will Packer's films, such as the NWA biopic "Straight Outta Compton," Tiffany Haddish's breakout vehicle "Girls Trip" and the dance drama "Stomp the Yard," have generated more than $1 billion at the box office
by making blockbusters that appeal
to black audiences and beyond.
"Little," starring Issa Rae and "Black-ish" cast member Marsai Martin, was co-produced by Martin, who is 14, with whom he worked to develop and pitch the idea for a "Big"-in-reverse-style comedy. He talks about changing things up in Hollywood and working with a new generation of talented women.
Fast Company: You've collaborated with a lot of powerful women over the years, including Tiffany Haddish, Queen Latifah, and Taraji P. Henson. "Little" showcases the talent of Marsai Martin, both behind and in front of the camera. She's now the youngest person to have produced a Hollywood movie. What made you want to work with her?
Will Packer: This next generation of creatives is more comfortable with its voice than previous generations. They are more aware of their reach and their power. With the right leadership and guiding hand, the sky's the limit for them. Marsai is a great example. She's amazing in that she listens to me and allows me to give her advice. But she has a very clear idea of what she wants to do, and what her talents are. My job is to put her in a position to win.
FC: You broke into film in 1994 as an undergraduate at Florida A&M University by producing "Chocolate City," a drama about a young man attending a historically black college. You spent $20,000 on the film, which became a local hit. What did you learn from that experience?
WP: There is a benefit to naïveté - you try everything and you're fearless. As an industry veteran, I think you still have to be fearless, even when you know that certain things may not work. You have (to remember) that you wouldn't be where you are if it wasn't for bucking trends and doing things in a nontraditional way.
I still have the philosophy that I have to attack this industry every day as if it's my first movie and I've got something to prove.
FC: With "Chocolate City," you tapped into an underserved audience that was hungry for films that spoke to their own experiences. Do you think the industry has changed its outlook on tailoring content for specific audiences?
WP: Being somebody who started off creating content for a niche audience, I was always feeling pressure from financiers, studios, distributors to bring the budgets down. But I understood how to get in under the hood and where to move the chips around in order to make (my films) palatable for a financier.
This is before people realized how big and fruitful my niche could be. I don't think anybody would say the urban - or new American mainstream - audience is some tiny niche now. Everybody knows that audience is a force to be reckoned with.
FC: Lately, your movies, like "Girls Trip" and your shows on OWN - which include the reality dating show "Ready to Love" and the family drama "Ambitions" - have focused on black women. You also acquired the popular black women's lifestyle site xoNecole. How do you identify content that appeals to this segment of the population?
WP: In today's environment of oversaturated content, if you're not making a movie for a specific somebody then you damn sure better be making it for everybody. But that's really, really hard to do.
So I think about (a specific) audience member. I think about what she does, what she likes, what she wants to see, what she hasn't seen and how she likes to see herself. I think about how I can make something that feels really specific and organic to her. And the stories usually evolve from that. "Girls Trip" was based on Essence magazine's annual music festival celebrating African-American culture and music. That was a real festival with real people, so it had a real texture to it.
FC: You are based out of Los Angeles and Atlanta, a major hub for black culture. Does having roots in Atlanta help your career?
WP: Living in Atlanta means I interact with my consumers daily. It gives me a leg up over my peers who don't leave the Hollywood bubble very often. The (2012) movie "Think Like a Man," which I produced and which was very successful, is based on Steve Harvey's book "Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man." I reached out to Steve before it was a New York Times best-seller.
I was dropping my girlfriend off at the hair salon when I noticed somebody with the book - it had been passed along to her, and there were two other people waiting to read it. I saw a demand (for the book) in a way that's not quantifiable, at least not in the ways that Hollywood usually thinks about intellectual property.
Ultimately, the book caught fire and multiple studios reached out to Steve. But to his credit, he said, "Will Packer was the first to talk to me about turning it into a movie."
FC: How has your role as a producer evolved since you founded your upstart production company, Rainforest Films, which you began while you were in college, to your current company, Will Packer Productions?
WP: I am what I like to call a "real" Hollywood producer. I've actually done every role on-set. I've held the boom. I've wrangled the cables. I understand physical production. So I'm not just an idea guy - I'm also somebody who understands the full 360-degree process of the execution of an idea. ... I pay
attention to the minutiae.

Resumen: Google's workplace culture and its apparently lax policies surrounding workplace relationships and potential abuses of power is once again under scrutiny, after a former employee published an intimate account of her alleged affair with the company's chief legal officer David Drummond. In November 2018, thousands of Google employees walked off their jobs for a day at the company's Mountain View headquarters, and at locations around the world, to protest how Google, and its parent company, Alphabet, responded to reports of sexual harassment in their workplaces. According to her account, she first became pregnant with his child in 2005, but later miscarried, before becoming pregnant again and giving birth to their son in 2007.

Texto completo: Google's workplace culture and its apparently lax policies surrounding workplace relationships and potential abuses of power is once again under scrutiny, after a former employee published an intimate account of her alleged affair with the company's chief legal officer David Drummond.
In a post on Medium earlier this week, Jennifer Blakely, a former senior contracts manager at Google, detailed her relationship with Drummond, her former boss, which she said began in 2004, while the Google executive was married, and ended in 2008, about a year after she gave birth to their son.
The relationship had previously come to light in a 2018 New York Times expose on sexual misconduct allegations against another Google executive, Android chief Andy Rubin, who reportedly received a $90 million departure package when he left the company in 2014. But Blakely's account reveals new details about her time at the company, and her contact with Drummond after their relationship ended.
"I believe a company's culture, it's behavioral patterns, start at the top," Blakely wrote. "Rarely do we hear about what happens to women after they are forced out of their jobs but I can tell you what happened to me."
Possibly more than any other major Silicon Valley company, Google has come under attack by former, and current employees in the era of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault.
In November 2018, thousands of Google employees walked off their jobs for a day at the company's Mountain View headquarters, and at locations around the world, to protest how Google, and its parent company, Alphabet, responded to reports of sexual harassment in their workplaces. By April of this year, some of the walkout's organizers claimed Google deliberately retaliated against them through means such as dissolving a company ethics council on artificial intelligence, and job demotions.
On Thursday, the group Google Walkout For Real Change threw its weight in support of Blakely.
"The powerful execs who enable this toxic culture here and throughout the industry wont' change on their own," the group tweeted. "The exec in this (Blakely's) story is now a board member of Google and was paid $47m last year while Jennifer was forced to sacrifice her career."
Google didn't respond to a request for comment about Blakely's post, or Drummond's status with the company.
However, Buzzfeed News published what is said was a statement it received from Drummond in which he acknowledged that he and Blakely "had a difficult break-up 10 years ago. I am far from perfect and regret my part in that."
Drummond went on to say that he "take(s) a very different view of what happened" between himself and Blakely. One of the issues Drummond disputed was Blakely saying that he had relationships with other Google employees.
"Other than Jennifer, I never started a relationship with anyone else who was working at Google or Alphabet," Drummond said. "Any suggestion otherwise is simply untrue."
Blakely said that when their affair began, Drummond was married, but "estranged" from his wife, and suggested that they have a child together. According to her account, she first became pregnant with his child in 2005, but later miscarried, before becoming pregnant again and giving birth to their son in 2007.
Though Google's policies did not allow managers to have personal relationships with employees who reported directly to them, Blakely claimed Drummond never notified people he worked for about their relationship. But "after our son was born, I received a call from HR notifying me that one of us would have to leave the legal department where David was now Chief Legal Officer;" she was then transferred to the sales department, despite having no experience, and left Google in 2008. Blakely then moved to Google's sales department despite having what she called "zero experience in sales."
Drummond, Blakely wrote, moved in with her and their son for a time, but abruptly ended their relationship in October 2008 and began an affair with another Google employee. The subsequent years, Blakely said, were consumed by a custody battle, with Drummond communicating with her and their child "exclusively on his own terms."
"Months or years would go by where he wouldn't see him or respond to my calls or texts with updates and pictures of him or even ask how he (their son) was doing, let alone how he might help out, knowing full well I was alone and in desperate need," Blakely said.
Blakely said she eventually won a custody agreement when their son was four-and-half years-old.

The truth about James Comey

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.
Comey wrote that Trump said the salacious story about prostitutes in a Russian hotel was “a complete fabrication and ‘fake news,’” and the president “said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.”
“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.

“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Texto completo: Una mujer lanzó este viernes un cóctel molotov en la recepción de una oficina del Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés) de Oakland Park, Florida . La bomba casera no funcionó y el incidente quedó en un susto y sin heridos, según Associated Press.
De acuerdo al informe que consultó la citada agencia de noticias, la mujer entró con una botella llena de gasolina y una mecha encendida . Sin embargo, al lanzarla la mecha se soltó y la botella no se encendió.
El personal de seguridad de la oficina esposó a la autora y la detuvo hasta que llegó el Servicio de Protección Federal y la arrestaron.
Las autoridades policiales dijeron que este ataque no está relacionado con otros perpetrados también contra agencias del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS). No obstante, no dijeron el nombre de la mujer ni qué la habría movido a enfrentarse a la institución.
The New York Times informó hace dos semanas de una investigación en proceso sobre unos disparos en una oficina texana del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE).
Estos ataques llegan en un momento de máxima tensión respecto a las restrictivas políticas migratorias que está proponiendo y empleando el presidente Donald Trump.
USCIS en concreto ha estado en el punto de mira en los últimos tiempos porque su director interino Ken Cuccinelli es partidario de las estrictas medidas migratorias del presidente. Bajo su supervisión, USCIS ha encabezado modificaciones como negar tarjetas de residencia a inmigrantes que hayan solicitado beneficios como Medicaid.

INDIA SAYS NO PLANS FOR WAR OVER KASHMIR

Texto completo: NEW DELHI - With tensions rising in the disputed Kashmir region, the Indian government said Friday that it had no intention of going to war with Pakistan and that any talk of a looming conflict was simply "fearmongering."
"The present narrative of the India-Pakistan situation by Pakistan, including the possibility of a war, is intended to project an alarmist situation," said Raveesh Kumar, an Indian government spokesman. "It is far removed from the reality on the ground."
India has come under increasing criticism for its decision in early August to revoke Kashmir's autonomy and lock down the area, arresting thousands and cutting off phone and internet service to millions.
Pakistan also claims parts of Kashmir, a mountainous region between India and Pakistan that has been racked by unrest for decades. Many people are worried that India's moves could further inflame the area, possibly even stoking a major conflict between the two archrivals, both of which have nuclear arms.
On Friday, Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister, said in an op-ed in The New York Times that "if the world does nothing to stop the Indian assault on Kashmir and its people, there will be consequences for the whole world as two nuclear-armed states get ever closer to a direct military confrontation."
India says Pakistan's strategy is to paint a dire picture of the situation, play up fears of nuclear war and scare the world into intervening in Kashmir, which India considers an internal matter.
Another U.S. soldier dies
An American soldier died during a combat operation on Thursday in Afghanistan, the Defense Department said, the third in just over a week.
The soldier, a member of the Army Special Forces, died in Zabul province, in the country's southeast, after disembarking a helicopter at the start of a joint mission with Afghan commandos, one department official said. The exact circumstances of his death remained unclear.
A statement from the Defense Department announcing the death did not provide any details.
The soldier's death comes as Taliban officials and State Department negotiators navigate the diplomatic details needed to finalize a plan for peace, one that is expected to include the withdrawal of American troops from the country.
The soldier's death brings the number of U.S. troops killed in combat so far this year to 15, the highest number of losses in a year since 2014, when the Pentagon announced the end of combat operations in Afghanistan.
Ex-PM sorry for tweet
A powerful storm has formed in the Atlantic, threatening Florida and parts of the Bahamas. But another formed on Twitter this week, after a former Canadian prime minister tweeted that she hoped Hurricane Dorian would strike President Donald Trump's Palm Beach, Fla., resort.
Forecasters are closely watching Dorian, which could potentially strike Florida early Tuesday as a Category 4 hurricane. But in a since-deleted tweet, former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell responded to news of the threat by saying, "I'm rooting for a direct hit on Mar a Lago!"
On Friday, Ms. Campbell deleted the original message about Mar-a-Lago taking a hit - two days after it was initially posted - and apologized "to all it offended."
"I sh[oul]d know better," she wrote. "Mea culpa."

Texto completo: A man must have all his weaknesses exposed before he can recognize his strengths.
The media are poised to deliver another election victory to President Donald Trump, because their constant bashing of the president turns off many Americans who are middle-of-the-road voters.
The problem with beating Trump relentlessly is that the excess involved makes even the most serious and legitimate criticism of the president and his policies seem like sport — something to indulge in for the mere enjoyment of it, but without any power to bring perspicacity and persuasion to the debate.
Consider the president's visit to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso following the mass shootings that happened in those cities.
I was pleased to see the New York Times carry the headline that read "Trump urges unity vs racism."
I thought that it was decent of the newspaper to put politics aside and focus instead on the unifying aspects of the presidential visit.
My approbation, however, was short-lived. Possibly owing to the intense backlash it received for the headline, the newspaper saw fit to change it to "Assailing hate but not guns."
This, I thought to myself, is not reflective of responsible journalism. Tergiversation is the art form of politicians, not newspapers.
A newspaper shouldn't change a headline because it comes under pressure. Instead, it should explicate the reasons for the headline.
In many instances, the idea of fake news itself is fake, but try telling that to the people who are nonbelievers in the media's honesty.
If Hillary Clinton ever had the chance of winning the presidency, the media spoiled it for her by being less than tough with her on issues and shielding her from proper criticism.
It is good for a candidate to get a thorough cleansing, to have all the issues aired out so that the defining ones become fully framed and do not suffer from distraction and devolution.
I watched the two recent Democratic debates with a fair degree of dismay.
For the most part, the candidates sailed through it without bruising, but that is not what independent voters want.
Immigration, border security, law enforcement, health care, violence in society, and trade cannot be wrapped in gratuitous, sentimental sound bites. However, that is precisely what the candidates seemed to bring to the debate.
I do not bend my feelings toward candidates because they speak of grand schemes like "free tuition for all" and "Medicare for all."
I want to know what mechanism will pay for these programs, and what class of citizens will form the axle and wheels of that mechanism.
I am not interested in any dialog that skirts the real issues and feeds instead on fancies and utopias.
It is the job of debate moderators to pull the candidates away from their comfort zones and talking points with tough and incisive questioning.
Except for two or three sharp exchanges, the debates were boring because the candidates were allowed to walk their political positions with insouciance, and without challenge or contradiction.
A man must have all his weaknesses exposed before he can recognize his strengths. To stand in the soft light of perfection is not to acknowledge the harsh light that falls naturally on all aspects of life and the world.
The man who stumbles and then regains his composure is more attractive politically than another who carefully avoids pitfalls with an unnatural and choreographed walk.
In politics, as in life, the facade of invincibility and flawlessness is easily penetrated by incipient truth and then quickly shattered by it.
Therefore, truth with blemish is a far better accoutrement of politics than disguise and dissimulation.

Texto completo: [Read Thursday's live briefing for updates on Hurricane Dorian.]
Even before Hurricane Dorian grazed Puerto Rico on Wednesday, some of the island's emergency preparation systems had already fallen short despite a scramble to ready residents for disaster.
Last year, federal and local emergency managers announced with fanfare that they had installed the first technologically advanced emergency alert siren downstream of the Guajataca Dam, the largest dam in western Puerto Rico.
At the time, television news crews clamored to record the new alert as the words "This is a test -- do not take action" bellowed through the lush green region. The system was seen as a big improvement for the vulnerable area, where hundreds of people live beside a dam that retains the largest water source for the western part of the island. The dam's spillway cracked during Hurricane Maria, sending emergency workers rushing door to door to get people out of their homes.
The solar-powered and satellite-activated system was to employ seven permanent sirens to announce dam-break warnings and mudslides for miles, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced in September 2018. But two years after Hurricane Maria forced the evacuation of the residents near the Guajataca Dam, the bulk of the $ 1.2 million in siren equipment is still sitting in storage on the island.
The reason: The Puerto Rican government still has not granted itself the permits required to install all the alerts.
FEMA, local emergency management officials, city leaders and even the company that FEMA paid to install the sirens cannot explain why the installation has taken so long. The delays have raised questions about Puerto Rico's hurricane response plan, even as a Category 1 hurricane barreled by the island this week.
"It is a very vulnerable area. The time the people there have to flee if there is a break is very minimal, because they are very close to the dam," said Vicente Valle, the public safety director in Isabela, where the dam is. "This is serious, very serious. Those sirens are vital."
LRAD Corporation, the San Diego company that sold the systems to Puerto Rico and delivered them this spring, said it had not gotten answers. The company's contract, which includes installation, has had to be extended three times, records show.
"We have been looking into the delay, and are very disappointed," said Richard S. Danforth, the company's chief executive.
Functioning sirens are vital in Puerto Rico, where even the smallest rainstorm can knock out electricity and cause mudslides. Many rural areas do not have cellphone service, and residents depend on the alarms to learn of evacuation orders. During Hurricane Maria in 2017, a family of four died in Toa Baja, about 60 miles east of Isabela, when city leaders opened the floodgates of a different dam. It was later revealed that the sirens had not functioned.
In a statement, FEMA said it was reviewing Puerto Rico's reimbursement for the sirens, which was managed by the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, known as PREMA.
"The only information provided by the applicant (PREMA) is that one acoustic alarm in the Dam was installed during the Emergency Period of Performance," the statement said. "FEMA is still reviewing the invoice submitted by the applicant for reimbursement."
Carlos Acevedo, the Puerto Rico emergency management commissioner, said three sirens had been installed. However, two of those are portable sirens and one was put up by LRAD at its own cost. The seven permanent sirens that Puerto Rico paid for are still in storage.
"They are not in danger," Mr. Acevedo said of the people nearby, adding that tests showed that the three sirens now in place were loud enough to reach all the area homes.
After an inquiry from The New York Times, Isabela's mayor, Carlos Delgado, said he checked with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which owns the dam. The agency said most of the sirens were still in storage because the electric company was waiting for another government agency to give permits to install the posts required.
"They said it was not in their hands, that it depended on other agencies," Mr. Delgado said. "It's too long a delay, but normal for Puerto Rico. Basically, it's bureaucracy."
A political crisis that gripped the island this summer created a bottleneck in many agencies, which seemed to stand still as Puerto Rico waited to find out who would run the island. The former governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, was widely criticized for his response to Hurricane Maria, and was forced out of office in July for that response and other reasons.
The new governor, Wanda Vázquez, told Puerto Ricans that the government was ready for a potential disaster.
"Agencies are working," she said in a news conference on Wednesday. "We are ready and prepared to respond."
But telecommunications workers in Puerto Rico said the Rosselló administration had never upgraded the 911 system, which collapsed during Maria, causing ambulance delays. It was among the reasons cited for the death toll of up to 3,000 people.
The government has not purchased the technology that would allow a 911 dispatcher to pinpoint a caller's location, and has not replaced the dozens of dispatchers who have quit and left the island since 2017, according to Aramis Cruz, president of the local Communications Workers of America union. The government did buy satellite phones for police, fire and ambulance stations, but Mr. Cruz said the 911 operators have yet to be given the numbers of those phones.
The 911 computer maps do not include many newer highways and subdivisions, Mr. Cruz said. If someone calls 911 from a development built in the last five years, he said, "I look at my computer, and it shows a mountain."
"We are improvising," Mr. Cruz said.
His boss disagreed.
"I don't understand why they are expressing that information, which is incorrect," the 911 commissioner, Yazmín González Morales, said.
Jenniffer M. Santos-Hernández, who researches disaster response at the University of Puerto Rico, said island leaders had failed in shoring up the emergency response preparation at the local level. Equipment is purchased, but often nobody knows how to use it, she said.
"You talk to community leaders and they say, 'I have a raft to evacuate people in a flood.' But they have a lot of aging, immobile people in their community. You look at them, look at the raft and think, 'not sure how this is going to happen."' She added that technology purchases had created a false sense of preparedness.
On Wednesday evening, Ms. Vázquez said that Hurricane Dorian had served as an "extraordinary exercise" in which agency chiefs, mayors and other government employees carried out hurricane preparedness plans.
"There is always room for improvement," she said. "Where there is need for improvement, we will improve."

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Maria Isabel Bueso was 7 years old when she came to the United States from Guatemala at the invitation of doctors who were conducting a clinical trial for the treatment of her rare, disfiguring genetic disease. The trial was short on participants, and thanks to her enrollment, it eventually led the Food and Drug Administration to approve a medication for the condition that has increased survival by more than a decade.
Now 24, Ms. Bueso, who had been told she likely would not live past adolescence, has participated in several medical studies. She has won awards for her advocacy on behalf of people with rare diseases, appearing before lawmakers in Washington and in Sacramento. Over the years, her parents have paid for the treatment that keeps her alive with private medical insurance.
But last week, Ms. Bueso received a letter from the United States government that told her she would face deportation if she did not leave the country within 33 days, an order described by her doctor, lawyer and mother as tantamount to a "death sentence."
Without any public announcement, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services eliminated a "deferred action" program this month that had allowed immigrants like Ms. Bueso to avoid deportation while they or their relatives were undergoing lifesaving medical treatment. The agency said that it received 1,000 deferred-action applications related to medical issues each year.
The policy change is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to revoke or modify procedures that have allowed certain immigrants to remain in the United States on humanitarian grounds. In addition to those with serious medical conditions, they included crime victims who have helped law enforcement with investigations and caretakers of sick children or relatives.
"I have been feeling super scared and overwhelmed," said Ms. Bueso, whose lower body is paralyzed from the disease, an enzyme disorder that inhibits cells from processing sugars. "The treatment that I receive keeps me alive."
Over the last two years, major changes to immigration policy have been made with little notification given to the federal workers charged with carrying them out, beginning with a travel ban imposed by President Trump in his first weeks in office, and the "zero tolerance" approach that led to family separations last summer.
A spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Services said requests for deferred action must now be made to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for removing people from the country.
But an ICE official said that the department had not been notified in advance about the change and questioned the agency's ability to assume that role.
Bryan Cox, a spokesman for ICE, said in a statement this week that the agency "reviews each case on its own merits and exercises appropriate discretion after reviewing all the facts involved," as it does for all requests for deferred action.
In letters reviewed by The New York Times, Ms. Bueso, her family and other deferred action applicants were told that requests would be considered only from people who are in the military, and that the authorities would "commence removal proceedings" against those who did not leave the country.
Martin Lawler, Ms. Bueso's lawyer in San Francisco, said he had been told "there is no appeal, and nobody has told us how to proceed."
Among others who could be forced to leave the country are children being treated for sickle-cell anemia, cancer and other illnesses.
Representative Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said Wednesday that she planned to call for a congressional oversight hearing on the matter after learning about 20 patients who had received denial letters for renewals.
"What's so troubling about this, beyond the cruelty of it, is the lack of transparency around the process," she said. "There was no public comment period, not even a public announcement of this, and so I'm working with my colleagues to get answers and to urge this administration to change course."
Every week for several years, Ms. Bueso has received intravenous infusions of the replacement enzyme that treats her disease, Mucopolysaccharidosis VI, or MPS-6, which causes dwarfism, clouded vision and spinal cord compression, among other abnormalities.
"Stopping this therapy will dramatically shorten her life span," said Paul Harmatz, the pediatric gastroenterologist who was involved in the original trial and has been treating Ms. Bueso since 2003 at the U.C.S.F. Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland, Calif.
The clinical trial had struggled to find patients, and without Ms. Bueso's participation, Dr. Harmatz said, it would not have taken place. The breakthrough that came from the trial has helped people with the disease live longer than 30 years, he said. Before the drug, they rarely survived past 20.
Across the country, doctors and immigration lawyers scrambled to understand the new policy and its consequences. In Miami, it meant possibly keeping an 8-year-old girl with nerve cancer from participating in an experimental treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Her father, who is in the country illegally, is the only parent available who can travel with her, said Tammy Fox-Isicoff, a Miami immigration lawyer who is representing the family.
Without deferred action, the man cannot legally drive or board an airplane from Miami to New York, where the girl must go each month for the treatment.
In a statement, Boston Medical Center, a research hospital in a city that is a hub for clinical trials and innovative treatments, said it was "deeply concerned" about the new policy and how it would affect its patients who are receiving treatment for "extremely serious medical conditions."
"We oppose any actions that could prevent people from accessing the health care they need," the hospital said.
Brent Renison, a lawyer who is representing an Indian woman who could be affected, said deferred action was "meant to allow for some discretion, to recognize cracks in the law that people fall into, and alleviate humanitarian situations and needless suffering."
It has been 16 years since Ms. Bueso began receiving weekly infusions of the approved drug, Naglazyme. She has built a productive life despite the crippling disease. Last year, she graduated summa cum laude from California State University, East Bay, where she worked with the school to start a scholarship for students with rare diseases.
Her family lives in a middle-class neighborhood in Concord, Calif., in a house her parents bought and renovated to accommodate their daughter's wheelchair. They did not expect to leave the country, having won permission to stay every time they applied for an extension.
When Mr. Lawler, the family's lawyer, told them about the government's decision last week, Ms. Bueso began to shake uncontrollably.
"We were crying with the nurses, doctors, everyone," her mother, Karla Bueso, said. "Without her treatment, it's like a death sentence. It has been hard to process."
Neither the drug nor the medical care that she requires is available in Guatemala. Without the drug, her health is expected to quickly deteriorate. Her breathing could become belabored; she could suffer cardiac arrest and become susceptible to infections.
"We have watched her grow up and mature, and become a responsible young adult, a leader advocating nationally," Dr. Harmatz said. "If you take it away, it will be a rapid return to her previous state. Death would be the outcome."

Texto completo: My favorite moment in Donald Trump’s trip to France came when our president was doing a little riff about North Korea and Kim Jong Un. Not only had he come to know Kim well, Trump told reporters, “the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she’d agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.”
Melania Trump has never met Kim Jong Un. Paging the cleanup crew.
“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim,” his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, explained. “And while the first lady hasn’t met him, the president feels like she’s gotten to know him too.”
Definitely the most creative explanation of the week for Stuff Trump Makes Up. Second prize may also go to Grisham, who tried to clear up her boss’s wildly meandering positions on China trade.
After going back-and-forth several times, the president was asked if he was having second thoughts (or third, or 18th ...) about the tariff war. He replied, “I have second thoughts about everything.”
Apparently not the message the White House was hoping to send.
“The president responded in the affirmative — because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher,” Grisham said. Desperate, but pretty darned good. So much better than what Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin came up with: “He has no second thoughts, no second thoughts.”
Trump’s long-and-kind-of-scary news conferences were just about the only news coming out of the meeting of major industrialized countries known as the Group of 7. Any attempt to come up with a united stand on climate change, Iran, trade, etc., was torpedoed by American intransigence. At the end there was just a pathetic one-page statement and an agreement to raise $22 million to help battle the Amazon rainforest fires.
Which the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, turned down imperiously. Before he appeared to be changing course. “Did I say that? Did I? Did Jair Bolsonaro speak?” he demanded of reporters. Guess how Trump and Bolsonaro get along. Great pals? Bingo.
If anything important came out of the G-7 meeting, it was probably further evidence that our president is ... getting worse.
We know, of course, that he makes things up and doesn’t try to correct himself even when the whole world knows he’s wrong. But he did seem even more befuddled and confused than usual.
His talks with reporters were a good example. He claimed he had personally gotten many important “high-level calls” from Chinese officials who wanted to “make a deal,” something the Chinese seemed to know nothing whatsoever about.
On this occasion Mnuchin, playing the part of translator, said something vague about how there had been some sort of “communication.” Too bad he wasn’t creative enough to tell the world that the Chinese and Trump had become so close they could exchange thoughts without having to pick up the telephone.
The meeting in France wasn’t the only recent exchange with world leaders that suggested Trump is suffering from something more worrisome than the lack of a coherent foreign policy. Back in April, after talking with NATO officials in Washington, he said that despite his complaints about Germany, he had “great respect” for the country from which his father emigrated. “My father is German ... born in a very wonderful place in Germany.”
Fred Trump was born in the Bronx. “To mental health professionals like me, the red flags are waving wildly,” wrote psychologist John Gartner.
The only time at the G-7 when Trump seemed very focused was when he got to the plans for next year’s meeting. It’s our turn to pick the location and set the agenda. The president told the international media that his “people” had already been looking for the best possible site and that they had determined it was — yes! — his Doral hotel in Florida.
“It’s right next to the airport. ... People are really liking it,” he said enthusiastically, going on to describe the Doral’s “tremendous acreage,” great views and extensive accommodations. He brought this up at two different news conferences. “And what we have also is Miami,” he concluded.
Donald Trump does not actually have Miami.
In response, reporters naturally asked whether it wasn’t a violation of the Constitution for the chief executive to receive valuables — like, say, a huge hotel contract — from foreign governments.
Trump complained he’d already lost “from $3 to 5 billion” by being president. “I did a lot of great jobs and great deals that I don’t do anymore,” he said. “I don’t want to do them because the deals I’m making are great deals for the country, and that’s to me, much more important.”
This was the appearance in which he used the word “deal” 58 times. We will not go into the evidence that when it comes to any business other than marketing his name as a celebrity reality show star, Trump has been a terrible failure.
So what do you think? Mental deterioration or just Trump as usual? No fair saying they’re both the same.

Texto completo: Hong Kong • Across the street that was about to become a battlefield, forces massed on each side tensely adjusted their gas masks, nervously fiddled with their weapons.
The riot police, with pistols at their hips, were ready with tear-gas grenade launchers and guns loaded with rubber bullets. Down the street, young pro-democracy protesters set up barriers to slow the police and stretched fishing line across the road to trip them.
Both sides wore helmets and gas masks, and both clutched sticks or truncheons. Then police charged, and a sedate neighborhood erupted into a fury of tear gas, flying rocks and Molotov cocktails.
The Hong Kong and Chinese governments have mishandled these protests from the beginning, and both sides are now escalating and becoming increasingly violent. That faceoff on the street was a microcosm of a larger standoff between China’s president, Xi Jinping, determined to impose his kind of order, and countless Hong Kongers, equally determined to breathe freely.
My heart is with the protesters. Hong Kongers are highly educated, and of course they deserve the right to choose their leaders. China under Xi has been nibbling away at Hong Kong’s autonomy, just as he has been ratcheting up repression at home — so it’s impossible not to be inspired by up to 2 million brave Hong Kongers marching to gain rights that are taken for granted in so much of the world.
When a small, skinny man in shorts and a tank top stood with his arms outstretched to try to protect protesters from a police officer pointing a gun at them — the scene of an unforgettable photo — how could we not be moved?
But I also feel a sense of foreboding. It’s probably only a matter of time before someone is killed, and that will unleash a new cycle of recrimination, escalation and violence. There are so many parallels to the Tiananmen student democracy movement that I covered in China 30 years ago — and I wonder if Beijing may ultimately deploy troops, perhaps from the paramilitary People’s Armed Police, to crush these protests as well.
As with the 1989 Tiananmen protests, these in Hong Kong are partly about democracy but also about economic frustrations. The average Hong Konger enjoys housing space of only 160 square feet, just a hair bigger than the average New York City parking space.
As in 1989, these protests snowballed because of government mishandling and arrogance. China’s hard line has also deeply antagonized Hong Kongers. Graffiti everywhere denounce “ChiNazi” influence, and people scold me when I refer to the population here with the old, familiar term of “Hong Kong Chinese.” No, people object: We’re not Chinese. Say “Hong Konger.”
Thus one of Xi’s legacies: He has tarnished the word “Chinese.”
Hong Kong’s police have sometimes been restrained, other times heavy handed, firing tear-gas grenades in ways that experts say are dangerous and excessive. Authorities are also accused of using more than 100 Chinese gangsters, known as triads, to do their dirty work and club and disperse protesters.
The Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, who has all the charisma of a fish in a tank in a Cantonese restaurant, is generally regarded as having bungled the affair from the beginning. Her next step may be to invoke emergency powers — akin to martial law — and crack down further on dissent; this may just backfire and inflame the protests.
On the other side, protesters have also escalated their tactics and become increasingly violent. More and more people — although still a tiny minority of the overall pool of protesters — hurl rocks or Molotov cocktails at police. Hong Kongers say they have absorbed the lesson that the government pays no attention to purely peaceful demonstrations. I believe the violence is a mistake that increases the risk of a crackdown, but the public frustration is so great that I found few people ready to condemn it.
One more eerie parallel with Tiananmen: Many protesters scoff at the possibility of a military crackdown.
“Western pressure will prevent a Tiananmen from happening here,” a 29-year-old man told me during a march the other day.
A young couple, Charles and Cindy, came out in matching helmets, gas masks and goggles to stand up for democracy, but they told me that Beijing would never use force to crush the protests.
“The free world will support Hong Kong,” Charles told me. And Cindy pointed to Hong Kong’s economic importance to China, adding, “We are still very valuable to them.”
True enough, and people often say that China will never kill the goose that lays golden eggs. But as Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, once dryly noted, that phrase came into existence only because “history is littered with the carcasses of decapitated geese.”
In the run-up to the massacres of 1989, idealistic protesters often told me that their cause was invincible. And then I watched tanks roll over righteousness.

Like bedbugs, rash of male fragility really bites

Texto completo: The world needs a safe space to house its growing population of extremely breakable men.
New York Times columnist Bret Stephens shattered to pieces because a university professor jokingly compared him to a bedbug. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he won't take millions of dollars the European Union has offered to help combat Amazon rainforest fires until French President Emmanuel Macron apologizes for past critical comments.
Male fragility seems rampant.
An editor at The New York Times was recently demoted in part because he responded to an author's correct criticism of his racially insensitive tweets by demanding the author apologize to him.
A sitting member of Congress, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, is suing Twitter and two parody accounts that regularly make fun of him, saying in the lawsuit that their tweets are something "no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life." One account pretends to be Nunes' mom and the other pretends to be a cow from Nunes' family farm. A cow!
And, of course, we have our super-not-at-all-insecure president, Donald Trump, who on Tuesday tweeted:
"They do stories so big on Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren's crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!"
That tweet resulted in a WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAmbulance being dispatched to the White House.
The most remarkable thing about most of these men and their Faberge-egg-like egos is they're often the first to gripe about the ills of "political correctness."
Take Mr. Stephens, a conservative columnist who has railed against "safe spaces," saying in a 2017 commencement address at Hampden-Sydney College that worrying about hurting other's feelings might lead to stifling all speech: "If we want to accommodate the sensitivities of our fellow students, shouldn't that accommodation extend not only to what we say around them, but also to what we say anywhere -- or what we allow to be said anywhere?"
He continued: "In the name of being 'safe,' the job security of professors and administrators has been put at increasing risk -- lest they espouse, teach or merely fail to denounce a point of view that contradicts the political certitudes of the moment."
Stephens apparently forgot those concerns when, following news there was an outbreak of bedbugs in the New York Times newsroom, David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, jokingly tweeted: "The bedbugs are a metaphor. The bedbugs are Bret Stephens."
Hardly anyone saw the tweet, as the professor at that point had few Twitter followers. But Stephens saw it -- and it hurt his feelings. So much so that he sent an email to Karpf and the university's provost, writing: "I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a 'bedbug' to my face."
Stephens was clearly trying to leverage his status as a Times columnist to get Karpf in trouble, all because he was mad the professor called him a bedbug. So much for Stephens' worries about "the job security of professors."
On Tuesday morning, I received an email from a reader calling me an "amoeba." I sent a tweet noting that "I'm not going to report him to his boss because it's only the 12th meanest thing someone has called me today. (It's 9:10 a.m.)."
Does that make me a tough guy? No way. If you Google "macho antonym," a picture of me should come up.
But male fragility isn't about toughness or a lack thereof. It's about insecurity.
I'm secure in the knowledge that I'm not an amoeba, so I don't feel the need to track down the person calling me one and exact professional revenge. If someone calls me a bedbug, I'm not going to tell that person to come "say it to my face" like an aggrieved 10-year-old at recess. (My apologies to any 10-year-olds I may have insulted with that comparison.)
And if I'm the president of the United States of America (God help us), I'm definitely not going to whine about a presidential hopeful's crowd sizes getting too much attention. Why? BECAUSE I'M THE DAMN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND I DON'T NEED TO DO THAT KIND OF THING!!
This isn't hard, fellas. Don't punch down, don't overreact, admit when you've made a mistake, listen to other people and learn from them and stop acting like you're the only one in the world whose feelings matter.
If someone is being threatening or repeatedly harassing you, take it seriously, of course. But a one-off insult? Or your own perception that people don't laud you enough? Please.
Fragile men are doing serious damage to the world, whether they know it or not. (They definitely don't know it, and if they did they wouldn't admit it.) And they're doing it while mocking others who, at the end of the day, just want to be treated fairly, regardless of their race, gender, faith or sexual orientation.
If you think being called a bedbug or getting mocked by a fake cow on Twitter or having your feelings hurt because people aren't saying enough nice things about you is bad, talk to a few women or people of color who have Twitter accounts. Talk to a few female newspaper columnists or sports reporters. Ask how many times each day they're called something many orders of magnitude worse than "a bedbug."
They aren't the ones demanding apologies for minor criticisms. They aren't tending to their egos before putting out fires.
It's men doing that. Fragile men. Men whose insecurities may be the death of us all.

Lamenting the last of Calhoun's sweet peaches

Texto completo: I suppose most of you -- and my editors -- would rather I focus on the big issues of the day than offer my absurd lamentations on the last of the Calhoun County peaches.
But I say screw it. I really couldn't give two figs. I love those white Tom Ringhausen peaches, dammit.
And we just finished the last of them, brought to me by two kindly retired Chicago police officers. They, too, are peach freaks. The rains and floods had washed away Tom's peach stand on the Illinois River. They found him in a tavern.
I paid them $35 for a half bushel and bought breakfast at Harvey's on 31st for their trouble. They're old-school coppers and didn't want to be identified.
"Put me in the paper?" he asked. "Hell no."
"In the paper? No way," she said.
Still, we had a good breakfast, and it was nice to be in the 11th Ward not wondering if I'd run into a short-shanked Daley.
Yet the peaches are gone now. There should still be some more growing on the trees down there, and I might drive down and get some. But now, today, without them, I'm a bit malevolent in my peachlessness.
If you're upset that I'm writing about my Calhoun County peach desires, do what others do, send an email, or tweet at me, calling me a (deleted) bedbug or whatever the insect of the week is now.
Or you may join the mob and say you wish I were (deleted) dead, my (deleted) sightless eyes staring into the (deleted) void from the (deleted) pike upon which my ripening (deleted) head is pinned.
Or hiss at me for ignoring that idiotic franchise chicken sandwich debate.
Yes, it's idiotic. If it's from a franchise, then it's crap and you know it. Crap is the base element in any franchise business model: crap consistency. The crap chicken, or burger, you get in Seattle is the same you'll eat at 96th and Commercial or on Long Island. Franchise chicken sandwiches? Please. It's all crap, my friends. Eat and enjoy.
You may also hate on me for being a (deleted) peach-eating Chicago Fire fan. We actually hate ourselves now.
I won't mock you in return. Insulting people on Twitter over their fruit of choice while wearing a fuzzy pink hat and a false identity, perhaps even a ridiculous cartoon head, is as common as nihilism.
And what is a peach, anyway, but a piece of fruit?
But this was a white peach from Tom Ringhausen's orchards in Calhoun County, Illinois, grown on the high limestone bluffs between the Illinois and Mississippi rivers.
We had a big basket on the kitchen counter, but the last of the peaches are gone. To eat them by hand without ruining yet another polo shirt, you've got to do the lean, the way you eat a good Italian beef sandwich or a succulent drenched goat meat taco from Birrieria Zaragoza on 48th and Pulaski. Those peaches are so sweet that your jawbones will crack from the sensation and joy.
My friend Jeff Carlin, the WGN radio producer and a baker of some renown, loves them, but says they're far too juicy to make a pie. That's what I like. A peach as large as a softball, ripe and firm and juicy. And for those about to accuse me of food porn, take your mind out of the gutter. Ringhausen peaches taste as pure as the voices of angels. I can no longer hear them sing.
There are other important topics, yes, but who cares now that the Ringhausen peaches are done?
The New York Times and angry left-leaning journalists everywhere (is there any other kind?) are upset that stupid stuff they post on Twitter may be quoted by President Donald Trump and his friends, and used against them to demonstrate their political bias.
Isn't that exactly what we do to politicians, plumbing their social media -- even old high school yearbooks -- hoping to unearth weapons against them in our woke-a-thon culture wars? And isn't that exactly what advocate groups on the left do to conservatives?
But that jabbering isn't a Ringhausen peach, is it? No. That's just a bunch of self-important people who once thought they'd grow up to become heroic iconoclasts but instead found they'd become Kemalists of the Washington Way, protecting the establishment. Now they seek to become a protected class.
Reporters quote politicians. But politicians can't quote us? What's next, Newspeak? Ah, but Newspeak is already here, isn't it?
Locally, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx wants to erase all pot convictions in a desperate grab for positive spin, given her bungling of the Jussie Smollett hate hoax case. I'd much rather that she vows she won't invoke the Fifth Amendment if questioned under oath by the special prosecutor.
But that is merely the dry, bitter fruits of what passes for Cook County justice. It is not a Ringhausen peach. Now that the white Ringhausen peaches are gone, I threatened them at work that I'd write a rhyming poem about them and touch my inner W.S. Merwin.
Instead, let me just say that Tom Ringhausen called with the bad news that the spring floods had washed out the bridges and roads down there, and growers had trouble bringing their produce to market.
He said some have lost 40 percent of their crop. That's devastating. And depressing. But he's a tough old jarhead Marine, determined to fight, and he will.
He's got to. Without those Tom Ringhausen peaches, what's a summer for?

Texto completo: The media are poised to deliver another election victory to Donald Trump, because their constant bashing of the president turns off many Americans who are middle-of-the-road voters.
The problem with beating Trump relentlessly is that the excess involved makes even the most serious and legitimate criticism of the president and his policies seem like sport, — something to indulge in for the mere enjoyment of it, but without any power to bring perspicacity and persuasion to the debate.
Consider the president's visit to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, following the mass shootings that happened in those cities.
I was pleased to see the New York Times carry the headline that read "Trump urges unity vs racism."
I thought that it was decent of the newspaper to put politics aside and focus instead on the unifying aspects of the presidential visit.
My approbation, however, was short-lived. Possibly owing to the intense backlash it received for the headline, the newspaper saw fit to change it to "Assailing hate but not guns."
This, I thought to myself, is not reflective of responsible journalism. Tergiversation is the art form of politicians, not newspapers.
A newspaper shouldn't change a headline because it comes under pressure. Instead, it should explicate the reasons for the headline.
In many instances, the idea of fake news itself is fake, but try telling that to the people who are non-believers in the media's honesty.
If Hillary Clinton ever had the chance of winning the presidency, the media spoiled it for her by being less than tough with her on issues and shielding her from proper criticism.
It is good for a candidate to get a thorough cleansing, to have all the issues aired out so that the defining ones become fully framed and do not suffer from distraction and devolution.
I watched the two recent Democratic debates with a fair degree of dismay.
For the most part, the candidates sailed through it without bruising, but that is not what independent voters want.
Immigration, border security, law enforcement, health care, violence in society, and trade cannot be wrapped in gratuitous, sentimental sound bites. However, that is precisely what the candidates seemed to bring to the debate.
I do not bend my feelings toward candidates because they speak of grand schemes like 'free tuition for all' and 'Medicare for all.'
I want to know what mechanism will pay for these programs, and what class of citizens will form the axle and wheels of that mechanism.
I am not interested in any dialog that skirts the real issues and feeds instead on fancies and utopias.
It is the job of debate moderators to pull the candidates away from their comfort zones and talking points with tough and incisive questioning.
Except for two or three sharp exchanges, the debates were boring because the candidates were allowed to walk their political positions with insouciance, and without challenge or contradiction.
A man must have all his weaknesses exposed before he can recognize his strengths. To stand in the soft light of perfection is not to acknowledge the harsh light that falls naturally on all aspects of life and the world.
The man who stumbles and then regains his composure is more attractive politically than another who carefully avoids pitfalls with an unnatural and choreographed walk.
In politics, as in life, the facade of invincibility and flawlessness is easily penetrated by incipient truth and then quickly shattered by it.
Therefore, truth with blemish is a far better accoutrement of politics than disguise and dissimulation.

Texto completo: What's on TV
ESCAPE ROOM (2019) 8:45 p.m. on Starz. The phenomenon of escape room games, where players pay to be locked in a room of puzzles, is mixed with the classic horror movie setup of strangers put in sinister circumstances in this thriller. The setup involves a group of players assembled for an escape-room challenge. The fact that the consequence for failure is death is a surprising revelation for the characters; given that this is a horror movie called "Escape Room," that information is likely to be less surprising for potential viewers. "There are intimations of 'Tales From the Crypt,' 'Final Destination,' 'The Game,' and other older, better films here," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The New York Times. "This movie never catches a fire like any of those did, and even its twist coda feels dreary and pro forma. But the movie is keeping me even further away from real-life escape rooms than I already had been."
POLTERGEIST (2015) 11:15 p.m. on FXM. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt star as a married couple fallen on hard times in this reimagined take on the 1982 horror classic. As in the old movie, the plot is anchored by a family, a haunted home and a creepy TV. "All in all there's not much to complain about here, except that -- as with a lot of revisited classics -- the story's not as revolutionary as you remember it," Neil Genzlinger wrote in his review for The Times. "For veterans of the 1982 'Poltergeist,' it's more like scary but pleasant nostalgia."
What's Streaming
OPERATION FINALE (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Ben Kingsley plays the high-ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann in this drama, which chronicles Eichmann's 1960 capture by Israeli secret agents. The operation involved agents traveling to South America, where Eichmann was in hiding, and bringing him to Israel. It's a slippery mission made more difficult by the fact that the agents were bringing with them their own memories of friends and family killed by the Germans. That emotional balancing act is principally portrayed here by Oscar Isaac, who stars opposite Kingsley as one of those Mossad agents. "The performances are as solid as the writing and direction," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "'Operation Finale' resembles a drama from the first golden age of television, back in the '50s," he added. "Its seriousness is more than a little square, and its tackling of weighty moral issues feels more conscientious than truly challenging."
IT (2017) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. It's late August, the first whiffs of fall are in the air and the killer clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) is cracking a wide grin over the horizon. With "It Chapter Two" hitting theaters next week, now is a good time to revisit the first installment of the story, adapted from the novel by Stephen King.

Biden campaign invites only black journalists to session with candidate

Texto completo: Joe Biden courted a small group of black reporters representing major news outlets, holding an exclusive, free-wheeling question-and-answer session with the journalists.
It is common practice for presidential candidates to grant interviews to outlets that serve a predominantly black audience or readership. But it is highly unusual for a campaign to select reporters themselves on the basis of their race.

For 90 minutes, Biden, 76, was peppered with questions from 10 black journalists who cover the campaign or broader race issues on Tuesday afternoon in Washington, D.C., ahead of his two-day swing of South Carolina, where African American Democrats comprise the majority of the primary electorate. Reporters in attendance included ABC News' Averi Harper and Rachel Scott, the Associated Press' Errin Haines and Juana Summers, the New York Times' Astead Herndon, Politico's Nolan McCaskill, the Washington Post's Vanessa Williams, and USA Today's Deborah Berry.
The discussion had initially been billed by the Biden team as a short, off-the-record conversation, but the former vice president waved the restrictions at the start, allowing himself to be quoted for more than an hour.
Biden's national press secretary Jamal Brown told the Washington Examiner his boss "wanted an opportunity to engage with reporters in detail on issues and concerns of most importance to voters."
"The roundtable was one in a series the campaign will do and is a critical way of reaching voters of all backgrounds," Brown said.
During the sit-down, Biden reiterated how he was the most electable candidate of the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential field, said institutional racism was "a white man's problem," and pushed for smaller debates going forward. He also followed many of his White House opponents in stating his preference for a woman or person of color as a running mate.
"People know me," the longtime senator for Delaware said, defending his record in the face of criticism from black rivals like California Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker. "After all this time, I think they have a sense of what my character is, who I am, warts and all.”
“I have never, ever, ever, in my entire life, had a circumstance where I have felt uncomfortable in the black community,” he added.
Biden's persistent front-runner status in early polling is boosted by his support from older African American Democrats, but as he himself said Tuesday, "that doesn’t mean it’ll stay that way.”
This week's minority outreach effort comes after Biden turned down an invitation to the National Association of Black Journalists' presidential forum, held last month in Miami. Biden sent staff, while Booker, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attended in person.
Tuesday's session is not the first time a Biden minority outreach initiative that was supposed to be private has spilled over into the public domain.
Politico reported this month that Latino leaders at the annual UnidosUS conference in the San Diego, California, grilled Biden on his "get in line" comments, made in reference to illegal immigration during the Detroit debates in July. A readout of the meeting distributed by the Biden camp described it as "a meaningful dialogue."

ICE NOW TO DECIDE ON SUSPENDING DEPORTATIONS OF SERIOUSLY ILL IMMIGRANTS: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency tasked with removing people from the country, will now begin reviewing requests to avoid deportation by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who are seriously ill or dealing with severe financial hardship, writes immigration reporter Anna Giaritelli.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is charged with reviewing requests for permission to immigrate, mailed letters to an unspecified number of people in mid-August informing them their "deferred action" — a decision by the agency or a judge to temporarily not deport them because they met medical or financial hardship criteria — would suddenly end in 33 days.
"USCIS field offices will no longer consider non-military requests for deferred action, to instead focus agency resources on faithfully administering our nation's lawful immigration system," a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services representative wrote in a statement to the Washington Examiner Tuesday.
All recipients, including those receiving life-saving medical treatments for illnesses such as cancer, would have to leave the United States by that time or risk being deported by ICE. The official said the program is not being shuttered but that current and potential recipients now need to apply with ICE for protections.
"I’d like to underscore that this does not mean the end of deferred action. Instead USCIS is deferring to ICE," the official wrote. "As deferred action is a type of prosecutorial discretion used to delay removal from the United States, USCIS will defer to the DHS component agency responsible for removing individuals from the United States to make most non-DACA, non-military deferred action determinations."
ICE is taking over the process because "deferred action is a law enforcement tool used to delay removal from the United States," the official added.
The change went into effect Aug. 7. It will affect those with pending renewal requests, as well as all new requests for the two-year protection. The only classes of people who will not be kicked off are those who served in the U.S. military or their family members.
Approximately 1,000 people apply each year for this type of medical or financial protection, though U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said "the majority of them" are not approved, making it difficult to know how many people will be affected by the change. Those who are granted deferred action also have access to Medicaid and can gain permission to legally work while in the country.

FEDERAL JUDGE PARTIALLY BLOCKS MISSOURI ABORTION BAN: A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked an eight-week abortion ban from taking effect in Missouri but will allow another part of the law to move forward that bans abortion on the basis of race, sex, or disability. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Mike Parsons, had been set to take effect Wednesday, but U.S. Western District of Missouri Senior Judge Howard Sachs, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, blocked the eight-week ban while the case is under litigation.
PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL IS TALKING MERGER WITH ALTRIA AS CIGARETTE DEMAND FALLS: Philip Morris International and Altria, formerly a single tobacco giant behind the iconic Marlboro cigarette, are discussing a multibillion dollar merger as demand for cigarettes falls and e-cigarette use rises. Altria has already invested $12.8 billion in Juul Labs, and the merger with Philip Morris International would be an all-stock merger. Company representatives said PMI and Altria are considering a 59%-41% split respectively.
PURDUE PHARMA REPORTEDLY PREPARED TO SETTLE 2,000 LAWSUITS FOR ABOUT $10B: In a secret meeting with Purdue lawyers, the Sackler family said it is prepared to settle some 2,000 lawsuits for at least $10 billion, according to two people who were part of the mediation. NBC News reported that in a Cleveland meeting with at least 10 state attorneys general, Richard Sackler, the de facto spokesman for the family, said that the company is willing to settle the suits that allege Purdue used deceptive marketing to sell Oxycontin. Purdue Pharma said to NBC News: "While Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals."
WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN DEMANDS EXPLANATION FOR ELDERS’ INJURIES IN EMERGENCY ADMISSIONS: About 20% of seniors admitted to emergency rooms had injuries resulting from abuse or neglect, according to a Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General report, and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal wants answers. Neal wrote to the Department of Justice and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asking what the agencies are doing to protect seniors in nursing facilities as well as to figure out how many similar cases go unreported.
NORTH CAROLINA ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SUING EIGHT E-CIGARETTE COMPANIES: Having already filed suit against Juul in May for marketing to kids, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein announced Tuesday he is suing eight other prominent e-cigarette manufacturers under the North Carolina Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices Act. “Our complaints allege that these eight e-cig companies are helping to fuel an epidemic of vaping among high school and middle school students,” Stein said. “One look at their marketing materials demonstrates just how egregious their sales tactics are – with flavors like cotton candy, gummy bear, unicorn, and graham cracker, they’re clearly targeting young people.”
FEDERAL COURT RULES IDAHO MUST PAY FOR INMATE’S GENDER REASSIGNMENT SURGERY: The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state must pay for the inmate Adree Edmo’s gender reassignment procedure. The Idaho State Correctional Institution has been providing hormone therapy that the court says is not enough. "Edmo testified that she feels 'depressed, embarrassed, [and] disgusted' by her male genitalia and that this is an 'everyday reoccurring thought,’” the court said. The court graphically described Edmo’s attempts to self-castrate and said that refusing to use taxpayer dollars on the surgery was a violation of the Eighth Amendment's protection from cruel and unusual punishment. Edmo is incarcerated for pleading guilty to sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy at a house party in 2012.
DIRECTOR OF NIH’S "ALL OF US" PROJECT TO CHANGE ROLES: Director of the NIH health research project "All of Us" Eric Dishman is stepping aside and embarking on a new role as chief innovation officer. He’ll spearhead new strategies to boost innovative research tools to accelerate the project, which aims to track health patterns of over a million people.

The real story about the rise from slavery

Resumen: Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government." In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history.

Texto completo: The New York Times has begun a major initiative, the "1619 Project," to observe the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe American history so that slavery and the contributions of black Americans explain who we are as a nation.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." She writes, "Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not be a democracy at all." There are several challenges one can make about Hannah-Jones’ article, but I’m going to focus on the article’s most serious error, namely that the nation’s founders intended for us to be a democracy. That error is shared by too many Americans. The word democracy appears nowhere in the two most fundamental founding documents of our nation — the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government."
The founders had utter contempt for democracy. James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10, that in a pure democracy "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, delegate Edmund Randolph said, "that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy."
The U.S. Constitution is replete with anti-majority rule, undemocratic provisions. One provision, heavily criticized, is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College so that in presidential elections, heavily populated states could not run roughshod over sparsely populated states. In order to amend the Constitution, it requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or two-thirds of state legislatures, to propose an amendment, and requires three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification.
In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history. The evidence: If black Americans were thought of as a nation with our own gross domestic product, we’d rank among the 20 wealthiest nations. It was a black American, Gen. Colin Powell, who headed the world’s mightiest military. A few black Americans are among the world’s wealthiest. Black Americans are among the world’s most famous personalities.
In 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner would have believed that such progress would be possible in less than a century and a half, if ever. As such, it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people. Just as importantly, it speaks to the greatness of a nation within which such progress was possible, progress that would have been impossible anywhere else. The challenge before us is how those gains can be extended to a large percentage of black people for whom they appear elusive.

Texto completo: STAMFORD — OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma has reportedly offered to settle, for a combined $10 billion to $12 billion, more than 2,000 lawsuits alleging deceptive marketing by the Stamford-based company and the Sackler family members who own the firm.
The New York Times reported Wednesday the settlement would also have the Sacklers give up ownership of Purdue Pharma.
A document outlining a tentative negotiated agreement, which was described to The New York Times, valued the family’s and company’s contributions at between $10 billion and $12 billion, including a $3 billion Sackler contribution.
In addition to their $3 billion cash payout, the Sacklers would sell another drug company they own, Mundipharma, and contribute an additional $1.5 billion from the proceeds, the Times reported.
The New York Times reported the bulk of the funds would come from restructuring the company under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing that would transform it from a private company into a “public beneficiary trust.”
It was not immediately clear, however, whether the proposal would resolve the dozens of lawsuits filed by Connecticut and nearly every other state.
The prospective deal was discussed by Purdue’s lawyers at an Aug. 20 meeting in Cleveland, with participants also including Purdue co-owner and defendant David Sackler and 10 state attorneys general, according to two unnamed sources cited by NBC News, which first reported the plan Tuesday. But neither Connecticut Attorney General William Tong nor any of his counterparts in other states confirmed the report — creating some uncertainty about whether the settlement offer applies only to the large body of lawsuits — the vast majority from cities and counties across the country — that have been been consolidated in federal court in Cleveland, or if it was also intended to include the state lawsuits that have not been made part of the Cleveland action.

After the NBC story was published, Tong’s office acknowledged that he was in Cleveland last week, although a representative declined to comment on whether he attended the meeting with Purdue.
“I can confirm that Attorney General Tong was in Cleveland last week as a member of the leadership committee of state attorneys general on the opioid crisis,” Elizabeth Benton, a spokeswoman for Tong, said in a statement. “Connecticut is continuing to aggressively pursue its case against Purdue and the Sacklers. Beyond that, we cannot comment on recent news reports.”
In its own statement, Purdue neither confirmed nor denied NBC’s reporting.
“While Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals,” the statement read. “The people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help now. Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome.”
More Information
Watch: Purdue Pharma co-owner Richard Sackler, a former CEO and president of the company, is questioned in videos newly released by ProPublica of his 2015 deposition in Kentucky’s then-lawsuit against the company.
A message left for a Sackler spokesperson was not immediately returned.
Earlier this year, an attorney for four of the Sackler defendants said that they wanted to reach a comprehensive “global settlement” with the plaintiffs. Tong has not ruled out such an outcome.
“Settlements are, by definition, a possibility in any case,” Tong said in a recent interview. “But our focus is on trial and holding wrongdoers responsible.”

Major verdict

The news of the purported settlement offer broke one day after a nine-figure verdict found one of the country’s largest pharmaceutical companies contributed to Oklahoma’s opioid crisis.
In the first state trial against one of the firms accused of propagating the use of addictive painkillers, an Oklahoma judge ruled Monday that Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries shared responsibility for the state’s epidemic of opioid abuse and ordered them to pay $572 million to help tackle the public health emergency.
For Purdue, which reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma in March, the verdict revealed the extent of the damages it could face if Connecticut’s complaint or any of the other cases against the firm were to proceed to trial.
“We continue to aggressively pursue our own case against Purdue Pharma and defendant members of the Sackler family,” Tong said in a statement Monday, in response to the Oklahoma decision. “The Oklahoma judgment does not impact our ongoing efforts to hold the addiction industry fully accountable for the opioid crisis and the pain and suffering it has caused here in Connecticut.”
While the decision represents only 3 percent of the $17 billion that Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter had sought for the state, it still represents a major blow for J&J and a de facto recognition of other plaintiffs’ claims.
“The award is substantial,” said Robert Bird, a professor of business law at the University of Connecticut. “While other states are not bound to follow it, this does not bode well for the company for lawsuits in other states.”
MDL plaintiffs’ attorneys lauded the verdict.
“This is a great ruling for the more than 2,000 communities (in the MDL proceedings) suing the opioid manufacturers, among other reasons because the (Oklahoma) judge found the epidemic to be a public nuisance caused by Johnson & Johnson,” said Paul Hanly, co-lead counsel for the MDL plaintiffs. “We are hopeful that (MDL) Judge (Dan) Polster and other judges around the country will study and follow this decision.”
J&J plans to appeal, having argued during the seven-week non-jury trial that scientific research supported its marketing claims and that its painkillers constituted a tiny percentage of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma.
Purdue’s settlement with Oklahoma precluded the state’s claims against the company from going to trial. The settlement funds supported the creation of an Oklahoma State University-run National Center for Wellness and Recovery in Tulsa, Okla.
In May, Oklahoma settled with another opioid maker, Teva, for $85 million.
No trials have started yet for any of the complaints that allege Purdue fueled the opioid crisis with fraudulent marketing of OxyContin, its top-selling drug. Purdue has uniformly denied those accusations.
The first of the MDL trials is scheduled to start Oct. 21.

Texto completo: The shock waves from Oklahoma's court victory over the pharmaceutical powerhouse Johnson & Johnson, which was ordered to fork over $572 million to staunch the state's opioid crisis, could impact Kentucky as the commonwealth fights a similar battle.
Kentucky is challenging opioid manufacturers and distributors in court over their effect on its own epidemic. Attorney General Andy Beshear has filed nine such lawsuits, including one against Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals.
In Oklahoma, a judge determined Johnson & Johnson was responsible for misleading marketing campaigns that promoted addictive opioids, with dangerous consequences. Johnson & Johnson's stable of products includes the opioid Duragesic.
"The Oklahoma verdict against Johnson & Johnson should be very encouraging to the citizens of Kentucky," Beshear said Tuesday. "It is the first verdict holding these opioid companies accountable for the devastation they have caused to our communities."
However, professor Richard Ausness of the University of Kentucky College of Law said the Oklahoma ruling won't necessarily give other states a better chance of succeeding with similar lawsuits in their respective court systems.
"I don't think a Kentucky court or any other court would feel they were bound in any way by the Oklahoma decision, especially since it's being appealed," he said. "You don't want to rely on a case that's overturned or reversed."
Ausness suggested the Oklahoma ruling is likely to help change the narrative surrounding drug companies' connection to the country's growing problem with opioid addiction, though.
Purdue Pharma, the company that makes OxyContin, has been the "poster child" for the opioid crisis in some ways, explained Ausness, a legal expert on product liability.
"Up until recently, Purdue was the bad guy. Everybody sued them, and they were sort of portrayed as the people who had created the demand for opioids," he said.
However, he suggested the Oklahoma case could embolden more plaintiffs to pursue cases not only against Purdue Pharma but also against Johnson & Johnson, as well as other businesses.
The $572 million judgment against Johnson & Johnson this week is intended to help fund efforts to quell the opioid crisis Oklahoma faces, although the payout is much smaller than the $17 billion payout the state sought, The New York Times reported.
An attorney for Johnson & Johnson said the ruling was "flawed" and indicated the company plans to appeal, noting, "You can't sue your way out of the opioid abuse crisis."
That may be true, but governments across the country are seeking help from the courts anyway, filing lawsuits focused on the growing problems with opioid addiction that are hurting their communities.
Kentucky's own lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary claims those firms promoted — and profited from — "deceptive marketing" that led doctors to write more opioid prescriptions for patients. That, in turn, increased the prevalence of related addictions and overdoses across the commonwealth, according to the state's complaint.
Beshear said Kentucky's case, which is in the discovery phase in McCracken Circuit Court, concerns the same conduct by Johnson & Johnson that Oklahoma cited in its lawsuit and pursues the same kind of "public nuisance" claim against the company. The commonwealth also is bringing additional Medicaid fraud and consumer protection claims against Johnson & Johnson.
"I believe that pursuing multiple claims gives us the potential for a larger verdict at trial," he told the Courier Journal.
Hundreds of lawsuits are still making their way through America's court system as Kentucky and other states grapple with troubling overdose deaths as well as skyrocketing expenses linked to opioid addiction.
Some legal challenges to pharmaceutical companies already have been resolved, though, with mixed results.
Both Oklahoma and Kentucky brought cases against Purdue Pharma, for example, that ultimately were settled.
In its 2015 settlement with Kentucky, Purdue Pharma agreed to pay the state $24 million. Oklahoma secured a much larger settlement with that company this year, though: $270 million.
Republican officials in Kentucky have questioned the size of the state's settlement with Purdue Pharma, which was authorized by former Attorney General Jack Conway just before Beshear took office, as well as whether the settlement helped Beshear avoid a potential conflict of interest.
Senate President Robert Stivers, for example, said in June 2017 that Conway settled the case for "pennies on the dollar" and noted that Beshear used to work for Stites and Harbison, a law firm that represented Purdue Pharma.
Beshear has said he was not involved in Kentucky's case against Purdue Pharma and had nothing to do with Conway's decision to settle. And Conway has said he considered the $24 million settlement to be fair, given various circumstances.
On Tuesday, Beshear said he couldn't comment on the Purdue Pharma case because he wasn't a part of that, although he did comment more generally on the process of seeking remuneration from opioid manufacturers and distributors.
"I will say that, as attorney general, I will ensure that anything that comes to resolution during my time will have a significant value that will be on par with what we've seen out of Oklahoma," he said.
Ausness, of UK, suggested the $572 million judgement against Johnson & Johnson in Oklahoma "could be a game changer psychologically" that ups the ante in terms of how much money governments will seek from the drug companies they sue.
"There is a gravitational pull. In other words, the price has gone up," he said. "I can see where the states would say: 'Well, if Oklahoma gets this amount, we ought to get that amount, too.'"
As for the difference in size between Kentucky's settlement with Purdue Pharma and Oklahoma's deal with the same company, Ausness noted that it was a different era. (Kentucky launched its case against Purdue Pharma in 2007.)
"Purdue was playing hardball back then," he said. "They're sort of on the ropes now."

Texto completo: CUYAHOGA FALLS, Ohio – Inside the pavilion, the biggest headlines in mainstream media – a possible recession, strained trade talks with China, the president's interest in buying an autonomous Danish territory – don't exist.
Even the reason for the evening's gathering – to mobilize suburban women who support President Donald Trump after suburban women helped turn the U.S. House blue in the midterms – struck some as a false premise.
"That's fake news," said Donna Lillo, 62.
Still, there has to be something Republicans can do to boost Trump's support among women, a voting bloc his campaign is trying to energize heading into 2020. Lillo, a retired veterinary technician, shook her head.
"Some people say they don't like his tweets. I like everything he says. He sounds like me, that's why I connect with him," she said.
Trump's promises to build a wall at the southern border with Mexico, the strong economy and his bluntness are what appeal to Lillo, who on Aug. 22 carried a souvenir: a pass from a Trump rally in Akron held three years ago to the day.
"I like that he's in for the fight. He's had a great life, he didn't need to do this," she said. "The fact that the left attacks us so much – they don't like him, but they don't like us. We're the deplorables."
For Ohio's "Women for Trump" meetup on Aug. 22 that drew more than 100, organizers chose Cuyahoga Falls, a suburb of Akron in Summit County, one of seven Ohio counties where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump in 2016 and where Democrats were able to flip a Statehouse seat by a razor-thin margin in the midterms.
It's also the kind of area where Trump and his allies are hoping to coax reluctant Trump-supporting women out of hiding.
"I think we should all wear them proudly, right?" Ohio Republican Party Chairman Jane Timken said at the event, urging the women to wear their red "Make America Great Again" hats.
The Trump Leadership Victory Initiative, an arm of the Trump campaign focused on training in voter registration, held "Women for Trump" events on the 99th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Trump's female surrogates, including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, fanned out across 13 battleground states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania.
In Ohio, the meeting drew local party officials and loyal supporters, who heard from Timken, the first woman to lead the state party, and Madison Gesiotto, an attorney, conservative commentator and Miss Ohio 2014 who is one of six national Women for Trump co-chairs.
Gesiotto, who emphasized economic gains under Trump and tax cuts impacting women with families, at one point urged everyone to text "EMPOWER" to 88022. Reaching for their phones, the entire room obliged.
Trump's campaign has good reason to target women. More than half of the white women who voted in 2016 voted for Trump, according to New York Times exit polling, demonstrating a key base of support that helped him win the White House. But an Aug. 19 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed 63% of college-educated white women and 49% of non-college educated white women will definitely or probably vote for a Democrat over Trump in 2020.
In Ohio, Trump's approval rating is underwater with women 41% to 54%, according to one of the latest Quinnipiac polls on the Buckeye State. Among white women, he has a 48% approval rating, with 47% disapproving of the job he's doing.
While Ohio didn't flip any congressional seats in the midterms, the state has nine pivot counties that voted twice for President Barack Obama and then for Trump. Those counties will be crucial to the 2020 election and serve as a bellwether for national attitudes about Trump – whose most loyal supporters aren't buying into the data showing Democrats gaining traction with women.
"I think the midterms were an anomaly. I think there was a lot of voter corruption," said Susan Platt, a 64-year-old teacher from outside Tiffin. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that millions of people have voted illegally.
"I'm not worried about this," Platt said. "He's got this."
David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the election is far from locked up.
"They know this is a big threat," he said. "Women in the suburbs who are voting for Democrats is the biggest trend in Ohio politics."
The crowd at the Aug. 22 event skewed toward white middle-aged women, with few women of color in attendance.
"He's not racist," said Jessica Harris, who is 63 and black. "The Democrats are trying to pull this race card and I'm sick of it. ... I think he's the right man for where we are right now, because we need a strong leader to fight against China. I drove all this way from Cleveland. I might be the only (black woman), but I don't care," she said. "I'm representing."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Representative Steve King of Iowa, who has a history of issuing racist remarks and demeaning insults about immigrants, seemingly joked on Tuesday about the Chinese government's mass detention and mistreatment of Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group.
"The Uighurs, the Muslims in China -- a million of them -- they're being put into camps, and they're taking their children away, and raising them, and then they're sterilizing the women," Mr. King, a Republican, said at a town hall-style meeting. He went on to explain the tactics of the Chinese government's cultural campaign against the Uighurs, telling constituents that Beijing had forced detainees to change their clothing and diet, "which includes trying to force the Muslims to eat pork."
"That's actually the only part of that that I agree with, is, everybody ought to eat pork," Mr. King, a Republican, said, drawing scattered chuckles from the room. "If we have a shortage of bacon you can't be happy."
Mr. King's comments, first reported by a local news website, Iowa Starting Line, were ostensibly meant to underscore the Chinese government's mistreatment of nearly two million Uighurs as part of a larger broadside. But in his aside, Mr. King, already under siege for his history of racist remarks, drew yet another unwelcome spotlight on himself while breathing new life into a worn Islamophobic riff mocking some Muslims for abstaining from pork.
[Here is a timeline of Steve King's racist remarks and divisive actions .]
Mr. King was assailed by both the left and right this month after a town hall-style meeting in which he questioned if there would "be any population of the world left" were it not for rape and incest. He made the comment while defending his opposition to exceptions for rape and incest in anti-abortion legislation. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called the remarks "bizarre" and reiterated her earlier call for Mr. King to resign.
With his comment on Tuesday, Mr. King returned to familiar territory. He told Breitbart last year in a radio interview that he did not want Muslims working at meatpacking plants in his district.
"I don't want people doing my pork that won't eat it, let alone hope I go to hell for eating pork chops," he said.
A week before that interview, he bemoaned on Twitter an article detailing how one of the world's largest competitive soccer tournaments for youth players announced it would refrain from serving pork at the tournament to accommodate Muslim players.
"No takin' bacon off our tables--ever!" he tweeted. "Sweden has capitulated to halal."
Mr. King, who is running for a 10th term, is facing his most serious primary race challenge in years. The challenger, State Senator Randy Feenstra, has gained traction with conservatives weary of Mr. King's penchant for making racist comments. Should Mr. King survive the primary, he is likely to face a bruising rematch against J. D. Scholten, the Democrat he beat in 2018 by about 10,000 votes.
Republicans have for years largely dodged Mr. King's comments while seeking out his endorsement as a presidential kingmaker in the crucial Iowa caucuses, even as he promoted white nationalists and neo-Nazis on Twitter and made outlandish and racist claims, including infamously stating that undocumented immigrants have "calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."
But party leaders drew a line this year after he made comments to The New York Times questioning why "white supremacist" was considered an offensive phrase. House Republican leaders removed Mr. King from his committee assignments in January, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Ms. Cheney suggested he should resign.

Texto completo: This week's ruling by an Oklahoma judge that Johnson & Johnson deceptively marketed its opioid painkillers and should pay $572 million in fines has given optimism to communities across the country that are seeking similar legal recourse from companies that they say contributed to the nation's ongoing crisis of drug addiction and overdoses.
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey -- who declined to comment Tuesday -- has filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma over its alleged role in deceptively marketing opioid painkillers to Maine doctors.
At the same time, Bangor, Portland, Lewiston, Waterville and several Maine counties are among roughly 2,000 local governments that have signed onto a separate federal lawsuit in Ohio against the makers, distributors and prescribers of opioid painkillers, including Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson.
[Bangor could join lawsuit against prescription opioid manufacturers]
A federal judge in Cleveland is due to start hearing arguments from two of those local governments, Ohio's Cuyahoga and Summit counties, in a trial starting Oct. 21.
Their lawsuit will rely, in part, on the argument that the defendants violated public nuisance laws by contributing to a major public health problem that could take decades to address.
After prescription painkillers became popular in the early 2000s, authorities eventually cracked down on their use, and they were replaced on the black market by heroin and strong synthetic opioids that are more likely to cause overdoses.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the crisis has killed more than 400,000 people across the country since 2000, including 47,000 in both 2017 and last year.
Attorneys in the Ohio lawsuit did not respond to requests for comment from the BDN but said in a statement that they were encouraged by the results from Oklahoma's lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, which relied on a similar legal strategy to theirs, according to the New York Times.

"While public nuisance laws differ in every state, this decision is a critical step forward," they said.
As part of Oklahoma's lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, it also reached settlements with Purdue Pharma and Teva Pharmaceuticals. The companies agreed to pay the state $270 million and $80 million, respectively.
Maine's lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, filed in Kennebec County Superior Court in June, alleges violations of the state's Unfair Trade Practices Act, not a public nuisance law violation.
One legal expert who has followed the case, Elizabeth C. Burch at the University of Georgia School of Law, cautioned against giving the Oklahoma decision too much weight when expecting what will come of those other lawsuits. She noted that the Oklahoma ruling is likely to be appealed and that a North Dakota judge previously threw out a similar state lawsuit.
"Sure, we'll see analogies, particularly to the public nuisance law, but nothing about the Oklahoma decision will be controlling," Burch said.
Even so, at least one Maine official, Bangor public health director Patty Hamilton, said she found the outcome of the Oklahoma lawsuit encouraging.
"You reflect on what's going on across the nation, wondering where that's going to lead us," Hamilton said. "My reaction is that it's nice to see there's been some recognition from the courts about the long-term implications of the behaviors of some of these companies."

Paul Krugman: Trump and The Art of the Fail

Texto completo: The “very stable genius” in the Oval Office is, in fact, extremely unstable, in word and deed. That’s not a psychological diagnosis, although you can make that case, too. It’s just a straightforward description of his behavior. And his instability is starting to have serious economic consequences.
To see what I mean about Trump’s behavior, just consider his moves on China trade over the past month, which have been so erratic that even those of us who follow this stuff professionally have been having a hard time keeping track.
First, Trump unexpectedly announced plans to greatly expand the range of Chinese goods subject to tariffs. Then he had his officials declare China a currency manipulator — which happens to be one of the few economic sins of which the Chinese are innocent. Then, perhaps fearing the political fallout from the higher prices of many consumer goods from China during the holiday season, which would result from the tariff hikes, he postponed — but didn’t cancel — them.
Wait, there’s more. China, predictably, responded to the new United States tariffs with new tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump, apparently enraged, declared that he would raise his tariffs even higher, and declared that he was ordering U.S. companies to wind down their business in China (which is not something he has the legal authority to do). But at the Group of 7 summit in Biarritz he suggested that he was having “second thoughts,” only to have the White House declare that he actually wished he had raised tariffs even more.
And we’re not quite done. On Monday, Trump said that the Chinese had called to indicate a desire to resume trade talks. But there was no confirmation from the Chinese, and Trump has been a notably unreliable narrator of what’s going on in international meetings. For example, he made the highly improbable claim that “World Leaders” (his capitalization) were asking him, “Why does the American media hate your Country so much?”
To repeat, all of this has happened just this month. Now imagine yourself as a business leader trying to make decisions amid this Trumpian chaos.
The truth is that protectionism gets something of an excessively bad rap. Tariffs are taxes on consumers, and they tend to make the economy poorer and less efficient. But even high tariffs don’t necessarily hurt employment, as long they’re stable and predictable: the jobs lost in industries that either rely on imported inputs or depend on access to foreign markets can be offset by job gains in industries that compete with imports.
History is, in fact, full of examples of economies that combined high tariffs with more or less full employment: America in the 1920s, Britain in the 1950s and more.
But unstable, unpredictable trade policy is very different. If your business depends on a smoothly functioning global economy, Trump’s tantrums suggest that you should postpone your investment plans; after all, you may be about to lose access to your export markets, your supply chain or both. It’s also, though, not a good time to invest in import-competing businesses; for all you know, Trump will eventually back down on his threats. So everything gets put on hold — and the economy suffers.
One question you might ask is why Trumpian trade uncertainty is looming so much larger now than it did during the administration’s first two years. Part of the answer, I think, is that until fairly recently most analysts expected the U.S.-China trade conflict to be resolved with minimal disruption. You may recall that after denouncing NAFTA as the worst trade deal ever made, Trump essentially surrendered and declared victory, settling for a new deal almost indistinguishable from the old one. Most economic newsletters I get predicted a similar outcome for the U.S. and China.
At the same time, the U.S. economy is slowing as the brief sugar high from the 2017 tax cut wears off. Another leader might engage in some self-reflection. Trump being Trump, he’s blaming others and lashing out. He has declared both Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, enemies. As it turns out, however, there’s nothing much he can do to bully the Fed, but the quirks of U.S. trade law do allow him to slap new tariffs on China.
Of course, Trump’s trade belligerence is itself contributing to the economic slowdown. So there’s an obvious possibility for a vicious circle. The economy weakens; a flailing Trump lashes out at China, and possibly others (Europe may be next); this further weakens the economy; and so on.
At that point you might expect an intervention from the grown-ups in the room — but there aren’t any. In any other administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, aka the Lego Batman guy, would be considered a ridiculous figure; these days, however, he’s as close as we get to a voice of economic rationality. But whenever he tries to talk sense, as he apparently did over the issue of Chinese currency manipulation, he gets overruled.
Protectionism is bad; erratic protectionism, imposed by an unstable leader with an insecure ego, is worse. But that’s what we’ll have as long as Trump remains in office.

Prequel, sequel, revival series: Will they ever end?

Texto completo: I guess I'm evolving. For a long, long time, I was inclined to dislike prequel, sequel, and revival series, simply because they are so often created to milk the financial potential of the source material. Generally, the sequel or prequel didn't need to be written; the story did not need to be told. But the show was made anyway, as a kind of fan service.
I have one title for you: “AfterMASH." And I have another: “The Carrie Diaries."
But it seems as though reboot fever isn't a fever anymore. It's just the way TV and the rest of pop culture operate now. Shows never really end; they just return to TV in different iterations, with no particular shame attached to them. That's the way it is, from the lousy shows to the good ones.
“Breaking Bad" is on my mind. One of the finest TV dramas of all time has spawned a beloved prequel series, “Better Call Saul," and, coming to Netflix on Oct. 11, a sequel movie called “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie."
The sequel movie, written and directed by “Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan, is about Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul) right after the events of the (supposed) series finale. Here's the Netflix summary: “In the wake of his dramatic escape from captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge some kind of future." There's no word yet on whether other “Breaking Bad" characters, including those played by Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, or Bryan Cranston, will appear in the movie. “All I can say, I think people will be really happy with what they see," Paul told The New York Times.
Meanwhile, a prequel series to another one of TV's best-ever dramas, “The Sopranos," is also on the way — in this case, to movie theaters. Called “The Many Saints of Newark," and set in the 1960s, it will be released in September 2020. And the “Downton Abbey" movie will be in theaters on Sept. 20.
Next thing you know, we'll be hearing about a sequel series to that other great modern drama series, “Mad Men," called “Sally!" or “Blankenship: The Early Years," or “Not Great, Bob: A Pete Campbell Mystery."
So I'm going to stop with the stink eye when I watch these revisitations. It's time for me to drop my bias. I hereby swear that I will no longer automatically look down on a show or movie sequel, prequel, or revival. And I will no longer presume that the end is really the end.

Woke mob tries to cancel Shawn Mendes for old ‘racist’ tweets

Texto completo: There are few celebrities in public life today less controversial than Shawn Mendes. The Canadian-born pop star radiates authenticity and kindness, largely stays out of politics, and is adored by tens of millions of fans.
Yet, while Mendes’s appearance may lead you to think otherwise, no person is perfect. And now, showing just how insane our culture is, an outrage mob has come for the singer.
As a huge fan myself, I was absolutely shocked when I saw Mendes forced into social media contrition on Friday night. In a lengthy public statement posted across his social media accounts, Mendes apologizing for some “racially insensitive” comments he posted on social media when he was younger, saying he “apologizes wholeheartedly” and “stands for complete inclusivity, equality, and love.”
Tweet
Even this wasn’t enough for some (rather unhinged) people online. The fact that #shawnmendesisoverparty actually widely circulated on Twitter reflects just how insane outrage culture has become.
TweetTweetTweetTweetTweetTweet
First off, unpacking some of these “racially insensitive” tweets shows this outrage for the overreaction it clearly is. In one instance, a teenaged Mendes posted this:
Tweet
Now, here’s what this is supposed to mean: “(something) >>>>” is an internet meme way of saying something is awesome. Mendes was clearly just trying to, in a typically crude teenage-boy type of way, to say that he found light-skinned African American women attractive.
Clumsy? Sure. Racist? Come on.
Some of the allegedly racist posts are more serious, like an Instagram comment (long since deleted), that used the N-word. It was not used in an intentionally derogatory context, but rather as slang to refer to a friend. Obviously, regardless, it is inappropriate, but it's a forgivable mistake made by many a teenage boy growing up in the age of rap music and racial progress. Seriously, get over it.
At some point, we as a society have to say that enough is enough, and abandon outrage culture for a culture of grace, growth, and forgiveness. Otherwise, we’ll all lose.
In a hilarious twist of fate, liberal journalists are starting to see the downside of the cancel culture they helped create. Conservative activists have dug up old inflammatory tweets from CNN journalists, the New York Times political editor, and other journalists at Trump-critical liberal outlets. The New York Times isn’t having it: In a Sunday story, they called these efforts “latest step in a long-running effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to undercut the influence of legitimate news reporting.”
Oh really? But when left-wing mobs do it, it’s just social justice in action, or something? Yeah, whatever.
Outrage mongers on all sides need to take a deep breath and calm down, or else they need to be canceled themselves.
People are imperfect, and social media documents these imperfections in a way previous generations never had to reckon with. We need a new standard, because woke purity tests that write people off for life on the basis of a few old offensive comments just aren’t reasonable or fair — as liberal journalists are now learning from their own foibles.
After all, if the mobs are targeting Shawn Mendes of all people, outrage culture has clearly gone too far.

Frank Bruni: A surprising path from Africa to the Ivy League

Texto completo: You’ve read a lot over the past year about kids who end up in the Ivy League because of their parents’ wealth and wiles, kids with obscene advantages. I’d like to introduce you to another kind of kid who landed there. Her name is Wadzanayi Mayiseni. She goes by Wadzi.
Before Wadzi, 19, arrived at Columbia University last month for a summer bridge program to prepare for her first year, she’d never been to the United States. She’d never left Africa. She’s from Zimbabwe, one of the poorest countries in the world, where her mother, who raised her without any help from her father, has been out of a steady job since Wadzi was 9.
When Wadzi was 12, she found out she had bone cancer, which meant not just chemotherapy but the amputation of most of her left leg. I asked her how, psychologically and emotionally, that changed her. She said it made her more determined.
“You’re not defined by the things that hold you back,” she told me. “You’re defined by how you rise above them.” She refused to be placed in classes for disabled children and later figured out how to get a scholarship to one of Zimbabwe’s most esteemed private high schools. Then she figured out how to translate that into the best college education possible.
She got help with that last part from the nonprofit United Student Achievers Program, which for two decades has identified disadvantaged high school students of enormous promise in Zimbabwe, coached them through applying to top-notch colleges outside of their country and steered them toward futures they never imagined.
And by “disadvantaged,” I mean students who in some cases grew up herding livestock and in other cases were strangers to computers. I mean orphans: Largely because of the AIDS epidemic, about a third of Zimbabwe’s USAP students have lost both parents. I met one such student, Getrude Makurumidze, last year; by the time she was 9, her mother, father and 6-month-old sister had died from complications related to AIDS. She then bounced among the members of her extended family who could afford at a given moment to keep her. She nonetheless went on to graduate from Bryn Mawr and is now in medical school at Georgetown University.
There are USAP programs in other developing countries. They not only provide students with the guidance necessary to apply to foreign colleges but also help with application fees and financial aid forms. Zimbabwe’s USAP was the model and remains the gold standard. It has sent more than 400 students abroad, mostly to the United States, where the schools they’ve attended include Stanford, Harvard, Yale, MIT, the University of Chicago, Duke, Pomona — you name it. Many went on to earn Ph.D.s. Many became physicians. Six won Rhodes scholarships.
That’s worth dwelling on for several reasons, starting with this one: Zimbabwe is the sort of place that President Donald Trump had in mind when he used a fecal epithet for poor, black and (to his thinking) worthless countries, but there is obviously great potential there, needing only to be recognized and nurtured. Countries don’t fall neatly into categories: good versus bad sources of immigrants. Reality is more complicated. Talent is universal.
For example, in another desperate part of Africa, Somaliland, there’s a remarkable school, Abaarso, that Jonathan Starr, an American philanthropist, opened in 2009. It educates children in Grades 7 through 12. Its alumni have been admitted to and received financial aid from Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown, MIT, Swarthmore.
Those institutions’ receptiveness is another reason I’m writing this. Yes, America’s richest colleges stay that way by giving special consideration to families with the means to make big donations. But they simultaneously use some of their wealth, if not quite enough, to educate students who cannot contribute a dime to their tuition.
Zimbabwe’s USAP is also the story of the difference that one person can make. It’s run by and was the brainchild of Rebecca Zeigler Mano, an American who married a Zimbabwean, moved to Zimbabwe and couldn’t just shrug off the country’s misery.
“There’s a big gap — a big chasm — between the talent that we have in Zimbabwe and the opportunities,” she said on the first of two occasions over the last 13 months when I spoke with her in New York. She returns frequently to America, in part to raise funds.
Her program has become so well-known and widely respected in Zimbabwe that every year she gets 700 to 800 applications for about 35 spots. “I like to tell Harvard that we are more competitive than they are,” she said. Many of the applicants are from remote rural areas; she tirelessly crisscrosses the country to interview them.
She also builds networks in the United States for the students who come here, so that they have places to go on school breaks — they can’t afford to fly home — and so that there are people to help with things like sheets and blankets. At the start, she didn’t factor in their entire array of needs and got reports that USAP students were sleeping on bare dormitory-room beds.
“She’s one of my life heroes,” said Bruce Wharton, who was the public-affairs officer in the U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe when USAP began. “I don’t know anybody who has done so much on an individual, personal level to make our world better.”
Her ambitions are expanding: She plans to open a USAP boarding school in Zimbabwe next year. Money permitting, it will give up to 50 Zimbabwean students their 11th- and 12th-grade educations, so that they’re in the best shape possible to thrive when they go to college abroad.
She told me that she also hoped that the school would give the kids a deeper investment in Zimbabwe. In her ideal scenario, they bring the knowledge that they’ve acquired in college back to a country with a shortage of leaders, of innovators, of hope.
Wadzi said that she could envision getting a medical degree in the United States, becoming a pediatric oncologist and then returning home to help children who confront medical scares like the one that she survived.
I asked her about her impressions of America so far. She mentioned a trip to see, up close, a world-famous landmark that was familiar from so many pictures: the Statue of Liberty.
“It was right in front of me,” she said. “I was awestruck.”
“You know the crown represents seven continents?” she added, referring to the spikes that radiate from it. She was transfixed by the fact that an icon so central to one country would allude to all the others; by the generosity of that symbolism; by its inclusiveness. “I remember really smiling,” she told me, “because I felt a part of that.”
She said that the tablet that Lady Liberty holds brought to mind studying, learning, growing. That, too, made her smile. “I’m here for an education,” she said. “And there’s a statue embodying what I’ve come for.”

Prequel, sequel, revival series: Will they ever end?

Texto completo: I guess I'm evolving. For a long, long time, I was inclined to dislike prequel, sequel, and revival series, simply because they are so often created to milk the financial potential of the source material. Generally, the sequel or prequel didn't need to be written; the story did not need to be told. But the show was made anyway, as a kind of fan service.
I have one title for you: “AfterMASH." And I have another: “The Carrie Diaries."
But it seems as though reboot fever isn't a fever anymore. It's just the way TV and the rest of pop culture operate now. Shows never really end; they just return to TV in different iterations, with no particular shame attached to them. That's the way it is, from the lousy shows to the good ones.
“Breaking Bad" is on my mind. One of the finest TV dramas of all time has spawned a beloved prequel series, “Better Call Saul," and, coming to Netflix on Oct. 11, a sequel movie called “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie."
The sequel movie, written and directed by “Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan, is about Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul) right after the events of the (supposed) series finale. Here's the Netflix summary: “In the wake of his dramatic escape from captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge some kind of future." There's no word yet on whether other “Breaking Bad" characters, including those played by Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, or Bryan Cranston, will appear in the movie. “All I can say, I think people will be really happy with what they see," Paul told The New York Times.
Meanwhile, a prequel series to another one of TV's best-ever dramas, “The Sopranos," is also on the way — in this case, to movie theaters. Called “The Many Saints of Newark," and set in the 1960s, it will be released in September 2020. And the “Downton Abbey" movie will be in theaters on Sept. 20.
Next thing you know, we'll be hearing about a sequel series to that other great modern drama series, “Mad Men," called “Sally!" or “Blankenship: The Early Years," or “Not Great, Bob: A Pete Campbell Mystery."
So I'm going to stop with the stink eye when I watch these revisitations. It's time for me to drop my bias. I hereby swear that I will no longer automatically look down on a show or movie sequel, prequel, or revival. And I will no longer presume that the end is really the end.

Trump's idea of buying Greenland is far from absurd

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is upset that Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called his interest in purchasing Greenland "absurd." Her dismissive response should have come as no surprise. In 1946, when President Harry Truman tried to purchase Greenland, Secretary of State James Byrnes wrote that the proposal "seemed to come as a shock" and an insult to Danish officials, who turned it down.
That was a big mistake. As part of his deal, Truman had offered to trade parts of the Point Barrow district of Alaska, including the rights to any oil discovered there, to Denmark, in exchange for parts of Greenland. The Danes dismissed the idea just as they did Trump's proposal. In 1967, the richest oil strike in U.S. history was made in the Point Barrow area. Bad move, Denmark! Sad!
With that blunder in their rearview mirror, you would think that Danish leaders would at least hear Trump out. The president's idea of buying Greenland is far from absurd. Today we have a military base in Greenland, so there is no need to buy it for that purpose. But Greenland has enormous unexplored stores of natural resources, including zinc, lead, gold, iron ore, diamonds, copper and uranium, that Denmark has been unable or unwilling to exploit.
It also has large, untapped stores of rare-earth elements, such as praseodymium or dysprosium, that are critical to the production of everything from electric cars to smartphones and lasers.
Today, the United States gets many of these rare-earth elements from China, which makes Americans dependent on Beijing. The Wall Street Journal reports that Beijing may cut off access to those minerals in its trade dispute with Washington, and China is also trying to corner the market for rare-earth elements in Greenland. Buying Greenland would put those strategically valuable minerals in U.S. hands.
But what makes Greenland particularly valuable to the United States is global warming. The unavoidable receding of Arctic sea ice will open a new sea route in the Arctic that can be used for both commercial and military vessels. In May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an address at the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Finland in which he pointed out that "steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade. This could potentially slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much as 20 days." He added that the emerging "Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st-century Suez and Panama canals."
He's right. A recent report in The New York Times notes that as sea ice melts and "Arctic routes become more direct, voyage times could fall to less than three weeks in some cases, making Arctic shipping potentially more attractive than the southern routes in coming decades."
The United States and its allies have a major interest in not allowing these Arctic sea lanes to fall under Russian or Chinese control. "Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a New South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?" Pompeo asked in Finland. Purchasing Greenland would help the United States to better secure these emerging strategic passageways.
In 1946, the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Truman that Greenland was "completely worthless to Denmark." Today, Denmark may not feel that way. But rather than getting offended, Copenhagen should entertain Trump's offer. After all, it would not be the first time Denmark sold the United States one of its overseas possessions. In 1916, it sold the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to President Woodrow Wilson. So, we've long ago established that parts of Denmark are for sale; there's no harm haggling over the price.
Indeed, a Greenland purchase would be in keeping with a long history of presidential land acquisitions. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana territory from France. In 1819, President James Monroe bought Florida from Spain. In 1854, President Franklin Pierce, in the Gadsden Purchase, bought part of New Mexico and Arizona from Mexico. In 1867, President Andrew Johnson bought Alaska from Russia. In 1898, President William McKinley bought the Philippines from Spain. And in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt rented the Panama Canal Zone from Panama and Guantanamo Bay from Cuba. If Denmark won't sell Greenland, maybe we can rent it!
On Monday, Trump tweeted a picture of a gleaming Trump high-rise amid small huts on the Greenland coast and declared, "I promise not to do this to Greenland!" But the idea of buying Greenland is no joke. It actually makes a lot of strategic and economic sense.

How to balance your back-to-school budget

Texto completo: I remember as I was growing up, I always thought school was free. I mean, I understood that private school costs money, but I went to public school, and I didn't think a whole lot about the expenses associated with it.
Now that I'm older, I realize how much parents actually spend on their kids when they go back to school. In fact, the National Retail Federation reports parents plan to spend $696 on back-to-school supplies this year. Isn't that crazy?
There are the obvious school supplies like notebooks, markers (my favorite!), and backpacks. And as a kid, I always needed new clothes and shoes. But there's not-so-obvious ones that nickel-and-dime you to death.
One of my coworkers told me that he had to buy football gear for his son that totaled $260. Understandably, it gave him a bit of sticker shock. There's nothing wrong with paying for this kind of thing if you have the money, but you still need to have a plan for how you're going to pay for it.
As the school year is gearing back up, it's important to make a list of things you need to budget for. So, think about these categories and come up with a dollar amount you plan to spend in each one:
School supplies
Uniforms
Sports equipment
Fall clothes and shoes
Meal plans
Fees for clubs, sports, band, and other extracurricular activities
I'd like to point out that this is a great time of year to teach your kids that money isn't in infinite supply. Teach them the value of working within a budget! They don't need the trendy name-brand shoes, or the flashy notebook that costs more. You're setting your kids up to win when they understand money can – and often does – run out.
Now, if you've already busted your back-to-school budget, here's what you can do:
Get your budget back on track. Where can you cut back this month to make up for the overspending? Is there anything lying around the house you can sell? Can you pick up some extra hours at work?
Plan for future school expenses. Once school is back in session, there will be other costs that come up. School pictures, yearbooks, field trips and more extracurricular activities are just around the corner. And now you know how to get ahead of them.
I know paying for all these school expenses can feel overwhelming, but if you plan ahead and pay with cash, you'll feel a lot better when September rolls around.

HOT DISH POLITICS

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren's visit to Minnesota last week drew thousands. Naturally her visit raises contrasts with Minnesota's own presidential candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
On issues like Medicare for All, Warren is no doubt to the left of Klobuchar, and thus warmer in the hearts of Minnesota's progressive activists.
But Klobuchar can answer that she can deliver what Democrats are really after -- victory over President Donald Trump. She's won Republican counties before. She has hewed to a more centrist line that will appeal to the suburbanites with whom Democrats made major gains in 2018 and need to keep. And she's from the region of the country where the election will likely be decided.
In other words, she's more "electable."
It's a compelling argument, and one that's also being made by the front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden
Here's the problem: It assumes that you know something about voter behavior, when in fact you aren't qualified to make that judgment -- because no one is, according to political scientist Jonathan Bernstein.
"There's simply no good way to know which candidate will do best in the general election," he wrote in the New York Times recently.
Instead, Bernstein continues, "People are likely to decide that the candidate they like for other reasons -- policies or personality or governing record or demographics -- is probably also the one apt to do best against Trump. In other words, voters and party actors acting as pundits are likely to fall into a version of the pundit's fallacy: the tendency to conclude that whatever they like is also what's really popular."
Democrats also are debating a related question: Should they nominate someone who can supercharge the base and bring out new and infrequent voters? This is a mobilization argument. Or, should they pick someone who can flip Obama-Trump voters, as many Dems managed to do in 2018? This is a persuasion argument.
Not surprisingly, party moderates are usually the ones who think persuasion is the way to go, while progressives want a mobilization candidate.
Here we turn to Yair Ghitza of Catalist, a data analytics firm that works for progressive causes: "It is clear that both mobilization and persuasion were critically important in [2018] in producing this scale of victory for Democrats. When it comes to turnout, the composition of the electorate roughly 'broke even' with 2016," he writes. In other words, Democrats were successful in bringing about an unusual occurrence: The demographic composition of the midterm electorate was similar to the 2016 presidential. That's mobilization.
But he also adds that "a large portion of gains came from people who voted in both elections, switching from supporting Trump in 2016 to supporting Democrats in 2018." That's persuasion.
When it comes down to it: Who knows?

Texto completo: Remember the controversy in 2012 when President Obama said, “If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”
In context, the president was trying to make the point that in addition to our own hard work, others contributed to whatever level of success we have attained. The president suggested no one achieves success on his or her own. Republicans took his words as just another indicator that Democrats want more government control over our lives and businesses.
The New York Times appears to have endorsed Obama’s view and gone a step further. The newspaper’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, recently called a staff meeting to announce “The 1619 Project,” named for the year the first African slaves were brought to Virginia. Someone recorded the session and leaked it to Slate, which published a transcript. The Washington Examiner reported on it.
“The goal of the 1619 Project,” says a statement from the newspaper “is to reframe American history.” More like rewrite it. This is the stuff of totalitarian regimes where the media serve as a propaganda organ for the state, in this case the surging left wing of the Democratic Party.
No more America beginning with the Declaration of Independence, The Federalist Papers and the Constitution. Africans had no say in these, though Jefferson’s brilliant line about all of us being created equal would resound nearly a century later in a Civil War that led to the freeing of slaves and the long road to achieving Jefferson’s noble statement.
Not satisfied with practicing what used to be called journalism, it appears the newspaper’s ultimate goal is to change what is taught in public schools so that children will no longer think highly of their country because of the “stain” of slavery, a stain that has been more than paid for in blood and federal programs, which have attempted to lift some descendants of slaves out of poverty. In many cases those programs have failed, poverty having many causes, but liberals continue to promote them because it seemingly makes them feel better about themselves.

The Examiner’s Byron York writes: “The basic thrust of the 1619 Project is that everything in American history is explained by slavery and race. The message is woven throughout the first publication of the project, an entire edition of the Times magazine.”
One excerpt reveals their drift: “If you want to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation.” Never mind that “brutal” capitalism has lifted more boats than any other economic system.
There’s much more. We are led to believe that America is evil, soulless, that those at the top have always exploited those at the bottom. There’s appears to be advocacy for bigger government, reparations and never-ending guilt for things we today had nothing to do with. Is this what we want to impose on our children?
The New York Times, despite Donald Trump’s criticism, carries influence with broadcast and cable networks like CNN and MSNBC, and these networks in turn can have a collective effect on the American psyche, particularly when there is no counterbalance.
No wonder private and home schools are growing at such a rapid pace. The National Home Education Research Institute projects that by next year the number of home schools will be 2.3 million, a major increase over recent years. According to the Department of Education, about 10 percent of children in grades K through 12 now attend private schools. If politicians allowed for school choice, the number would likely be higher.
The Times’ attempt to shape history to fit its own biases is not journalism. If public schools follow its lead, they will begin to resemble schools in countries where freedom is not the prevailing tenet and antithetical to what the Founders gave us. America’s greatness eventually led to the freeing of slaves and a chance at a better life for their descendants.

You, Too, Can Be Called a 'Thru-Hiker'

Texto completo: The doe and her fawn stood in a sunbathed clearing next to the trail. As we approached, the doe startled, leaping away into the underbrush, but the spotted fawn hesitated, uncertain. We crept forward, cooing with delight, until the fawn wobbled away into the trees, tripping over its own legs. So we continued our walk, alone with the rocks and the wildflowers and the hills, pleasantly surprised every time we glimpsed the Manhattan skyline in the distance.
It was our second and final day hiking the Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail from beginning to end, both a challenging and restorative interlude from the city. Perhaps because it was the height of spring, animal sightings were plentiful: We saw frogs and salamanders and a snake, turkeys, a fox and my hiking partner even startled a bear.
Hiking opportunities abound in New York, but little surpasses the satisfaction of completing a trail in its entirety, which can be accomplished in just a few days on the Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail. The approximately 23-mile, yellow-blazed trail spans almost the full length of two state parks, Harriman and Bear Mountain. Best of all, the southern trailhead is only around 30 miles from Manhattan and easily accessible by public transportation.
The terms "end-to-ender" or "thru-hiker" are normally reserved for those who complete long-distance trails like the Appalachian Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail, which are each more than 2,000 miles long. Although these are not easy feats, the popularity of thru-hiking has only grown, year after year. But attempting a thru-hike of the A.T. or the P.C.T. requires a significant amount of money, time, and familial and professional flexibility. I'd like to suggest that one can achieve a similar satisfaction thru-hiking shorter trails without quitting your job and putting everything you own into storage.
And, if thru-hiking has already captured your heart and imagination, hiking shorter trails is a good way to put your skills and gear to the test before embarking on anything longer.
The southern end of the Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail begins a short walk away from the train station in Suffern, N.Y., at the confluence of two interstates. As we began climbing upward, the drone of the highways hummed in our ears. We quickly gained the first viewpoint, a rocky outcropping overlooking rolling hills and winding roads.
We soon dropped down to a valley, and the sounds of civilization were replaced by the crunch of our feet against rocks and dried leaves. The southern half of the trail traverses a series of boulder fields, detritus carried by a glacier more than 20,000 years ago that wreaks havoc on knees and ankles. One of these perilous tracts is nicknamed "The Valley of Dry Bones." According to a New York Times article published when the trail was constructed in the 1920s by volunteers from New York's walking groups, a Fresh Air Club member who worked on the trail "ingeniously" made the route "as rocky as possible." Some of the individual boulders are large and distinctive enough -- more than 20 feet tall -- to have earned their own names, like "Grandma and Grandpa Rocks." Another rock cropping is called, succinctly, "Egg."
We stopped to lunch at Stone Memorial, the first of the three-sided stone shelters along the trail, and assessed our progress: six miles in under four hours. Hikers wanting a more leisurely, three-day trip could stop for the night here, on a hill above a rushing stream, but our destination was the Big Hill shelter, another five miles along the route. We stowed the remaining cheese, crackers and the mini jam jar, pulled on our packs and marched on.
Later that afternoon, the breeze that had dried the sweat from our necks and kept the black flies and mosquitoes at bay died down. Beneath the tree cover, the air became thick, and I swatted at the bugs around my face.
Just then, a darkening sky and a few cold drops announced a sudden downpour. We hastily donned rain jackets, but our socks and shoes were soon sodden, and the ground squelched with every step. The squall passed just a few minutes later, and the wet trees sparkled with sunlight. The bugs returned, but, I told myself, in fewer numbers.
We had the shelter to ourselves that weekday night and prepared thru-hiker standards -- a Knorr Pasta Side and Idahoan powdered potatoes -- over a backpacking stove. From our makeshift kitchen, we could see the bright lights of Manhattan.
The next morning, we climbed the Jackie Jones fire tower. From the enclosed viewing platform, we took in the 360-degree view of the Hudson Highlands while wind gusts rattled the window panes. From vantage points further along the trail, we could see the fire tower peeking out above the treetops, marking how far we had come.
The trail passes by an interest point labeled on the map as "ORAK ruins." Orak, research later revealed, was a mansion built in the early 20th century by a vice president of the company that made Karo syrup, which was presumably the source of both the man's fortune and the estate name. The buildings were only demolished in 1973, but the greenery crawling over the foundations lends it an aura of greater antiquity.
The northern half of the trail is punctuated by several steep, rocky scrambles that require judicious hand and foot placement. The most challenging of these is the ascent up Pyngyp Mountain, a climb of approximately 250 feet in less than a fifth of a mile. After hauling ourselves up the cliff face, we paused at the top to inhale water and snacks, taking in the view while hawks circled below.
The Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail briefly follows the 1779 Trail, the path taken by Revolutionary War soldiers and Brigadier General "Mad Anthony" Wayne on their way to the Battle of Stony Point. However, as the 1779 Trail was for practical purposes, it follows the path of least resistance, whereas the Suffern-Bear Mountain trail, a pleasure trail, is far more challenging. They quickly diverge.
Hikers worried that the trail might not be challenging enough can be reassured. The trail rarely follows a ridge line for long, which makes for frequent ups and downs. My GPS navigation app logged more than 5,000 feet of ascent. The trail also has the advantage of being relatively unpopulated, especially if you can come midweek. Over two days with nearly perfect weather, we saw just three people: one backpacker and two day hikers.
On the final descent we could make out, through the trees, the Hudson, the Bear Mountain Bridge and the cliffs of Anthony's Nose, part of the Hudson Highlands on the eastern side of the Hudson River. On tired legs and sore feet, we limped into Bear Mountain Inn and ordered two beers from the front desk. We carried them to the leather and log couches to drink as the air conditioning and the euphoria of finishing a good, hard hike washed over us.

Paul Krugman: From voodoo economics to evil eye economics

Texto completo: Almost four decades ago, then-candidate George H.W. Bush used the phrase “voodoo economic policy” to describe Ronald Reagan’s claim that cutting taxes for the rich would pay for itself. He was more prescient than he could have imagined.
For voodoo economics isn’t just a doctrine based on magical thinking. It’s the ultimate policy zombie, a belief that seemingly can’t be killed by evidence. It has failed every time its proponents have tried to put it into practice, but it just keeps shambling along. In fact, at this point it has eaten the brains of every significant figure in the Republican Party. Even Susan Collins, the least right-wing GOP senator (although that isn’t saying much), insisted that the 2017 tax cut would actually reduce the deficit.
During the 2016 campaign Donald Trump pretended to be different, claiming that he would actually raise taxes on the rich. Once in office, however, he immediately went full voodoo. In fact, he has taken magical thinking to a new level.
True, whenever tax cuts fail to produce the predicted miracle, their defenders come up with bizarre explanations for their failure.
My favorite until now came from Art Laffer, the original voodoo economist and recent recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Why did George W. Bush’s tax-cutting presidency end not with a boom, but with the worst economic slump since the Great Depression? According to Laffer, blame rests with Barack Obama, even though the recession began more than a year before Obama took office. You see, according to Laffer, everyone lost confidence upon realizing that Obama might win the 2008 election.
But Trump has gone one better. As it has become increasingly clear that the results of his tax cut were disappointing — recent data revisions have marked down estimates of both GDP and employment growth, to the point where it’s hard to see more than a brief sugar high from $2 trillion in borrowing — Trump has invented ever more creative ways to blame other people. In particular, he’s now claiming that the promised boom hasn’t arrived because his opponents are hexing the economy with bad thoughts: “The Democrats are trying to ‘will’ the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election.”
Can opposition politicians really cause a recession with negative thinking? This goes beyond voodoo economics; maybe we should call it evil-eye economics.
To be fair, the claim that Democrats are hexing his boom is a secondary theme in Trump’s ranting. Mostly he has been blaming the Federal Reserve for its “crazy” interest rate hikes. And the truth is that last year’s rate increases pretty clearly were a mistake.
But blaming the Fed for the tax cut’s fizzle won’t wash. For one thing, the Fed has actually raised rates less than in previous economic recoveries. Even more to the point, the Trump economic team was expecting Fed rate hikes when it made its extravagantly optimistic forecasts. Administration projections from a year ago envisioned 2019 interest rates substantially higher than what we’re actually seeing.
Put it this way: The Trump tax cut was supposed to create a boom so powerful that it would not only withstand modest Fed rate hikes, but actually require such hikes to prevent inflationary overheating. You don’t get to turn around and claim betrayal when the Fed does exactly what you expected it to do.
Aside from blaming everyone but himself, however, how will Trump deal with the failure of his economic promises? He has taken to demanding that the Fed roll the printing presses, slashing interest rates and buying bonds — the actions it normally takes in the face of a serious recession — even as he claims that the economy remains strong, and unemployment is in fact near a historic low.
As many people have noted, these are exactly the actions Republicans, including Trump, denounced as “currency debasement” when unemployment was far higher than it is today and the economy desperately needed a boost.
Since the Fed is unlikely to oblige, what else might Trump do? Officials have floated, then retracted, the idea of a cut in payroll taxes — that is, a tax break for ordinary workers, rather than the corporations and wealthy individuals who mainly benefited from the 2017 tax cut. But such action seems unlikely, among other things because top administration officials denounced this policy idea when Obama proposed it.
Trump has also suggested using executive authority to reduce taxes on capital gains (which are overwhelmingly paid by the wealthy). This move would have the distinction of being both ineffectual and illegal.
What about calling off the trade war that has been depressing business investment? This seems unlikely, because protectionism is right up there with racism as a core Trump value. And merely postponing tariffs might not help, since it wouldn’t resolve the uncertainty that may be the trade war’s biggest cost.
The truth is that Trump doesn’t have a Plan B, and probably can’t come up with one. On the other hand, he might not have to. Who needs competent policy when you’re the chosen one and the king of Israel?

Texto completo: The next recession – whenever that is – will be run-of-the-mill, economists expect. But for many people, their only or closest experience of a downturn was one for the record books: the Great Recession of 2007-2009.
That one lasted 18 months, longer than any other since World War II, and massive job losses occurred years after the recession technically ended. It was characterized by foreclosures and long-term unemployment. Its aftermath is still felt today.
But that was atypical, and economists expect the next recession to be less severe and shorter because household debt is in better shape and banks are on solid footing.
While the economy is flashing some signs of trouble, we aren't known to be in a recession yet. We wouldn't know anyway because they are declared retroactively by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Some economists, though, think one could hit in 2020.
If so, what can you expect?
Based on news headlines and clippings from the four recessions before the downturn of 2007-2009, here's what an average recession looks like on the ground.
Student debt victory dance: This woman paid off over $222K in student debt. This is how she did it.
Worried about stocks?With recession fears rising, here's how to find stability when Wall Street has you on edge
Say goodbye to jobs
Even in the mildest recessions, when job losses happen, it’s “devastating” to any individual affected, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
Others lose hours, raises and bonuses. Those not directly affected may know people who lost jobs, either family, friends or colleagues. There’s a ripple effect.
“It may not be devastating,” Zandi says, “but it’s terribly uncomfortable. ”
Take the 1991 recession and its impact in the Bronx, as chronicled by then-Newsday reporter Gail Collins, now an op-ed columnist for the New York Times. The downturn came in “like a flash flood. Everybody feels it,” she wrote.
In the article, Collins talked to a guy – Jeremy – who offered to pump gas at a self-service station in the New York City borough for tips. He once had a job, working at Roy Rogers, but he got laid off.
An owner of a nearby children’s clothing store thought about shuttering his store, according to the article.
"This is going to be my last year. I can't hold on," the store owner said then. "Nobody has any money," his clerk said.
Tightening belts
When a downturn hits, Americans also pinch their pennies. Spending on travel, entertainment and eating out are cut down.
A 1982 article from the United Press International noted that the recession then was hurting rock concerts and record sales at the time.
A Dallas promoter even blamed the break-up of The Doobie Brothers, who were then on their final national tour, on the recession. He noted that the group wouldn’t have separated “if the money was rolling in like it used to,” the article said.
Americans even abandoned doing their own car repairs to save money during the double-dip recession of the early 1980s, according to a 1982 UPI article.
''We're seeing a lot of people not doing anything,'' a spokesman with the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association said at the time. ''It's the drive it till it stops syndrome. ''
Family life during recessions
Even the kids aren’t spared.
A 1982 Associated Press article described how Jane Heim, who wrote letters to children from Santa Claus, had to choose her words carefully that year because of the recession.
"I have to tell them they may not get all the toys they are asking for," she said. "Because of unemployment and the poor economy as a whole, we expect many parents to enclose a note saying they won't be able to buy their children gifts they really want. This makes a very delicate situation, and it must be handled with kindness, tact and understanding. "
A Washington Post article from 1991 asked teenagers how the recession was affecting them: Lower allowances, a lack of summer jobs and fewer big-ticket Christmas gifts was what they said.
Silver linings
Many individuals turn their recession woes into opportunity.
In 2001, USA TODAY reported that Andrea Papa, a single mother who had been laid off from her job of 20 years, turned around and started her own media and marketing business. Another perk: She greeted her son when he got home from school.
"People have been telling me for years to do this, but as a single parent, I always said, 'No. ' Then the decision was made for me," Papa said then. "When I was laid off, one door was closed, but there is a myriad of other doors to choose from. "
Another 1991 article from The Advertiser in Australia found that the downturn there was boosting people’s sex lives.
“Sales of erotic lingerie and sex aids are booming, as couples spend time at home enjoying each other's company,” the article said.
Even in a recession, there’s always a silver lining.

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

Texto completo: Rick Gates, the right-hand man to President Trump's former campaign chairman, returned to the witness stand Thursday, testifying in the trial of prominent Washington lawyer Gregory B. Craig.
Gates - who previously served as the government's star witness against his former business partner Paul Manafort - testified about his interactions with Craig in their work on behalf of the Ukrainian government.
Federal prosecutors accuse Craig of lying to Justice Department officials who were investigating whether Craig should have registered as a foreign agent for work he did in coordination with Gates and Manafort, a former political adviser to Ukraine's president at the time.
Craig, 74, a former Obama White House counsel, has pleaded not guilty to one count of making false statements, and his attorneys say he is being unfairly prosecuted for actions that at the time did not appear to fall under the requirements of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
The law requires Americans to publicly register when they are paid to influence U.S. policy for foreign governments. The key question for jurors is not whether Craig was required to register, but whether he lied to federal investigators about alleged public relations work on behalf of Ukraine that would have triggered the registration requirement.
In federal court in Washington on Thursday, Gates testified that Craig was an integral part of his team's public relations strategy for enhancing Ukraine's reputation, and that Craig initiated a briefing with a handpicked New York Times reporter at the direction of Ukraine.
But Craig's attorneys painted Gates as untrustworthy, as he acknowledged in court that he lied on his tax returns and to federal investigators, deceived his former business partner and circumvented Craig's orders. The admissions echoed Gates's testimony in federal court in Alexandria in Manafort's trial that ended with Manafort's conviction for bank and tax fraud.
Gates's credibility is a test of the government's case against Craig - and critical to Gates's future. He is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy and lying to the FBI as part of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
He faces a sentence of 57 to 71 months, according to federal guidelines, and has been a cooperating witness in hopes of receiving a lesser term.
Gates, 47, said he has been largely unemployed since his indictment, and he mostly appeared relaxed during more than four hours on the witness stand as he told jurors that he has met with federal investigators more than 40 times in the past two years. He will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the same judge presiding over Craig's trial.
Craig was the first prominent Democratic figure to be charged in Mueller's investigation, and the case against him centers on work he did at his former law firm - Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. He was hired to produce an independent report in 2012 for Manafort client Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian president at the time.
The report was to determine whether the trial and incarceration of Yanukovych's political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, was a fair proceeding, with the report part of a broader campaign by the Ukrainian government to win favor in the West. The report largely concluded that Tymoshenko's trial was fair but was critical in some measures.
The nature and extent of Craig's involvement in promoting the report with journalists is central to the government's case.
Prosecutors argue that Craig didn't want to register as a foreign agent because it would undermine the perceived independence of the report that Skadden was paid more than $4 million to produce and might tarnish Craig's reputation and future prospects for political roles. The government says Craig intentionally concealed from Justice Department officials that he had a hand in trying to influence journalists and to publicize the report's findings on behalf of leadership in Ukraine.
Craig's attorneys have insisted his interactions with journalists did not represent advocacy for Ukraine coordinated with the government, but rather efforts to correct the record about the report.
Gates testified Thursday that Craig twice suggested sharing an advanced copy of the report with New York Times reporter David Sanger - initially at a meeting with Gates and Manafort at Craig's D.C. law office and then in September 2012 at a meeting at the Harvard Club in New York attended by Gates and Manafort. Craig said they could count on Sanger for a tough but credible article "that would help with our PR strategy," Gates testified.
"Did you expect the on-record interview to be a glowing endorsement?" asked prosecutor Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez.
"No, we did not," Gates said.
The prosecutor noted that Craig is quoted in the Times article published on Dec. 12, 2012, before the report was officially released, with the headline: "Failings Found in Trial of Ukrainian Ex-Premier."
"Had he been asked to do so on Ukraine's behalf?" the prosecutor asked.
"Yes," Gates answered.
Craig's attorney Paula M. Junghans presented Gates with copies of his media rollout plans that included a line about Skadden Arps's concerns about participating in public relations. She portrayed the strategy involving Craig as speculative rather than based in reality.
Although Craig mentioned Sanger as a go-to, she noted - and Gates confirmed - that the memo says, the law firm "cannot proactively lead in communications given their restrictions by FARA registration and disclosure," a reference to the act.
Gates acknowledged under questioning that "there was reluctance on Mr. Craig's part to take on a lot of the actions we outlined."

NRA legal team sees shake-up amid strife

Texto completo: The National Rifle Association shook up its legal team Thursday and severed ties with its longtime outside counsel, intensifying a civil war that has upended the influential gun rights lobby.
The group ended its relationship with prominent Washington attorney Charles Cooper, while another outside counsel, Michael Volkov, resigned, according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.
The moves follow an extensive NRA inquiry into efforts to oust chief executive Wayne LaPierre, according to two NRA officials involved in the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly.
The departures, which were first reported by the New York Times, come as LaPierre has been working with another NRA outside counsel, William Brewer, to fend off allegations of financial mismanagement.
In a statement, LaPierre said the lawyers who left were part a broad effort to push him out that he claims was led by the NRA's then-president, Oliver North, in coordination with the group's former ad agency.
"It disturbs me that the NRA's supposed 'friends' - a man I personally recruited to be president of the NRA, our trusted ad agency of four decades, a couple of our attorneys, and a chief lieutenant - would engage in this obviously premeditated extortion scheme to harm our association," LaPierre said.
Carolyn Meadows, the NRA's current president, said in a statement there has been a "malicious smear campaign against the NRA and our leaders."
"Kernels of 'truth' were stripped of context, wrapped in lies, and peddled to the media and unsuspecting audiences," she said.
An attorney for North declined to comment. Before he was ousted in April, North had warned in two internal letters that Brewer's firm was reaping "extraordinary" legal fees that were draining the NRA coffers, a claim that NRA officials have said is inaccurate.
Cooper, who has represented the NRA for the past three decades, said in a statement that throughout that time he "adhered to the highest standards of professionalism and loyalty."
He said his allegiance was to the nonprofit group, "not to any individual officers or directors of the organization."
"At every turn, I have advised my client as to my best judgment of the steps that should be taken to advance and protect the best interest of the NRA itself," Cooper added, declining to comment further.
Volkov, who was retained in 2018, confirmed that he resigned but declined to comment further, citing "ethical restrictions."

Bernie Sanders' new, special carve out for unions undermines the case for his socialized healthcare plan

Texto completo: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposal to move all Americans to a single government plan has had an ongoing problem with a constituency that should be among his core supporters: organized labor.
The issue is that like most other Americans, union workers like their current plans and want to keep them. As healthcare costs have risen over time, unions have negotiated collective bargaining agreements in which they accepted lower salary increases in exchange for more generous health coverage. Now, the Sanders plan would require taking them away, and they are not happy about it.
Sanders appeared at a labor town hall event on Monday and drew some heat on the issue. Now, the Washington Post reports that he has made a change to his plan:
Under Sanders’s new wrinkle, those unions could renegotiate their contracts under the supervision of the National Labor Relations Board. 'Unions will still be able to negotiate for and provide wrap-around services and other coverage not duplicative of the benefits established under Medicare-for-all,' the plan now says, a seeming acknowledgment of a role for private coverage by a campaign that has railed against others for not taking a hard-enough stance against such plans.
On the surface, the change does not appear to do much to alter the plan. After all, under the legislation as it existed before the change, employers were still theoretically free to offer coverage that did not offer any of the same benefits that were in the new government plan. However, the issue has always been that because Sanders promises that the government plan will cover such a wide array of benefits (listed here), in reality it effectively outlaws private coverage. Sanders often likes to say that his plan would allow for coverage of cosmetic surgery, but as Margot Sanger-Katz helpfully detailed over at the New York Times, cosmetic surgery insurance does not actually exist.
That said, the article also cites a Sanders adviser as saying that the change "is meant to guarantee that any savings to employers under the Medicare-for-all plan 'must be passed on to their organized workers in the form of additional wages or benefits.'" That suggests that as the result of the arbitration process, union workers will be treated differently than non-union workers.
That smacks of unfairness. The whole moral pitch for the Sanders plan, and for his candidacy in general, is that it's supposed to create more equality and end special interest deals. But by treating union workers differently, he'd be making exceptions for a powerful liberal constituency whose votes he needs.
There are plenty of low-income and middle-class workers who are not unionized. While union healthcare plans may be especially generous, all workers who have insurance through their employers — which includes about half the country — in some way have accepted lower salaries because businesses provide them with health benefits. Even if it wasn't the result of a formal collective bargaining process, this is the simple reality given that businesses budget in terms of overall compensation.
It should be recalled that a special carve out for union plans nearly killed Obamacare. Initially, Obamacare's Cadilac tax of expensive healthcare plans was supposed to go into effect much sooner, but with a special provision that delayed its effect for generous union plans. Opponents cited this as one of the special interest deals, and it nearly smothered the efforts to pass the bill. Eventually, Democrats were forced to delay the taxes for everybody. Sanders, if he ever gets much further in the election process, risks a similar sort of backlash.
At the end of the day, if Sanders and others are serious about transitioning everybody to a single government plan, they need to make the case that unions, like many other groups, will have to suck up the rocky transition to get to what they believe is a better place. He can make the case that once it's in place, employers will be saving money on insurance costs, so salaries will start to go up. But it is simply an untenable position to adopt a special carve out for his preferred special interests.

Pakistan predicts Indian 'false flag' attack that triggers face-off with 'nuclear-armed countries'

Texto completo: Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan raised the prospect of nuclear war with India while calling for international assistance in a territorial dispute with his larger democratic neighbor.
“My worry is that this can escalate and for two nuclear-armed countries, it should be alarming for the world what we are facing now,” Khan warned.
Khan invoked their respective weapons of mass destruction twice, stoking alarm over the arsenals that make the question of who controls the border region of Kashmir one of the “most dangerous” controversies in the world. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tightened his government’s control over the Indian-held portion of Kashmir, arguing that the changes would enhance security in an area simmering with terrorism threats, but Khan suggested that New Delhi is preparing a “false-flag operation” to justify a military conflict with his country.
“And then you are looking at two nuclear-armed countries eyeball to eyeball, and anything can happen,” Khan told the New York Times in an interview published late Wednesday.
The two rivals clashed in February, when Indian fighter jets crossed the unofficial boundary dividing the Indian and Pakistani-controlled portions of Kashmir to strike a terrorist group in Pakistan. One of India’s Soviet-made MiG-21s was downed by the Pakistani air force, and the pilot was captured. But U.S. officials sided with India in that incident because of frustration over Pakistan’s perceived willingness to allow the terrorist networks to operate with impunity.
“Khan has been attempting to turn the tables on India, and characterize it as the malevolent force in the region, while in fact Pakistan is the country that has used terrorism as the primary tool in its foreign policy,” Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Washington Examiner.
Modi echoed those charges when he revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status earlier this month on the grounds that “terrorism and separatism” had flourished in the area and that the territory’s autonomy "used as a weapon by Pakistan to incite anti-national feelings against some people in our country.”

President Trump sided with Modi implicitly in the wake of the administrative change, despite Khan’s allegations that India is planning an “ethnic cleansing.” But India’s tactics in locking down the Muslim-majority region — the government has cut internet access and used pellet guns to enforce a curfew — is beginning to draw criticism from American leaders.

“There are legitimate concerns about the ongoing communications blackouts, increased militarization of the region, and enforcement of curfews,” House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, said Wednesday. “This policy decision exacerbates an already tense environment in the region. I encourage both India and Pakistan to keep lines of communication open to prevent the further deterioration of the situation, and exercise restraint instead of engaging in rhetoric and actions that inspire extremist ideology.”
Khan argued that India has rejected his attempts to have a productive discussion of the issue, which Indian authorities maintain is a purely internal matter. “There is no point in talking to them,” he said. “All the overtures that I was making for peace and dialogue, I think they took it for appeasement.”
But Roggio, who monitors terrorist groups headquartered in Pakistan as editor of the FDD’s Long War Journal, views Khan’s complaint with suspicion. “I do not think Khan is sincere about this,” he told the Washington Examiner.
“I do not think Khan is sincere about this,” Roggio said. "He is laying the groundwork for plausible deniability for the next attack in India that is carried out by one of Pakistan’s jihadist proxies.”

Texto completo: It isn’t hard to guess what Mike Pompeo, the hawkish congressman from Kansas, would say about the Afghan exit deal that Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, is negotiating with the Taliban.
The details of the negotiations, which are being conducted in Qatar by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and could be finalized by the end of the month, are a closely held secret. So close, in fact, that I’m told Pompeo won’t allow White House officials to review details of the agreement except in his presence.
But the basic outline is this: a complete withdrawal of America’s 14,000 troops from Afghanistan within 14 months — that is, by October 2020 — in exchange for a promise from the Taliban not to attack our forces on the way out, along with some kind of vague assurance from them that Afghanistan will not again become a base for global terrorism. A source familiar with the deal says there is no explicit requirement for the Taliban to renounce its ties to al-Qaida.
Even those who want the U.S. to leave Afghanistan, come what may, should be dismayed to see an American strategic decision be so nakedly dictated by the electoral needs of a president who wants to take credit for ending “endless wars.” They should be no less dismayed by the idea that we are doing so in plain indifference to Afghanistan’s government, which wasn’t invited to the talks because the Taliban won’t deign to speak to what it considers a puppet government.
That “puppet” government is, for all of its well-known flaws, internationally recognized and democratically elected. It does not wantonly massacre its own people, or wage war on its neighbors, or sponsor terrorist groups that seek to wage war on the West. And it’s also all that will stand between the Taliban’s murderous misogyny and Afghanistan’s 18 million vulnerable women.
Then again, progressives have been pining for an Afghan exit for at least a decade, and Barack Obama set a timetable for full withdrawal (which he was later forced to reverse in the face of Taliban gains) in 2014. Foreign-policy hawks in the mold of Pompeo used to take a different view about the wisdom of U.S. retreat — at least before they became Donald Trump flunkies.
For starters, they had no patience for the lie that the Taliban was to al-Qaida merely what a flea motel is to a fugitive on the lam. The Taliban lied to Clinton administration envoy Bill Richardson in 1998 by telling him they didn’t know of Osama bin Laden’s whereabouts when they were harboring him, and then refused to give him up after the 9/11 attacks.
They’d have even less patience for the convenient fantasy that the Afghan Taliban has, or ever will, part ways with its brothers in global jihad. The deputy leader of the Taliban is Sirajuddin Haqqani, who also leads the Haqqani network that has been entwined with al-Qaida since its earliest days.
“There is not a scintilla of evidence that the network is willing to break with al-Qaida,” notes Thomas Joscelyn of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Even if the Taliban were to renounce A.Q. and attacks on the West, which they have never done, you’d need a verification mechanism. But if you withdraw all Western troops, there is no verification.”
What about the case for ending a long war? That’s always desirable, and every death in war is a tragedy. But a hawk might also note that the U.S. endured just 14 fatalities in Afghanistan in 2018, and that a U.S. service member is far more likely to die in a training accident than in combat. At some point, describing our current involvement in the country as a “war” stretches semantic credibility when compared with past U.S. conflicts.
Against the human (and budgetary) cost of our presence in Afghanistan, hawks would tally the cost of withdrawal. Even liberals like former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta criticized Obama for withdrawing too hastily from Iraq, thereby creating the power vacuum that ISIS quickly filled. It was a fiasco that ended only when Obama was forced to return U.S. troops to Iraq a few years later.
Why should a similar scenario not play out in Afghanistan? It’s true that ISIS and the Taliban are rivals, but any administration willing to entrust the Taliban with being a bulwark against global terrorism is even more gullible than the poor saps who paid money for a Trump University training program.
Hawks once understood this — just as they understood that America paid a steep price in strategic and moral credibility when it bugged out of its international commitments, squandered the sacrifices of U.S. troops for the immediate political benefit of a sitting president, and betrayed the vulnerable populations we had endeavored to protect against a barbaric enemy.
Don’t just take it from me. “As a former Army officer, it is gravely concerning to see any president of the United States play politics with critical national security issues,” one conservative lawmaker said in 2011 of Obama’s initial decision to begin a drawdown of U.S. forces. “This decision puts both the lives of American troops and the gains made on the ground in Afghanistan at risk.”
That lawmaker was — who else? — Mike Pompeo. If the secretary has a sense of shame, he might consider apologizing to Obama for adopting the same policy he once so loudly denounced. If he has a sense of honor, he might consider resigning rather than fathering the catastrophe that may soon befall Afghanistan. I’m confident he’ll do neither.

Texto completo: Joe Walsh, the former 8th District congressman who lost his seat to current U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth in 2012, may announce as early as this weekend that he’ll challenge Donald Trump in the 2020 primary for the Republican presidential nomination, according to a Wednesday night report from The New York Times.
Citing two anonymous sources, The New York Times says Walsh has already hired a senior political adviser.
The former WIND 560-AM radio host prone to making controversial statements supported President Trump in the 2016 election, but in recent months has used his Twitter account to criticize him. Wednesday on Twitter, Walsh asked, "Have we ever had a bigger crybaby in the White House?"
Walsh wrote last week in a guest op-ed for The New York Times that a GOP challenger for Trump needed to emerge in 2020.
Walsh, a North Barrington native, has not responded to the Daily Herald’s requests for comment on that op-ed.

How to Sell Chicken Sandwiches: Taunt a Rival on Twitter

Texto completo: The first Popeyes tweet seemed innocent enough -- a photograph of the chain's new fried-chicken sandwich (chicken breast, brioche bun, pickles, sauce) beneath an artfully garbled caption: "So. Good. Forgot. How. Speak."
But as a social media battle has captivated the internet this week and generated long lines at Popeyes locations across the country, that tweet from last week now has the feel of an opening salvo. Things grew heated on Tuesday, when Chick-fil-A tweeted what appeared to be a coded response to the Popeyes announcement, extolling the virtues of its "original" chicken sandwich.
Popeyes replied a few hours later: "...ya'll good?"
Soon, the "passive-aggressive chicken sandwich debate," as one news article put it, had escalated into a Twitter battle royal, as other fast-food companies started promoting their own sandwiches. Shake Shack tried to rise above the fray, promising a chicken sandwich "without the beef."
As the Twitter commotion intensified, the Popeyes chicken sandwich reportedly sold out at some locations.
"Look at how much attention they're getting -- it's impressive," said Jonathan Maze, the executive editor of Restaurant Business Magazine, a trade publication. "All this is really going to do frankly is embolden other chains to do similar things when they introduce new products."
In the chicken wars this week, fast-food rivals seemed intent on stirring up trouble. Take this exchange between Wendy's and Popeyes:
Wendy's: "Y'all out here fighting about which of these fools has the second best chicken sandwich."
Popeyes: "Sounds like someone just ate one of our biscuits. Cause y'all looking thirsty."
Wendy's: "lol, guess that means the food's as dry as the jokes."
To some, these Twitter antics may seem juvenile. But many brands have discovered that one easy way to cut through the social media noise is to poke fun at the competition. In fast food, Wendy's has arguably the sassiest corporate Twitter account in the country. Now, Popeyes is starting to catch up.
"If you're a fast-food brand," Mr. Maze said, "you have to have a strong social media game."
In a statement, Felipe Athayde, the Popeyes president for the Americas, declined to reveal how many chicken sandwiches the chain has sold. But he said the response from customers had been "extraordinary."
"We noticed a lot of organic conversation about the sandwich and we decided to have a little bit of fun along with our guests," he said. "There's a lot of enthusiasm for our brand."
Chick-fil-A did not respond to requests for comment.
Fast-food companies are not the only major brands eager to kick up some dust. After the snack-bar company Clif took out an advertisement in The New York Times in March calling on its competitors to use organic ingredients, its main rival, Kind, responded with a television commercial. There was also a lengthy back-and-forth on Facebook.
Asked in a recent interview whether he regretted the social media spat, the Kind chief executive, Daniel Lubetzky, struck a defiant tone. "We are not going to not defend our baby and our honor," he said. "They picked the wrong fight."
When it comes to chicken sandwiches, the battle has political overtones. Some critics of Chick-fil-A are hailing the Popeyes sandwich as a socially responsible alternative. Since 2012, Chick-fil-A has been widely criticized for its chief executive's derogatory comments about same-sex marriage. But Mr. Maze said he doubted the Popeyes sandwich, however aggressively marketed, would pose much of a threat to Chick-fil-A, whose sales grew by 16.7 percent last year, making it the third-largest restaurant chain in the United States.
"The chicken sandwich is their base, it's what they've done forever and it's a very good product," he said. "I can't imagine Chick-fil-A's customers are suddenly going to abandon the chain and go to Popeyes. They've been kind of unstoppable for a long time."
Still, at the Popeyes on West 40th Street in Manhattan, a line stretched down the block as die-hard fans and curious first-timers waited to sample the sandwich. Kurwyne Gayle was in line for his fifth sandwich in a week.
"I had it on Friday, Saturday, Sunday," Mr. Gayle said as he chatted with a group of friends outside. "It's really good. That's why I'm here standing in line."

Maybe liberty isn't a lost cause in China

Texto completo: Here's a crazy idea: Maybe the forces of liberty will win.
Sadly, few people are rooting for liberty these days, and even among those who are, there's a dismaying amount of pessimism about its prospects.
Consider China.
There's a new bipartisan consensus these days: The "elites" made a "bad bet" on China.
We were told by "elites" that giving China access to the global marketplace would deliver huge economic benefits for America. Simultaneously, economic liberalization in China would lead to political liberalization. After all, the history of democratization usually begins with growing prosperity. As the middle class gets richer, it demands rights and protections once enjoyed only by aristocrats -- i.e. political representation and the rule of law. This is how liberal democracy emerged in England and Holland in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in much of the rest of the free world since then. The same will happen in China, policymakers said. And since democratic societies tend not to go to war with each other, American and global security will improve.
And now, today's elites insist that it was all false.
While it's true that the benefits were oversold and the costs minimized, it's not clear to me that any of these claims are settled.
On the economic front, plenty of studies show that Americans benefitted from increased trade with China. Consumer goods got cheaper, particularly for lower-income Americans. Yes, America lost some manufacturing jobs to China -- though it almost certainly lost more to robots. But competition with China also yielded more hiring of Americans in non-manufacturing jobs, a much larger part of our economy. Perhaps this painful transition was necessary and inevitable. (For those interested, Duke Law School's Scott Lincicome authored an excellent survey of the economic literature at the Bulwark in January.)
In short, the economic argument is a mixed bag. Though the fact that hundreds of millions of Chinese people were lifted out of abject poverty -- by markets -- is a moral victory for humanity and an important demonstration of the fact that police states alone don't make life better for the policed.
Which brings us to freedom. Beijing remains stubbornly -- and by some measures, increasingly -- authoritarian. It's not as bad as when Chairman Mao killed some 60 million of his own people, but China's technologically advanced police state is still plenty grotesque.
Why? A scholar who spent years in China once explained to me that the government -- i.e., the Communist Party -- is often more afraid of the people than the people are of it. The Communist Party understands the history of democratization as well as anyone. It's just betting that artificial intelligence and facial recognition will keep its aristocrats in power in ways that the bayonets and gunpowder of yesteryear could not.
China is in a nationalist phase, just as Germany, France, Italy and other former or would-be Great Powers were on their way to democracy. That poses very real dangers to the global order in the same way the nationalist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries did. Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm wanted what he called a "place in the sun" for the German empire, and so did Adolf Hitler. Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants it, too.
Whether it was a young political scientist named Woodrow Wilson hailing Otto von Bismarck's authoritarian Prussia as the most "admirable system ...and most nearly perfected" in the world, or Lincoln Steffens claiming upon his return from Soviet Russia that he'd "seen the future, and it works," or New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wishing that America could learn from China's "one party authoritarianism," virtually every time nationalist and authoritarian regimes seize the reins, countless Western intellectuals became convinced that a better, more "efficient" model of government had been created.
As George Orwell observed, this sort of thinking amounts to power-worship, and this mindset leads people to think that current trends will only continue in a straight line into the future.
But that's not how the last three centuries have gone. Power-hungry experts love to tell us freedom has had its day, yet liberty keeps winning. The freedom fighters in 2019 Hong Kong may meet the same fate that the protestors in Tiananmen Square did in 1989. But that doesn't mean they'll be remembered as victims of a lost cause. Rather, they might be remembered as proof that liberty can win in the long run, when people fight for it.
The great lie about China wasn't that good things would come from its enrichment, but that the good things would be instantaneous -- and easy. Liberty is never easy. It takes work.

Lawmakers criticize Utah’s planned next-generation surveillance program as ‘North Korea-esque’ and ‘Big Brother’

Texto completo: For $2.2 million a year, law enforcement representatives said Tuesday, Utah can build and run a real-time, next-generation surveillance apparatus that combines public social media posts, traffic cameras and other data sources to decrease police response times, keep interstate traffic flowing and save lives.
“It tells you where to look for the needle in the haystack,” said Ric Cantrell, chief of staff to Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes. “So it will shave hours down to minutes.”
But those plans were met with vocal skepticism by Utah legislative leaders, who worried the plans could be a step toward an Orwellian, “North Korea-esque” abuse of personal privacy by state government.
“In a way, we’re creating the NSA Utah,” said Rep. Francis Gibson, R-Mapleton.
Gibson, the House majority leader, shared his concerns during a meeting of the Executive Appropriations Committee.
The influential lawmaker said the creation of a live-time intelligence platform — a joint project by the attorney general’s office, Utah Department of Public Safety, and University of Utah relying on software by Banjo, a Utah-based company — is “a slippery slope” toward the routine surveillance of residents’ activities that is none of the government’s business.
“I just see us asking for $2.2 million a year to be Big Brother,” Gibson said, referring to the all-seeing dystopian regime of George Orwell’s “1984.”
Lawmakers appropriated $3.7 million toward the project earlier this year, with state agencies contracting with Banjo in July for development of the intelligence platform. But that funding was one-time, meaning the nascent apparatus will effectively grind to a halt without additional investment by the Legislature.
Jess Anderson, Utah’s commissioner of public safety, said that while the program has the capability to monitor Utahns’ social media — and other — activities in real time, the Banjo software strips that data of personally identifiable elements while pooling critical information related to law enforcement and public safety incidents.
“One of the things that gets people concerned, and rightly so, is the fact we’re watching everything,” Anderson said. “It’s just a tool for us to be able to respond quicker, to be able to gather that information and actually have it. As long as it is anonymized, there’s no threat to any sort of private information.”
Cantrell gave the example of a recent kidnapping simulation organized by the attorney general’s office in coordination with local law enforcement agencies. In the simulated exercise, officers were able to identify the location of a missing child in eight hours, he said, while a test of a live time intelligence program reached the same conclusions in 22 seconds.
“If we could find the information in 22 seconds and knock on the door in 4 minutes, we can rescue the child before there’s trauma, before there’s a murder,” Cantrell said. “That’s what brings tears to my eyes. That’s why I want to make a foray into this area.”
He said the data analyzed by the program are not of a type that typically require a warrant — like tweets or posts on Facebook — but are like puzzle pieces that a data-based algorithm is more equipped to fit together.
“The best way to predict the future is to invent it,” Cantrell said. “We feel like Utah is the right place to develop this technology."
Other members of the appropriations committee questioned whether the program could lead to racial profiling, or the abuse of facial recognition software.
In July, The Washington Post and New York Times reported that Utah was among the states where driver license databases had been mined by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the FBI, using facial recognition software, without the knowledge of motorists.
State officials denied the characterizations of those reports, while lawmakers and activists criticized the use of driver licenses databases for the purpose of immigration enforcement.
Anderson said Monday that Utah’s live-time intelligence program will not include a facial recognition element, but added that strict regulations are appropriate to ensure the platform is not abused in the future.
“We’re very concerned as well,” Anderson said, “but yet at the same time have great confidence in this tool to be used as a tool to increase our ability here in Utah on many fronts.”
Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, noted that many Utahns voluntarily use smartphone apps that track their location — like maps and other driver-assistance programs — and create data that is potentially useful for law enforcement. But the original intent of the program could be lost or diminished as new people or new agendas take precedent.
“I think we’re all concerned about the potential of the future,” Adams said. “Today we have good people involved, and we have some checks and balances. But I think there is concern.”

Texto completo: Washington • The Trump administration unveiled a regulation on Wednesday that would allow it to detain indefinitely migrant families who cross the border illegally, replacing a decades-old court agreement that imposed a limit on how long the government could hold migrant children in custody and specified the level of care they must receive.
The White House has for more than a year pressed the Department of Homeland Security to replace the agreement, known as the Flores settlement, a shift that the administration says is crucial to halt immigration across the southwestern border.
The new regulation, which requires approval from a federal judge before it could go into effect and was expected to be immediately challenged in court, would establish standards for conditions in detention centers and specifically abolish a 20-day limit on detaining families in immigration jails, a cap that has prompted President Donald Trump to repeatedly complain about the “catch and release” of families from Central America and elsewhere into the United States.
“This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress,” Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, said in a statement. He called it a “critical rule” that would allow the government to detain families and maintain the “integrity of the immigration system.”
The administration proposed the rule last fall, allowing the public to comment on the potential regulation. It is scheduled to be published this week in the Federal Register and would take effect 60 days later, though administration officials concede that the expected court challenge will probably delay it.
Under the new rule, the administration would be free to send families who are caught crossing the border illegally to a family residential center to be held for as long as it takes for their immigration cases to be decided. Officials said families cases could be resolved within three months, though many could drag on much longer.
Trump administration officials — who briefed reporters on Tuesday night on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans — said that many of the families would be detained until they were either released after being awarded asylum or they were deported to their home countries. Some families might be awarded parole to leave the facilities while the courts decide their fate.
The 20-day limit has been in place since 2015, a legal outgrowth of a 1997 court-ordered consent decree after a federal class-action lawsuit alleged physical and emotional harm done to immigrant children held for extended periods of time in the detention facilities.
Previous administrations tried to change the rules for detaining children in efforts to reduce surges of migrants crossing the border. Trump’s homeland security officials have repeatedly said that limiting the detentions of entire migrant families has driven the surge of Central American families who crossed the border this year.
The officials said Tuesday that enacting the new regulation would send a powerful message that bringing children to the United States was not “a passport” to being released from detention.
They predicted that the rule would cause a significant decrease in the number of families trying to cross into the United States illegally, reducing the need for more family residential centers.
Withdrawing from the consent decree has also been a personal objective for Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration policy. Delays in finishing the new regulation had prompted Miller to lash out at senior homeland security officials, who were ousted from the department.
The New York Times reported in April that Miller berated the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ronald D. Vitiello, for not finishing the new rule. Vitiello later had his nomination withdrawn by Trump, who said he was not tough enough for the job.
The Flores settlement has also been at the root of partisan debates on immigration. Democrats have said the rules, are imperative to ensuring the well-being of detained children, especially after reports of children being kept in overcrowded cells and sometimes going without showers, toothpaste or hot meals.
McAleenan told the House Homeland Security Committee in May that the Flores settlement had incentivized migration to the United States, saying that “if an adult arrives with a child, they have a likelihood of staying in the United States.”
Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the chairman of the committee, reminded McAleenan of the original purpose of the court-ordered regulations.
“It was about prolonged detention of children had proven to be harmful to their health,” Thompson said. “I think the court looked at it from that perspective rather than a punitive decision on the department.”
The Trump administration’s regulation, which is several hundred pages long, eliminates a requirement that federal detention centers for immigrant families be licensed by states, most of which had no such licenses.
Instead, under the regulation, the three centers built to house hundreds of immigrant families — in Dilley and Karnes City, Texas, and Leesport, Pennsylvania — would have to meet standards set only by ICE, which runs them.
The administration officials insisted Tuesday that the facilities were, and would continue to be, maintained at high standards for the immigrants who were detained there. They said the facilities provided health care, education and “top notch” food.
But critics of the administration have long argued that the facilities were unsuitable for children to be held for long periods of time. And the recent examples of horrible conditions at overcrowded Border Patrol detention centers have underscored their concerns about the residential centers.
“We don’t disagree with detaining children when it’s necessary — namely, if they’re a flight risk or they’re a danger to themselves or others, we agree,” said Peter Schey, a lawyer who filed the original case and has continued to defend the settlement terms in court since. “It’s the unnecessary detention of child that this settlement sought to end. So these regulations really reflect a flagrant disregard on the part of President Trump and his administration for the safety and the well-being of children in the care of the federal government.”
Last summer, the Trump administration began separating children from their parents as a way to get around the Flores agreement. The children were sent to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services while the adults were imprisoned while awaiting trial on their violation of immigration laws.
A fierce political backlash forced Trump to publicly abandon the separation policy, though immigration advocates said some families continued to be separated after that announcement.
Administration officials said Tuesday that the effort to allow families to be detained indefinitely was an attempt to avoid having to either separate families or release them while they waited for their cases to be heard.
Even before the final rule was announced on Wednesday, immigration advocates said it amounted to a cruel effort to imprison families — some with infants or young children — many of whom are fleeing violence and corruption in their home countries.
Under the terms of the 1997 consent decree, the regulation must be approved by the judge in the original case, Judge Dolly M. Gee of U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The government will have seven days to file a brief in her court seeking her approval of the regulation.
If she refuses, the administration is expected to appeal her decision in a case that could drag on for months or even years, legal experts said.

Texto completo: Journalism is not for the faint of heart, especially in an era where the most powerful politician in the land has labeled its practitioners "enemies of the people" who produce "fake news."
So while we rake muck and speak truth to power without fear or favor - or at least aspire to do so - it's only natural to sometimes lose sight of why what we do matters. I've blessedly been reminded by, first, a gathering of several thousand journalists that I attended in Florida a few weeks ago and, currently, the start of a new academic year that brings a fresh bunch of young people still eager to seek truth and tell stories.
My batteries have been recharged, and I'm rarin' to go.
Sometimes we become so focused on the insanity emanating from that other Pennsylvania Avenue that we forget that our work is much more than responding to tweets and temper tantrums. We have a constitutional license to inform and educate.
In the aftermath of the latest confrontation between neo-Nazis and those who have been deemed anti-fascists or, antifa, I saw one guy asserting that white people made this country. Obviously, schooling failed him. But I firmly believe that we soldiers without swords - to borrow a phrase from the documentary filmmaker Stanley Nelson - can fill in the knowledge gap of his ilk. Start with a magnificent opus by the New York Times, The 1619 Project. That long-overdue corrective will absolutely alter the minds of anyone not too far gone to learn. The collection of essays and commissioned literary works challenges readers to unlearn what they think they know about the country's origins and to recognize the centrality of the African/African American presence.
"We were told once, by virtue of our bondage," Nikole Hannah-Jones writes in the opening essay, "that we could never be American. But it was by virtue of our bondage that we became the most American of all."
This month marks the 400th anniversary of the arrival in the Virginia colony of Africans kidnapped from present-day Angola. Commemoration events will culminate on Sunday with a National Day of Healing and the ringing of bells across the country at 3 p.m. That's a fine goal, but healing won't come until there is acknowledgment of how the past has shaped the present. And we journalists have a role in helping the general public connect the dots.
We must also educate about politics in a way that makes us more than commentators in a sporting event or producers of spectacles called presidential debates. At the convention of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), which drew some 4,000 people, I challenged political reporters to tell more complex truths than they are wont to do. Yes, the middle class feels pinched. But why must the faces of middle-class angst be white? And in those Rust Belt counties that have defected from the Democratic Party because of the impact of globalization, aren't there more than white people who live there and have been similarly displaced?
The more complex truth is that most issues on the minds of the American populace are on the minds of more than angry white men or exasperated white soccer moms. So we must tell it like it is, taking advantage of new tools for unearthing truth, telling stories and connecting with our communities, as well as new initiatives to support local news and investigative journalism. Learning about this during workshops at conventions such as NABJ's is part of the continuing education of journalists.
The good news is that many journalists I met at the convention are amenable to the idea of more complex truth; the bad news is that too many others said that as the only person of color in their news shops or one of a handful, they have limited opportunities to shape news coverage. That is an industry failure.
Thankfully, despite all the challenges - from the prohibitive cost of earning a degree in the more elite journalism programs to an anti-truth mood being stoked by political charlatans - young people are filling classrooms from coast to coast.
I'm all fired up now, but when my batteries finally lose their power, there's an army of replacements ready to take up the role that the fictional Mr. Dooly ascribed to journalists: "comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable."
Look out, world!

Mueller crushed Dem dreams, so now it's race

Texto completo: What was the embittered left -- Democratic presidential candidates and their media allies -- supposed to do when their hopes of Russia-Trump collusion crashed on the boulevard of broken dreams?
Pivot.
They had invested so much in their fantasy that President Donald Trump was a treasonous agent of Russian boss Vladimir Putin. But when special counsel Robert Mueller's report came out, and there was no collusion, no crime charged, their fantasy collapsed.
And so, after a brief spasm of despair, the left pivoted to their default position: race.
Race. Race. Race. Race. Race.
With Americans working and with money in their pockets again, with the 2020 election approaching, Democrats are reaching for the race card the way a sick man reaches for the waters of Lourdes. Desperately. Their allies in media followed suit, with Trump called everything from a white supremacist, to a Nazi, and on and on.
Meanwhile, The New York Times embarks on an ambitious new series, the 1619 Project -- marking the 400th anniversary of the first slave ships to our shores.
The newspaper said it hopes "to reframe the country's history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are."
NYT editor Dean Baquet, a former colleague of mine at the Chicago Tribune, a thoughtful man now with his newsroom in turmoil, expressed the pivot in a different way.
In terms of Mueller.
In a transcript of a newsroom meeting with his liberal staff that made its way to Slate, Baquet said this:
"The day Bob Mueller walked off that witness stand, two things happened," Baquet said. "Our readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, 'Holy s---, Bob Mueller is not going to do it.' And Donald Trump got a little emboldened politically, I think. Because, you know, for obvious reasons. And I think that the story changed. A lot of the stuff we're talking about started to emerge like six or seven weeks ago. We're a little tiny bit flat-footed. I mean, that's what happens when a story looks a certain way for two years. Right?"
So the Times pivoted.
The story of slavery in America is compelling and worthy of such attention. But reducing the whole of America to the sin of slavery and racism that America has tried so hard to reject -- by shedding blood in the Civil War, by passing the Civil Rights Act, by twice electing Barack Obama to the White House -- is absurd. But revealing.
I talked about this on "The Chicago Way" podcast with Tom Bevan, co-founder of Real Clear Politics. His website publishes a wide spectrum of politically diverse views. (Disclosure: I consider Bevan a friend, and my column has been linked on that site.)
Real Clear is what I once imagined The New York Times to be, before it took on such an overwhelming liberal bent.
"What happened to just reporting the news, as (RCP columnist) Carl Cannon says, without fear or favor?" he asked. "The New York Times is a for-profit institution and must cater to the whims of their readers or they'll cease to exist as a business. Their readers are upper-class white liberals ... the Times felt like it had to be part of the resistance to succeed with their readers. That strategy succeeded. But they're caught in this cycle. They're no longer the paper of record."
The short-term benefits of defining America by race may help Democrats and soothe subscribers at The New York Times.
But what it does long term, to journalism, to the republic, doesn't concern the left, just as it doesn't concern Trump.
He's not introspective. An introspective man couldn't, wouldn't have said some of the things he's said. He's a purely transactional politician, as cynical as his opponents.
In the short term, Democrats and their media allies are using race and charges of "white supremacy" to herd those 60 million or so Trump voters back into Hillary Clinton's basket of deplorables.
But once you brand 60 million people as "white supremacists," and "Nazis," what can you do with them? If Democrats win in 2020, will Trump voters be welcomed back into some brave new Trumpless America?
Will the left open its arms and call them brothers and sisters on the condition they agree to kneel like penitent sinners and burn their MAGA hats in ceremonies of public redemption?
No. It doesn't work like that.
Recently, presidential candidates Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren reminded their faithful that Michael Brown, a black man of Ferguson, Mo., was "murdered" by a white cop. Ferguson erupted in riots after Brown's death.
Warren and Harris are both lawyers. They know that the Obama Justice Department tried mightily, but did not, could not find that Brown had been murdered.
But they incite anyway. Because they want to win.
The American political media, relentless in ferreting out even a whiff of suspected racism among conservatives, largely gave them a pass.
According to PolitiFact, a liberal standard of truth, their use of "murder" was problematic, but not a lie.
PolitiFact said "the significance of Harris' and Warren's use of the word (murder) is open to some dispute, we won't be rating their tweets on the Truth-O-Meter."
Of course not.
Watching our politics, as some Americans have their individuality stripped away by identity politics, as others are kicked to the margins of society, as I mourn journalism as I remember it, I'm reminded of something.
Ernest Hemingway's explanation of how a man went bankrupt:
Two ways. Gradually and then suddenly.

Texto completo: BELGRADE, Me. -- You might have heard by now that 1969 was the summer of Apollo 11, and Woodstock, and Chappaquiddick. But in my neighborhood, out in the Philadelphia suburbs, it was the summer of Vrroom.
Made by Mattel, Vrroom -- usually written with an exclamation point; Vrroom! -- was a bicycle designed, as one commercial explained, "to look and sound just like a motorcycle." A flick of a switch, and all at once your bike roared like a shovelhead.
All that noise didn't make your bike go any faster, of course, but that was hardly the point.
I had forgotten all about Vrroom until last month. I was doing my usual bike circuit around the north half of Long Pond, here in Belgrade. As I turned left, I found myself accidentally merging into the Trek Across Maine, a three-day event in which cyclists ride from Brunswick to Augusta to Waterville and back again. It's a huge event, drawing more than 2,000 riders; money raised during the trek benefits the American Lung Association.
It felt good to suddenly join the pack, and to find myself surrounded by all those other cyclists. But it was awkward, too, and not only because I wasn't wearing a race number. More embarrassing was the fact that I was passing everyone, sailing up the hill on Castle Island Road in front of the Travis Mills Foundation for wounded veterans while everyone else was grinding away in low gear.
That's because my bike was no ordinary road bike, but one of the new e-bikes now taking over the cycling world.
Although they've been around since the 1990s, until recently e-bikes were sold mostly in China and in Europe. But now sales are through the roof; in 2017 over a quarter-million of them were sold in this country, a 25 percent jump from the year before.
The principle is fairly simple: You plug the bike in at night, and it charges a battery that provides an extra level of support as you ride. You still have to pedal, but the battery silently doubles the amount of power provided by your muscles to the wheels.
For older riders like me -- I'm in my 60s -- the assist makes all the difference in the world. I've been riding all my life, and while I've never been a competitive cyclist, biking has always been my favorite form of exercise. In part it's because I like the solitude of riding, especially on the remote trails where I take my mountain bike. I've encountered moose and deer and bald eagles during my rides in the Kennebec Highlands Reserved Land, eaten my lunch by a rushing stream, explored blueberry barrens high atop Vienna Mountain in Kennebec County.
(It is worth mentioning that in a column I wrote about cycling five years ago, I committed an error that demanded a correction that is still legendary among Times editors. I spoke of observing purple bird poop on a rock, the result, I said, of ospreys eating blueberries. By day's end, the paper had to post this melancholy note: "An Op-Ed essay on Monday described bald eagles and ospreys incorrectly. They eat fish, and their poop is white; they do not eat berries and excrete purple feces." Years later, when I told another editor about this, she breathlessly said, "That was you?!")
Yes, that was me.
Anyway. Cycling, like everything else, has gotten harder as I've grown older. For much of the year, I live on a dirt road at the bottom of a mile-long hill, and some days I just don't have the energy to make the ascent. Last summer, I was on my bike a total of five times.
Since I got the e-bike, though, I've been riding 15 and 20 miles a day, four or five days a week. It's been life altering, not just making me fitter, but also raising my spirits, getting me out of the house and back into the mountains.
I felt more than a little guilty as I soared past the other riders in the Trek Across Maine. A couple of them called out to me as I passed. "What in the world is that?" asked one. "That is so awesome," said another.
Ryan Rzepecki, the chief executive of Jump Bikes, a leading manufacturer of e-bikes, says that this is the beginning of a multiyear shift away from regular pedal to electric bikes for his company. "When people first jump on an e-bike, their face lights up," said Mr. Rzepecki. "It's exciting and joyful in a way that you don't get from a regular bike."
Nowhere was this clearer to me than when I left the Trek Across Maine peloton and paused at the top of something called Blueberry Hill. For a moment I thought I was alone. But then I saw another rider had pulled over, and he had the same kind of bike as mine, a Specialized Turbo Como. We exchanged goofy grins, and I told him that the bike had changed my life.
At that moment, from down a mountain trail, came a dozen wounded veterans also on e-bikes. Some men had prosthetic arms and legs. They were from the Travis Mills Foundation, as my companion explained, and some of them hadn't been on a bike in years.
Now they'd ridden all the way to the top of Blueberry Hill.
"You're not the only one who's life got changed," the man said.
I rang the bell on my bike -- ding! -- and headed into the mountains, feeling hopeful, feeling as if I still have lots of adventures ahead.
I rang the bell again. Vrroom, I thought.

Texto completo: Sudan's deposed leader, Omar al-Bashir, told investigators that he had received $90 million from Saudi Arabia, a Khartoum court heard Monday during the opening of al-Bashir's keenly anticipated trial on corruption charges.
A senior police officer testified that al-Bashir, who was ousted in April after months of street protests, had admitted to receiving part of the money from envoys sent by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The remainder came during the reign of King Abdullah, who died in 2015.
Al-Bashir was confined to a cage and surrounded by uniformed security officials for the two-hour hearing, in a sight that few Sudanese could have imagined during al-Bashir's 30 years in power. The former leader spoke only to confirm his name, age and residence. His lawyer dismissed the accusations.
It was a dramatic start to a trial that has come to signify the momentous changes underway in Sudan since al-Bashir was ousted in April. Many Sudanese hope to sweep away the vestiges of al-Bashir's period of rule, when Sudan endured numerous internal revolts, became an international pariah and was subjected to U.S. sanctions. More recently the country suffered a crushing economic collapse that spurred the uprising against him.
Even so, most Sudanese say the revolution is incomplete. Al-Bashir, 75, has yet to face charges in the most serious accusations against him, including genocide and war crimes. And some of his closest lieutenants have retained their grip on power.
On Saturday, Sudan's military and civilian leaders signed a power-sharing deal to run the country jointly for the next three years until elections can be held. A transitional government run by civilians, with a senior general in charge, is scheduled to assume power Sept. 1.
The generals, most of whom owe their careers to al-Bashir, insist they will not send him to The Hague to stand trial at the International Criminal Court, where he faces a decade-old indictment on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Those charges stem from a brutal military campaign in the western region of Darfur in which up to 300,000 people were killed. Many of the generals who led that campaign, including the head of a notorious paramilitary unit, are expected to hold senior positions in the new power-sharing government.
The account in Monday's hearing of large personal payments from Saudi royalty also highlighted the enduring influence of one of the richest countries in the region on one of the poorest.
Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates, backed al-Bashir, who sent thousands of troops to support the Saudi-led war campaign in Yemen. But the Saudis and Emiratis quickly switched sides after al-Bashir was ousted, offering a $3 billion aid package to the military junta that toppled him.
The trial being held in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, focuses on corruption charges.
Al-Bashir arrived at the courthouse in a large military convoy. As he arrived in the courtroom he waved his hand in greeting to supporters, who responded with cries of "God is great."
It was striking to see al-Bashir - for decades one of the great survivors among African autocrats - take a seat inside a cage. He smiled as he listed his place of residence as Kober prison, a facility in Khartoum where he once dispatched his own enemies.
The corruption charges stem from a raid on one of al-Bashir's residence in the days after his ouster, when police and military officials seized bundles of cash in various currencies that the military junta's leader, Lt. Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, later valued at about $113 million.

Texto completo: of summer If the calls of hundreds of glittering cicadas don't remind you of the dog days of summer, what will? "When I hear the cicada I think of summertime and BBQs," self-proclaimed bug guy Christopher Wade said Monday. His official title is environmental program administrator for the pesticide section at Delaware's Department of Agriculture, but bug guy is a lot easier to say. The unique sound that cicadas make is one of the most fascinating things about them, he said.
Another is their complex life cycle.
Here are a few things to know about the bulky, big-eyed insects found in so many Delawareans' back yards.
They're likely dog-day cicadas You may have heard that cicadas only emerge from the ground once every 17 years.
While that is true of some cicadas, others have much shorter lifespans. Generations of these bugs overlap, which means they emerge from the ground annually, Wade said.
In the U.S., they're often referred to as dog-day cicadas, because they molt and take flight in July and August, during the hottest days of summer, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Delaware does also have periodical cicadas — the kind that have 13- to 17-year life cycles — but the next big batch of those isn't due until 2021. The group that typically emerges in Delaware is known as Brood X, or the "Great Eastern Brood."
Every 17 years, Brood X cicadas emerge from the ground, lay eggs, and then die off in several weeks. After mating, females cut slits in the bark of young twigs and lay hundreds of eggs, according to the USDA.
Six to 10 weeks later, the eggs hatch and newborn nymphs drop to the ground, where they burrow into to the soil and feed on the juices of plant roots. They go through several stages of development underground before emerging 17 years later, molting and taking flight.
The Great Eastern Brood has the greatest range and concentration of any of the 17-year cicadas, which means the year after next there will be a lot of them.
Broods can number in the billions.
That sound is a mating call "They are so loud," Wade said. "If there's more than them hatching, then, of course, the combined noise could be louder."
The sound you hear is actually the mating call of the male cicada and can be louder than a lawn mower. In a swarm, the high-pitched hum can reach 85 decibels, which is slightly louder than a diesel train, reported the New York Times.
Cicada songs are painful to birds' ears and male cicadas from the same brood often stick together in order to scare away predators.
The bugs have a set of ridged, drum-like organs called tymbals, which vibrate very quickly when pulled in by tiny muscles in their abdomens, according to cicadamania.com. The chirping and clicking noises can be heard by females up to a mile away.
The sound can also damage human ears. If, for instance, you were to pick a cicada up and hold it next to your head, you could end up with hearing damage, the Cicada Mania website warns.
Female cicadas, in comparison, are mostly silent.
They won't hurt you Cicadas generally don't do that much damage. And they don't sting or bite.
Sometimes confused with locusts, they do not feed on trees once they emerge from the ground, though they cut slits in them to lay their eggs. As nymphs, they feed on the juice of tree roots but, again, don't cause significant damage.
"Their numbers aren't great enough to cause substantial damage to property," Wade said.
The only trees that may require protection are young or ornamental fruit trees.
If a female cicada picks one to lay its eggs in, it may lose most or all its branches. But basic garden netting should be enough to stop the damage, experts say.
But these creepy wasps might Cicadas don't sting, but large wasps called cicada killers may attack if threatened.
Big solitary wasps that nest in the ground and feed on cicadas, they generally keep to themselves. They are mostly black with yellow bands and can reach up to 1.5 inches in length, according to the USDA.
"Like any other wasp, they can sting, but they're very docile," said Wade, who has petted a cicada killer on the head before.
"I'm just a weird bug guy, but they're very docile," he said.
If you see one, Wade recommends leaving it alone. If you do step on a cicada killer or disturb its nest, the females have big stingers that they will use to defend themselves.
The males don't have stingers at all.
"They're actually beneficial because they keep the (cicada) population in check," Wade said.

Guns are back on the radar

Texto completo: For all the talk about a possible breakthrough on background checks for gun buyers, it would be only a minor success if military-type assault weapons remain on the market.
Their continued availability since expiration of the ban enacted by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 1994 makes a mockery of any lesser reform, leaving the majority Republicans in the Senate still captive of the National Rifle Association.
The NRA's successful campaign putting assault weapons back in the hands of Americans in 2004, with no sane or justifiable argument for doing so, should be the real objective of gun-control advocates, especially in the current era of spreading domestic terrorism.
The recent surfacing of a white supremacy "manifesto" allegedly issued by the young killer of innocents in El Paso, Texas, underscores the scope of today's peril in such rapid-firing devices of death employed by its adherents.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, now seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, seized the issue Sunday in a New York Times op-ed, calling for the ban's reinstatement along with another on sale of high-capacity bullet rounds.
"Republican leaders," Biden wrote, "try to prevent action and parrot NRA messaging, as Donald Trump did last week when he said, 'Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.'
"This is the same president," Biden continued, "who during his first year in office repealed a rule President Obama and I put in place to help keep guns out of the hands of people with certain mental illnesses. This is the same president who said after Charlottesville that there were 'very fine people on both sides,' and who continues to fan the flames of hate and white supremacy. We can't trust his diagnosis."
Biden also tweeted that he and Feinstein "led the successful effort to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It worked. It saved lives."
As president, he said, he will take on the NRA again and make the ban "even stronger."
Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the assault weapons ban was enacted in 1994, said it was "the last meaningful gun legislation we were able to get signed into law before the NRA and the gun manufacturers put the Republican Party in a headlock." Biden claimed his efforts then to extend the ban past its 2004 expiration were thwarted by the gun lobby.
Other 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants quickly joined the call, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Some went further than Biden, calling for licensing of gun buyers.
Biden is skeptical of licensing, telling CNN it "will not change whether or not people buy what weapons, what weapons they can buy, where they can use them, how they can store them."
While some Democrats question whether the former vice president still has fortitude and firepower to take on Trump, he quickly identified one issue on which support for enhanced public safety should be indisputable.
Citing police data on the killings by such weapons, Biden stated the obvious: "Shooters looking to inflict mass carnage choose assault weapons with high-capacity magazines holding more than ten rounds. They choose them because they want to kill as many people as possible without having to stop and reload."
As for the proposed background checks on guns buyers, a bill has already passed the House and is awaiting unexpected consideration in the Senate, which Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he has no intention of calling back into session.
Such is the state of political paralysis now inflicting the Grand Old Party under a president who pays lip service to background checks.

Texto completo: What's on TV
POSE 10 p.m. on FX. With its large ensemble of transgender actors, and the trans writers and producers Janet Mock and Our Lady J, "Pose" has continued to revolutionize the way L.G.B.T. stories are told onscreen. Set in New York City's ball scene in the early '90s during the height of the AIDS crisis, Season 2 has seen its characters strive for their dancing, modeling, activist and entrepreneurial dreams, amid medical, financial and societal setbacks. In the season finale, directed by Mock, Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) tries to reassemble her house after a medical scare, Angel (Indya Moore) encounters a fan during a modeling gig and Elektra (Dominique Jackson) and Pray Tell (Billy Porter) confront a new ball category.
MOST EXPENSIVEST 10 p.m. on Viceland. Over three seasons of his Viceland show, the rapper 2 Chainz, with his French bulldog Trappy in tow, has gotten his hands on some of the priciest toys, products and services tailor-made for the one percent. On the summer season finale, the rapper dives into the rich world of viticulture, visiting the Napa Valley winery Promontory to sample a $ 900 bottle of wine. Then he tries out a $ 2,000 decanter that comes with its own instructional DVD.
ALTERNATINO WITH ARTURO CASTRO 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. In the season finale of this sketch comedy series, the many characters portrayed by "Broad City" alum Arturo Castro tackle everything from diversity and identity to baseball batting rituals and niche Netflix shows. His character goes from lying about his immigration status in one sketch, to defending his deep love for Bruno Mars in the next. The show "sends up American ideals about Latino culture in the same vein as [Amy] Schumer did with modern American womanhood," Trish Bendix wrote in The New York Times.

Having written and directed a mockumentary about veganism set in the year 2067, and a semi-autobiographical feature about a young filmmaker who believes he's unable to love and be loved, this British comedian's work can be both humorously absurd and deeply vulnerable. His new stand-up special for Netflix sits somewhere in the middle, with Amstell tapping into his anxieties about death, love, ego and intimacy with self-deprecating wit. He also touches on ayahuasca, an experience that the comedian has said has helped his depression.
GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) on Netflix. If, after watching him battle Charles Manson's cronies in "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," you find yourself craving more action from Leonardo DiCaprio, consider revisiting this violent Martin Scorsese epic that depicts the gang wars of downtown New York in the 1860s. DiCaprio's character returns to Five Points, seeking revenge against the nativist leader William "Bill the Butcher" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) who killed his father, the head of a group of Irish-Catholic immigrants, 16 years earlier. In his New York Times review, A.O. Scott wrote, "Mr. Day-Lewis positively luxuriates in his character's villainy and turns Bill's flavorsome dialogue into vernacular poetry."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Since their founding in New York City in 2016, the far-right Proud Boys have cultivated a rough and ready image, often declaring: "We don't start fights. We finish them."
But on Monday, jurors in State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected claims by two members of the group, who had said they had been acting in self-defense last fall on the Upper East Side when they took part in the beating of four people described by the police as anti-fascists connected to a loose-knit group called Antifa.
The two defendants, Maxwell Hare and John Kinsman, were convicted on charges of attempted gang assault, attempted assault and riot for their part in a melee after an appearance by the founder of the Proud Boys at the Metropolitan Republican Club on East 83rd Street.
That brawl mirrored clashes in other cities that had pitted far-right groups, calling for "free speech" or chanting nationalist and racist slogans, against leftists, including Antifa, who have physically confronted those they deem to be fascists or Nazis.
Although members of the male-only Proud Boys have battled leftists across the country, the trial in Manhattan appeared to mark the first time people connected to the group had been before a jury in connection to these incidents.
The jury deliberated for a day and a half before delivering its verdict. Mr. Hare was found guilty of attempted gang assault, riot and three counts of attempted assault. Mr. Kinsman was found guilty of attempted gang assault, riot and two counts of attempted assault. The jury also found that Mr. Kinsman's actions were "justified" with respect to the lowest counts of attempted assault.
Mr. Kinsman was heard saying "wow" in a low voice as the verdict was read. Soon after, he walked into a courtroom hallway, holding a book in front of his face to shield himself from photographers, and declined to comment. Mr. Hare did not respond to a request for comment as he left the courtroom.
"As violent extremism rises in America, a Manhattan jury has declared in one voice that New Yorkers will not tolerate mob violence in our own backyard," the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement following the verdict.
Mr. Hare and Mr. Kinsman face a maximum sentence of up to 15 years in prison on the top count, attempted gang assault. They are scheduled to be sentenced in October.
Much of the trial focused on video of the incident from several sources, which showed the minute-long brawl from various angles.
None of the victims took the stand.
The four apparent Antifa members who were involved in the brawl -- referred to in an indictment as Shaved Head, Ponytail, Khaki and Spike Belt -- refused to speak with a police officer who approached them after the incident. Ultimately, prosecutors were only able to charge the defendants with attempted assault, which requires evidence of intent to cause injury, rather than assault, which requires evidence of injury.
Even after determining that the supposed Antifa members were subject to arrest because of their role in the fighting, investigators were never able to learn their identities.
That fact was cited repeatedly by defense lawyers, who sought to put Antifa on trial in absentia. They presented the decentralized group as a collection of ruthless Terminator-like hooligans and "maniacs" who terrorize conservatives while wielding bricks, crowbars and other weapons.
The defense suggested several times that prosecutors were politically motivated or that the case was built on police incompetence. Mr. Kinsman's lawyer, Jack Goldberg, theorized that "the Antifa" and prosecutors were in cahoots.
"These people aren't the New York County district attorney's office," he said, indicating prosecutors during his summation. "They are the New York County district Antifa office."
Prosecutors often referenced the Proud Boys founder, Gavin McInnes, whom they called a "hatemonger," telling jurors that violence was an innate part of the group and that its members relished the chance to brawl with Antifa.
"Their attack was vicious, disproportionate and most important, unnecessary," a prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said of the defendants during closing arguments.
The atmosphere was tense on Oct. 12, when Mr. McInnes, a co-founder of Vice magazine, appeared at the Republican club and, wielding a plastic sword, staged a re-enactment of the 1960 murder of a Japanese socialist leader by a teenage ultranationalist.
Outside, people had gathered chanting "No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist U.S.A." The night before, hooded figures had broken windows at the club, sprayed anarchist symbols on its doors and promised future attacks in leaflets that also denounced Mr. McInnes as a "hipster-fascist clown."
Mr. McInnes departed the club brandishing his plastic sword. Shortly after, 10 members and associates of the Proud Boys punched, kicked and stomped four people wearing black clothes and masks, who the police said had circled the block to intercept them.
Later, Mr. McInnes said Antifa members had ambushed the Proud Boys. But security camera footage obtained by The New York Times showed that a Proud Boys member initiated the encounter by charging at protesters.
Within days, a group called New York City Antifa circulated on social media the names of the Proud Boys who participated in the attack. A police detective testified that the department used some material that had been posted online in its investigation.
Investigators ultimately arrested 10 men connected to the Proud Boys. Seven have pleaded guilty to charges including riot, disorderly conduct and attempted assault. An eighth is awaiting trial.
Video footage showed Mr. Hare yelling, "Proud Boys, you ready?" and running at four black-clad figures, one of whom then threw a plastic water bottle that sailed past him. Mr. Hare was shown punching Ponytail, then swinging and kicking at Shaved Head. Mr. Kinsman was shown barreling into Spike Belt then punching, kicking and stomping him and kicking Shaved Head.
Both defendants testified that their actions on that night were justified because they felt they were being attacked.
Mr. Kinsman told jurors that he did not see how the fighting had begun. He had rushed to help his friends, he said, partly because he had learned from YouTube videos that Antifa had a reputation for being violent.
Mr. Hare testified that "a row" of Antifa members had gotten within 30 feet of the Proud Boys before he went toward them. He had not immediately punched Ponytail, he said, but had tried to remove his mask.
"They were going to hurt us," he said.
Prosecutors presented evidence that Mr. Hare had actually gone about 100 feet rather than 30 to get to the black-clad figures.
They also told jurors that Mr. Hare had punched someone a week earlier during a similar brawl in Providence, R.I., and had posted a picture of himself on Facebook holding an AR-15 rifle and a defaced Antifa flag.
Mr. Steinglass pointed to video from before and after the clash while making the case to jurors that Mr. Hare and Mr. Kinsman had been eager to fight.
As he left the club that night, Mr. Kinsman had taunted protesters with a straight-arm salute and by making punching motions, video showed. After the fighting, video captured him saying that he had "stomped" someone.
Mr. Hare had also reprised the fight with other Proud Boys afterward, exulting and exchanging a hand clasp, then shouting that he had "ripped" one protester's mask off and "hit him right in the head."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Appearing on "Fox and Friends" on Monday morning, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that The New York Times' 1619 Project was "a lie. "
The 1619 Project is an effort by the Times to commemorate the 400th anniversary of slavery's beginning in America. The 1619 Project aims to "reframe the country's history, [understand] 1619 as our true founding, and [place] the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are. "
Gingrich disagreed with the 1619 Project's interpretation of history, which included essays by New York Times writer Nikole Hannah-Jones, Princeton University sociologist Matthew Desmond, and Harvard University professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad.
"The whole project is a lie," Gingrich said. "Look, I think slavery is a terrible thing. I think putting slavery in context is important. We still have slavery in places around the world today, so we recognize this is an ongoing story. "
More: Pete Buttigieg says Trump voters are 'looking the other way on racism'
More: 2020 Democrats are stepping up their courtship of Native American voters. Here’s why.
"Certainly if you're an African American, slavery is at the center of what you see at the American experience. But for most Americans, most of the time, there were a lot of other things going on," Gingrich argued, adding, "There were several hundred thousand white Americans who died in the Civil War in order to free the slaves. "
Gingrich went on to compare The New York Times to Pravda, the Soviet propaganda newspaper, for what he saw as anti-Trump bias.
Hannah-Jones, who led the project, responded to similar criticism on Twitter from Gingrich on Sunday.
"A very proud moment," she declared.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is throwing “my full support" behind the re-election bid of her Massachusetts Democratic colleague Ed Markey in an endorsement video to be released by his campaign on Monday
The 90-second video, which follows a public endorsement by Warren in February, comes as Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III is considering a primary challenge against Markey, potentially triggering a divisive intraparty fight at a time when Democrats are grappling with a rising insurgency calling for fresher and more diverse faces in Congress.
Calling him a friend, fighter and true progressive, Warren says in the video shot late last week that Markey is needed in the Senate “now more than ever," citing his leading track record on climate change, and a career spent “as our country's greatest champion for clean energy jobs and as Big Oil's worst nightmare."
“Ed is my friend and my partner in the Senate," she says, looking straight into the camera. “I've got his back, and I know that he will always have yours. Let's get Ed Markey reelected to the Senate."
Markey, 73, a Malden native, was elected to the Senate in 2013. He has been a fixture of Massachusetts politics since he first won a House seat in the suburbs north of Boston in 1976. He faces at least two candidates in the Democratic primary, labor attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan and businessman and author Steve Pemberton.
But a challenge from Kennedy, the grandson of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, would be formidable. He will decide whether to challenge Markey in the coming weeks, according to a person close to Kennedy.
Warren has opted to stay above the fray in other Democratic primary battles. Over the weekend, she expressed kind words for Markey and Kennedy in a brief interview with a New York Times reporter.
“Eddie has been a great partner in the Senate," she said. But then she also said Kennedy — who along with his wife was a former student — also has been a great partner and is “really an amazing person."
Markey and Kennedy have endorsed Warren's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Markey said in a statement Monday that he was “proud" to have Warren's endorsement, calling her a “great friend and partner."

We have a moral imperative to work together to stop gun violence -BYLN-

Texto completo: As a freshman in college, after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, I wrote a poem titled "Please Mr. President" that was published in The New York Times and then the Daily Herald.
I clung to an idealism meant for storybooks, addressing an envelope with my poem to the White House, half-believing that our president would read and share my words.
He didn’t. I’m still not sure why I was surprised.
I’d directed my hope and plea for change at our president. Two years later, I’ve come to realize that my hopes and pleas mean nothing to the people in power.
When I was 14 years old, standing in my kitchen, my parents told me about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. We reached the absolute worst — a massacre of children — in 2012, and then because the leaders of our country placed priority on other matters, we watched Las Vegas happen.
We watched Parkland happen. And then Sante Fe. And then Pittsburgh. And then Virginia Beach.
Most recently, we learned that 22 people were gunned down in El Paso, Texas, and another nine in Dayton, Ohio.
I have friends in Dayton and in Texas. I was scared for them.
I was scared for all of us.
Each time a tragic event occurs, we follow a script that begins with well-meaning words from people in power and ends without action. During a vigil in Dayton, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s words were overshadowed by people shouting, "Do something."
This discussion has been under way for a long time, but it’s difficult to move forward when progress is stalled by one excuse or another. It’s difficult to prioritize empathy, integrity and a sense of moral responsibility in a dialogue where money seems to supersede everything else.
Lately, politicians and civilians alike have resorted to blaming particular groups of people, hoping to pinpoint the problem and shift blame. We don’t have time for that. We have allowed the analysis, blaming and media coverage of mass shootings to become a partisan issue.
Yet it always has been, and will remain, a moral issue in which politics has no place. Set aside the right and left for a moment and realize that our own people are dying because of these divisions.
America, we must bind together and demand that this violence ends. We are blessed to look at that flag of red, white and blue fluttering in the breeze and remember the strength and power it represents.
America, we have so much potential for good, but we each have to want it.
A little over a week ago at Wrigley Field, I rose for the national anthem, feeling hopeful and hopeless at the same time. I watched our American flag fly at half-staff in light of the Ohio and Texas shootings.
In a moment void of partisan politics, I listened to acoustic guitar notes and patriotic lyrics waft over the baseball diamond. I watched 40,000 baseball fans rise together, bound by a pride and love for our nation.
It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
It was during those few moments that I realized we each owe it to ourselves and our country to start demanding changes immediately.
The time for politicians’ well-meaning words is over. People are tired of well-meaning words because well-meaning words represent a fear to do something more.
America, I don’t want to appeal to the emotions of Congress or the president. I want to appeal to you. To your emotions and your hearts.
To the parents who send their kids on buses to school, trusting each day that their children’s education will not be compromised because of gun violence. To the families taking their kids to the movies, to concerts, to shopping malls, praying that their city won’t be in the headlines the next day because of gun violence.
I don’t think it wise for any of us to wait for Congress to change its predictable pattern. It has been given ample chances to step forward and make concrete changes to prevent gun violence. It won’t bring changes to the table on its own.
And if it won’t, then America, we must.
The movement for change starts from the ground up, and it starts with the people. And not just the people or towns affected by gun violence but every person in every city. So let’s start with the small steps.
We can fill the inboxes of congressmen and women with requests for new laws. We can write letters to senators asking for sessions on gun regulation. We can speak peacefully and directly to our governors about taking action to solve this problem instead of talking about it, just as a group of people did during Gov. DeWine’s speech.
Countless gun reform groups are already advocating for change. Everytown for Gun Safety, started in 2006, has nearly 6 million supporters. America, we can join them.
For the safety and protection of our citizens, we each must step forward and speak until the people in power cannot ignore us.

Texto completo: A panel on MSNBC's Deadline: White House speculated that President Trump has Alzheimer's and that his cabinet should consider invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.
Nicolle Wallace led the panel on Friday, which featured Al Sharpton, Philip Rucker, Alexi McCammond, and Tim Miller. Focusing on how the president talked about the economy and also encouraged a rally attendee to start exercising, the conversation began with Rucker discussing what he saw at Trump's Thursday night rally in New Hampshire.
"[Trump] repeated points he had already made earlier in the evening as if he did not remember already making them," Wallace said, reading a line from the New York Times' coverage of his speech. "David Brooks reported in 2017 that a bunch of Republicans came out of a meeting where Donald Trump displayed some signs that were similar to the early stages of Alzheimer's."
MSNBC panel speculates Trump could have Alzheimer's and 25th amendment should be considered
She continued, reading that "in and out of the rooms people, either disparagingly or affectionately, are saying at an increased clip, he's crazy."
"You know, there's pervasive reporting in this regard and if it was grandpa, you would probably take him to see a neurologist or someone who specializes in geriatric medicine. That hasn't happened here that we know of," said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney. "The remedy is the 25th Amendment and that requires an intact cabinet, which Trump does not have. Whether by design or by accident, most of the cabinet is acting. We don't know what the mix would look like in a vote, and there's no will to take that on, in any event."
"There's no will to fill a cabinet with the kind of appointees that would have that power," Wallace added.

Texto completo: During an episode of Comedy Central’s “Drunk History,” comedian Nicole Byer described a conflict between the late Lady Bird Johnson and actress-singer Eartha Kitt when Johnson was first lady.
During a July 2 episode, Byer said: “Lady Bird calls the CIA and she goes, ‘Yo listen, this bitch? I don’t like this bitch. You better find everything you can about her so I can send it to other people so she doesn’t work. Lady Bird is just like, ‘Destroy her.’ ”
We had to know whether Byer’s description of Johnson was accurate. Comedy Central did not return a request for more information, so we consulted archival news coverage and spoke with historians to check this claim.
Kitt’s comments
Kitt’s comments, made during a luncheon at the White House to discuss crime among young people, were well documented in the press, as they caused quite a commotion.
Both President Lyndon Johnson and the first lady were at the luncheon. When Kitt rose to speak, she offered a sharp condemnation of the Vietnam War, according to a Jan. 19, 1968, New York Times story.
“You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed,” Kitt said during the luncheon, according to the Times. “They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don’t want to go to school because they’re going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.”
Lady Bird Johnson recalled Kitt’s remarks in a Jan. 18, 1968, entry in her audio diary. She said that Kitt took a step toward her, “looking with intense directness at me,” when she offered her critique.
The CIA’s Kitt file
Byer said Lady Bird Johnson asked the CIA to find damaging information on Kitt after the luncheon. We couldn’t find evidence of this direct request.
But the Secret Service did request information about Kitt from the CIA the day after the women’s luncheon, according to a Times report. Historians say it is unclear who directed the Secret Service to make the request.
Secret Service officials said they asked the CIA for information on Kitt the day after the luncheon to see if she was a threat to President Johnson or others under their protection, according to the Times.
The CIA gave a three-page report on Kitt to the Secret Service, a file the agency had maintained since at least 1956, because Kitt had done work overseas, the Times reported.
The report stated that Kitt had a “very nasty disposition” and described her as “being a spoiled child, very crude and having a vile tongue.”
We submitted an open records request to the CIA seeking the information in the report. The CIA responded: “We did not locate any responsive records that would reveal a publicly acknowledged CIA affiliation with the subject.”
John Wilson, an archivist at the LBJ Presidential Library, said he doubts Lady Bird Johnson would have asked the CIA to investigate the star, and if she did, she would not have put it in writing.
“As far as actual power, first ladies don’t have very much, but people would tend to listen, I would think,” Wilson said. “Whether or not she should or could ask is one thing, but if she did ask them informally, they would be a lot more likely to pay attention.”
Michael Gillette, a former historian at the LBJ Presidential Library, said that Johnson would not have wanted to fan the flames around the Kitt incident.
“I knew her a long time and I knew a lot of people who knew her better than I did, and that’s so out of character for her that it’s almost laughable,” Gillette said.
Our ruling
“Drunk History” claimed former first lady Lady Bird Johnson demanded the CIA find damning information on singer Eartha Kitt.
While the Secret Service did request information from the CIA after the luncheon, there is no evidence to support the idea that Lady Bird Johnson asked for the information. The Secret Service said the request was made for security purposes, not to “destroy her.”
We rate this claim Mostly False.

Texto completo: How do we actually record interviews with our far-flung Times correspondents around the world?
With a cell phone. Two cell phones, actually.
We call it a "self-sync." We used the technique several times this past week, with our colleagues Javier Hernández in Hong Kong and Paul Mozur in Beijing.
The quality of audio from a cell phone call is notoriously poor -- it sounds distant and staticky. You really don't want to listen to it for 25 minutes.
But everybody has a cell phone, making it our best option. So we ask guests to make use of the voice recorder built into their phones.
They hold one phone to their left ear, the other to the right. One is used for a regular phone call, to speak to me for the interview. The other is used to capture the guest's side of the conversation using the phone's internal voice recorder. (That phone is placed on airplane mode to avoid pesky interruptions.)
At the end of the interview, guests send us the recording by email, and we match it up to the studio recording of my side of the interview. Voilà! You have a "Daily" interview.
The process produces surprisingly high-quality recordings.
Whenever we can, we send producers with professional microphones to record guests in faraway places. But when we can't, because of tight deadlines or logistics, we deploy the two-phone system.
It sounds -- and no doubt looks -- funny, these reporters with two phones to their face, but it works.

Sneak peek of a new series
"They say our people were born on the water. When it occurred, no one can say for certain. Perhaps it was in the second week or the third, but surely by the fourth, when they had not seen their land or any land for so many days that they lost count."
Nikole Hannah-Jones says these words at the beginning of our special multipart audio series "1619," which debuts on "The Daily" on Tuesday, Aug. 20. On that day 400 years ago, a ship carrying more than 20 enslaved Africans arrived in the British colony of Virginia. No aspect of the country that would be formed here has been untouched by the 250 years of slavery that followed. So on the anniversary of that fateful moment, we're finally telling the story of who we are as a country.
The audio series is part of a range of Times coverage, including a special issue of the Magazine. Look out for "1619" at nytimes.com/thedaily or in your podcast feed next week, and listen to a trailer for the series here:

What we're listening to
Who: Julia Simon, audience & operations
What: The "Nature Cure" series from "Outside Podcast"
Where to start: "Why a Walk in the Woods Cures the Blues"
Living in New York City, it takes work to find nature. I do everything I can to take in pockets of it -- count the trees on my walk to the subway, or stare at the water while riding my bike along the Hudson (I know, I should probably look straight ahead). But I hadn't really considered why I did things like that until I found a four-part audio series from Outside magazine on how spending time in nature matters for our well-being. One episode focuses on the growing movement of health care providers prescribing time outdoors, and another is about how experiencing awe in nature expands your understanding of the world as a whole. I had serendipitously pressed play on my favorite of the series, "Why a Walk in the Woods Cures the Blues," while strolling through Fort Greene Park. As I listened to the story about the calming effect of "bathing" in forest trees, I found myself doing a new thing -- I stopped hurrying along. Instead, I took off my sandals and sat on the grass. I looked up at the leaves and watched the squirrels, and then I felt something powerful. It's hard to describe that feeling, but for a moment, the skyscrapers and city noises fell away.

Trump’s policy on China: incoherent, values-free

Resumen: [...]it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time. When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people." What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights.

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country’s foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Donald Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country — and weakening it, too — by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China’s dictatorship.
We have long wondered when the thoughtless chaos of Trump’s presidency would finally catch up with him and endanger our country. How long could an administration that replaces policy with impulse and thinking with tweeting stay out of crisis? The disarray around Trump’s China policy and the economic turmoil it has unleashed tell us that moment is now.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think that he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping’s brutally authoritarian rule.
"He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy Tuesday on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
This reaction is scandalous from the leader of a nation whose Constitution begins with the words: "We the People." When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
But Trump’s correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market’s dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s about-face seemed motivated not by any grand strategy but by a purely selfish concern for his own re-election. "Nobody wants to run for president, on either party, in the middle of a recession," Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO, told CNBC.
What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China’s abuses, Trump’s erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the U.S. as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump’s affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation’s domestic fabric by dividing us against each other, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

New York Times glosses over Mellon heiress’ support for abortion and eugenics to focus on her anti-immigration positions

Texto completo: Talk about being slow on the uptake.
A lengthy New York Times profile this week on Cordelia Scaife May, the late heiress to the Mellon banking fortune, suggests her personal politics took a "darker” turn when she embraced extreme anti-immigrant positions, not when she slummed for decades with eugenicists and abortionists.
Because, for the New York Times, sidling up to race-obsessed abortion fanatics like Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger is nothing compared to calling for America’s borders to be sealed.
The New York Times tracks how May, an “environmental-minded socialite,” went from being an “indifferent student, an unhappy young bride” and “a miscast socialite” to being one of the top funders of hard-line nativist groups. The narrative offered by the New York Times is that May went from good to bad, that her story is one of a well-intentioned progressive who went too far.
That all may be. But the report, titled “Why an Heiress Spent Her Fortune Trying to Keep Immigrants Out,” is simply mistaken when it suggests May’s politics took a turn for the worse when she embraced severe anti-immigrant positions. I can assure you her descent into ugliness happened long before that — and that fact is based on the New York Times’ own reporting. You just have to read a bit before you get there.
The 23rd and 24th paragraphs read:
But it was Margaret Sanger, the famous and, in some circles, scandalous founder of Planned Parenthood, who provided the sense of direction Mrs. May had craved. Mrs. Sanger was a close friend of her grandmother. Mrs. May acknowledged that it was not the birth control pioneer’s “works or ideals” that initially appealed to her but the fact that she had been jailed for her activities. Mrs. May first worked for the Planned Parenthood chapter in Pittsburgh and later joined the board of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. “I have always admired and tried to take a part in the work that you started,” she wrote in a 1961 letter to Mrs. Sanger.
Just so we are all on the same page: Margaret Sanger is the same lunatic who once wrote that the United States should “keep the doors of immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as feebleminded, idiots, morons, Insane, syphilitic, epileptic, criminal, professional prostitutes, and others in this class barred by the immigration laws of 1924.”
This is the same woman who provided May with the "sense of direction" she "craved," back before the wealthy socialite's "darker” turn, according to the New York Times.
Planned Parenthood’s founder also wrote that a “stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.”
Sanger, who also once said, “More children from the fit, less from the unfit — that is the chief aim of birth control,” wrote of those she considered “unfit” that they ought to be relocated to “farm lands and homesteads” where “they would be taught to work under competent instructors for the period of their entire lives.”
None of this is mentioned in the New York Times report, by the way. May’s devotion to Sanger is mentioned only matter-of-factly in a few paragraphs that recount the heiress' introduction to politics and activism.
The article's 26th paragraph continues:
Her twin passions, protecting natural habitats and helping women prevent unplanned pregnancies, merged over time into a single goal of preserving the environment by discouraging offspring altogether. “The unwanted child is not the problem,” she would later write, “but, rather, the wanted one that society, for diverse cultural reasons, demands.”
There is more:
For some of America’s elite in the 1960s and ’70s, supporting efforts to limit population growth was partly an act of noblesse oblige. The Fords donated millions for United Nations-backed family planning projects worldwide. Mrs. May joined the board of the Population Council, a group founded by John D. Rockefeller III that emphasized family planning and economic development as ways to lower birthrates around the world. She and some relatives together contributed $11.4 million to the council during the 1960s, and Mrs. May joined the group’s president, Frank Notestein, on trips to Asia to review projects.
May would go on to work for Planned Parenthood for more than two decades, according to the New York Times, all the while embracing her “passion” for helping “women prevent unplanned pregnancies.” She left to pursue what would eventually become her lifelong pursuit of keeping immigrants out of America. May chased this dream right until her death in 2005.
To recap: By the time May went full nativist over immigration, she was already a population control enthusiast working for the nation’s largest provider of abortion. She was also a willing and eager acolyte of Sanger, the high priestess of the Church of Eugenicist.
Maybe these pursuits are not as different as the New York Times assumes.
In other words, I think we can say May's supposed turn happened a little before immigration became her chief focus.

Texto completo: LeBron James was back in his hometown of Akron on Wednesday afternoon, standing atop a basketball court.
Unlike many others he’s visited throughout his life, this one was unique: The multicolored surface and brand new hoops are just outside the doors of the I Promise School that he helped open last year. Ushering in the court, sponsored by the 2K foundation, alongside his former high school teammates who once won a national championship in 2003, James hoped that the new court would help build bonds that last longer than typical pick-up games.
“You can create a brotherhood, or sisterhood, to be able to create things that last forever,” he said to a small gathering of students, media and other community members at the unveiling.
He then gestured to his St. Vincent-St.Mary’s teammates: “We created a friendship over 25 years ago, and we’re still standing strong.”
It’s been one year since the I Promise School began, and already the school has ambitions of standing the test of time.
In April, the New York Times reported that 90 percent of the school’s 240 students had met or exceeded their individual growth goals math and reading, which was well ahead of the curve in the school district. That feat is considered more remarkable given that the school is designed to take in the most at-risk and struggling students. The Akron Beacon Journal also reported that all but one of the students who attended last year decided to re-enroll this year — retention that is unparalleled in the area.
But the school doesn’t plan on resting on its early laurels: The student body is expanding to 344 this academic year as IPS adds fifth graders to its third- and fourth-grade levels. The staff is also growing to keep a 20-to-1 student-to-teacher ratio: Small class sizes are one of the top principles of the publicly operated school.
The court is also a small part of a larger rollout of amenities. IPS also has a new digital media lab that includes a broadcast facility. Adding to features for families that already exist, the school has put in a Family Resource Center that now includes legal help and adult education classes for parents of students, as well as laundry facilities to help families who don’t have access to washers and dryers at home (the school found that unlaundered clothes contributed to absenteeism).
There’s also a more permanent housing for intervention specialists, who can identify specific issues for students while trying to avoid punishments such as suspensions that cause them to miss more school.
As the school eventually levels up to accomodate grades three through eight, officials anticipate more change and possibly consideration for adding another building to the complex.
For now, a court is a good start.

Texto completo: Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim announced a lawsuit Tuesday against e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs, contending the company "intentionally created addicted teen customers to continuously come back looking for another fix." The merits of the specific case against Juul will be sorted out in court, but there is a broader reach to the alarm bells that Nerheim is sounding. In short, teen vaping is here, it’s dangerous and it poses the threat of a broad epidemic.
Illinois lawmakers recognized that truth when they included e-cigarettes in a new law that prohibits the sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products to anyone under 21 years old. Juul, it is worth pointing out, has launched major ad campaigns with some of the nation’s largest print and online news organizations declaring its support for such restrictions on the sale of vapor products.
The sincerity of Juul’s appeal may be open to question, but there’s no room for doubt that it and Illinois’ new regulations are running several steps behind the e-cigarette monster that is rampaging through suburban middle and high schools.
At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, Stevenson High School senior Vrushali Thakkar described classrooms in which students use e-cigarettes when teachers leave the room. A New York Times story this week reports the son of an anti-e-cigarette activist describing the flavors he and his friends prefer and the appeal to some kids of products whose higher nicotine content provide "a bigger head rush."
But, evidence isn’t merely anecdotal. The National Institute on Drug Abuse cites studies showing that more than 16% of high school seniors — and nearly 10% of eighth-graders have used e-cigarettes in the past month. Another National Institutes of Health survey found that about 37% of high school seniors reported vaping in 2018. The figure was 28% a year earlier.
While vape companies like to declare that their product is intended only to help people stop smoking, they may be working toward the precise opposite. The NIH report points to studies showing that nearly 31 percent of students who vape graduate to traditional cigarettes and tobacco products within six months.
According to The New York Times, Trump administration health officials recognize the problem and are considering counter measures. The outgoing FDA commissioner proposed isolating e-cigarette products at retailers where they won’t be accessible to teenagers and requiring merchants to demand purchasers show identification.
If adopted, such measures may be a start. But the situation also requires a broader societal response. Nerheim predicted Tuesday that "it will take years" to overcome the impact e-cigarettes have made on the present generation of teenagers. That is not going to happen merely by punishing companies that have made impressionable children think it’s harmless and cool to use their dangerous product. It also requires broad recognition by all of us of the need to make them realize that neither of those things is true.

O'Rourke to return to campaign trail

Texto completo: O'Rourke stayed in
El Paso while Democratic opponents were in Iowa at the state fair, a key campaign stop.
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke will return to the presidential campaign trail after spending more than a week in his hometown of El Paso following a deadly mass shooting at a local Walmart.
The former U.S. Congressman plans to give a speech at 7:15 a.m. MT Thursday in El Paso. He'll return to campaigning after.
Last week, O'Rourke hit pause on stumping.
He was on the campaign trail in Las Vegas and left for El Paso after a white gunman targeting Hispanics opened fire and killed 22 people at the store near Cielo Vista Mall on Aug. 3.
Since then, O'Rourke has made stops in the community, visiting a makeshift memorial for those killed in the attack, attending assemblies at local high schools and meeting with with family members of victims.
O'Rourke's speech in El Paso "will outline the path forward for his presidential campaign and for the future of the country," according to a news release from his campaign.
"Beto will continue to seek the Democratic nomination for President," the release reads.
Some have said the former Senate candidate who challenged Sen. Ted Cruz before launching his presidential bid should again turn his attentions to the Senate — this time running against Sen. John Cornyn.
The Houston Chronicle's editorial board pushed for the switch in a recent editorial. But O'Rourke and his team have maintained his eyes should remain on the White House.
"I'm running for president," O'Rourke told the New York Times. "This community holds so much for the rest of the country. Whether it's immigration, whether it's our safety, whether it's our connection to the rest of the world, whether it's the fact that we're on the front line of so many issues that can and will define America."
O'Rourke stayed in El Paso while Democratic opponents were in Iowa at the state fair, a key campaign stop. He explained Friday it was important for him to be in El Paso with his family and the community to attend funerals and go to the memorial by Walmart, where flowers, candles and other mementos to those killed lay.
"I feel so strongly about the need for this community to heal and also the opportunity for this community to ensure that we are not defined by this act of terror but instead are defined by how overcome that," O'Rourke said. "We all have, all of us, have a responsibility and a role, and I'm trying to do my best on behalf of my community at this moment."
The former El Paso City Council and U.S. congressman member has been critical of President Donald Trump, saying he shouldn't visit the city and condemning his rhetoric about immigrants and race.
"As long as the President employs this rhetoric, and as long as it is tolerated or ignored by so many, tragedies like these will continue to tear our country apart," O'Rourke said in a Tuesday CNN op-ed.

'Huddled Masses' Meant Europeans, Official Says

Texto completo: Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, one of the Trump administration's top immigration officials, set off a controversy this week with comments about "The New Colossus," the 136-year-old sonnet at the base of the Statue of Liberty.
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," reads the poem, by Emma Lazarus.
But on Tuesday morning, Mr. Cuccinelli, the acting director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, added a caveat.
"Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet, and who will not become a public charge," he said. That evening, he said the poem referred to "people coming from Europe."
Mr. Cuccinelli had been speaking to news outlets about the Trump administration's new "public charge" rule targeting legal immigrants who want to remain in the United States but are deemed likely to use government benefit programs.
As he made the rounds, at least three journalists asked him about "The New Colossus."
Mr. Cuccinelli's responses drew swift condemnation from those opposed to the new rule -- a backlash that also spoke to the enduring symbolic significance of the statue and its sonnet on Liberty Island, just southwest of Manhattan.
"Our values are etched in stone on the Statue of Liberty," Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential candidate, said on Twitter on Tuesday. "They will not be replaced."
Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, posted: "The words of the Statue of Liberty won't be changed at the racist whims of this administration. And neither will the character of this country."
In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Cuccinelli said that "the theme of the left media is to ask about a poem, not talk about the policy that is almost as old as America itself, and that is we expect immigrants who come here to support themselves and not go on welfare."
Mr. Cuccinelli began facing questions about the poem on Monday, when he gave a news conference at the White House.
"You're implementing a public charge rule for the first time," Steven Portnoy, a journalist for CBS News Radio, said. "Is that sentiment -- give us your tired, your poor -- still operative in the United States? Or should those words come down?"
Mr. Cuccinelli responded that he was "certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statue of Liberty," and added that the United States had a long history of welcoming migrants.
The poem came up again on Tuesday morning, during an interview with Rachel Martin on National Public Radio.
"Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty -- 'give me your tired, your poor' -- are also part of the American ethos?" Ms. Martin asked.
"They certainly are," Mr. Cuccinelli said, before adding words of his own: "Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet, and who will not become a public charge."
That comment was repeated back to him later on Tuesday, during an interview with Erin Burnett on CNN.
Ms. Burnett read the poem's final lines aloud and added: "Wretched, poor, refuse -- right? That's what the poem says America's supposed to stand for. So what do you think America stands for?"
"Well, of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies where people were considered wretched if they weren't in the right class," Mr. Cuccinelli said.
"And it was introduced, it was written one year after the first federal public charge rule was written," he added. "That says, and I'll quote it, 'Any person unable to take care of himself without becoming a public charge' would be inadmissible. Or, in the terms that my agency deals with, they can't do what's called adjusting status: getting a green card, becoming legal permanent residents."
Mr. Cuccinelli was referring to the Immigration Act of 1882, which said the United States could deny entry to people who were likely to become a "public charge." That was also the year that the Chinese Exclusion Act was put in place.
Excluding people because of their circumstances or ethnicity was not new to the United States, but until the late 19th century, many of those policy decisions had been left to states and localities.
The Trump administration's new immigration rule was pushed by the White House adviser Stephen Miller, who has also been asked to reckon with the 1883 sonnet. A reporter read him a line from the poem in 2017, when Mr. Miller was defending President Trump's plan to cut legal immigration by half.
"The poem that you're referring to was added later," he said. "It's not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty."
It is true that the statue has not always been associated with migration. The monument was conceived as a celebration of liberty, the end of slavery and the camaraderie between France and the United States.
The French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi originally designed the statue as a lighthouse for the Suez Canal in Egypt. After that project fell through, he became an enthusiastic proponent of putting Lady Liberty in New York Harbor. It was inaugurated on a soggy day in October 1886.
Around that time, Lazarus and many others thought the United States benefited from migrants, or had a moral duty to accept them, said Paul A. Kramer, an associate professor of history at Vanderbilt University. But a rising tide of voices favored exclusion.
"The 1880s were a real pivotal moment where you see these very strong pro-immigration approaches colliding with these new nativist and racist approaches," Dr. Kramer said.
Lazarus wrote "The New Colossus" in 1883 as part of a fund-raising campaign to pay for the statue's American-made pedestal. She was a fourth-generation American whose Sephardic Jewish family was well established in New York.
Lazarus wrote poems and essays about violent pogroms against Jewish people overseas, and she became an advocate for Jews who came to the United States in the late 1800s, fleeing persecution in Europe and Russia.
"Ms. Lazarus not only insisted that American Jews come to the aid of Jewish refugees," Esther Schor, a biographer of Lazarus and a professor of American Jewish studies at Princeton, wrote in a column for The New York Times. "She wrote 'The New Colossus' to argue that aiding the poor and oppressed of all lands was the mission of all Americans, the mission of America itself."
Lazarus died in 1887; her poem was not affixed to the statue until 1903. It took years after that for the sonnet and the statue to meld in the popular imagination, but, with time, the figure that now towers more than 300 feet over Upper New York Bay came to be understood as the Mother of Exiles.
In his statement, Mr. Cuccinelli said that his agency was "tasked with enforcing the law, not a poem."
"All of the poetry discussion," he added, "is a complete distraction from the fact that the Trump administration is upholding the rule of law."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: One of the most basic duties of our federal government is to protect citizens against the threat of attack from hostile foreign powers. Each year, we spend hundreds of billions to insure that our military forces have the tools they need to keep us safe from foreign invasion or attack so that we can lead out our lives in peace and pursue our happiness.
But in the 21st Century, a new threat to our citizens has arisen from hostile powers abroad. Today, foreign governments are strategically targeting Americans through cyberattacks against email and other electronically stored information systems. These foreign governments do so in order to intimidate and silence perceived enemies, influence debates over policy, and ultimately to achieve political outcomes that benefit them rather than the United States.
Unfortunately, it is doubtful that we are currently equipped to deal adequately with these threats. Just recently, the New York Times reported that Chinese-sponsored hackers were behind the disruption of information systems administered by the city of Baltimore. They shut down email and disrupted real estate sales, water bills, health alerts, and many other city services. According to the report, these cybercriminals have been targeting other towns, cities, hospitals, airports, rail, ATMs, and university systems across the country. They have paralyzed operations, stolen personal information, and otherwise wreaked havoc.
This is just the latest in a series of state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting U.S. companies and U.S. citizens. Back in 2014, North Korean hackers broke into computer systems at Sony Pictures and threatened the release of confidential data unless the entertainment company canceled the release of an upcoming motion picture, The Interview, critical of the North Korean regime. Sony complied with the demands.
Since 2017, North Korea has engaged in “increasingly hostile cyber activities, including theft [and] website vandalism” according to the Congressional Research Service. Government-backed hackers have reportedly conducted cyber-espionage against tens of thousands of U.S. targets, accessing computer networks and intellectual property, and raking in hundreds of millions through cyber-crime.
The same group of Russian hackers responsible for interfering in the 2016 presidential election with a cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee have reportedly gone after hotel WiFi networks and American companies like FedEx and Merck.
Iranian hackers have used ransomware widely against U.S. citizens.
And late last year, National Security Advisor John Bolton verified that China had been behind the 2015 cyberattack on the Office of Personnel Management, the most extensive hack of U.S. government data in history, which entailed the theft of personal data for over 22 million people (most of them federal government employees), including Social Security numbers, fingerprints, passwords, and other personal information gathered in the process of granting security clearances.
This issue transcends party lines. Both Republicans and Democrats — as well as liberal and conservative think tanks — have been targeted for perceived opposition to the interests of governments sponsoring the cyberattacks. The common thread is a desire to intimidate opponents of a particular agenda favored by a foreign government, by means of blackmail, theft, extortion, and invasion of privacy. Cyberattacks have become the weapon of choice for bad foreign actors who want to invade the privacy of American citizens in their quest to infiltrate the American political system to further their own interests.
The fact is, foreign governments have been aggressively using cyberattacks on private data systems for years to influence politics and policy in the U.S. They have realized that they can effectively curtail the First Amendment rights of American citizens and compromise our election system through the use of espionage organizations to infiltrate, intimidate, and silence opposition to their governments' stated policy aims. They are willing to invest a lot of resources to do it, and there is little risk of retribution because victims lack effective means to strike back. American courts have consistently ruled that foreign governments have immunity from legal action on the part of U.S. plaintiffs, including the seizure of assets, as a result of the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act, a law passed in 1976 before the advent of the Internet.
In short, our laws provide hostile powers with immunity for their nefarious behavior by allowing them to exploit a legal loophole.
Congress should enact a cyberattack exception to the FSIA to protect the privacy and property of Americans. A clear precedent for such action already exists: Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted several laws that limit sovereign immunity for states sponsors of terrorism, providing a cause of action to certain victims of terror attacks. As recently as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which was passed over President Obama’s veto in 2016, Congress has engaged legislation that reduces FSIA’s jurisdictional immunity in the terrorism context. A cyberattack exception would extend the same protections to hacking victims as terrorism victims currently enjoy.
Until Congress acts, foreign governments such as Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China will have a free hand to intimidate and silence Americans. That’s why we have come together as Republicans and Democrats to found Americans for Transparency and Accountability, a new organization which seeks to protect our democratic system and promote a healthier, more transparent debate about policy issues. We will advocate for policies that would place greater constraints on foreign influence campaigns, beginning with an update to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
It is time for all of us to come together to take measures that will effectively protect Americans from cyberattacks sponsored or conducted by foreign governments.
Kirk Thompson is the president of Redshift Strategy and a board member of Americans for Transparency and Accountability.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Stacey Abrams, former Democratic nominee for Georgia governor, on Wednesday said she would be "honored" to be the vice-presidential running mate to "any" of the nearly two dozen 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
“I would be honored to be considered by any nominee,” she said in an interview with The New York Times published Wednesday.
Tuesday, Abrams quashed months of speculation about her possibly jumping into the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential field. Instead, the Georgia Democrat announced an initiative called Fair Fight 2020, which will staff and fund voter protection teams in battleground states across the country ahead of the 2020 elections.
More: Stacey Abrams isn't running for president — she's launching a voter protection program
Following her defeat to Republican Brian Kemp in the Georgia governor's race during the 2018 midterms, Abrams was floated as a possible presidential candidate — something she told media multiple times that she was considering. In April, Abrams also decided against running for Senate, after being urged by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. , to consider that 2020 contest.
Abrams told the Times that she wouldn't have "publicly raised the possibility” of launching a 2020 presidential campaign “if it was not a legitimate thought. "
She added that she is pleased with the current Democratic field.
Abrams met with former Vice President Joe Biden in April, which sparked rumors that she would be his running mate. However, she later told MSNBC she was not interested in being a primary candidate's running mate.
"I do not believe you run for second place and I do not intend to enter a presidential race as a primary candidate for vice president," she said at the time.
Steve King: 2020 presidential candidates, GOP challenger, condemn 'rape and incest' remarks
A number of 2020 Democrats have said they would be open to having a woman as their running mate, including former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Biden.
In her interview with the Times, Abrams said she believes that her new initiative is the "strongest contribution" she could make to the 2020 Democratic primary.
“I’ve just come to the decision that my best value add, the strongest contribution I can give to this primary, would be to make sure our nominee is coming into an environment where there’s strong voter protections in place,” she said.

Oh, how media has changed Other Voices

Texto completo: My topic isn't to glorify the good old days when the media was more civilized, non-partisan, and professional. It is to lament what it has become.
The media - print, radio, television, and social - still do what has always been their job. It informs, analyzes, entertains, gives advice, sells products, and advocates on behalf of sports teams, stocks and bonds, travel, cultural events, personalities, governments, politicians, candidates, and policies. Only now, as the humorist Jimmy Durante used to say: "Everybody is getting into the act."
We are enveloped by the media, capturing our attention, consumption, and belief. Nationally, where there were four major TV outlets there are now over 50 and counting. Radio, too, has blossomed. Enter the internet, exploding from nothing. The foreign media has even joined the fray. Local media hangs on, a small but important niche compared to the big picture bombarding us.
Needless to say, the mass media competes, each element fighting for our attention. After all, they sell products to pay their expenses. They are all businesses depending upon advertisers and subscribers.
As the competition increases, the more the media focus on their fundraising, and so they use more and more the proven methods to sell themselves.
One of the most notable and more frequent methods media employ is to become overtly partisan. Yes, it has always been with us. Early in American history found the media kings, newspapers, lined up with political parties, policies, and candidates to the point that some became "yellow" or unprofessionally and truthfully biased.
Then radio and televangelists appeared that made no secret in their praise and or condemnation of political leaders and government policies. Billy Sunday and Billy Graham were not the first and Jerry Falwell was not the last to make clear their political preferences. Radio journalists, Lowell Thomas and Walter Winchell come to mind, also made known their political positions. Now television has spawned a plethora of partisan media. We know, don't we, where Fox News and MSNBC stand or where CNN leans?
As politicians cultivate and feed a political base of supporters, media does as well. The more people in the base (viewers, listeners, and readers), the more they can charge advertisers. Even the media that proclaim themselves non-partisan, such as The New York Times, Washington Post, PBS, ABC, CBS, and NBC, do so to attract readers and viewers who want straight news, not propaganda.
A second and more overtly historical method media employ to gain strength in the competition for consumers is to report, even foment conflict.
Conflict sells. It is exciting; it provokes acceptance or rejection, and it creates intrigue as to conflict's outcome - the same attraction of sports competition. Our current president paved his way to the White House by mastering media conflict. He loves it. Provokes it, the more outrageous the better, persists in it to dominate the news and feed and expand his political base while dividing his opponents.
He is not alone in creating conflict and using it to attract consumers. CNN moderators in charge of the recent Democratic "debates" demanded conflict from the candidates, giving them no choice. They demanded simple-minded sound bites by enforcing stingy time limits.
They guaranteed attacks by asking the candidates to respond to any one who disagreed. In turn, those who were attacked by the responder were told to continue the conflict. CNN targeted Joe Biden, the prime target as the front runner. As a result of this staged prize fight, the presentation of serious policy positions was neglected, even omitted.
Yes, CNN got a big audience but the audience got exciting crumbs. Trump triumphed.
Yuk!

Civility is dead — except in real life

Texto completo: YUMA, COLORADO — Dressed in white slacks, a blouse, and an oversized hat—the kind you wear when the sun and heat are insufferable — Donna Bray walks up to U.S. Senator Cory Gardner along Albany Street with a broad smile on her face and a clipboard in her hand.
Like just about everyone in this town, she extends her hand. Then she introduces herself, which is something just about nobody in this town does. That's because Gardner knows almost all 3,000 people in his hometown.
“Good morning senator, I just wanted to say hello. My name is Donna Bray, and I am hopefully one of your challengers.” Bray is one of 14 contenders seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Gardner.
Gardner’s smile is genuine, and so is Bray’s. He welcomes her to the town his family has lived in for over 100 years, introduces her to his children Allison and Thatcher (the latter is weaving through the crowd on his bicycle that has a sign on it that says, “Vote for my Daddy”). Then he compliments her prudent hat choice.
“My husband is Australian,” she explains, “and he taught me the importance of hats.”
The two chit-chat about Yuma, the need to stay hydrated, and so forth. The banter goes on for a few minutes and is, frankly, normal.
It’s Yuma County parade day in this plains town in Eastern Colorado. The local Lions Club is handing out American Flags just in front of Bray and Gardner. The high school basketball team who just won their second straight state basketball championship is to their right, loading up on bottles of chocolate and white milk from the Yuma Dairy to hand out to parade goers.
Parker Dressel is about to take his place in the parade. He just won the state hog championship at the county fair over the weekend.
“He sold his pig for $5,500 last night,” Gardner notes with pride.
Dressel blushes at the attention and looks down. The 12-year-old says he raised the pig and will reinvest his winnings. “I am going to use the money to buy more pigs."
Minutes later, Lorena Garcia who is a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Colorado, also approaches Gardner. Dressed in jeans, a campaign shirt with her slogan “Put People First” on the back and also wisely wearing a straw hat, she exchanges pleasantries with her senator whom she hopes to unseat.
Even before last weekend’s horrific murders in Texas and Ohio took place, the idea of civility and grace between opponents in a face-to-face encounter would sound absurd. Our national media and our social media advance the narrative that candidates aren’t supposed to merely be on opposite sides of issues, but that they are expected to loathe each other.
Nowadays, being civil to the other side is possibly unsafe. It’s a sure way to get attacked by your own side. Consider the meltdown by the Left when the New York Times ran a banner headline titled, “Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism”, the day after President Donald Trump spoke to the nation after the weekend massacres, urging unity against racism.
“Lives literally depend on you doing better,” tweeted 2020 Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey, upset that the headline didn't make Trump look bad. But New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was far more aggressive: “Let this front page serve as a reminder of how supremacy is aided by and often relies upon the cowardice of mainstream institutions.”
Twitter vitriol then increased over the week. One congressman's campaign tweeted out names and occupations of his own constituents to shame them for donating to Trump.
It's all a striking contrast to the normal interaction between Gardner and two of his potential opponents. Seeing these real human interactions should be a reminder that when you turn on cable news and watch the panels of pundits, candidates and experts explaining how their side is better and the other side is the devil, you are watching "experts" who rarely ever observe people outside of social media.
There is a simple reason why the interaction between these candidates in Yuma didn’t make the news or trend on Twitter: It was normal and civil, which reflects the character of this country more accurately than what you see on cable or social media.

DONALD TRUMP CAN DO NO RIGHT HIS SPEECH DESERVED PRAISE, BUT DIDN'T RECEIVE IT.

Texto completo: When the El Paso shooter's manifesto was first reported, it was an excellent time to disengage not only from social media, but also from its nominally more responsible relatives, the news giants. It was instantly obvious that 1) President Donald Trump would be blamed for the shooting; 2) he would be called upon to unite us; and 3) no matter what he actually did, he would be blamed again for giving a lousy response.
The media demanded Mr. Trump denounce white-supremacist thinking in his speech last week. So he did exactly that. He said, "in one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy," using the specific words for which the media had clamored. He gave a speech that would have been lavishly praised had a Democrat given it. But Mr. Trump is a Republican and Republicans can do no right.
Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto used to have a running gag about how the media covered awful news when Barack Obama was president: "Why do bad things always happen to him?" Mr. Taranto would sardonically inquire. National calamities were framed as matters that did unfortunate harm to Mr. Obama's reputation and even unsettled his vacations. "The war in Afghanistan follows Obama to his vacation in Hawaii," read the Washington Post headline on a 2016 story about the deaths of six soldiers, for which, as commander in chief, Mr. Obama was ultimately responsible.
If, say, Mitt Romney or George W. Bush had been president on Aug. 3, each of them would also have been blamed for inspiring the El Paso massacre, and whatever either of them said afterwards would have been labeled grossly inadequate, or worse. The major difference is that the magma-hot temperature of many of Mr. Trump's public remarks and tweets is considered by the media to give them license to be equally intemperate, even if it means making themselves look foolish.
The shooter specifically said his views predated Mr. Trump's rise, and he cited everything from Dr. Seuss's "The Lorax" to college debt to universal-basic-income proposals in his rather wide-ranging explanation of his murderous thoughts, but as his manifesto intersected with Mr. Trump's rhetoric via the single word "invasion," the media figured they might as well shift the blame to Mr. Trump, as though Mr. Trump were the first president to use overwrought language.
I would have been pleased if Mr. Trump had taken a moment to apologize for his intemperate use of the word "invasion" and acknowledged the humanity of illegal immigrants while maybe even admitting that this class of people isn't actually more criminally inclined than Americans. But, had he done so, would the media have responded with a hearty "Attaboy, Mr. President?" You and I both know the answer. The six-column headlines would have read, "President Virtually Admits Inspiring El Paso Shooter."
In short, this president can do no right, ever. Whether he is turning it up to 11 or dialing it down to three, he knows from experience the media will react with the same supercharged hostility. He knows from the popped balloon of the two-year Robert Mueller extravaganza that at no point will the media even admit to overplaying their hand; when one scandal peters out, they'll simply keep the hysteria level at Defcon 3 while shifting the new source of alleged crisis to some silly thing the president said on Twitter or, if all else fails, to a deliberate misconstruing of fact. "Trump falsely says the Constitution gives him 'the right to do whatever I want,'" the Washington Post reported breathlessly on July 23, though Mr. Trump was clearly referring to the power to fire Mr. Mueller, which he did in fact enjoy. As long as Mr. Trump resides in the White House, the media can never concede that any condition other than a state of emergency obtains in the United States of America.
After Mr. Trump condemned racism and bigotry, the New York Times changed its headline from "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM" to "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS," shifting the goalposts before our very eyes, as though Mr. Trump were obliged to have as much hatred for a fundamental American right as Times readers do. Kirsten Powers, on CNN, said the speech amounted to "the arsonist saying they want to help put out the fire ... at a minimum it should make him feel some sort of culpability ... he is not in a position to be claiming to be condemning white supremacy." So Mr. Trump isn't allowed to condemn white supremacy? Max Boot, in The Washington Post, said Mr. Trump is"leading our country to destruction," which sounds even more overwrought than Mr. Trump's reference to 2016 crime levels as "American carnage." Mr. Boot added on CNN, "To contribute to the slaughters in the streets, he cannot then say, 'I condemn racism and white supremacy and violence.'" So Mr. Trump is a contributor to slaughter. And he should also just shut up about it. As if a silent Mr. Trump wouldn't be generating headlines attacking him for keeping his counsel.
The endlessly repeated replay to which we are all being subjected is beyond tiresome. An intemperate president creates an intemperate media, which makes such a spectacle of its hostility to him that Mr. Trump fires back, which in turn raises the media's dudgeon level from "high" to "ludicrous." After El Paso, or any similar calamity, we need our media to be extra-sober, extra-judicious, more measured and cautious than they are on their best days. We need calm. Instead, what do we get, every time? A food fight.
Why are we so divided, the media ask? Talk about arsonists saying they want to help put out the fire. CNN and other news organizations turn a handsome profit by marketing non-stop emergency, panic and revulsion. Admitting that Donald Trump is not to blame for everything that goes wrong, or that even the president occasionally gives a reasonably OK speech, would be bad for business. It might be good for everyone's blood pressure, but there's no longer much of a market for being reasonable.

Texto completo: Even on an internet bursting at the seams with conspiracy theories and hyperpartisanship, Saturday marked a new chapter in our post-truth, choose-your-own-reality crisis story.
It began Saturday morning, when news broke that the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein had apparently hanged himself in a Manhattan jail. Mr. Epstein's death, coming just one day after court documents from one of his accusers were unsealed, prompted immediate suspicion from journalists, politicians and the usual online fringes.
Within minutes, Trump appointees, Fox Business hosts and Twitter pundits revived a decades-old conspiracy theory, linking the Clinton family to supposedly suspicious deaths. #ClintonBodyCount and #ClintonCrimeFamily trended on Twitter. Around the same time, an opposite hashtag -- #TrumpBodyCount -- emerged, focused on President Trump's decades-old ties to Mr. Epstein. Each hashtag was accompanied by GIFs and memes picturing Mr. Epstein with the Clintons or with Mr. Trump to serve as a viral accusation of foul play.
The dueling hashtags and their attendant toxicity are a grim testament to our deeply poisoned information ecosystem -- one that's built for speed and designed to reward the most incendiary impulses of its worst actors. It has ushered in a parallel reality unrooted in fact and helped to push conspiratorial thinking into the cultural mainstream. And with each news cycle, the system grows more efficient, entrenching its opposing camps. The poison spreads.
Mr. Epstein's apparent suicide is, in many ways, the post-truth nightmare scenario. The sordid story contains almost all of the hallmarks of stereotypical conspiratorial fodder: child sex-trafficking, powerful global political leaders, shadowy private jet flights, billionaires whose wealth cannot be explained. As a tale of corruption, it is so deeply intertwined with our current cultural and political rot that it feels, at times, almost too on the nose. The Epstein saga provides ammunition for everyone, leading one researcher to refer to Saturday's news as the "Disinformation World Cup."

At the heart of the online fiasco is Twitter, which has come to largely program the political conversation and much of the press. Twitter is magnetic during huge breaking stories; news junkies flock to it for up-to-the-second information. But early on, there's often a vast discrepancy between the attention that is directed at the platform and the available information about the developing story. That gap is filled by speculation and, via its worst users, rumormongering and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, Twitter's trending algorithms hoovered up the worst of this detritus, curating, ranking and then placing it in the trending module on the right side of its website. Despite being a highly arbitrary and mostly "worthless metric," trending topics on Twitter are often interpreted as a vague signal of the importance of a given subject.
There's a decent chance that President Trump was using Twitter's trending module when he retweeted a conspiratorial tweet tying the Clintons to Epstein's death. At the time of Mr. Trump's retweet, "Clintons" was the third trending topic in the United States. The specific tweet amplified by the president to his more than 60 million followers was prominently featured in the "Clintons" trending topic. And as Ashley Feinberg at Slate pointed out in June, the president appears to have a history of using trending to find and interact with tweets.
On Saturday afternoon, a computational propaganda researcher, Renée DiResta, noted that the media's close relationship with Twitter creates an incentive for propagandists and partisans to artificially inflate given hashtags. Almost as soon as #ClintonBodyCount began trending on Saturday, journalists took note and began lamenting the spread of this conspiracy theory -- effectively turning it into a news story, and further amplifying the trend. "Any wayward tweet ... can be elevated to an opinion worth paying attention to," Ms. DiResta wrote. "If you make it trend, you make it true."
That our public conversation has been uploaded onto tech platforms governed by opaque algorithms adds even more fodder for the conspiratorial-minded. Anti-Trump Twitter pundits with hundreds of thousands of followers blamed "Russian bots" for the Clinton trending topic. On the far right, pro-Trump sites like the Gateway Pundit (with a long track record of amplifying conspiracy theories) suggested that Twitter was suppressing and censoring the Clinton hashtags.
Where does this leave us? Nowhere good.
It's increasingly apparent that our information delivery systems were not built for our current moment -- especially with corruption and conspiracy at the heart of our biggest national news stories (Epstein, the Mueller report, mass shootings), and the platforms themselves functioning as petri dishes for outlandish, even dangerous conspiracy theories to flourish. The collision of these two forces is so troubling that an F.B.I. field office recently identified fringe conspiracy theories as a domestic terrorist threat. In this ecosystem, the media is frequently outmatched and, despite its best intentions, often acts as an amplifier for baseless claims, even when trying its best to knock them down.
Saturday's online toxicity may have felt novel, but it's part of a familiar cycle: What cannot be easily explained is answered by convenient untruths. The worst voices are rewarded for growing louder and gain outsize influence directing narratives. With each cycle, the outrage and contempt for the other build. Each extreme becomes certain its enemy has manipulated public perception; each side is the victim, but each is also, inexplicably, winning. The poison spreads.

Texto completo: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 8/18/2019: This article misstated a fact about people being injured by manhole covers. In 2005, a man in south Minneapolis had three vertebrae severed and a leg broken by a flying manhole cover as he was trying to put it back in place during a storm. Little-known fact: You don't have to go to Yellowstone to see a geyser; you can find them right here in Minneapolis. You just have to wait until it rains hard enough that water explodes out of a manhole.
OK, urban geysers are very rare. But they do happen. It's much more common to see manhole covers slightly "jumping" during heavy rainstorms.
A Star Tribune reporter witnessed the phenomenon while walking around downtown Minneapolis during a July storm and tweeted a mystifying video of the hyperactive manhole covers. (To watch the video, visit startribune.com/curious.)
But what causes it?
That's the latest question for our Curious Minnesota project, a community-driven series of articles fueled by questions from readers.
Responses to the tweet suggested possible causes: Oscar the Grouch, the clown from "It" or perhaps the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles having a party. The real answer is much more scientific.
To find out more, we asked Robin Hutcheson, director of Public Works in Minneapolis. She told us that the city's storm-drain system was built in the 1910s and is constantly being updated.
The downtown area sits above a network of massive storm tunnels, giant pipes that can move a huge amount of water. They're big enough for a person to walk through. However, the system can still become overwhelmed. In less-urban areas of town, rain will be absorbed into yards and parks. But downtown Minneapolis is made up of impervious surfaces -- aka concrete -- and the water has nowhere to go but into the storm drains.
As rain rushes into the enclosed space, the pressure increases. When the pressure becomes great enough it lifts the manhole covers, causing them to "dance." Each one weighs 200 pounds.
The elusive urban geyser occurs when a smaller tunnel completely fills with water.
Minneapolis has 7 miles of storm tunnels, and Hutcheson wants to build more.
"We know that we have a capacity issue downtown," Hutcheson said.
In one July storm, pressure displaced seven manhole covers.
Manhole covers have been blown off with enough force to seriously injure someone, but it usually takes more than rainwater. In Brooklyn, a man was taken to a hospital in critical condition after a manhole cover exploded into the air and hit him on the head, according to the New York Times.
However, fierce explosions like this are especially rare. In this case, there had been recent snowstorms, and salt from the road seeped down into cracks in electrical cables.
Rest assured: To Hutcheson's knowledge, no one in Minnesota has ever been injured by a flying manhole cover.
If you see a manhole cover that has been displaced, call 311 and the city will send someone to fix it.

Bill Dawers column: NY Times coverage considers large-scale developments in Savannah

Texto completo: "Square Feet," a weekly feature about commercial real estate development in The New York Times, took an extended look last week at large-scale developments in the downtown Savannah area. Headlined "The Charm, and Challenge, of Savannah", the piece focuses largely on our lengthy review processes and on Eastern Wharf, the ambitious project on the site of the failed Savannah River Landing development.
The NY Times piece takes a tangent into the Foram Group's planned Starland Village, which is rather strangely dubbed "the first new mixed-use development in that district."
I suppose one could defend the veracity of that statement if we define "new" and "district" very narrowly.
In case you have forgotten, Starland Village will transform the west side of Bull Street between 37th and 39th streets. The former church at the corner of 38th Street will be renovated for an event space, with residential and commercial units immediately to the south. New apartments will also be built at the northwest corner of Bull and 38th streets on a site formerly owned by the city of Savannah.
And we will have a parking garage - euphemistically referred to as a "parking deck" in the Times - at the southeast corner of Whitaker and 38th streets.
The piece says that Starland Village will be "an assembly of modest structures," but "modest" seems an inappropriate description for a parking garage that will be surrounded on three sides by historic homes.
The Thomas Square Neighborhood has been home to a mix of residential, commercial and institutional uses since the 19th century. Mixed-use development was restricted to some degree by zoning ordinances in the second half of the 20th century, but we wisely adopted a new ordinance in 2005 that embraced the mixed-use history.
The Starland Lofts project, which was completed in 2006, is just two blocks south of Starland Village. Businesses like Back in the Day Bakery and Graveface Records & Curiosities occupy the street-level commercial spaces. There are apartments on the second and third stories.
The large mixed-use building at Abercorn and East 42nd streets was also completed in 2006.
A few blocks away, the Savannah College of Art and Design's Victory Village was formerly the mixed-use development One West Victory, which was completed about five years ago.
Smaller, relatively recent mixed-use projects in the Thomas Square neighborhood can be found at the northeast corner of Habersham and 34th streets and at the northeast and southwest corners of Bull and 32nd streets.
I have detailed these mixed-use projects to make the simple point that investment was already flooding into Thomas Square. Sure, the pace was slowed, even stalled, by the deep 2007-2009 recession, but the long-terms trends have not changed.
With so many interested investors, we simply don't need to compromise sound urban design principles for developments that are not in scale with our historic neighborhoods.
While I agree that developers in Savannah have to navigate difficult bureaucracies, the NY Times article focuses exclusively on big projects that deserve serious scrutiny, especially since they would not be possible without significant support from taxpayers.
The public investments in the riverwalk and in new parking facilities, for example, will probably pay off in the long run, but those financing mechanisms likely deserved even more scrutiny than they received.
A reader who does not live in Savannah might get the impression from the NY Times coverage that the bureaucratic deck is stacked against big developers, but we know that is not true.
Because of the region's longstanding inferiority complex, the more recent post-recession desperation and other factors, area officials have greased the skids for deep-pocketed developers time and again.
By contrast, developers of smaller scale projects who lack political clout can face crippling bureaucratic delays, and small business owners routinely face unexpected and costly hurdles that jeopardize their success.
The NY Times coverage correctly notes that the National Park Service's recent downgrading of the status of the Historic District "prompted officials and residents to intensify their allegiance to the city's character," but we will have to wait and see if that allegiance is lasting.

Texto completo: "Every Woodstock musician I've talked to, when asked what performances they liked, immediately cites Santana as an obvious mega-highlight," said Andy Zax, the co-producer of "Woodstock -- Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive," a mammoth 38-CD boxed set released on Aug. 2.
Santana, a psychedelic jam band from San Francisco that incorporated Latin and African polyrhythms into blues-rock, was one of the least-known acts at Woodstock. It was added to the festival mainly because the manager Bill Graham, also the most powerful concert promoter in the country, forced them onto the bill.
When Santana went on at 2 p.m. on Saturday, the crowd was taken aback by the bandleader Carlos Santana's scything, nimble guitar playing, and a rhythm section that included two percussion players, at the time uncommon in rock bands.
Carlos Santana called from his office in San Rafael, Calif., to discuss which two bands played a better set than Santana, why Woodstock was a glorious social experiment, and how a change in schedule led to him hallucinating while onstage. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
We're talking about something that happened 50 years ago. Do you have a strong memory?
Yes, I inherited that from my mother. I have a pretty much photographic memory when it comes to music and melodies.
The band hadn't yet released its first album. How did you get booked at Woodstock?
Our manager, Bill Graham, was my first archangel. I have certain people who show up at the allocated, correct time and place, and open big doors for me. Bill invited us to his house in Mill Valley. We were still living in the Mission [District] in San Francisco. He said, "There's going to be a concert that's going to change your whole life. I need for you guys to really hear me: After this concert, people are going to start looking at you the way they look at the Doors and Jimi Hendrix. You guys will get in trouble because your heads are going to get so big, you're going to need a shoehorn to go in a room."
We rolled our eyes and we go, "Bill, we're from the Mission. We don't buy into that rock star thing."
Lots of groups had long delays before their sets. But Santana was rushed onto the stage, right?
When we landed, the first person I saw was my brother and friend Jerry Garcia. He looked like one of those yogis in a cave in the Himalayas. He had that beatific, everything is all right already look. For me, he was like assurance, confidence and a sanctuary.
They'd told us we were going on two bands after the Grateful Dead. He goes, "Well man, you better get comfortable because apparently, we're not going on until one o'clock in the morning. It's a mess here. And by the way, would you like to take some of this?" It was mescaline. And I was like, "Let's see, it's 12:30 in the afternoon. By two o'clock in the morning, I'll be all right." I used to take LSD and mescaline a lot, so I knew the timing. After eight or 10 hours, you're into what we call the amoeba state. Your thoughts become very galactic and universal and microscoped.
Two hours after I took it, there was a face in my face that said, "You need to go on right now, otherwise you're not going to play." By this time I was really, really on it, you know? I just held on to my faith, and what my mom taught me. I asked, over and over, "Just help me stay in tune and on time."
[ See all of our coverage of Woodstock at 50 .]
I assume that in 1969, Jerry Garcia's mescaline was pretty potent.
Oh, it was. I'd been dosed by them a year before. It took me two to three days to coordinate after that one. I'd been baptized into consciousness expanding, I'll call it, so that didn't scare me.
We knew already they had a reputation for dosing other bands and since we were opening for them in Las Vegas, I made sure to carefully wash this Coca-Cola can I was going to drink. But what I didn't know is, they knew how to put a syringe in the soda can. So we played our set and left, and on the way from the airport to the plane, the hall kept getting longer and longer. The colors in the carpet and in the wall started oozing like lava. I said, "Uh oh, they got me." When I sat down on the plane, I looked out the window as we were taking off, and the Vegas lights looked like Aztec hieroglyphics. [Laughs] I said, "This is going to be intense."
When you were onstage at Woodstock, were you hallucinating?
Oh totally. You can tell by my body language. I'm wrestling with the guitar -- not wrestling in conflict, but like a surfer, wrestling to maintain and sustain a balance. That's the key to everything in life. Whether you're straight or on mescaline, maintain your composure and your balance.
Everyone now says it was a great set. But in the moment, what kind of reaction did you get?
It was the same as seeing black and brown kids and poor white kids in Harlem River Drive on the hottest day in the summer, and somebody opens up a fire hydrant with cold water. It was just glee!
We came on full on with congas and the audience was like, "Oh, this is like being at Hippie Hill or at the [Central Park] fountain in New York." And you get to smoke weed and you get to hear congas, and music that makes you celebrate, not think about fear or Vietnam or Nixon or whatever.
That was a beautiful thing that I'll hold true till the day I leave this planet. I witnessed, with my own eyes and my heart, that people can get along, with unity and harmony. No fights. Share granola or a blanket or whatever. I got to see that humans are capable to coexist with benevolence. That's why we're still talking about Woodstock, man.
Who played the best sets at Woodstock, and where does Santana rate?
There was only three bands I recollect that were putting it all on the line. You're playing like Buddy Rich or Miles Davis; you're playing for your life. Sly and the Family Stone for me is No. 1. Jimi Hendrix is No. 2. Everybody else has to fight with us for No. 3.
What we brought was basically African rhythms and melody. After Woodstock, every band all of a sudden started getting congas. Miles had congas. The Rolling Stones had congas. Because they saw that mixing congas with guitars is a win-win situation -- especially with women!
For you, when did Santana's Woodstock set peak?
It peaked when the audience woke up to us, even though it was in the afternoon. It was a breath of fresh air, because Santana's music connects to Africa, and always gives you joy. Joy is the opposite of fear. Right now, everybody is selling fear, from the president all the way down to Hollywood.
You know what? This is the best part of the interview, man. I hope The New York Times can help us have a Woodstock in every city, every weekend. Because we need the colors. We need the balloons. We need the barbecues. Filipinos, Irish, Italian -- we just need everybody to become a creature that celebrates being alive.
I know people say, "Santana took too much acid." Well maybe you haven't taken none at all! You see what it is. I see what it can be and should be, which is how it felt when the Berlin Wall came down, or Mandela was freed. That's what Woodstock was about: a collective consciousness, commonality, unity, harmony, celebrating.
Bill Graham predicted that the band would become bigheaded after Woodstock. Did it?
Oh, totally. In my case, I fell out soon enough to embrace spiritual discipline. I moved to Queens, New York, and cut my hair. I wasn't doing drugs, wasn't drinking, changed my diet. For 10 years. I was devoted to a certain code of conduct that serves me well now. I got more energy than when I was 17.
I'd like to hear a little bit about your bigheaded phase.
[Laughs] Sure you do. You buy expensive, flashy cars, and you waste a lot of time in the mirror changing clothes. It becomes like what happened to Prince and Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. You create this mask -- it's called persona, like Batman and Bruce Wayne -- that is draining to maintain. That's why I made a change to drop that and become a person rather than a personality.

Charges, uh, dropped; 'Coke' on QB's car actually bird poop

Texto completo: Cocaine charges and a team suspension for Georgia Southern quarterback Shai Werts were dropped Friday when lab tests confirmed what Werts said when he was arrested: The white substance on his car was bird poop, not cocaine.
Werts was pulled over on July 31 and charged with speeding and cocaine possession. Despite the extreme implausibility of powder cocaine just sitting comfortably on the hood of a car going 80 mph, police and media outlets acted as if it was Werts who had the ridiculous story, not the cops who confused bird poop and cocaine.
Some headline writers took the cocaine theory at face value. As of Friday afternoon, few retractions had been made.
This was always a straightforward case: A bird pooped on Werts' car, and a moron cop decided the crap was coke. Georgia Southern's student newspaper viewed video of the arrest, and quoted the following exchange from it:
Officer: "What's that white stuff on your hood, man?"
Werts: "Bird s-t."
Officer: "That ain't bird s-t."
Werts: "I promise you, that's bird doo doo."
Officer: "I promise you, it's not though."
Werts: "I swear to God, that's bird doo doo."
Officer: "I swear to God, it's not. I just tested it and it turned pink."
The roadside test for drugs is notoriously unreliable, though. In a 2016 investigation headlined 'How a $2 Roadside Drug Test Sends Innocent People to Jail' the New York Times reported that the tests can have false positives caused by heat, cold, user error and even poor lighting.
That appears to be what happened here, as Saluda County, South Carolina prosecutors said Thursday that actual lab testing found no drugs.
Werts' Sun Belt team beating LSU in its season opener would be less surprising than a "slime-like" substance on the hood of a car going 78 mph being cocaine.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, Republicans call people antisemitic, Rep. Collin Peterson made some new friends, and a mysterious voice on TV asked people to call Sen. Tina Smith. Let’s get on with this.
NRCC and antisemitism
The National Republican Congressional Committee, chaired by Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota’s Sixth District, has taken to leveling accusations antisemitism far and wide. According to them, a good number of Democrats in the House are antisemitic —including Jewish members. That strategy, for obvious reasons, doesn’t sit right with at least two Jewish Democrats who have been targeted.
For one, the NRCC targeted Third District Rep. Dean Phillips, who comes from a prominent Jewish family in Minnesota, with just such an accusation. Phillips replied:
“I’m a business person and I happen to be of the Jewish faith. I’m certainly not antisemitic and I’m not a socialist,” he said, noting that such language might be an effective tactic “But we should hold ourselves to higher standards in this country. Both parties. And that’s just a woeful example of I think dangerous rhetoric that makes this country a more dangerous place for a lot of people.” Read more at MinnPost.
Speaking of antisemitism … and, uh, Tom Emmer, the American Jewish World reported that Emmer also sent a letter to Minnesotans in March that says: “the news of impactful, real progress on turning our nation around was undercut by biased media and hundreds of millions of dollars of anti-Republican propaganda put out by liberal special interests, funded by deep-pocketed far-left billionaires George Soros, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg.” As AJW points out, “Soros and Bloomberg are Jews; and Steyer had a Jewish father.”
“There is nothing anti-Semitic about drawing attention to billionaire donors and who they are giving money to,” NRCC spokesman Chris Pack told AJW reporter Adrian Glass-Moore.
“The idea that Jews are behind a conspiracy to undermine society or control government is pretty classic anti-Semitism, and we know that these words can lead to real violence — recall that the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter was motivated by the belief that Jewish money was behind the migrant caravan approaching our southern border,” Carin Mrotz, executive director of St. Paul-based Jewish Community Action, said in a statement. “It’s language that puts Jews in real danger and has unfortunately become too frequent of a go-to for those seeking to undermine and combat progressive advocacy.”
Sugar rush
Rep. Collin Peterson has been called the “godfather” of the sugar beet industry and, as the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, one of the most important members for the industry.
It appears that, as Republicans ramp up a potential challenge to Peterson, sugar executives are worried. Or at least concerned enough to create The Committee for Stronger Rural Communities ; a super PAC that will only focus on re-electing Peterson this cycle.
A representative for the committee said that it has already raised more than $300,000, with an initial contribution of $150,000 from the American Crystal Sugar Company, the large agricultural cooperative based in Moorhead. And they said that the super PAC intends to raise more. Read more at MinnPost.
The voice on the TV
Have you been hearing a mysterious voice on TV, telling you to contact Sen. Tina Smith about health care? You’re not alone.
Doctor Patient Unity , a secretive dark money group whose funding can’t be traced beyond its business registration in Virginia, has already spent $277,348 on local television advertisements, according to Karl Evers-Hillstrom at Open Secrets.
The group is spending millions around the country, pushing senators to not support one proposal for cutting down surprise medical bills. Specifically they want people to call and ask senators for things like: “To be taken out of billing disputes between doctors and insurance companies” and for “An independent resolution process that allows healthcare experts to solve billing disputes between doctors and insurance companies.”
An aide in Sen. Smith’s office said that their office has never heard of the group and has not been contacted by them. By their account, the ads were confusing, in that Sen. Smith ostensibly is on their side.
“Sen. Smith believes that surprise medical bills are terrible for patients and need to be urgently addressed,” Smith spokesperson Ed Shelleby told MinnPost. “She supports bipartisan legislation that would fix this problem with arbitration, which means that providers and insurers would work together with an independent arbiter to come up with a fair price for insurers so that patients don’t have to pay anything.”
Al Gore: Line 3 is ‘not a good project’
Former Vice President Al Gore was in Minneapolis late last week. Along with Gov. Tim Walz , Gore urged fast action on global warming at an event that showcased Minnesota’s changing climate, its split politics over the Line 3 oil pipeline and its plans to make the energy grid carbon free by 2050. Read more from MinnPost’s Walker Orenstein.
Farm Fest
As the trade war between President Trump and the Chinese government continues, farmers gathered in Morgan for Farm Fest. And many of them were not happy.
“As far as his tweets go, I’m not impressed and I don’t think anybody in here is, to be honest,” Joel Schreurs, a Tyler, Minn., soybean farmer who sits on the American Soybean Association board, said. The Forum News Service’s Dana Ferguson has the story.
“Minnesota farmers in my area are particularly influenced by the tariffs,” Jamie Beyer, president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association , told MinnPost. “Our beans are normally carried by rail to the West Coast where they are typically shipped to China.” Beyer said that while provisions to deal with the current situation have been helpful, farmers “would rather have trade than aid.”
The president next door
Sen. Amy Klobuchar released her “Plan from the Heartland” this week, detailing the policies and proposals she’d seek to help farmers and rural communities if she was elected to office.
Klobuchar also shared a first look at her “plan to fight hate crimes” in the wake of the El Paso shooting with Vox, proposing things like providing federal resources to marginalized communities dealing with the impact of violence and explicitly pushing the federal government to address white nationalism.
So far only 9 candidates have qualified for the third Democratic presidential debate, to be held on September 12 and 13 at Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas. Klobuchar has qualified for this one, as well as for the fourth debate, which will be held in October.
In other news
* Authorities in El Paso are viewing the attack on Walmart, in which a gunman killed 20 people and wounded several others, as a domestic terrorist attack.
* A top climate scientist has quit the U.S. Department of Agriculture, following others who have accused the Trump administration of politicizing their work.
* The New York Times has a great map detailing exactly who in your area is donating to which political candidate. The map make several things apparent: Sen. Bernie Sanders is dominating the country with a swath of small dollar donors, Klobuchar’s base is definitely in Minnesota, and Beto O’Rourke’s base is definitely in Texas.
Quote of the week
“What do you think? You know the shit he’s been saying. He’s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don’t know, like, members of the press, what the fuck?” — Beto O’Rourke, when asked what the president could do to make things better following the shooting in El Paso.

Texto completo: "Wearing the white coat represents a commitment to upholding the standards of medicine, as set forth in the Hippocratic Oath."
Robert L. Johnson
MD, FAAP, interim dean
NEW BRUNSWICK - Friday, Aug. 2 marked the commencement of a new chapter in the lives of 165 individuals who stood in front of family and friends as Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's newest class of medical students to don their white coats for the first time.
"Wearing the white coat represents a commitment to upholding the standards of medicine, as set forth in the Hippocratic Oath," said Robert L. Johnson, MD, FAAP, interim dean, in his welcome address during the school's White Coat Ceremony at The State Theatre. "It should serve as a reminder throughout the next four years of training to value humanism and practice compassion when caring for patients."
The White Coat Ceremony culminates a week-long orientation for the incoming class and signifies the students' entrance into the medical profession. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the students recited the Hippocratic Oath, beginning their journey to becoming physicians.
The Class of 2023 is diverse in culture, as well as in experience, with nearly half the class having pursued another career or advanced education between earning their undergraduate degree and becoming a medical student.
Sixteen percent of the class are entering with either master's or doctorate degrees, including four students who are part of the medical school's unique dual-degree program with Rutgers Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, in which they earned a doctorate in pharmacy before matriculating at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Service to the community – locally and globally – and mentorship are also common threads among the class, which includes 46 students who hold bachelor's degrees from Rutgers.
"I hope to transition from a medical student looking to learn medical knowledge to a young doctor looking to learn people, and how medicine and health impact their daily life," said Richard Lisi, III, who will pursue a dual-degree in the school's MD/MBA program.
Lisi, of Cranston, Rhode Island, was inspired to become a physician because of the care he received as a premature infant, born at 28 weeks and weighing less than two pounds.
"The sentiment shared by my family and I has been that the care I received in the NICU saved my life. Thus, becoming a doctor is my way of paying it forward," he said.
Kate Kim, of Chatham, also is looking forward to improving care by developing a bond with patients.
"As a medical school student, I am really excited to learn the skills it takes to become an exceptional physician," said Kim, who explored other careers, including consulting for federal policymakers, before deciding to pursue medicine as a profession. "I want to learn what it is like to have truly meaningful relationships with patients, how to handle challenging ethical scenarios, and how to simultaneously be a strong leader and supportive team member. I believe that my training and education and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School will allow me to gain the confidence to address any hurdle or challenge I experience along the way in my journey to becoming a physician."
The keynote address was given by Jessica L. Israel, MD, corporate chair of geriatrics and palliative care and director of The James and Sharon Maida Geriatrics Institute at RWJBarnabas Health. Dr. Israel earned her medical degree at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.
She completed an internship and residency in internal medicine, as well as a fellowship in geriatrics and adult development at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. She is the co-author of the textbook "Medicine: A Competency Based Companion" and has been a contributing writer to The New York Times. Dr. Israel's clinical interests include geriatrics, dementia and behavioral management, palliative care, end-of-life care and doctor-patient communication.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director who was fired for statements he made about communications between the bureau and the press, sued the F.B.I. and the Justice Department on Thursday, alleging that the dismissal was retaliatory and politically motivated.
The Justice Department engaged in a "politically motivated and retaliatory demotion in January 2018 and public firing in March 2018," Mr. McCabe said in his lawsuit.
He added that President Trump "purposefully and intentionally" pushed the Justice Department to demote and terminate him as part of an "unconstitutional plan" to discredit and remove Justice Department and F.B.I. employees who were "deemed to be his partisan opponents."
Mr. McCabe, 51, was also the subject of a scathing Justice Department inspector general report that accused him of violating the bureau's media policy when he authorized the disclosure of information to the press and of misleading investigators about what he had done.
When he was fired, Mr. McCabe told The New York Times that he had been let go for political reasons. He was among the first F.B.I. officials to ask whether the Trump campaign had questionable ties to Russia and whether Mr. Trump himself had tried to obstruct justice.
"The idea that I was dishonest is just wrong," he told The Times. "This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness."
Earlier this week, Peter Strzok, the F.B.I. senior counterintelligence agent in the Russia investigations, also sued the Justice Department and the F.B.I. He said in his lawsuit that he had been fired because of political pressure from the president, who was enraged by text messages that showed he had been a harsh critic of Mr. Trump.
"The F.B.I. fired Special Agent Strzok because of his protected political speech in violation of his rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States," the lawsuit said. Mr. Strzok said his termination also violated his due process rights.
The Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment.
After Mr. McCabe was fired, Mr. Trump took to Twitter, calling his dismissal "A great day for Democracy."
Mr. McCabe has long said Mr. Trump's public criticisms of him and his firing were meant to help discredit the special counsel's investigation into Russian election interference and any role that the Trump campaign may have played in that activity.
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said in his report released this spring that Russia had interfered in the election to benefit Mr. Trump. He said there was not enough evidence to prove that the campaign itself had conspired in that effort, even though it was receptive to help from Russia. Mr. Mueller declined to weigh in on whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice, saying only that he was unable to exonerate the president.
While the F.B.I. deems lack of candor to be a fireable offense, Mr. McCabe fought back against the recommendation that he be dismissed. The 21-year veteran of the F.B.I. appealed to senior career officials at the Justice Department, to no avail.
Mr. McCabe said in his filing that within weeks of Mr. Trump's swearing-in, he became caught up in the president's desire to protect himself from the Russia investigation at all costs, which included purging the Justice Department and the F.B.I. of officials perceived to be disloyal or to be Democrats.
After department officials were told that Mr. McCabe would soon be eligible to retire, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. McCabe was "racing the clock to retire with full benefits."
Mr. McCabe said in his lawsuit that this language was meant to convey that the president wanted to fire him before his retirement date.
Candice Will, who oversaw the termination effort for the Office of Professional Responsibility, wrote in a memo the week before the firing that it was unlikely that the bureau would reach "final resolution" before Mr. McCabe's retirement date. But the timing would ultimately be up to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, she wrote in the memo, which was filed as an exhibit in the lawsuit.
Mr. McCabe claims in his lawsuit that the process to fire him was accelerated, and that he was not able to properly examine and respond to all the evidence in his case.
The week before he was fired, Mr. McCabe said, Scott Schools, the Justice Department's highest-ranking career official, said in a phone call that the department was not following established protocols in the disciplinary review, but was "making it up as we go along."
The day before Mr. McCabe was eligible to collect his full government pension, Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, said he would terminate Mr. McCabe "effective immediately" for lack of candor under oath.
In his filing, Mr. McCabe said he hoped his lawsuit would address the "chilling effect" that his firing had on career civil servants who felt at risk of being dismissed for partisan political reasons.
He is seeking to force the Justice Department to allow him to retire as the deputy director of the F.B.I. and an agent in good standing, as planned, and to receive his full pension, health care insurance and other retirement benefits.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence.
Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, according to a tweet from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.
Haberman also tweeted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had pushed for a pardon, but aides instead persuaded Trump to agree to commutation.

Texto completo: When the National Rifle Association endorsed Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio) for a ninth term last fall, the group noted that he has consistently maintained an A rating and been "solidly pro-gun." Literature sent to members emphasized Turner's opposition to expanding background checks and banning military-style weapons, as well as his past vote to immunize gun manufacturers from liability and to force all states, regardless of their own laws, to recognize concealed-carry permits issued anywhere else.
In the wee hours of Sunday morning, Turner's daughter and a family friend had just entered the Tumbleweed Connection bar in Dayton when a gunman opened fire across the street. Nine people were killed and 27 injured. The congressman's daughter ran home, as he prayed for her and the community.
On Tuesday afternoon, Turner announced that he has had a change of heart on gun control. He said he would vote for an assault weapons ban, limits on the size of gun magazines and for a federal "red-flag law" that would make it easier to "quickly identify people who are dangerous" so their firearms can be taken away.
"The carnage these military-style weapons are able to produce when available to the wrong people is intolerable," Turner said in a statement. "I understand not every shooting can be prevented or stopped from these measures, but I do believe these steps are essential. . . . This tragedy must become a catalyst for a broader national conversation about what we can do to stop these mass shootings."
Why didn't Turner think it was a "catalyst" for change when other people's children had to run for their lives in cities that weren't in his congressional district? It has been 20 years since Columbine, with increasingly frequent and deadly mass shootings in places such as Orlando, Las Vegas, Blacksburg, Va., Newtown, Conn., and Charleston, S.C.
A spokeswoman said Turner was not available for an interview and declined to answer follow-up questions from The Washington Post's Colby Itkowitz, including whether the congressman regrets his votes in February against two bills that would strengthen background checks.
Turner is not alone: He joins a sizable group of conservatives who were outspoken opponents of gun control until the issue hit close to home. Only then did they stand up to the powerful gun lobby. Consider these three examples:
Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) received the NRA's support and contributions when he got elected to Congress in 2016. A little more than a year after he took office, one of the congressman's friends was among the 17 people massacred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where he had once lived. Aaron Feis was the assistant football coach, and he died while ushering students to safety. Mast has said he decided during Feis's funeral to call for a ban on "assault or tactical" firearms and for requiring background checks on all gun purchases, including online and private sales.
Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) also had an A rating from the NRA. As a candidate for that office in 2016, he campaigned against background checks on private gun sales, talked about the safe full of guns he kept in his home and touted his votes against new gun laws in the state legislature. Then, two days after the Parkland shooting, police in Fair Haven, Vt., arrested a teenager for allegedly plotting to shoot up Fair Haven Union High School.
Authorities had been tipped off about a threatening Facebook message. When police searched the teen's car, they found a shotgun, 17 rounds of ammunition and four books about school shootings. They also found a diary titled "The Journal of an Active Shooter," according to court documents. In an interview, the young man allegedly told police that he wanted to "exceed the body count from the Virginia Tech shooting," which had left 32 dead, "and that he had chosen his ammunition accordingly."
"As I processed this information, I was shocked," Scott explained in April 2018. "Just 24 hours before - even in the aftermath of Parkland - I thought, as the safest state in the nation, Vermont was immune to this type of violence. . . . Sitting there, I realized, only by the grace of God did we avert a horrific outcome."
That caused the lifelong gun owner to "do some soul searching" and, just two months later, sign into law a trio of bills that banned the possession and sale of magazines holding more than 10 rounds for a long gun and 15 for a handgun. To ensure background checks on private gun sales, Scott also required that nearly all guns be bought and sold through a licensed firearm dealer, and he raised the minimum age to purchase weapons.
"I was wrong. And that's not always easy to admit," he said at the signing ceremony, as opponents of gun control chanted "Traitor!" while carrying signs that blared "Not My Governor" outside the State House.
The most famous example is Ronald Reagan. On the 10th anniversary of being shot, the former president wrote an opinion piece endorsing the Brady Bill. The legislation was named for his White House press secretary, James Brady, who was wounded in the assassination attempt. Reagan pushed back on the NRA's arguments against background checks. "This level of violence must be stopped," the former president wrote in the New York Times. Nancy Reagan, who had been deeply traumatized by seeing her husband in the hospital and remained good friends with Brady's wife, Sarah, played a key role in her husband's evolution.
Then, in 1994, Reagan teamed up with his old rival Gerald Ford - who had been lucky to avoid getting shot in two assassination attempts during his presidency - to endorse the assault weapons ban. "While we recognize that assault-weapon legislation will not stop all assault-weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals," Reagan and Ford, along with Jimmy Carter, wrote in an opinion piece for the Boston Globe. The bill passed the House by two votes, and multiple lawmakers cited personal lobbying from Reagan to explain why they had changed their positions.
It's understandable that personal experience shapes people's worldviews as much as anything else. But it can be problematic. When a crack epidemic was killing young black men in urban centers in the 1980s, white lawmakers from rural areas championed tough-on-crime policies that put junkies and dealers alike behind bars for long sentences. When the opioid epidemic came to their communities and started killing their neighbors and the children of their friends, many of these same politicians demanded a more compassionate approach that focused on treatment, not incarceration.
There are exceptions, of course. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) has remained a stalwart opponent of new gun laws despite nearly dying in a shooting during a congressional baseball team practice.
Reality check: The assault weapons ban and limits on magazine size that Turner endorsed appear dead on arrival so long as Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is majority leader. A red-flag measure is more likely to get through, but even that's not certain to secure 60 votes - unless there's a sustained push from the president.

The ideology of hate and how to fight it

Texto completo: Many of today's mass murderers write manifestoes. They are not killing only because they've been psychologically damaged by trauma. They're not killing only because they are pathetically lonely and deeply pessimistic about their own lives. They are inspired to kill by a shared ideology, an ideology that they hope to spread through a wave of terror.
The clearest expression of that ideology was written by the man charged with a killing spree in Christchurch, New Zealand. His manifesto has been cited by other terrorists; the suspect in this weekend's El Paso mass shooting cited it in his own manifesto.
It's not entirely what you'd expect. At one point its author writes about his travels around the world: "Everywhere I travelled, barring a few small exceptions, I was treated wonderfully, often as a guest and even as a friend. The varied cultures of the world greeted me with warmth and compassion, and I very much enjoyed nearly every moment I spent with them."
The ideology he goes on to champion is highly racial, but it's not classic xenophobia or white supremacy. Its first feature is essentialism. The most important thing you can know about a person is his or her race. A white sees the world as a white and a Latino sees it as a Latino. Identity is racial.
The second feature is separatism. Races are healthy when they are pure and undiluted. The world is healthy when people of different races live apart. The world is diseased when races mix. "I am against race mixing because it destroys genetic diversity and creates identity problems," the El Paso suspect wrote.
The third feature is racial Darwinism. Races are locked in a Darwinian struggle in which they try to out-reproduce their rivals. Currently, the black and brown races are stronger than the white race and are on the verge of obliterating it through invasion.
Immigrants, the Christchurch suspect wrote, come "from a culture with higher fertility rates, higher social trust and strong robust traditions that seek to occupy my peoples lands and ethnically replace my own people."
If we allow them into our country, brown immigrants will overwhelm whites just as Europeans overwhelmed the Native Americans centuries ago. As the El Paso suspect put it, "The natives didn't take the invasion of Europeans seriously, and now what's left is just a shadow of what was." Immigration is white replacement. Immigration is white genocide.
This is not an ideology that rises out of white self-confidence but rather white insecurity.
This ideology is an extreme form of a broader movement - antipluralism - that now comes in many shapes. Trumpian nationalists, authoritarian populists and Islamic jihadis are different versions of antipluralism.
These movements are reactions against the diversity, fluidity and interdependent nature of modern life. Antipluralists yearn for a return to clear borders, settled truths and stable identities. They kill for a fantasy, a world that shines in their imaginations but never existed in real life.
The struggle between pluralism and antipluralism is one of the great death struggles of our time, and it is being fought on every front.
We pluralists do not believe that human beings can be reduced to a single racial label. Each person is a symphony of identities. Our lives are rich because each of us contains multitudes.
Pluralists believe in integration, not separation. We treasure precisely the integration that sends the antipluralists into panic fits. A half-century ago, few marriages crossed a color line. Now, 17% of American marriages are interracial.
Pluralists are always expanding the definition of "us," not constricting it. Eighty years ago, Protestants, Catholics and Jews did not get along, so a new category was created, Judeo-Christian, which brought formerly feuding people into a new "us." Thirty years ago, rivalries were developing between blacks and Hispanics, and so the category "people of color" was used to create a wider "us."
Pluralists believe that culture mixing has always been and should be the human condition. All cultures define and renew themselves through encounter. A pure culture is a dead culture while an amalgam culture is a creative culture. The very civilization the white separatists seek to preserve was itself a product of earlier immigration waves.
Finally, pluralism is the adventure of life. Pluralism is not just having diverse people coexist in one place. It's going out and getting into each other's lives. It's a constant dialogue that has no end because there is no single answer to how we should live.
Life in a pluralistic society is an ever-moving spiral. There are the enemies of pluralism ripping it apart and the weavers of community binding it together. There is no resting spot. It's change, fluidity and movement all the way down.
The terrorists dream of a pure, static world. But the only thing that's static is death, which is why they are so pathologically drawn to death. Pluralism is about movement, interdependence and life. The struggle ahead is about competing values as much as it is about controlling guns and healing damaged psyches. Pluralism thrives when we name what the terrorists hate about us, and live it out.

Texto completo: Aside from using two-factor authentication and keeping your operating system and web browser up to date, using a password manager is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself online. Here are some tips from Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests and reviews products, on how to choose a password manager. Andrew Cunningham
WHY YOU NEED A PASSWORD MANAGER. A password manager is a secure, automated, all-digital replacement for the little notepad that you might have all of your passwords scribbled down in now, but it's also more than that. Password managers generate strong new passwords when you create accounts or change a password, and they store all of your passwords -- and, in many cases, your credit card numbers, addresses, bank accounts, and other information -- in one place, protecting them with a single strong master password. If you remember your master password, your password manager will remember everything else.
A PASSWORD MANAGER FOR ANY BUDGET. Wirecutter's favorite password manager is 1Password. It has great apps for PCs, Macs, and all kinds of tablets and phones. If you're not using two-factor authentication to further protect your accounts already, 1Password can generate, store, and insert those codes for you when you need them. And 1Password's family plan makes it easy to share passwords for accounts you share with your family members and friends. If you can't or don't want to pay the $ 36 per year for a 1Password subscription, you can find good free options too. Wirecutter's favorite is LastPass Free.
MAKING A GOOD MASTER PASSWORD. Because your master password is responsible for protecting all of your account information, you must make it long and difficult to guess. But because you'll need to type it in when you start using a new computer or phone, when you need to log in to change account settings, or when you restart your computer or browser, it should also be easy for you to remember; otherwise you could lock yourself out of your account and lose access to everything.

Texto completo: As President Trump addressed the nation after a weekend of mass shootings, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) was watching.
Reading from a teleprompter, Trump condemned the "barbaric slaughters" but did not blame lax gun laws for the 31 deaths in El Paso and Dayton. In his closing, Trump asked God to "bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo," naming the wrong Ohio city.
Shortly thereafter, Ryan, who rushed to Dayton after the tragedy, took to Twitter. "Toledo. Fck me," he wrote.
Ryan is the latest Democratic presidential candidate to unleash his anger and frustration with raw, emotional language that would have been considered taboo in a pre-Trump era.
Ryan spokesman Michael Zetts said the tweet was the congressman's spontaneous response to the president's flub. The day before, Ryan expressed frustration on MSNBC with years of inaction on gun control policy by saying Republicans "need to get their s--- together and stop pandering to the NRA."
"It affected him, being at the vigil with the community," Zetts said. "I think those emotions just kind of came through, and those frustrations came through. And there's no action [in Congress]. Years go by with just nothing."
Former congressman Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native, also left the campaign trail abruptly this weekend after a gunman opened fire Saturday morning at a Walmart in the city, killing at least 22 and injuring dozens of others. A manifesto authorities are investigating for ties to the suspected shooter said the violence was motivated by fears of a "Hispanic invasion."
For weeks, O'Rourke has been calling out Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail as racist. When a reporter asked O'Rourke on Saturday whether there was anything Trump could do to make things better, he let loose.
"Uh, what do you think? You know the s--- he's been saying. He's been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals," O'Rourke said, at times throwing his hands up and stammering in exasperation. "I don't know. Like, members of the press: What the f---? Hold on a second!"
"It's these questions that you know the answers to. I mean, connect the dots about what he's been doing in this country," O'Rourke continued. "He's not tolerating racism. He's promoting racism. He's not tolerating violence. He's inciting racism and violence in this country. So, you know, I just - I don't know what kind of question that is."
The willingness of candidates to cross this line is a sign of the times, said Vanessa Beasley, a communications professor at Vanderbilt University who studies presidential rhetoric.
"The norms for presidential decorum are in flux right now," Beasley said. Usually, candidates are mindful of the importance of "acting presidential," she said - which in the past meant staying calm.
In the past, there were penalties for losing your cool. A scream essentially ended Howard Dean's campaign in 2004. During the 2000 campaign, George W. Bush described a New York Times reporter as a "major league a--hole" on a live microphone, causing a minor furor and a subsequent statement of regret.
But Trump's behavior since taking office - the round-the-clock tweets, the inflammatory rallies, the profane tirades about everything from the Mueller report to foreign countries - has scrambled politicians' understanding of how a candidate should act.
"I think the question becomes: What does looking presidential look like?" Beasley said, pointing to a division among the Democratic field between those like former vice president Joe Biden, who has promised a return to normalcy, and others who insist there is no "normal" after a Trump administration.
There's another factor, too. Candidates' language, Beasley said, may reflect the genuine fear and anger they - and voters - are feeling.
"When I watched Beto last night on television, he was [responding] as a community member. . . . If he hadn't reacted that way, it would have been weird," Beasley said. "The moment to show that there is something that makes you kind of lose your mind and not be calm is now, both in a strategic sense and an affect sense.
"It's not about data. It's about that feeling," she added.
Other Democratic candidates are also pushing rhetorical boundaries. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who in his campaign appearances emphasizes love and unity, didn't mince words during Trump's speech Monday.
In a private text message his campaign manager shared on Twitter, Booker wrote: "Listening to the president. Such a bulls--- soup of ineffective words. This is so weak. We should quickly condemn his lack of a real plan."
Though Booker did not share the message himself, it's hard to imagine his campaign manager tweeted it without the candidate's permission.
But Beasley cautioned that the standards are gendered: While a male candidate using profanity can be viewed as relating to "how people in America really talk," female candidates, because of sexist stereotypes, might be seen as showing "too much emotion" if they curse.
For instance, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on the debate stage last week shouted, "I wrote the damn bill!" in response to a question about Medicare-for-all; he's now selling merchandise with the phrase on it.
By contrast, the female candidates have all largely avoided swearing on the campaign trail so far, even though Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in past years has been known to invoke an f-word or two when discussing Trump.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris has been loath to even quote the president when it comes to his remarks on "shithole countries," instead saying "S-hole countries" on the campaign trail. On Monday, she stopped short of saying "b---shit."
"You can hear the frustration in my voice because here's the thing: I'm sick of all the grand gestures," Harris said in a phone interview with MSNBC about stalled gun-control legislation. "All kinds of grand gestures. All kinds of proclamations about B.S."
Harris then immediately apologized for saying "B.S." on air.
"The very same thing that people will praise men for doing as a form of leadership - like direct speech - for women it's seen as … well, you know, it rhymes with rich," Beasley said, herself sidestepping a curse word in an interview. "These communication patterns create another barrier for women, and that seems unfair."
Meanwhile, O'Rourke, who went viral for his unfettered thoughts in El Paso, took to Twitter later to defend his response, profanity and all.
"I stand by what I said," he tweeted.

J.D. Scholten is running again in the 4th District

Texto completo: Democrat J.D. Scholten is taking his second swing at the Democratic nomination in Iowa's 4th District, the most conservative area in the state.
The former professional baseball player announced he is running again to represent northwest Iowa in 2020 after narrowly losing the general election to incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve King in 2018. The Kiron conservative won by 3.4%, the smallest margin he has faced in a general election in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats 190,000 to 120,000.
This time, Scholten said he was hoping to improve on last year's results. He's already confident coming into his announcement with much higher national and local name recognition, as well as more attention on Iowa's 4th District seat at large.
"It's hard to comprehend how different this is," he said in an interview with the Des Moines Register. "The amount of attention we're receiving in just hours compared was months and months worth last time. But we're still trying to get out with the same thing we did last time: prove that we're trustworthy and prove that we're going to fight for the people of this district."
He launched his new campaign with a video narrated by Kevin Costner Monday morning, and with support from national Democratic groups like Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.
He's coming back with a lot of the same priorities as he had in 2018 — fixing health care, supporting farmers — but with a new goal of meeting even more new voters. He has a "70% goal" for 2020: making sure come Election Day, at least seven of every ten voters in the district have seen him or "Sioux City Sue," his Winnebago RV with their own eyes.
"We saw the success we had last time," he said. "We saw that we got 25,000 more voters than there are Democrats in this district. We're looking to improve on that and it's by going to all 39 counties, multiple times, and continuing to go where the people are at and listen."
This week, he's kicking off his campaign touring in his Winnebago, holding rallies in Sioux City and Ames, as well as visiting the Iowa State Fair Thursday and the Iowa Democratic Party Wing Ding Friday.
While King has been a controversial political figure for many years, tensions reached a boiling point after the Republican's 2018 reelection. King was removed from his House committees by U.S. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy in January after he was quoted by the New York Times saying: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
The backlash from Republicans means Scholten is no longer the only challenger to the prominent Republican official. Prominent GOP challenger state Sen. Randy Feenstra significantly outraised King, and gained support from several national and state conservative figures.
"Two years ago, Congressman Steve King almost handed Iowa's 4th Congressional District to Nancy Pelosi when liberal Democrat J.D. Scholten nearly won," Feenstra said in a statement. "Today's announcement that Scholten will again seek the seat further highlights the need for Iowa Republicans to nominate an effective conservative that will win in November."
Scholten said even if King doesn't win the primary, his campaign strategy and message is going to stay the same.
"My game plan is the same as when I was a pitcher in baseball," he said. "It didn't matter what the batter was, it didn't matter who the opponent was, I was going to pitch my game. ... My campaign is about who we are and what we can do for the district."
That doesn't mean getting King out of the representative seat isn't a priority.
"He has a voice as a member of Congress that is far too controversial, far too loud — nobody should know who the 4th Congressional District representative is," he joked. "I really think its time for a change in this district."
King bashes fellow Americans online, can't do much in Congress because of his committee removals and has turned off voters on both sides of the aisle, Scholten said, adding that the 4th District is ready for a change.
"American voters are sick of punching down," he said. "That's not what I learned in Sioux City, growing up here ... That's our message, no matter who the opponent will be."
In February, King said he would run for reelection, saying he had nothing to apologize for. King's campaign could not be reached for comment.
"Don't let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who's going to represent you in the United States Congress," he told voters in the district.

Epstein's twisted world

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles a comic book villain for the developmentally arrested intellectual - the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist - and now accused sex trafficker - is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein's apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn't be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times' reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein's very special black book, according to the Times.
The male invitees weren't your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual imposter." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks.
Others on Epstein's guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes. But he wasn't convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don't like to be contradicted and Pinker was thereafter told he'd been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein's private island in the Caribbean - which he dubs "Little St. Jeff's" - is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh's headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein's remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, Epstein is no ordinary bloke.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell - and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration - his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

8chan down after El Paso mass shooting — for now

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

WHAT'S BEHIND NADLER'S IMPEACHMENT POSTURING? TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, NADLER IS IN A TOUGH SPOT

Texto completo: First elected to Congress in 1992, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York is a well-established member of the Democratic establishment and a loyal follower and supporter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. So, what's behind Mr. Nadler's pointed determination to pursue President Donald Trump's impeachment? Mr. Nadler appears to be ignoring the speaker's wishes. Perhaps there is more here than meets the eye.
It has been underreported that Mr. Nadler faces a credible challenger in New York's Democratic primary in 2020. Specifically, Mr. Nadler's opponent is the capable-appearing Lindsey Boylan. Ms. Boylan - who is 35 years old, a recent deputy secretary for economic development for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and a daughter of a Marine - has several things going for her. She has raised more than $250,000, which might not sound like a lot but is already more than triple what Mr. Nadler's Republican challenger raised in 2018. With nine months to go until the primary, this energetic young progressive may just be getting started.
Ms. Boylan has staked out a committed position to impeach Mr. Trump, and she accuses Mr. Nadler of being soft and ineffective as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. "We need a leader, not a follower," she told Politico this month, adding that Mr. Nadler is "trying to place the blame on someone else, Nancy Pelosi. I don't think that is a way to lead."
To state the obvious, Nadler looks a lot more like Joseph Crowley, the longtime incumbent whom Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., defeated in a 2018 primary, than he does a recruit for "the Squad." Conversely, Ms. Boylan seems a more experienced version of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.
To put it bluntly, Mr. Nadler is in a tough spot. You have to assume Ms. Pelosi has given him a pass to appear to be outside her control. The Judiciary Committee chair can look like he is proceeding with impeachment without going too far. This means Mr. Nadler must maintain some sort of political Brownian motion, always appearing to be on the move but never really going anywhere. Members of Congress have enjoyed reelection rates of 90% or higher since 2012, and primary challengers face a steeper hill to climb. But there are local factors that suggest Ms. Boylan might have a better chance than your average long-shot candidate.
The boroughs of New York have a history of Democrat insurgency that long predates Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. In 1970, Bella Abzug beat a 14-year incumbent in a primary in a district made up of parts of Manhattan. Two years later, Elizabeth Holtzman beat a 50-year incumbent (one of the House's longest-serving members) in a Brooklyn district to become at the time the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.
There is not only precedent at play here but also a pattern. Longtime incumbents House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., also face primary challenges this cycle - in Mr. Engel's case, one backed by the same Justice Democrats political action committee that helped propel Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to victory last year.
It's impossible to determine exactly how much of Mr. Nadler's push for impeachment is driven by a longing for the Klieg lights as opposed to the fear of an appealing young primary opponent. But no discussion of the internal workings of a Democratic House would be complete without a reference to legendary House Speaker Tip O'Neill, who is credited with saying that "all politics is local." You can bet that this is something Mr. Nadler has brought up more than once in private discussions with Ms. Pelosi. In a year when Democrats are supposed to be on offense, a number of them are feeling threatened within their own party.

GO TO AN ART MUSEUM in your hotel lobby

Información de publicación: Philadelphia Tribune ; Philadelphia, Pa. [Philadelphia, Pa]. 04 Aug 2019: 1B.

Texto completo: Procuring and exhibiting art in all forms has been synonymous with the hotel experience for several decades now, with both luxury and midlevel brands highlighting local artwork and museum-quality pieces rather than predictable poster reprints.
Guests like it: In a 2018 survey conducted by the nonprofit organization Americans for the Arts, 72% of respondents said they enjoyed the arts in "non-arts" venues including hotels.
Art-centric hotels are popping up in many cities, including the ART in Denver and the upcoming Hall Arts Hotel in Dallas, hoping to attract a new breed of clients who want to be surrounded by sculptures, video installations, paintings and mixed media.
But of late, some properties have begun to push the boundaries of what it means to be a hotel with great art.
Actively supporting artists
Artists once depended only on galleries to showcase their work and be "discovered," but more hotels now actively seek and support new talent in that role.
"We didn't want to commission art merely for the purposes of decoration," said Carson Glover, vice president of brand marketing at The Peninsula Hotels. The company created the "Art in Resonance" program, highlighting midcareer artists whose works were unveiled at the Hong Kong property in March.
"Nurturing the artist is an aspect that is so often lost in the business," he added.
For the first installment of "Art in Resonance," the American sculptor Janet Echelman created a netlike sculpture whose shape constantly changes with the wind. The Australian-born artist Timothy Paul Myers hand-wrapped everyday items like cups, saucers and chairs in red felt, creating a site-specific sculpture called "Alizarin" that stood out in the neutral tones of the lobby. And Shanghai-based MINAX architects created a modern version of the traditional Chinese teahouse using 999 pine and bamboo wooden pieces.
"For over 20 years I found myself making these large environmental installations that I can't afford to build on my own," says Paul Myers. His work and that of the other artists will travel to other Peninsula locations over the next few years, much like a museum exhibit.
Prices at the Peninsula Hong Kong start at $650 per night based on double occupancy, including taxes and fees.
Rotating exhibits
Two contemporary art collectors, Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson, opened The 21c Museum Hotels in 2006 in Louisville, Kentucky, with a vision to save the downtown.
The hotel has amassed more than 3,000 works, now spread over public areas, lounges and rooms, and exhibits are open to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In this aspect, this group of museum hotels - opening its ninth location this year - operates differently than a traditional gallery, which typically has more restricted exhibit hours.
The brand also co-curates exhibitions with museums like the North Carolina Museum of Art with the mindset that hotel art does not necessarily need to take the place of gallery art.
After the film and video artist Christina Zeidler took over the Gladstone Hotel in Toronto, the 37-room boutique hotel began holding rotating exhibits annually as well as live events. Artists also helped with the interior design of the rooms.
"Artists are given free rein to think about the design of the furniture, window coverings, wallpaper or wall treatment," said the exhibitions director Lee Petrie, who explains that apart from the permanent room art, the hotel shies away from commissioning anything. They believe continuously changing exhibits are draws for repeat visits.
Room rates at the 21c Louisville property start at $200. Rates at the Gladstone start at around $239 per night with a breakfast discount and free cocktail if you book directly on their site.
Murals
Installing murals has become an increasingly popular way for hotels to spice up room design.
In Philadelphia, the artist King Saladeen grew up as a "super inner-city, super low-income kid," and became the first artist-in-residence at the new Fitler Club, a "work/stay/play" destination. His gym mural is hard to miss; he used house paint, acrylics and spray paint to create "a burst of energy to stay motivated," he said.
Rates at the Fitler Club start at $450 for a king-size room; there is a monthly membership to use the club and workspaces starting at $225.
Philanthropic efforts
As funding for the arts is always a struggle, some properties have taken to raising contributions in more creative ways.
Saint Kate, the Arts Hotel that opened in Milwaukee in July, invited local artists to each design and decorate its "Canvas" rooms. Each Canvas room stay has a percentage of proceeds donated to organizations including The Milwaukee Repertory Theater, Artists Working in Education and even a local radio station.
Rates range from $209-$459 depending on weekday or weekend check-in.
Large-scale installations
Suzi Cordish, who runs more than 70 properties under the Live! Casino & Hotel brand, proudly displays her personal art collection in her hotels. Of late, she's put her energies into more large-scale installations and supporting emerging and midcareer artists.
She commissioned the New York City-based Chris Doyle to create an animated moving image called "Games of Skill and Chance" on a 9-by-40 screen at the Maryland Live! property.
Doyle said that rather than focusing his energies on trying to raise capital, he had peace of mind and free rein working with the hotel. In this instance, "the cost of making the video wall was far more expensive than the artist fee," he said.
The Mexican artist Bosco Sodi created a 16-by-8 "Blue Pangaea" painting that hangs in the library of Hotel Matilda in San Miguel del Allende, Mexico.
"If the hotel is a good hotel and you (as an artist) are in a position of putting your conditions with this kind of installation, that helps because a lot of people will see the work," Sodi said.
Room rates for Hotel Matilda start at $340 per night based on double occupancy, including taxes and fees. - (The New York Times)

Get Ready for All the New York Times Content Being Adapted for the Small Screen

Why read a newspaper when you can get what you need from TV? It’s not how all of us think, but there certainly are some out there who do, and it seems the The New York Times is determined that won’t exclude those members from still being part of their audience. In other words, get ready to be hit by a barrage of New York Times content adapted for the small screen.
In June, the paper launched The Weekly , a narrative news documentary, similar to their hit podcast The Daily . The Weekly, which airs on FX and streams on Hulu the next day, takes the viewer on a ride along with a Times journalist as he or she tracks and reports a news story. Right from finding sources to conducting interviews to chasing leads, the viewer gets to take a closer look at the life of a journalist and the pursuit of the truth. So far, The Weekly has covered stories on a variety of topics, ranging from the declining taxi industry in New York to immigrant families being separated at the border. The most recent episode, which was aired last Sunday, was centered on the Facebook love scam, in which operatives from Nigeria have duped an increasing number of women in the States.

“More than ever, we need to stand up for journalism. The best way to do that is to be transparent. On TV, you see the lengths we go to get the story and to get it right,” Sam Dolnick, assistant managing editor at the paper and a leader of The Weekly said in an announcement of the show’s launch.
On August 16, the paper will be releasing a seven-episode, non-fiction Netflix series, Diagnosis, based on the namesake hit medical column in The New York Times Magazine . In her column, Dr. Lisa Sanders, tells the story of people with mysterious, baffling illnesses and their journeys toward diagnosis. The televised adaptation, which has been co-produced by Scott Rudin Productions, Lightbox and NYT Magazine , will be centered on the cases of a series of patients with undiagnosed medical illnesses who Sanders has introduced in her column in the past year. Only this time, the readers were encouraged to help with the diagnosis.
Based off the medical data and patient history provided by Sanders, readers had the opportunity to research the symptoms and share their ideas and solutions with the patients and doctors in their efforts to find a diagnosis. Thousands of readers responded, and Sanders has vetted and narrowed the best responses fit for presentation to the patient and medical team. This combination of documentary-style storytelling coupled with global crowdsourcing will be new territory for Netflix too.
This foray into television by the Times doesn’t stop here. In October, Amazon will release Modern Love, based on a popular column from the Style section. The show will consist of eight stand alone, half-hour episodes that “explore love in all of its complicated and beautiful forms,” according to the paper. Created by filmmaker John Carney and produced by Storied Media Group and The New York Times , the show features a host of household names, Anne Hathaway, Dev Patel, Tina Fey and Andrew Scott to name a few. Modern Love column editor Daniel Jones, who serves as consulting producer, is already eager for the show to get a Season 2 order.
The variety in the content being produced by the Times is particularly striking, and the fact that each is being streamed on a different platform will help in their efforts to reach out to a wider audience.
We’re living in the golden age of television and small screen entertainment. Streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon have revolutionized the industry and transformed how we consume content. The New York Times is clearly ready to take its piece of the pie.

Covington Catholic students file new libel suit

Texto completo: A dozen public figures have been named in a libel lawsuit that claims their comments on the Covington Catholic incident were defamatory.
The suit was filed Friday on behalf of eight unnamed Covington Catholic High students present during the now-viral encounter with Native Americans on the National Mall, in which Nathan Phillips sang and played a drum as Nick Sandmann and his classmates stood around him. Some students chanted and performed a tomahawk chop, considered by some as mocking toward Native Americans.
This new lawsuit seeks a fraction of the more than three-quarters of $1 billion sought by Nick in his three suits against media companies. This suit was also not filed in federal court.
This suit, submitted by attorneys from Los Angeles and Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, seeks at least $15,000 and at most $50,000 for each student from each of the 12 defendants. That makes for a total of at least $1.44 million and at most $4.8 million.
The suit lists the following as defendants, claiming they made defamatory comments against the "Covington Boys," as they are identified in the suit:
Rep. Debra Haaland, a congresswoman from New Mexico;
Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and frequent guest on CNN;
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a congresswoman from Massachusetts and presidential candidate;
Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter;
Kathy Griffin, an actress;
Matthew Dowd, a political consultant and analyst;
Reza Aslan, a scholar and author;
Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton;
Shaun King, an activist;
Adam Edelen, a former state auditor of Kentucky;
Clara Jeffery, the editor in chief of Mother Jones;
and Jodi Jacobson, the editor in chief of Rewire News.
Haaland, who in 2018 joined Sharice Davids of Kansas as the first Native American women elected to Congress, tweeted about Phillips "being harassed and mocked by a group of MAGA hat-wearing teens."
The tweet is defamatory, the suit alleges.
But David Marburger, a Cleveland-based First Amendment attorney, was critical of the suit's credibility after reviewing it.
"Assuming politics don't intervene in the judicial system, this is exceedingly weak," he said. "I can't see anything that is colorably actionable as defamation."
Aslan is listed in the suit for tweeting a photo of Nick and Phillips and the question, "Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?"
Warren tweeted that Phillips "endured hateful taunts."
Kruse tweeted the students "mocked" Phillips and "taunted women."
The same and similar language highlighted by the suit as defamatory was listed as protected speech by a federal judge in Kentucky just last week, when U.S. District Judge William Bertelsman dismissed Nick's $250 million suit against The Washington Post.
Citing a Supreme Court decision, Bertelsman wrote statements that are "loose, figurative" or "rhetorical hyperbole" are protected by the First Amendment because they can't be proved true or false.
He identified certain words used by The Post as falling under this protection: "swarmed," "taunting," "disrespect," among others.
Another parallel exists between Nick's federal suit and the one filed in state court. In his ruling, Bertelsman wrote some of The Post's identifiers – "the teens" and "hat wearing people" – couldn't constitute defamation of Nick because he wasn't named or specifically described.
This new suit includes a tweet by Navarro that deems "MAGA-hat wearing teens" racist. And a tweet by King about "young kids in MAGA hats" is also included.
Marburger said the defendants may find protection because some of their comments were directed at a group rather than individuals. Though the suit says the statements were "interpreted by their [the students'] friends, family and associates as about them personally."
The suit claims the defendants called for the "public punishment" of the students, who received hate mail and death threats.
Griffin, in a tweet, called on her followers to identify, shame and "dox" the students. To dox is to publish personal information and encourage the harassment of others.
Edelen, the former Kentucky auditor, is the only Kentuckian named in the suit.
Robert Barnes, an attorney on the case, said by email that because no plaintiff is seeking more than $75,000 from any one defendant, the case could not legally be filed in federal court.
Marburger said the plaintiffs are "deliberately limiting the potential damages to keep it out of federal court."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump isn't a racist. Just ask him. He'll tell you.
"I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world," he told reporters at the White House.
That's a statement that doesn't sound like it is to be taken seriously by anyone except perhaps his mostly white and very conservative support base as a signal that he's not about to be pushed around by what he calls "political correctness" -- and I call common courtesy.
Lately, as the president might say, "a lot of people have been talking about" whether Trump is a racist or just playing one on TV.
Allegations about Trump's racism, as a Google search will quickly reveal, go back to his early days as a rising New York real estate developer and ravenous publicity hound in the 1970s.
But his latest self-promotion as "least racist" of all of the planet's 7.5 billion people comes after a couple of weeks of tweets and sound bites that are loaded with racist tropes and stereotypes against certain lawmakers of color.
First he called on four progressive Democratic congresswomen of color to "go back" to the "totally broken and crime infested places" they came from. In fact, all four lawmakers are American citizens. Three were even born in the U.S., but Trump isn't about to let stubborn facts get in the way of a good rant.
More recently he targeted Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., calling him a "racist" and declaring that the black congressman should return to take care of his Baltimore district, which Trump described as a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."
That's another way of saying "Go back to where you came from," as if Cummings' job description includes pest control.
Trump sounds a lot more agitated by Cummings' real job as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which currently includes oversight of whether Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, illegally used private email and text message accounts for official purposes.
Since it is quite late in the game to try reaching for votes beyond his base, it is no big surprise that Trump might find it easier to light emotional fires under his old supporters than to try to win new ones.
It is also apparently easier to make up black support in his head than to produce evidence to back it up. "The African American people have been calling the White House," he said last week. "They have never been so happy about what a president has done."
Right. Never mind that new Quinnipiac poll that asked quite simply, "Do you think President Trump is racist?" About half, 51%, of the voters surveyed said yes. The breakdown: 46% of whites taking part in the survey said yes, 55% of Hispanics and 80% of African Americans.
If Trump thinks demonizing black leaders is enough, his scheme could backfire by enraging and motivating other voters of color to turn out in larger numbers against him on Election Day.
Trump might be doing Democrats a big favor by reminding them about what may be the least appreciated cause of Hillary Clinton's electoral loss in 2016: Black voters who didn't show up to vote -- especially in the pivotal swing states of the Upper Midwest, which Obama won twice before she lost them.
In 2016, only four years after a record black turnout helped reelect President Obama, the black turnout rate for Clinton plunged -- falling to roughly 60% in 2016 from a record high of nearly 67% in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center.
Those stay-at-homes could have made a big difference for Clinton. President Trump won Michigan, for example, by only 10,700 votes out of more than 4.5 million cast.
Similar stories of black falloff and white conservative surges unfolded in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, among others.
A New York Times analysis last year found that while 9% of Obama 2012 voters went for Trump in 2016, 7% -- or more than 4 million missing voters -- stayed home. Three percent voted for a third-party candidate
So the best way for Democrats to beat Trump's strategy may be to motivate their own base to show up and vote. If they wonder why, all they have to do is remember the campaign trips to Michigan and Wisconsin that Clinton did not make before Trump won both.
Democrats don't need to pander or go overboard with impossible or divisive promises such as slavery reparations. They just need to show their own support base and persuadable independents that all of their votes matter. In fact, they do.

Assault weapons ban in Florida? AG Moody wants to block voters from having a say commentary

Texto completo: Ashley Moody is new as Florida's attorney general. So we're still learning who she really is.
Last week, she looked like a lackey for the gun lobby.
Moody drew cheers from the NRA when she went to court to try to block Floridians from voting on a citizen-proposed amendment to ban high-capacity weapons.
Keep in mind: Moody didn't just take a stance against the amendment and urge Floridians to vote it down. She's trying to stop you and every other Floridian from ever getting a chance to vote on it in the first place.
She wants to win this debate by preventing it. That's dirty pool.
And I say that as someone who's not really a fan of this amendment.
Yes, I think this gun-control measure is flawed in a couple of key ways. (More on that in a moment.)
But that's a debate for citizens, politicians and special interests to have at the ballot box - not one Moody should try to win for the gun groups by stifling it altogether.
Frankly, I'm sick and tired of Florida politicians trying to silence the voters' voice and thwart the voters' will.
You vote for lottery money to go to schools, and they divert existing funds away so schools remain underfunded. You vote for medical marijuana; they drag their feet. You vote for Fair Districts; they refuse to comply until a court forces them.
And sometimes, Florida's politicians do what Moody's doing here when they think they're going to lose a debate - they try to stop the debate from ever happening.
In this case, Moody's legal argument isn't even a very believable one. She says the amendment is too complicated for you to understand.
First of all: Since when has any Florida politician ever cared about that? Complicated and misleading amendments are just about the only kind they put on the ballots. Last year's ballot contained hot messes that mixed vaping with oil drilling and a "victims rights" bill that cops are still struggling to understand.
Second: This amendment isn't complicated or misleading.
It says the state would ban "assault weapons." It defines those weapons as rifles and shotguns capable of handling magazines with more than 10 rounds. And it says that anyone who owns an assault weapon now can keep it if the ban passes, as long as they register it with the state.
Once again, you're free to think that idea is an awful one. Or a wonderful one. But it's not a complicated one.
Here's what would be on the ballot if backers collect enough signatures:
"Prohibits possession of assault weapons, defined as semiautomatic rifles and shotguns capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition at once, either in fixed or detachable magazine, or any other ammunition-feeding device. Possession of handguns is not prohibited. Exempts military and law enforcement personnel in their official duties. Exempts and requires registration of assault weapons lawfully possessed prior to this provision's effective date. Creates criminal penalties for violations of this amendment."
Moody says the language is "not clear."
Actually, it's quite clear ... which is why the NRA hates it. Because the gun group knows the public strongly supports banning weapons made for high-speed human slaughter.
"This is just another attempt to thwart the voters from having a choice," said Patti Brigham, president of the Florida League of Women Voters and a leader of the group behind the amendment, Ban Assault Weapons Now. "Our government in Florida doesn't want any control on guns in a state that has had some of the biggest mass shootings in the country.
"Let Floridians decide, because it's the Floridians who are getting killed."
Moody spokeswoman Lauren Schenone described the ballot language as "a trick," saying the amendment would ban "virtually every semi-automatic long gun."
She's right about the ban covering most long guns - which is one of the reasons I think the amendment is flawed. Instead of banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, it would ban any gun "capable" of handling those magazines. That's most guns. I think it's too broad. But the amendment clearly says what it bans.
Here's another flaw in the amendment: It only applies to long guns - not handguns.
There are pistol magazines that hold 12 rounds, 17 rounds, 20 rounds and more. When Markeith Loyd was arrested for the murder of Orlando police officer Debra Clayton, he had a 9mm Glock attached to a 50-round drum.
If this ban passed, those would still be allowed.
I think backers just didn't want all the political heat of going after handguns. So they exempted them. That might be politically savvy, but also logically inconsistent.
Listen, I get the desire to clamp down on high-capacity weapons. I share it. These weapons aren't meant for hunting or protection. They're military-inspired weapons that many cops want off the streets because they're meant to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time.
As Ben Pollara, an adviser to the amendment campaign said: "If you're hunting, you don't need to spray more than 10 rounds at a deer."
That said, gun-makers will almost always come up with ways to get around new laws. So will criminals.
If Florida clamps down on current rifle designs, gun manufacturers will come up with new ones - as evidenced by the recent New York Times piece: "When lawmakers try to ban assault weapons, gunmakers adapt."
But that's all a debate for election season - not for a single politician to silence.

Missett: Decorations give away my not-so-secret obsession

Texto completo: I have a semi-secret. It’s only half a secret if you don’t come to my house. The decorations in my house will give the secret away. It’s also only half a secret if, away from my house, you ask me what my hobbies and interests are. And my friends and immediate family are aware of my obsession.
Oh, I have many of the same interests as you or your spouse or significant other, your parents or your siblings or your children. I love to read, tending toward murder mysteries, I always look forward to warm weather because I can start to garden, and I’m likely to be out gardening from May through September (this year, with all the rain, has been a major exception, though the flowers already established or sown before the rains began are doing splendidly). My interest is more of an obsession, I’m afraid.
Are you getting any ideas? Something inside my house, with its four main rooms, which isn’t apparent just looking at my house from the outside (although you’d find one definitive help on my backyard shed, a new addition)? Hmmm. I’ll tell you this, it isn’t anything obvious.
It has to do with an ocean creature. I have a friend who actually wrote a book about this creature, which made it to the New York Times bestseller list. She even had one of these creatures as a friend – really!
Here’s a hint. Ringo Starr sang lead on 11 Beatles songs. One of them has my sea creature in its title. No, it’s not “I Am the Walrus.” And before you rush off to look it up on your computer, I’ll tell you.
The song is “Octopus’s Garden.”
I don’t know why I love octopuses (which is the correct American plural of octopus) so much, but I’ll give you an idea of how obsessed I am. In my bedroom, I have a rubber octopus, and octopus brooch, and a box with an octopus on it, set up so the octopus can be seen when I first wake up in the morning.
In my office, I have only two octopus things, and it’s the same for my kitchen. I’ll have to fix that soon. I have temporary octopus tattoos ready to put on sitting on my bathroom sink – I’m thinking of wearing one the next time I go see my rather straight-laced doctor.
My living room’s glass art collection cabinet has two glass octopuses, as well as a real octopus in acrylic. There’s a white octopus adorning an end table, and, at the top of the bookcase, there is the first octopus I ever acquired – the realistic, 3-foot-long Octavia, a stuffed animal I purchased at the Baltimore Aquarium. Taking her home, I put her in a shopping bag, tentacles out, which resulted in curious looks and some questions.
I used to have Octavia at work, and a co-worker put a plastic heart-shaped ring on one of her tentacles, which she still wears today. Oh, by the way, I don’t really know Octavia’s gender, but males differ from females by having a specialized tentacle that carries sperm. Stuffed animals are not that exact in detailing.
I’m also preparing to put octopus decals on either side of my car.
Octopuses are extremely smart and extremely difficult to keep as pets, although people still continue to try and keep these charmers. But even in a substantial tank with a substantial lid, octopuses regularly escape their tanks and explore their non-water surroundings when the family which “owns” them sleep. Some octopuses are so very clever they will put themselves back in their tanks and put the cover on as it was when they escaped before their owners get up in the morning.
My family is so aware of my love of octopuses that my granddaughter Georgia, before she could spell, drew me a picture of a smiling octopus (with 11 tentacles) with smiling fish and seaweed titled “Oondrwodr,” her version of “under water.” It has a place of honor on my refrigerator; I forgot it when I listed my collection! Since it has 11 tentacles, should I call it an “undecimpus,” using the Latin for 11? I’ve also given Georgia a T-shirt with an octopus on it, which I hear she likes very much.
My author friend who wrote “The Soul of an Octopus” had her own personal octopus friend. When it was old and dying, she went to see it, and the octopus came across its tank and wrapped a tentacle lovingly around my friend’s arm.
As I’ve mentioned before, I’m 70, and I believe in having fun, even if my fun is quite eccentric. Why don’t you be like me and do what you really like to do? So what if people scratch their heads and think you are a little loco? You’ve earned it. Break out of your rut and adopt something crazy for yourself! Have fun now; you’ve earned it!
And P.S., I’d love to have a real live octopus someday, even if it did wander the house at night!

DOORDASH GETS A DELIVERY, BUYS RIVAL CAVIAR FOR $410 MILLION

Texto completo: The market for Bay Area-based online food delivery companies will shrink a bit: DoorDash is buying Caviar in a deal worth $410 million.
DoorDash Chief Executive Tony Xu announced the acquisition late Thursday in a company blog post. Xu said DoorDash made the deal because of Caviar's standing in the on-demand food-delivery market and its business philosophy.
"Like DoorDash, Caviar is a merchant-first company," Xu said. "Adding these merchants to our platform will complement DoorDash's merchant selection, ensuring we can cater to everyone and every occasion."
Caviar currently is owned by payment-processing and services company Square. Under terms of the deal, San Francisco-based DoorDash will pay Square $410 million in cash and preferred DoorDash stock for Caviar. The deal is expected to close later this year.
The deal comes as competition in the on-demand food delivery market is getting fiercer, with competitors such as GrubHub, Uber Eats and Postmates among the major companies battling for consumers' attention and dining-out dollars. Postmates has also filed to go public, which could boost its position in the food-delivery sector.
DoorDash's acquisition of Caviar comes as it is dealing with the fallout from a New York Times report that took a critical view of DoorDash's policy of subsidizing the wages of its delivery staff with their tips. DoorDash has said it will soon revamp its tipping policy to ensure that delivery staffers, which the company calls "Dashers," get the full amount of their tips on top of pre-set wages.

Texto completo: As a public school advocate, however, I take issue with the idea that something about the very nature of traditional public schools is failing our children. When desegregation efforts in Jacksonville ended, our community's commitment to equity among schools also ended.

While we provided choice through magnet schools, we did so in a manner that stripped neighborhoods of ownership of those magnet schools. For a while we even operated separate-but-unequal parallel schools -- in one case within a single school.

As our city expanded south and west of the St. Johns River without the benefit of developer impact fees, we allowed our older schools to crumble. Historical factors like white flight, financial redlining and economic abandonment have also contributed to the segregated, separate-but-unequal scenario we still see in too many of our public schools.

I submit that it was our community's abandonment of desegregation -- driven by generations of white racism -- that has failed vulnerable children; it is not any inherent flaw in "public schools" per se.

New York Times Magazine writer Nikole Hannah-Jones recently provided an in-depth look at America's abandonment of one of the most effective tools we've ever had for closing the achievement gap between black and white students.

Wrote Hannah-Jones: "We now know that school desegregation significantly reduced the test-score gap between black and white children -- cutting it in half for some black age groups without harming white children. No other reform has reduced the gap on this scale. Rather the opposite is true: The test-score gap between black and white students reached its narrowest point ever at the peak of desegregation and has widened as schools have resegregated."

Politicians who revived the ghost of George Wallace to end court-ordered busing are responsible for resegregation and the resulting widening achievement gap.

Indeed the headline of Hannah-Jones' article summed it up well: "It was never about busing."

Regardless of the cause of vastly unequal schools, charter schools now offer a valuable alternative to many families.

But isn't it time we started telling the whole story about school inequality? Isn't it time we all took responsibility for it instead of blaming our hardworking public school teachers?

Trump may block Dan Coats deputy from taking over as acting spy chief

Texto completo: The White House plans to prevent a top intelligence official from taking over as acting spy chief when Dan Coats steps down later this month, upsetting Democratic leadership.
Sue Gordon, who is principal deputy director in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, would step in as acting director until a nominee is confirmed, per a federal statute. The White House, however, has other plans, the New York Times reported Friday.
President Trump tweeted Sunday announcing he would nominate Rep. John Ratcliffe to replace Coats. Trump also said he would name an acting director soon, indicating that he could circumvent Gordon.
The White House requested the intelligence agency create a list of top officials who have worked for the agency, in what some saw as another sign Trump was looking at options beyond Gordon to temporarily take over.

Trump did not allow Gordon, who has served for more than 30 years in intelligence posts, to deliver a recent intelligence briefing at the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. A spokeswoman for the agency said Gordon was not prevented from attending any recent briefing but did not elaborate on what happened.
Gordon has not been told by the White House that Trump wants someone else serving in the role, and she plans to retire if informed that the president wants someone else in her current role who could then rise to serve as acting director until the Senate confirms a nominee, sources said.
Still, after the report was published, Trump told reporters he liked Gordon and did not rule out allowing her to become acting spy chief.
"I like Sue Gordon. Sue Gordon is there now, and I like her very much. I’ve always liked her," he said.
Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, "the plain language of the law requires that [Gordon] be elevated to that role once Dan Coats steps down." The California Democrat argued that if the Trump administration bypasses her, it will be "further evidence of Trump's intent to politicize the Intelligence Community to serve his partisan aims."

Peter Thiel blames Silicon Valley elitism for Google's AI work with China

Texto completo: Silicon Valley entrepreneur and President Trump ally Peter Thiel is berating Google again over its work on artificial intelligence in China, which he warns may benefit the country's armed forces.
“A.I. is a military technology,” Thiel wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times. “Forget the sci-fi fantasy; what is powerful about actually existing A.I. is its application to relatively mundane tasks like computer vision and data analysis.”
Artificial intelligence tools, he added, are “valuable to any army — to gain an intelligence advantage, for example, or to penetrate defenses in a relatively new theater of cyberwarfare, where we are already amid the equivalent of a multinational shooting war.”
Thiel, who founded data analytics firm Palantir, said artificial intelligence’s military applications make Google’s recent decisions “shocking." The company, for example, announced in 2017 that it would open a center devoted to artificial intelligence in China and said a year later that it wouldn't renew a Pentagon contract for artificial intelligence work.
“A little curiosity about China would have gone a long way, since the Communist Party is not shy about declaring its commitment to domination in general and exploitation of technology in particular,” Thiel wrote in the New York Times. “Of course, any American who pays attention and questions the Communist line is accused by the party of having a ‘Cold War mentality’ — but this very accusation relies on forgetfulness and incuriosity among its intended audience.”
An early investor in Facebook and a member of its board of directors, Thiel went on to call Google “naive” for ending its Pentagon contract, which followed backlash from its workforce, and opening its Beijing lab.
“How can Google use the rhetoric of ‘borderless’ benefits to justify working with the country whose 'Great Firewall' has imposed a border on the Internet itself?” he questioned. “This way of thinking works only inside Google’s cosseted Northern California campus, quite distinct from the world outside. The Silicon Valley attitude sometimes called ‘cosmopolitanism’ is probably better understood as an extreme strain of parochialism, that of fortunate enclaves isolated from the problems of other places.”
Thiel has trained his sights on Google in recent weeks and last month called for the CIA and the FBI to investigate whether the tech giant has been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence. He also said at the time the company is “seemingly treasonous” for its decision to work with the Chinese military instead of the U.S.
Google executive Karan Bhatia denied accusations that the company had been compromised by the Chinese government.
Thiel's op-ed slamming Google for its work in China comes after Trump escalated his trade war with Beijing this week by imposing a 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese goods beginning Sept. 1.

Whitney Cummings reminds us why we need shows (sort of) like Roseanne

Texto completo: Do you remember, a few outrage cycles ago, when Roseanne got canceled because of its lead actress’ racist tweet?
It was spring of 2018, and Roseanne Barr said former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was the product of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” Barr was swiftly sacked by ABC, though why the network hired the loose cannon for the show’s revival in the first place is a mystery.
Well, not too much of a mystery. Roseanne was bringing in heavy viewership, though it had diminished by the time Barr popped an Ambien and started tweeting.
To many conservatives, Roseanne was appealing and, as a show that depicted Trump supporters with even a little bit of sympathy, rare. Too bad Barr, once mislabeled as a conservative heroine, is more provocateur and right-wing populist than conservative.
Now Roseanne writer and producer Whitney Cummings is speaking out about the downfall of the show, and her comments explain why shows like Roseanne are important — and stars such as Roseanne are not.
“There’s this huge disconnect between Hollywood writers and America,” Cummings told the Daily Beast on Wednesday. “And there’s this idea among some Hollywood writers that America’s stupid.”
Cummings said the show helped lower-income families and people in red states feel “seen.” So many other shows, including Cummings’ 2 Broke Girls, follow the lives of at least relatively affluent characters in New York City. Roseanne, which originally ran from 1988-1997, focused on a working-class family in Illinois.
“I’m not saying that’s why people voted the way they did, but they did and they weren’t being represented on television,” Cummings said, after noting that Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment echoed the disconnect between Hollywood elites and much of their American audience.
“The opportunity to get content with a message into red states was very appealing to all of us,” she continued. “Because a lot of stuff that we make, only our echo chamber sees. We’re so delusional about who watches what we make and a lot of times we’re in our echo chamber and we sort of forget that there’s a ton of people who are not watching and we’re preaching to the choir.”
The U.S. needs more shows like Roseanne, where the lives of everyday Americans are reflected on-screen. Cummings adds that she even had to fight to bring realism to the show, reminding writers that characters would not say “undocumented immigrants” in their own home.
“In the privacy of his kitchen, with his wife, sixtysomething years old, [John Goodman’s character Dan] probably would not say ‘undocumented workers,’” she said. “But ‘illegals’ is not the PC term. It’s a tough one. And people got angry on the crew.”
She added that they had to “get it right so we know how the characters get it wrong.”
In the fall after the Barr tweet, ABC released The Connors, a show that was Roseanne without Roseanne, who had unceremoniously died before the pilot episode. The New York Times called The Connors “unsettling and raw and fitfully funny.”
It’s not Roseanne, but it doesn’t need to be. Without the star who played a Republican on screen and in her free time posed as Hitler for a photo shoot and tweeted out a couple's home address, it can distance itself from the right-wing caricature Barr represented.
The Connors still offers something most other shows don’t, and without the baggage of Barr, its appeal is so much better.

Timothy L. O’Brien: Trump’s racism infests the Republican Party

Texto completo: Back in February, Representative Elijah Cummings, a black Democrat, stood up for his friend, Representative Mark Meadows, a white Republican.
Members of Congress were fielding the testimony of President Donald Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, when Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, accused Meadows of racism for trotting out a female black Trump appointee as a stage prop during the hearing. “My nieces and nephews are people of color, not many people know that,” Meadows responded, fuming. “It’s racist to suggest that I asked her to come in here for that reason.”
Meadows, who recommended during the 2012 presidential campaign that Barack Obama be sent “back to Kenya,” also reminded the House of what he described as his record of combating racism. He asked Cummings, chair of the committee convening the Cohen hearing, to strike Tlaib’s comments from the record. “Mr. Chairman, you and I have a personal relationship that’s not based on color,” Meadows noted.
“If there’s anyone who’s sensitive with regard to race it’s me, the son of former sharecroppers,” Cummings replied. “You’re one of my best friends, I know that shocks a lot of people. But you are. And I can see and I feel your pain.” Cummings encouraged Tlaib to clarify that she wasn’t calling Meadows a racist personally, calmed down Meadows himself, and then moved the hearing along.
Over this past weekend Trump put Cummings and his Baltimore district in his crosshairs, tweeting at him 17 times in a racially-charged salvo of alternately bigoted, hostile and inaccurate insults that commenced at 7:14 a.m. on Saturday and concluded at 6:49 a.m. on Monday. Baltimore and its neighboring areas, the president allowed, were a “very dangerous & filthy place” and a “rat and rodent infested mess” where “no human being would want to live.” Cummings was “incompetent” and a “brutal bully” responsible for Baltimore’s problems, a “racist” who “spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people.” As he has done before, Trump also retweeted the musings of a far-right British pundit who is a self-described racist to make his case against Cummings.
A broad, diverse swath of Baltimore residents and supporters responded to Trump by coming to Cummings’s and their city’s defense, acknowledging that Baltimore had myriad problems, including crime and poverty, but was hardly the noxious monolith the president was slagging. #WeAreBaltimore became a ubiquitous hashtag and a rallying cry on social media. Perhaps the most poignant and powerful voice in all of that was a CNN anchor, Victor Blackwell, who was born in Baltimore and noted during a pointed, emotional broadcast on Saturday that Trump frequently uses the words “infested” and “infestation” when describing the homes or countries of people of color.
”Donald Trump has tweeted more than 43,000 times. He’s insulted thousands of people, many different types of people. But when he tweets about infestation, it’s about black and brown people,” Blackwell said. “There are challenges, no doubt. But people are proud of their community. I don’t want to sound self-righteous, but people get up and go to work there. They care for their families there. They love their children, who pledge allegiance to the flag just like people who live in districts of congressmen who support you, sir. They are Americans, too.”
One person who has yet to speak out on Cummings’s behalf is his good friend, Meadows. The congressman from North Carolina, like his entire political party, has remained silent while Trump - an inveterate racist- has spent yet another weekend targeting a high-profile Democrat of color in heinous, prejudiced ways. In that context, Meadows is a proxy for the lack of political courage and moral clarity in Trump’s Republican Party.
Mick Mulvaney, the president’s acting chief of staff, sat for an interview with Fox News on Sunday and said there was nothing racist about Trump’s comments. “If I had poverty in my district like they have in Baltimore,” Mulvaney said, “I’d get fired.” (Mulvaney’s old South Carolina district does have poverty rates like Baltimore’s - as do many of the rural, red state districts that Trump avoids criticizing).
Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, went on “Meet the Press” and simply pandered to Trump when the news show’s host, Chuck Todd, asked him about the tweets aimed at Cummings. “I didn’t do the tweets Chuck, I can’t talk about why he did what he did,” Scott said. “But I am disappointed in people like Congressman Cummings who are attacking border patrol agents.”
And While the president was comfortable attacking a politician for Baltimore’s woes, he couldn’t find it in himself to hold the city’s business community equally responsible. If he had, of course, that would have brought his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s family into the line of fire. The Kushners own and operate low-income housing developments in the Baltimore area that have been plagued with allegations of legal abuses and have been fined by local authorities for more than 170 building code violations.
Trump’s distaste for cities like Baltimore isn’t new. During the 2016 presidential campaign he referred to inner cities as “ghettos” that were “more dangerous than some of the war zones.” He also painted this portrait and made a promise: “The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We’re going to work with the African-American community and we’re going to solve the problem of the inner city.”
But the president has done little for troubled urban areas other than to use them as political punching bags from time to time. So what compelled him to lash out against Cummings and Baltimore this time?
Some of Trump’s language and bile was clearly inspired by and directly lifted from a “Fox & Friends” segment that aired Saturday morning about an hour before he first tweeted at Cummings. The congressman has been an aggressive critic of the humanitarian crisis along the U.S.’s southern border that was sparked by the president’s immigration policies, and it was the Fox piece that first tried to argue that conditions on the border were better than in parts of Baltimore.
The House Oversight Committee, which Cummings oversees, also voted recently to subpoena personal email and texts used by top White House aides, including Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump - which undoubtedly bothers the president.
Finally, and most troubling of all, the White House has concluded that Trump’s racist tweets and attacks on politicians of color may be an asset in the 2020 presidential campaign because it will resonate strongly “among his political base,” according to the Washington Post.
All of this explains why Trump sprang into action over the weekend. But it’s worth recognizing too just how comfortable the president has become with random bigotry, and with openly deploying a racism that has come naturally to him for quite some time. He might have checked himself if his party was more resolute, but he clearly understands that Meadows and the rest are there to empower him.

Texto completo: Kamala Harris faced a barrage of tough attacks over her criminal justice record at Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, with two rivals accusing her of ramping up drug prosecutions, failing wrongfully convicted defendants and keeping inmates in prison for cheap labor.
While some of the broadsides from former Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii were on point, not all of their claims stand up to scrutiny.
The scrum represented the most prominent airing so far of criticism that has dogged Harris since she jumped into the presidential campaign in January.
"The people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor you owe them an apology," Gabbard told Harris.
Harris stood her ground, attacking Biden for his own history of supporting tough-on-crime bills in the Senate and, after the debate, laying into Gabbard for her past defense of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.
Here's a rundown of Biden and Gabbard's accusations and what they got right and wrong about Harris' record:
DISMISSED CASES
Joe Biden: Harris "had a police department when she was there that, in fact, was abusing people's rights. was told by her own people her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me that  the police officer did something that did not give you information of what would exculpate your client. She didn't do that. She never did it. And so what happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough. And he freed 1,000 of these people. If you doubt me, Google 1,000 prisoners freed, Kamala Harris.' "
The facts: Biden is correct in describing the broad outlines of this episode, but he doesn't explain the full story and messes up many of the details.
The former vice president, who once served as a public defender in Delaware, is referring to a scandal Harris faced in her last year as San Francisco district attorney. A technician in the city's police drug lab had been skimming some of the cocaine she was supposed to test, possibly contaminating results.
Several members of Harris' staff had had concerns about the technician but continued to prosecute cases based on the lab's work and failed to tell defense attorneys about the issue for months. (Harris has said she wasn't told about the problem until it became public.) After blistering criticism from a state judge, Harris moved to dismiss about 1,000 drug cases.
At the time, Harris was slow to admit fault, with her office originally accusing the judge of bias because she was married to a defense attorney. But she took responsibility in an interview with The Washington Post this year, saying "The buck stops with me."
Some of the details Biden got wrong include: Harris' office moved for the cases to be dropped, not the judge. Not all 1,000 cases involved inmates who were "freed." The technician was not a police officer. And the judge in the case was a state judge, not a federal judge (and a woman, not a man).
DEATH ROW APPEALS
Tulsi Gabbard: "She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. In the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so."
The facts: Harris' attorney general office did block DNA testing that some legal observers believe could have helped overturn the murder conviction of a death row inmate who insisted he was framed.
Harris opposed efforts by lawyers for Kevin Cooper, a death row inmate from San Bernardino County, to get new DNA testing. In 2018, following a New York Times investigation into the case, Harris said she was wrong and called for further testing. Gov. Jerry Brown and his successor, Gavin Newsom, ordered additional testing to take place, which is still ongoing.
Her attorneys also defended several other convictions with serious problems. In one case, her office defended a murder conviction in which a prosecutor allowed false testimony in court. That provoked harsh criticism of her office from a federal appeals court panel, and Harris later changed her position, arguing for the conviction to be reversed.
INMATE LABOR
Tulsi Gabbard: "She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California."
The facts: It's false to say Harris kept prisoners incarcerated beyond their sentences. Lawyers in Harris' attorney general office did unsuccessfully argue against the early release of prisoners, citing needed inmate firefighting labor but Harris said they did so without her knowledge and publicly criticized the statement at the time.
In September 2014, attorneys for Harris argued in a court filing that the state should not free some prisoners as part of efforts to reduce prison crowding because it would negatively impact programs that put inmates to work fighting wildfires. That would "severely impact fire camp participation a dangerous outcome while California is in the middle of a difficult fire season and severe drought," the lawyers wrote. A judge ruled against Harris' office's request.
When the memo provoked headlines that fall, Harris spoke out against it and said she was not aware of it. "The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities," she told the website ThinkProgress. "The idea that we incarcerate people to have indentured servitude is one of the worst possible perceptions. I feel very strongly about that. It evokes images of chain gangs."
MARIJUANA PROSECUTIONS
Tulsi Gabbard: "She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana."
The facts: This is a highly misleading statistic.
Gabbard appears to be referring to the number of Californians who were sent to state prisons for marijuana-related offenses while Harris was state attorney general. The conservative Washington Free Beacon reported this year that at least 1,560 people went to prison for pot during Harris' tenure from 2011 through 2016, citing reports from the California corrections department that are no longer available on its website. A department spokesman said it would take him several days to confirm those stats.
But the attorney general's office doesn't directly prosecute the vast majority of drug cases in the state. That's up to the individual district attorneys in each county. It's wrong to say Harris put those people in jail. Still, Harris did directly prosecute marijuana cases as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 through 2010. The DA's office has not yet released data about pot convictions during that time period.
While launching her attorney general reelection campaign in 2014, Harris let out a big laugh when asked by a local TV reporter about her opponent's support of legalizing pot for recreational use. This year, Harris has come out in support of decriminalizing marijuana on the federal level, proposing a sweeping plan last week to bring the cannabis industry out of the legal shadows. She said in an interview in February that she'd personally smoked weed as a college student "and I inhaled."

Texto completo: Justices' decision on wall funding sets dangerous precedent
The real key to the decision by the five conservative justices of the Supreme Court is not that the court continues its virtually unwavering political support for Donald Trump and the wall (“Justices let building of the border wall proceed," Page One, July 27). Rather, it is that the decision allows Trump, under the guise of declaring a national emergency (and national emergency to him seems to mean that Congress disagrees with him and thus should be ignored or overruled), to reassign money appropriated by Congress.
But it is the constitutional role of Congress, not the president, to control the purse and appropriate funds for the government. With this precedent established, why would Trump not continue to declare emergencies to move money where he wants it rather than where Congress has allocated it? In the end, what power would Congress still have?
This is a basic rewriting of the constitutional balance between the executive and legislative branches, and it is part and parcel of the dismantling of democratic elements and spaces in the United States, supported by many in the Republican Party and conservative movement.

Another scary victory for our imperial president
It's bad enough that the spineless Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and most of his fellow Republicans are kneeling before the man in the White House, thereby relinquishing the authority of Congress as an equal branch of the US government. But now the Supreme Court has fallen in line with those who are willing to diminish the power of our legislative branch, by allowing Trump to divert funds allocated by Congress for our military to pay for his political sideshow of a border wall.
As too many legislators and justices kowtow to an imperial president, we should heed the warning of one who knows him well: his former attorney, Michael Cohen. Cohen warned that Trump won't give up power voluntarily.
Let us not forget the lessons of the events that led to the rise of fascism in Germany 80 years ago. In my opinion, the impeachment of Trump cannot come soon enough.

Clark's call for impeachment is muddled
I was alarmed when I read Representative Katherine Clark's statements in the Sunday Globe (“Clark explains why she joined the call for impeachment"). She states that what was pivotal for her, after finding details in the Mueller report of attempted obstruction disturbing, was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's blocking of a vote on an election security bill. What does the blocking of a vote by a member of the legislative branch have to do with the impeachment of the president?
Was Clark alarmed in 2016 when President Obama joked that “no serious person" believes that our election could be rigged? Was she concerned when Russian disinformation about scandalous events in the Steele dossier slandered then-candidate Donald Trump?
After it became clear that Robert Mueller's recent testimony would not have a so-called smoking-gun moment, Clark took Mueller's remarks about Russian interference as a new avenue toward impeachment. The idea that McConnell's blocking of a bill could be the deciding factor for her is an indication of how contrived her views of impeachment actually are.

Time will judge GOP lawmakers harshly
When they leave their congressional offices, Republicans will have to live with themselves and their consciences for not speaking up against Donald Trump for his racist remarks, his undermining of our democracy and the Constitution, and his general demeaning of the office of the president. For expedient purposes and their own deemed self-interest, they have become servants of Trump rather than servants of the people.
As Martin Luther King Jr. said, “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."

The people need to take to the streets to push Trump out
Re “Start those impeachment engines!" (Letters, July 26): While I share Norah Dooley's sentiments regarding the recalcitrance of the Democratic leadership (“What . . . are they waiting for — deus ex machina?"), I believe she draws the wrong conclusion from the events in Puerto Rico that she cites so approvingly.
The leadership in that island had nothing to do with the ouster of the governor there. This was entirely the product of a mass popular uprising. At least 10 percent of the entire population were out in the streets.
Expecting the sclerotic Democratic leadership to mount an effective opposition to the increasingly monstrous behavior of Donald Trump and his coven of enablers is an exercise in futility. Exercise? No, it's the CrossFit of futility.
As with the labor movement, civil rights, women's suffrage, and other major changes, our leaders will act in our interests only when we force them to.

Trump's true base: the wealthy, who make out like bandits
Why do big-bucks conservatives still love Donald Trump despite his otherwise embarrassing vulgarity? Just look at two recent headlines in the Globe: “Government plan would make coastal mansions eligible for disaster aid" (July 22) and “Trump's callous cuts to food stamps could affect 90,000 in Mass." (July 26). The transfer of taxpayer support from the poor to the rich has been the conservative agenda since long before Trump.

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" — if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage. "'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.
The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."
In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita — more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 — up from 147 homicides at the same time last year.
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%.
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics.

Texto completo: EMBRACING THE COMPLICATIONS
SYDNEY -- Years ago, when I returned to the New York newsroom after covering the war in Iraq, the executive editor at the time, Bill Keller, said something to me that stuck: "If we're telling our readers the world is more complicated than they think, that's when we know we're doing our jobs." That's what Adam Ferguson does in this section with his stunning photography, intimate portraits, sharp observations and personal reflections. He tells us -- and shows us -- that the Australian outback is more complicated than we think, even if for those, like him, who grew up not far away. I grew up in Massachusetts, 10,000 miles from my current home, in Sydney, where I was the lucky soul chosen to open The New York Times's newest international bureau. I'm a Yank, a father of two, a voyaging reporter who has covered a dozen countries, and now I am leading The Times's expansion in Australia, part of a global push to reach readers everywhere. Adam's project, in many ways, exemplifies the mission of our Australian outpost and The Times's broader international operation: to tell a wider range of stories in more dynamic ways from more places, and by so doing, to create journalism that is relevant and stands apart. We know that Times readers share certain characteristics. Whether here in Sydney or in Perth, London, Toronto, Berlin or Mexico City, our people are curious. They want to see their own lives reflected in our coverage, but they are also eager to learn about the rest of the world, and more willing than most to be challenged by information, images and stories that spark contemplation. Since our Australia bureau opened in March, we have found a growing audience eager to engage with what we do, and with each other. They are eager to be more connected to global conversations, exacting in their standards (holding us accountable, too), and generous with insight and opinion. If there has been a consensus in reader guidance so far, it's on two points: First, get out of the cities. Second, remember that Australia is a young country of sharp contrasts and rich veins of reporting that are not yet fully mined. Indeed, it is one of the world's wealthiest and most urbanized nations, yet Australians like the ones in these pages often see their identity and economy through the lens of wide-open spaces and competition over natural resources. It's a country that's clearly open to outsiders in some ways, with one in two Australians either born overseas or with a parent who was. But it is also divided, like so many places, over whom to welcome, and how far to go in evolving what it means to be Australian. In these gaps and others, The Times will continue to dig around for stories that reveal Australia's complexities to the world -- and to itself. DAMIEN CAVE, Australia Bureau Chief

Texto completo: Since at least February, DoorDash drivers have known the company was at times dipping into their tips to cover their base pay. But it wasn't until last week that the on-demand meal delivery service said it would stop.
More customers finally got wise to how their tips were being used. And they didn't like it.
Announcing plans to rethink the controversial pay structure on Twitter, Chief Executive Tony Xu indicated it was backlash from the people placing all those takeout orders - not the ones delivering them - that forced the concession.
"It's clear from recent feedback that we didn't strike the right balance," Xu tweeted. "We thought we were doing the right thing by making Dashers whole when a customer left no tip. What we missed was that some customers who did tip would feel like their tip did not matter."
The practice first came to light earlier this year when couriers, confused about what and how they were being paid, began piecing together what little information they had as independent contractors and realized customers' tips were sometimes helping DoorDash pay them the guaranteed base pay, not just supplementing their earnings.
But it wasn't until a recent New York Times report renewed attention to the practice and sparked outrage among customers and the public.
"The new model will ensure that Dashers' earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order," Xu tweeted, saying "customer obsession" was one of the company's "core values." "We'll have specific details in the coming days."
The company's acknowledgment is a stark about-face from when driver and tech worker backlash prompted San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin to ask the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to investigate DoorDash for a potential labor violation in February. In an interview with Fast Company at the time, DoorDash said "we believe our model best serves both Dashers and customers. Since implementing this pay model in 2017, Dasher retention and overall satisfaction have increased significantly while average delivery times have decreased."
Gig Workers Rising, a San Francisco group that represents on-demand laborers, tweeted it was "remarkable" Xu attributed the reason for the policy change to customers and not to the drivers who first complained about misuse of their tips.
"It was highly disrespectful of (Xu) to dismiss drivers when he announced this policy change," Shona Clarkson, an organizer with Gig Workers Rising, said in a statement. "He should have proactively said he would repay the wages taken from their workers. Instead, DoorDash will have pocketed millions of dollars taken from customer tips."
DoorDash isn't alone in the practice. As the Los Angeles Times first revealed in February, Amazon was in some cases using customer tips to guarantee Flex drivers' base pay. Amazon did not respond to questions about whether the company is considering changing its policy. Another company making use of this practice, Instacart, gave in to pressure and quickly changed its policy when it was called out by drivers in February, as BuzzFeed News first reported.
As is often the case, independent contractors who work for gig economy companies are left to do the extra work of cobbling together the meager information these companies give them to understand how they operate. While DoorDash said it indicated in its FAQ that tips were sometimes added to meet pay guarantees, the language is confusing and ambiguous enough that it's not immediately clear how tips are used.
"For each delivery, you will earn at least $1 plus customer tip, but DoorDash will ensure that your total earnings (including tips) are never less than the amount you're guaranteed when you're offered a delivery," the FAQ reads.
It later says: "When base pay plus tip is more than the guaranteed minimum, you keep that larger amount."
Workers across the gig economy demanding answers have long had to settle for templated responses from customer support representatives.
Responding to questions about tips from Flex drivers, Amazon, in emails obtained by The Times, repeatedly stated that drivers received 100% of tips but also that they "add any supplemental earnings required to meet our commitment that delivery partners earn $18-$25 per hour."
In lieu of clear and direct communications from companies, many gig workers turn to online forums and groups, looking for others who might have more information and banding together to trade documents and tips to ensure they are receiving what they have been promised. Some turn to creative sleuthing to get clear answers.
The asymmetry in information, fragmented nature of the workforce and fear of retaliation make it possible for companies like DoorDash and Amazon to implement questionable labor practices like these, often without significant pushback. Every so often, however, the same decentralized network dynamics can put companies in the midst of a bad PR blizzard they can't control - as DoorDash learned last week.

Texto completo: LONDON -- The estranged sixth wife of the ruler of Dubai asked a London court on Tuesday to protect her child from being forced into marriage, escalating a standoff within one of the world's wealthiest royal families that has so far been cloaked in secrecy.
The wife, Princess Haya, fled with the couple's 11-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son to London several months ago, making her at least the third woman to try to escape the palaces and estates of the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.
On Tuesday, the princess made her first public appearance since then, at the opening of the closely watched legal battle.
Sitting in a wood-paneled hearing room of the family division of the high court, Princess Haya also asked for custody of the couple's two children and a non-molestation order protecting her from violence or harassment, Britain's Press Association reported.
But it was her appeal for a forced marriage protection order that drew the most notice. Such orders allow the British authorities to prevent a family from forcing someone into marriage. They allow the authorities to block the person from being taken abroad, and they can also be used to help someone already in a forced marriage.
Sheikh Mohammed's lawyers contested Princess Haya's request, asking the court to allow the children to be taken back to Dubai, the largest city of the United Arab Emirates.
Details of the couple's legal motions were not disclosed, including which child was the subject of the princess's marriage-protection motion.
The judge, Andrew McFarlane, barred British-based reporters for international news outlets like The New York Times from watching the proceedings. The hearing was also subject to broad reporting restrictions.
But the judge, citing "a public interest," allowed some information to be disclosed after denying a request by Sheikh Mohammed's lawyers to suppress even the most basic details of what he and Princess Haya were seeking.
Princess Haya, 45, the most visible of the sheikh's six wives, appeared in court beside her lawyer, Fiona Shackleton, who represented Prince Charles in divorce proceedings with Princess Diana. Sheikh Mohammed was not in court, but he is being represented by Helen Ward, who helped Guy Ritchie in his divorce from Madonna.
Representatives for both parties declined to comment on Tuesday. In a joint statement this month, they said the legal proceedings were "concerned with the welfare of the two children of their marriage and do not concern divorce or finances."
Princess Haya's flight followed attempts by two of Sheikh Mohammed's daughters from other marriages, Sheikha Shamsa al-Maktoum and Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum, to leave. They were recaptured by Emirati forces and are said by advocates to be held in Dubai against their will.

Texto completo: It has become a drearily familiar story: A data breach at a major company exposes troves of sensitive information, putting millions of people at risk of online fraud.
Last year, it was Marriott. The year before, Equifax.
This time, it's Capital One, which said on Monday that a hacker had compromised the personal information of more than 100 million people, in one of the largest-ever thefts of data from a bank. For the vast majority of those consumers, the breach appears to have exposed only relatively inconsequential details like names and addresses, rather than Social Security and bank account numbers.
The bank said it was "unlikely that the information was used for fraud or disseminated by this individual," and that no credit card numbers or passwords were exposed.
But the news of the theft -- just a week after Equifax reached a $ 650 million consumer settlement stemming from the 2017 breach -- highlights the importance of digital security at a time when major leaks of consumer information are a fact of life.
Who was affected?
The suspect, identified in court documents as a 33-year-old software engineer, Paige Thompson, is accused of stealing 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 bank account numbers, as well as one million "social insurance" numbers, which are the Canadian equivalent of Social Security numbers.
The information came from credit card applications that consumers and small businesses had submitted from 2005 to 2019, according to Capital One. The bank said the account numbers were linked to "secured" credit cards, which tend to be held by consumers with bad credit who are financially vulnerable.
Capital One says it will "notify affected individuals through a variety of channels." The bank did not respond to an email seeking more information on that process, but Capital One has promised to make free credit monitoring and identity protection available to anyone affected by the breach.
What can consumers do to protect their data?
Capital One has issued guidelines urging consumers to monitor their credit card accounts for suspicious activity and forward phishing emails to abuse@capitalone.com.
Beyond those initial steps, the response to a major data breach generally follows a basic playbook: After the Equifax breach, The New York Times's Tim Herrera wrote a four-part guide to protecting sensitive information online. Here are the precautions he recommends:
Set up fraud alerts. The three major credit reporting agencies -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- will alert you if someone tries to apply for credit in your name.
Consider credit freezes. A credit freeze locks your credit files so that only companies you already do business with have access to them.
Check your credit report. All Americans get one free credit report a year from all three major reporting agencies. Closely analyzing those reports can help you spot any suspicious activity.
Consider credit monitoring. Capital One has promised free credit monitoring to consumers affected by the breach. You should probably take them up on that.
Emily Flitter and Karen Weise contributed to this article.
(We'll update this story as we learn more about what you can do to find out if you were hacked, and how to claim credit monitoring.)
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Juan Rodríguez (39) sobrevivió a la guerra de Irak, pero nada se compara con la pesadilla que está viviendo desde la tarde del viernes, cuando descubrió que un “descuido” suyo había acabado con la vida de sus gemelos de un año de edad, asados de calor tras ser olvidados dentro de su auto en el estacionamiento del hospital donde trabaja en El Bronx (NYC).
Desde entonces Rodríguez ha estado tratando de comprender cómo pudo dejado a su hijo mayor de 4 años en su guardería y haber olvidado hacer lo propio con los gemelos en su otro centro de cuidado. Y, peor aún, cómo pasó 8 horas en el trabajo sin recordar que los bebés estaban encerrados en su auto.
Algunos se preguntan si esa “laguna mental” no es consecuencia de su experiencia militar. De hecho, en el Hospital “James J. Peters VA” en Kingsbridge labora como trabajador social ayudando a otros ex combatientes sin hogar y enfermos.
El sábado quedó en libertad bajo fianza, con cargos de homicidio involuntario.
Angustiado, le dijo a un amigo cercano que creía que había dejado a los niños en su guardería, a pesar de que no lo había hecho. “No podía explicarlo”, dijo el amigo Alfredo Angueira. “En su mente los dejó”.
El domingo, Rodríguez llamó a David Diamond, un profesor de psicología en Florida que estudia por qué los padres pueden olvidar a sus hijos en los automóviles.
Rodríguez no podía entender su propio lapso de memoria. “Pensó que era la única persona que había hecho” algo así, dijo el Dr. Diamond en una entrevista a The New York Times.
El Dr. Diamond le aclaró a Rodríguez que cientos de otros padres también han dejado a sus hijos en autos calientes, con resultados igualmente trágicos. Le ha sucedido a médicos, contadores, maestros.
Desde 1998, alrededor de 440 niños en todo el país han muerto de golpes de calor después de ser olvidados en automóviles, generalmente no por falta de amor, sino por cómo funciona la memoria humana, dijo Diamond.
“Creo que esto lo ha ayudado en su momento de duelo”, dijo, “para comprender cómo es posible que pudo haber hecho eso”.
Rodríguez no ha hablado públicamente, pero los comentarios de Angueira y el Dr. Diamond ofrecieron las primeras ideas sobre cómo está lidiando con la devastadora realidad de haber dejado morir a sus hijos.
Rodríguez, quien vive en el condado Rockland (NY), al salir del trabajo regresó al auto a las 4 p.m. Sólo se dio cuenta de que los bebés estaban dentro después de que comenzó a manejar unas cuadras, afirmó.
“¡Mis bebés están muertos! ¡Maté a mis bebés!”, gritó al descubrirlos muertos y con espuma en la boca .
Su esposa, Marissa A. Rodríguez ha estado a su lado, afirmando que fue un accidente horrible. El domingo dijo en un comunicado que las muertes de sus bebés Luna y Phoenix han sido “mi peor pesadilla”.

USA TODAY caught up with Amoruso to talk about everything from iced matcha and Cat Stevens to learning tough lessons the hard way and being thirsty for knowledge.
Question: How did you get your start in the business world?
Sophia Amoruso: At 22, I started an eBay store called Nasty Gal Vintage and it exploded. In a few years, we went from $250,000 to $1. 1 million to $6. 5 million to $30 million in revenue. I had never even worked in an office before, but I followed my nose and built a really big business. That brand spoke to women in a way beyond fashion – Nasty Gal was a community, and that’s the throughput with Girlboss. When a customer bought a motorcycle jacket, it was something that was a promise to herself to be just a little more bold in her life, and it was beyond a motorcycle jacket – it was something that made her feel more confident to go out into the world. That’s very much what Girlboss is – we’re doing that more directly with our professional network that we just launched – and her being able to see herself in a life that she wants and being able to take small steps forward to achieve that and see other people that are doing it is very much what I’ve done throughout my career.
In terms of Girlboss, it’s another thing that exploded. I wrote a book (“#GIRLBOSS) five years ago now, and the hashtag’s been used 17 million times on Instagram, the book’s sold half a million copies, Netflix put a show called “Girlboss” to 100 million homes, and it’s very much part of the zeitgeist. As a company, we’re two years in, and we have a podcast network, a yearly conference called Girlboss Rally, but what we’re really doing that that all ladders up to is building a digital professional network for ambitious women.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Amoruso: I usually take calls from home in the morning, and come in around 10. I have a lot of meetings, more than I would like, but there’s a lot to do. Those things can range from looking at creative to talking about our road map to having touch bases to recording a podcast. There’s a lot of shifting gears and a lot of variety in what I contribute to and spend time on (with) Girlboss. I have therapy twice a week, so part of that takes me across town, but I often work in that area after therapy and have meetings closer to West Hollywood. I go home at maybe 7, and for the most part I cook dinner for myself – I enjoy cooking – and I’ll often work from home for several hours after that, just catching up because there’s so little time to clean my inbox or do deeper thinking while I’m at the office.
Q: What’s your favorite thing about your job? Amoruso: Being able to learn. Our platform is in beta, but I’m beta, and I’ll always be beta. I get to learn things that I would never otherwise be able to and that I never even knew existed. Just learning, really every day – it’s such a privilege to be in a place where our business requires that.
Q: What do you credit your success to?
Amoruso: Resourcefulness, grit, and curiosity.
Q: How do you balance work, life, and such a busy schedule? Amoruso: Unless I’m traveling, I don’t work on weekends. I make sure that if I need to work from home, I do. The whole team works from home on Fridays, which is really nice, and we’re able to work from anywhere. I rarely do business dinners – I go home almost every day and spend time cooking for myself, taking care of myself, and having some time alone until my boyfriend gets home, which is usually a little later than I get home. I make sure to do small self-care things, whether it’s doing yoga or something like getting my nails done – just stopping, taking care of my body, and feeling like I’m investing in feeling good and my body and who I am going out into the world. I also eat really healthfully: I don’t eat sugar, I don’t eat gluten, and that’s been really great because that 3 p. m. slump I get, I no longer get, and it’s been really great eating more healthfully.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Amoruso: The cover of Forbes was huge; publishing “#GIRLBOSS” was an unparalleled experience; opening our first store with Nasty Gal was so exciting, and founding Girlboss. Being able to focus on Girlboss full time three years after the book was published, knowing that there’s been a community waiting for us to build what we’re building today for girls that have read the book and have been inspired by the Girlboss ethos – that we have now built a place for her to go and connect with one another and advance her career professionally. That’s really, really, really rewarding.
Q: What has been one of the biggest tough lessons you’ve had to learn as an entrepreneur?
Amoruso: Holding executives accountable. That’s something I could have done a better job at at Nasty Gal. I hire people, and I trust them. The advice is to let smart people do their jobs, but at the same time, everybody needs that kind of guidance. I had hired executives who had careers longer than I had been alive when I was in my twenties, and I thought they’d show up and dive into business and just do what needed to be done, but I could’ve stayed closer to their work. That’s something I’ve learned the hard way.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Amoruso: Try a lot of things and find what resonates and what you’re good at. Especially when you’re young, you cannot fail. You have all the permission to jump around and try different things. Find smart people around you who have been there and done it. Seek out great advice, and stay curious. Use all of the resources you have at your disposal: read books, Google things, watch YouTube videos – whatever you need to answer the questions that you have. Find where you can gain that information and knowledge. A lot of that is on Girlboss – what we’re building with this social network is what I wish I’d had. To be able to connect with tens of thousands of women who have been there and understand what you’re going through more so than a Google search would is so, so powerful. There’s ways that you can fast-forward without having to learn those lessons the hard way by connecting with people who have done it.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he has selected Rep. John Ratcliffe to replace Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats when Coats leaves his post next month.
"I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence. A former U. S. Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves," Trump said in a tweet.
"I am deeply grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to lead our Nation’s intelligence community and work on behalf of all the public servants who are tirelessly devoted to defending the security and safety of the United States," Ratcliffe said.
Here is what you need to know about the man Trump has tapped to be the next director of national intelligence:
He is more ideologically aligned with Trump
Coats' tenure as Trump's intelligence community czar was at times rocky, as the DNI director's assessments did not always conform to the president's political priorities.
Ratcliffe, 53, appears to be someone who will share more of Trump's perspectives.
For example, Coats declined to include immigration among the top threats facing the United States during his annual threat assessment before Congress in January, when Trump was calling it a national security threat. That same month, Ratcliffe voted against the appropriations bill to end a government shutdown because it did not include all the funds Trump had requested for a border wall and "ensure our national security needs are met. "
"When the safety of American citizens is on the line, we just can’t afford to miss the mark," Ratcliffe said in a tweet explaining his decision to vote against the bill.
What the director of national intelligence does
The director of intelligence is the head of the U. S. intelligence community. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the 9/11 Commission cited a lack of communication and cooperation between various law enforcement and intelligence agencies as being partly to blame for a failure to identify warning signs that might have prevented the attack.
The DNI was established to better coordinate those agencies to prevent future domestic attacks. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence prepares the president's daily intelligence briefing and advises senior military commanders, as well as Congress, on national intelligence.
As a Cabinet-level position, the director of national intelligence requires Senate confirmation.
He made an impression during Mueller's testimony
Ratcliffe gained national attention last week when he aggressively questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller. He argued that the entire second volume of Mueller's report on potential acts of obstruction of justice should never have been written.
"You wrote 180 pages about decisions that weren’t reached, about potential crimes that weren’t charged or decided," Ratcliffe said. "Respectfully, by doing that, you managed to violate every principle and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors. "
He also made an argument – which has since been repeated by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – that criticized Mueller's statement that while his "report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. "
"It was not the special counsel’s job to conclusively determine Donald Trump’s innocence or to exonerate him because the bedrock principle of our justice system is a presumption of innocence," Ratcliffe said.
"Donald Trump is not above the law. He's not. But he damn sure shouldn't be below the law," he told Mueller.
The next day, during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump named Ratcliffe as one of the congressional Republicans he thought "represented themselves brilliantly" during Mueller's testimony.
Critics say he is too 'partisan'
While Coats has been praised for his independence from Trump, critics are already skeptical that Ratcliffe will be too eager to please the president.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. , said it would be a "big mistake" to "elevate such a partisan player to a position that requires intelligence expertise and non-partisanship. "
"It’s clear that Rep. Ratcliffe was selected because he exhibited blind loyalty to President Trump with his demagogic questioning of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller," Schumer said in a tweet on Sunday.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. , on Monday said Ratcliffe was "an inapproriate choice" for the historically nonpartisan post.
"I think he's a television character that the president has watched on TV, and he wants to put somebody in this position who's going to agree with his political take on intelligence," Murphy said on MSNBC.
The New York Times reported Sunday that some Senate Republicans have similar reservations. Citing unnamed sources, the Times said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N. C. , told the White House that Ratcliffe was "too political" for the job.
Ratcliffe defeated a 34-year incumbent in 2014
Ratcliffe unseated 17-term Rep. Ralph Hall in a 2014 primary election. Hall, first elected to Congress in 1980, was a Democrat who changed parties in 2004.
With tea-party support, Ratcliffe campaigned against Hall as a Washington insider who had been on Capitol Hill for too long. Hall, the oldest serving member of Congress when he left office at 91, claimed he once sold cigarettes to the notorious outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.
He is a former U. S. attorney and small-town mayor
Ratcliffe served as a U. S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas from 2007-2008.
On his congressional biography, he boasts that in his stint as a federal prosecutor, he "put terrorists in prison, arrested 300 illegal aliens in a single day, and cracked down on drug trafficking and public corruption. "
From 2004 to 2012. he served as mayor of Heath, Texas, an affluent suburb on the shores of Lake Ray Hubbard, about 25 miles from downtown Dallas. According to the U. S. Census, the town currently has a population of 8,953, up from 6,921 in 2010.
Racliffe's biographby says that as Heath's mayor, he "balanced the budget for eight consecutive years without ever raising taxes. "

Texto completo: El mes pasado, Steven Romero celebró su sexto cumpleaños en Legoland en California. El domingo por la tarde, fue asesinado a tiros en el Festival del Ajo Gilroy en el norte de California.
En total, tres personas murieron y 13 resultaron heridas en el tiroteo , dijeron las autoridades. Se desconocen las identidades de las otras dos víctimas.
La policía disparó en apenas un minuto y mató al sospechoso que portaba un rifle de asalto, según un comunicado de la ciudad de Gilroy. Este lunes el atacante fue identificado como Santino William Legan . Se desconocen los motivos del crimen.
“No hay nada que realmente pueda hacer, además de tratar de estar con él hasta que pueda colocarlo en su lugar de descanso”, dijo el padre de Steven, Alberto Romero, a NBC Bay Area.
“Mi hijo tenía toda la vida por vivir y solo tenía seis años. Esto es todo lo que puedo decir.”
Romero estaba en casa con su hija de 9 años cuando se enteró del tiroteo. Steven había ido al festival con su madre y su abuela, que también resultaron heridas.
Romero dijo que la madre de Steven recibió dos disparos en la mano y cree que la abuela recibió un disparo en la pierna.
“Ojalá que detengan a los atacantes”, dijo Romero.
Justo después del tiroteo, Romero publicó una foto de Steven en Legoland, pidiendo a la gente que dé información sobre el tiroteo. Su cuenta ahora es privada.
Describió a su hijo como un niño enérgico que acababa de graduarse de la guardería y estaba a solo unas semanas de ingresar al primer grado.
Estaba “siempre feliz y siempre queriendo divertirse”, dijo Romero, mientras mostraba fotos del pequeño.
Entre los heridos estaba Lesley Sánchez, de 15 años, una porrista de la escuela secundaria Gilroy que estaba como voluntaria en el festival , según informaron miembros de la familia a The New York Times. Le dispararon en la cadera, pero pudo recibir visitas en su habitación del hospital el domingo por la noche, dijeron.
Julissa Contreras, una testigo que dijo que era una ex cadete de la policía, dijo en una entrevista el domingo por la noche que vio a “tu hombre blanco promedio” disparando lo que parecía ser un rifle semiautomático, “simplemente yendo de izquierda a derecha y disparando a quienquiera que podía, honestamente “.
“Definitivamente disparó más de 30 rondas”, dijo. “Fue como ininterrumpido, con dos, tres, cuatro disparos por segundo”.
Contreras describió al hombre como de unos 30 años, vestido con una gorra, gafas de sol deportivas y lo que parecía ropa de estilo militar.
“Parecía que podría trabajar en seguridad privada”, dijo. “Pero tenía como correas y clips, y estaba completamente preparado para lo que estaba haciendo. Absolutamente”.
Gilroy se encuentra a unos 30 kilómetros al sur de San José. El tiroteo tuvo lugar durante el Festival del Ajo Gilroy, un evento anual de tres días en Christmas Hill Park. Gilroy, de aproximadamente 60,000 habitantes, es un importante productor de ajo y hogar de trabajadores agrícolas y personas que se desplazan a empleos de tecnología.

Harlan Lane, Northeastern professor who studied and championed deaf culture, 82

Texto completo: As a psychologist, writer, and advocate for those who are unable to hear, Harlan Lane had a way of focusing quickly and concisely on what was at stake for the deaf community, which he championed as its own distinct ethnic group with a vibrant culture.
That discussion should begin, he said, by examining who gets to decide what constitutes a disability — a label he called “squishy."
“My students don't think needing eyeglasses is a disability but that needing a hearing aid is," he told the Globe in 2001.
Dr. Lane, who had been the Matthews distinguished professor of psychology at Northeastern University, where he helped establish the college's American Sign Language Program, died July 13 in his home in Roquefort-les-Pins, France, near Nice, according to The New York Times. He was 82.
His friend and collaborator Dr. Richard Pillard told the Times the cause was Parkinson's disease.
“We remember his creativity, his impact, and his passion for his work, especially his dedication to the deaf community," Joanne Miller, who chairs Northeastern's psychology department, told the News@ Northeastern website. “Harlan had a truly remarkable career, and we were very fortunate to have him as a colleague for nearly 40 years, until his retirement in 2012."
Dr. Lane, who also had a home in Boston, had studied deaf culture since the early 1970s, when he happened to watch two deaf people converse. Impressed by American Sign Language's complexity, and its emotional breadth and depth, he conducted research that illuminated the richness in how those who are deaf communicate.
He also became a prominent critic of how a mainstream culture dominated by those who can hear treats those who can't — including the insistence by many medical professionals that the top goals should always be teaching the deaf to speak and surgically giving them the ability to hear.
“If you're talking about the deaf as an ethnic group, and what you're offering them is to try to change them to make them more like the majority, because life is easier for the majority, that's unethical," he told the Globe in 2011.
Dr. Lane also challenged the notion that it should be automatically considered beneficial for someone who has been deaf since early childhood to regain hearing through surgical means, and to then leave deaf culture behind.
Deaf people marry other people who are deaf “more than any other minority. I think that's very significant," he said in 2011, adding that “what's up is the value placed on being deaf."
He particularly opposed medical intervention — such as cochlear implants — for young deaf children, and he drew an analogy to others who aren't born into a majority group.
“With black Americans, if we told them we can make life a little easier for your kid because with a little plastic surgery and some skin lightening, which we can do nowadays, they're going to 'pass' more easily . . . I would step out of the way, because I might get punched, and justifiably so," he said.
Dr. Lane said that he “and deaf people, and others who know the deaf well see that there's no disability here. There's a physical difference, which many minorities have."
In an interview with The Washington Post, he once said that “cochlear implants are bad medicine. Pure and simple."
Harlan Lawson Lane was born on Aug. 19, 1936, in Brooklyn, N.Y. His parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised by a grandmother.
After graduating from Columbia University in New York with bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology, he studied under the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner at Harvard University, from which he received a doctorate in psychology. He taught at the University of Michigan and also earned a degree in linguistics at what is now called Sorbonne University in Paris.
In the mid-1970s, he was hired by Northeastern's psychology department and had served as its chairman.
While Dr. Lane was in California in the early 1970s, he was introduced to deaf students communicating in American Sign Language.
“I became quite excited because I realized there was a whole new way to look at the psychology of language," he said in an interview posted on a Northeastern website in 2011, the publication year of “The People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry," a book he cowrote. “I felt like Balboa discovering the Pacific."
Watching the students communicate led him to explore what he called “Deaf World" in books, journal articles, and research.
He would, in time, help start Northeastern's ASL program and establish a research laboratory that studied speech and language.
Cathy Cogen, the first director of Northeastern's ASL program, told the Times how determined Dr. Lane had been to start holding classes in which hearing students could learn sign language.
“But the college said 'no,' " she recalled. “Harlan didn't take no for an answer, and in his gentle and poised way, he started offering the classes. When students started streaming in, the dean's office said 'OK' and accredited them."
Dr. Lane wrote or cowrote several other books, including “When the Mind Hears: A History of the Deaf" (1984), “The Mask of Benevolence: Disabling the Deaf Community" (1992), and “A Journey into the Deaf-World" (1996).
In 1988, while teaching as a visiting professor at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., where the students are deaf and hearing-impaired, he watched proudly as students protested the school's selection of a hearing educator as its new president over qualified deaf candidates.
When the students commandeered the school's gym, Dr. Lane watched as their “flying fingers" conveyed an awakening of their cultural pride.
“In that silence you could feel the kids' excitement at being on their own and coming together with their own kind," Dr. Lane told The Chicago Tribune. “It's a feeling of solidarity that, once a minority experiences it, there's no turning them back."
The school subsequently reversed its decision and hired its first deaf president, I. King Jordan.
After Dr. Lane's death, Roberta J. Cordano, Gallaudet's current president, who is deaf, said in a statement: “As a hearing person who advocated for the rights of deaf people, Harlan Lane had few peers."
Information about Dr. Lane's survivors and a memorial service were not immediately available.
In 1991, he received a MacArthur fellowship — the so-called “genius" grants — for his work with the deaf. Speaking with the Globe then, Dr. Lane recalled that parents who learned their children are deaf sometimes sought his advice.
The parents often were anguished by the prospect of their children becoming part of a different culture with its own language.
He said he would tell the parents that “as difficult as it is to believe right now, something wonderful has happened, and if you embrace this miracle, you and your child can have a much richer life. If on the other hand you try to deny it, to bury it, you are condemning yourself and your child to a great deal of suffering."

Texto completo: Skyscrapers, steam rising through street vents, newspaper kiosks near subway entrances, women dressed in high-fashion black−there are few cities that everyone can envision in their head without ever stepping foot there other than New York City. Now through September, guests of the Customs House Museum & Cultural Center can get a glimpse of city days gone by with the new exhibition "New York Revisited: A Photographic Essay" by Norman Lerner.
The 26 photographs feature all the glamour and character of New York City from the 1950s to the 1970s. Lerner's skill at capturing special moments of everyday life is evident in such images as "Grand Central Station Waiting Room" (1954) to a photograph titled, "Avid Reader" (1957) showing a young man sitting atop a statue at the 5th Avenue Plaza reading "Peyton Place." The exhibition was guest co-curated by Sara Lee Burd and Paul Polycarpou. Sara, who has worked with the photographer on his catalogue raisonné, writes, "Lerner's art strikes tensions between visual elements of light and dark, the context and figure, and symmetry and asymmetry. Through photography, he records authentic views of everyday life and often including surprise elements of subtle storytelling. Approaching Lerner's works with an active gaze inspires curiosity as the artist presents honest human expressions."
From the 1950s through the 1970s, Norman Lerner worked as a fashion and commercial photographer in New York City. His work was featured in hundreds of magazines including GQ, Glamour, Look, and New York Times Magazine. He maintained an active studio of some 40 to 50 employees; their primary work coming from the major magazines in the city. In the 1960s, he was founder and chair of the first fashion photography degree program in the United States at the Fashion Institute of Technology. In the 1970s through the mid-1980s, he was a coordinator of the photography studies program at California Polytechnic State University and remains connected with the university as Professor Emeritus.
"New York Revisited" will be on view through Sept. 29 at the Customs House Museum & Cultural Center, 200 S 2nd St.For more, contact Terri Jordan, Exhibits Curator, at 931-648-5780 or terri@customshousemuseum.org.

Texto completo: Tyson keeps museum post after sexual misconduct probe
NEW YORK -- Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson will keep his job as head of the Hayden Planetarium at New York's American Museum of Natural History after the museum concluded its investigation into sexual misconduct accusations against him.
A museum spokesman said in a statement Thursday that based on the results of the investigation, Tyson "remains an employee and director of the Hayden Planetarium."
The statement said museum officials would not comment further "because this is a confidential personnel matter."
Tyson was accused of behaving inappropriately with two women in an article published in November on the website Patheos.
Hathaway: 'Modern Love' role gave her more compassion
LOS ANGELES -- Anne Hathaway says playing a bipolar character in Amazon's new series "Modern Love" affected her emotionally long after she wrapped the role.
Hathaway plays Terry Cheney, a woman navigating romance with bipolar disorder, in an episode of the anthology. The series, based on The New York Times' column of the same name, debuts Oct. 18.
At a Television Critics Association meeting Saturday, Hathaway said the role gave her a heightened compassion for people with mental illnesses who can't walk away once the cameras stop rolling. She said she hopes telling stories like Cheney's will open up the conversation surrounding mental illness.
After reflecting on her role, Hathaway lightened the mood when she was asked how she feels about her newly announced second pregnancy.
"How do you think?" she replied, smiling.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – President Donald Trump would love to see Apple make iPhones in the USA and has been threatening tariffs to persuade companies like Apple to move production here.
But for a variety of reasons, mostly dealing with the skills of overseas labor at manufacturing digital devices and the lower costs, the idea of bringing the iPhone here is a "pipe dream," says Tim Bajarin, a longtime industry analyst from Creative Strategies. "It's not going to happen. "
Building an iPhone XS Max, the current top of the line $1,100 iPhone, would cost consumers more than $2,000 if it was made here. A 25% tariff, as threatened by Trump, would add $250 or so to the price of the device, which consumers would either have to pay, or Apple would eat.
Apple's main competitor, Samsung, is based in South Korea and builds the premium Galaxy phones and others in Korea, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia and China.
Google has Pixel phones made in China. Amazon's Echo speakers are made there, as are most consumer tech products.
Apple bytes: Here are five takeaways on Foxconn in Wisconsin
Bye, iPhone 6: So now what should I buy as a budget option?
Apple this week asked the government to not put tariffs on parts it needed from China to build the new high-end $6,000 Mac Pro computer, but Friday, Trump said no way.
"Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!"
Apple had announced plans to build a factory in Austin, Texas, to make high-end Mac computers here, but recently shifted gears to get them made in China. In January, the New York Times outlined the various issues Apple had in getting devices made in Texas, most notably problems getting a specific screw that was only available in large quantities in China.
"The costs of doing it here makes it impossible," says Bajarin. The main components of an iPhone – screen, power chip, RAM, solid-state drive and camera sensor – are all made in China.
"The tariff outcome is unlikely to bring wholesale suppliers to the U. S. ," says Sridhar Tayur, a professor at the Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. That said, he notes there's been a trend for companies to move out of China and look elsewhere due to higher labor costs, human rights abuses and environmental issues.
Bajarin says Vietnam has been the beneficiary, with many companies getting tax breaks to set up shop in the Asia country. Action camera maker GoPro shifted its U. S. production to Mexico in June, while still creating cameras for other countries in China.
The Foxconn Technology Group, which builds iPhones for Apple in Shenzhen, announced with great fanfare two summers ago that it would work with Trump and build a plant in Wisconsin to make TV display panels. The company said it would spend $10 billion on a new plant, and create as many as 13,000 jobs. The state offered the company a controversial $3 billion in state incentives to make the move.
But as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a member of the USA TODAY network reports, the factory has yet to be built, and it "will be significantly smaller and less costly than the type of plant specified in Foxconn’s contract with the state. "
Tayur says the experience of Foxconn in Wisconsin shows the perils of Chinese sub-contractors moving their operations to the United States. "If Foxconn cannot make it happen, I don't see how others can," he says.

Woman running South Dakota's last video rental store

Texto completo: Nancy Hiller's dream had finally come true.
It was Feburary 2007, and she'd taken out a loan to stock the shelves of Movie Mania, a video store tucked into a strip mall off of North Harrison Avenue in Pierre.
"I always wanted to work at a video store," she said. And after working at one for four years, her dream was realized with Movie Mania.
At the time there was competition – three other video stores were in town, and both Redbox and Netflix offered alternative video rental options, but Hiller had no idea what was coming.
Today, she's running the last remaining video store in South Dakota.
The same month Hiller opened Movie Mania, Netflix rolled out its first movie and TV streaming service with about 1,000 titles available. But at the time, the company seemed to doubt its potential.
"Yet even as he touts the benefits of his own service," a 2007 New York Times article reads, "Mr. Hastings does not believe that electronic distribution, be it through downloads or streaming services, is ready for prime time."
"The market is microscopic," Hastings is quoted as saying. "DVD is going to be a very big market for a very long time."
Fast forward 12 years, and Movia Mania is the state's last video store standing.
"It's a tough business," Hiller said. "It really is."
How Movie Mania was the last store standing At the start of 2019, there were still other stores in the state. But Video Plus in Dell Rapids closed in March. Mr. Movies in Rapid City announced that movie rentals had ceased earlier this month, and it will close sometime in August after selling off its stock.
Even Aberdeen's Party Central – which had been Northview Video until 2007 when the store pivoted to selling party supplies, while also continuing to keep a small stock of movies available – closed in May when the owners retired.
Hiller says she's stayed afloat due to a number of factors – a considerable one being that she's never paid herself.
It's a family business – her husband Steven works with her, and her sister volunteered for a while as well. And Hiller herself also has a job with the state.
"If this was my sole job," she said, "we wouldn't still be here."
That doesn't mean they haven't tried to change with the times. They open at noon now instead of 10 a.m. Hardly anyone rents video games anymore, so unless a new Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto comes out, Hiller doesn't buy it.
Most of all, they're selling anything and everything that people will buy: wallets, purses, hats, coffee from Rapid City.
"If we have a space to sell something, we have something in that space," Hiller said. "You try and bring what somebody else in town doesn't have."
It's the same attitude she brings to her competition with streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Redbox and the rest.
At Movie Mania, she says, she gets to recommend movies to people. She gets to help them think of that movie from the 1980s they want to show their kids. She gets to watch those same kids excitedly choose their own movie that they want to rent.
"There's something about going up and picking up a case," she said, "and being able to read about it and not standing in front of a machine."
'I don't want to let the dream die' Hiller knows it's surprising that she subscribes to the service that's draining the life from the industry she dreamed of joining.
She held off for a while, she said, but two years ago she decided she should be paying more attention to the competition. So she got a Netflix subscription.
"I don't watch a lot of stuff on there now," she said. It's not a principled decision – she just doesn't like much of what's offered.
The Netflix of 12 years ago was much different than what it is today, but Hiller said she knew pretty early that streaming was going to be a big deal.
"It was too convenient," she said. "I know how people are."
With more and more streaming services asking people for money and offering their own unique content, there's a part of Hiller that thinks the future might not be all bad.
"I think eventually when people are tired of having to pay Disney, Netflix, ABC, CBS, they're going to come looking for that one-stop place," she said. "And I hope we're still here."
But there's another part of Hiller, the part that knows that maybe her dream just came true at the worst possible time.
"If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't open it up," she said. "I didn't know streaming would be so huge. People don't like to leave their house. You don't have to get out and interact with people, which is sad."
She's a member of a Facebook group where video store owners chat, and she's seen plenty of them announce their closure.
"People miss these businesses when they're gone, they talk about it on social media," she said. "Okay, well, where were you guys before this was happening?"
All of that, combined with the knowledge that Movie Mania missed the golden years of video stores by just a bit, is heartbreaking.
"It's devastating," Hiller said. "Who wants to have a dream and have it get crushed?"
But the store's still open, and new releases keep coming in. She's got less time now, but she still watches as many as she can.
As long as people walk into Movie Mania because it's time for their kid to watch The Breakfast Club or because there's something that just isn't streaming anywhere, Hiller wants to be there.
As she talks, "Shazam!" is playing in the background. Hiller thanks a customer as they walk out the door.
"I hope they don't completely go away," she says. "I'll try everything I can to stay open because I don't want to let the dream die."

Honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug

Texto completo: You had to become an "honorary white."
That was the status South Africa used to bestow upon black performers from the United States who visited the apartheid regime. The O'Jays, Tina Turner, Ray Charles and Eartha Kitt were among those who received that designation, allowing them access to hotels and restaurants from which black Africans were barred.
It was, as you might expect, a controversial thing. Or as Eddie Levert of the O'Jays later observed, "We've been apologizing ever since."
While there is no official "honorary white" status in this country, American politics has evolved a rough analog. As lily-white conservatism has lurched deeper into a brazen racism and xenophobia reminiscent of the 1950s, black and brown people willing to use their color to give it moral cover have seen themselves eagerly embraced by those whose sins they abet.
It's not quite access to "whites only" hotels and restaurants, but it is acceptance into white spaces otherwise closed and hostile to people like you. Sometimes, it even brings a kind of petty stardom in the murky world of right-wing bloggers, social media and cable news. Racist xenophobes get to feel that they're not racist or xenophobic at all because, hey, "Diamond and Silk" agree with them.
But ultimately, the joke is always on you. In recent days, we've seen that lesson learned painfully and publicly by two men: a black Donald Trump voter named Kevin Martin and a Donald Trump friend of Puerto Rican heritage named Geraldo Rivera.
The former told CNN last week that when Trump told four congresswomen of color to "go back" to their countries, it "just came out of left field" and "hit a lot of us in the gut." The latter, while loyally insisting Trump has "been treated unfairly," conceded to The New York Times that, "As much as I have denied it and averted my eyes from it, this latest incident made it impossible."
To which, the only appropriate response is: Wow. Just ... wow.
After the housing discrimination suits, the quote about black laziness, the persecution of the Central Park Five, now it's suddenly "impossible" for Rivera to deny Trump's bigotry? After the Mexican rapists crack, the smear against a Mexican-American judge, the Muslim ban, the "very fine people on both sides," Martin thinks Trump's latest rancid spew "came out of left field?!"
One can only conclude that honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug. Side effects include cultural amnesia and inability to process reality.
It's not that people of color can't or shouldn't be conservative, as that term was once understood. But this modern iteration doesn't care about small government or muscular diplomacy. Rather, it is working to normalize racism and enshrine xenophobia, and if you're black or brown and still don't realize that, well, again, wow.
The thing is, honorary whiteness has its limitations. Consider Barry Martin, an honorary white black dancer who toured South Africa in 1983 and was in a single-car accident while there. An ambulance picked up the white driver, but left Martin in the wreckage. A black motorist happened by and took him to a white hospital where he was refused admission. Eventually, Martin wound up in the black section of another hospital.
Somewhere in all that jostling, his injured spine was severed. Martin became a quadriplegic. He never walked, much less danced, again.
Take his story as an object lesson, you honorary whites of American politics: You are not special, only useful.
You'd be wise to learn the difference.

Texto completo: With barely three weeks to go until its scheduled Aug. 16 opening day, Woodstock 50 might find a new home in Columbia.
Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said during a news conference early Thursday night that the county government is "in talks with the promoter [of the music festival] and Merriweather [Post Pavilion]" to host the anniversary event at the famed amphitheater this summer.
The facility has a history of hosting multi-act concerts such as Capital Jazz Fest and Virgin Festival, Ball said.
"This is a place where we're known for our music festivals," he said. "We're a place that celebrates arts and culture."
Ball also referenced the history of the festival, which originally took place in 1969 against the backdrop of the hippie movement and flourishing counterculture. It turned musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone - both of whom played there - into international stars.
Despite its own problems, including muddy festival grounds and two deaths, Woodstock remains a strong symbol of that generation and introduced many of its performers, including 2019 returnee Carlos Santana, to a bigger audience. It is the third major anniversary festival, after editions in 1994 and 1999 - the latter of which devolved into chaotic violence and property damage.
News of the move, which Bloomberg Businessweek first reported Thursday, came nearly 7½ months after Michael Lang, who co-founded the original Woodstock festival in 1969, first announced the 50th anniversary event. Since then, Lang and his collaborators encountered numerous hurdles, including departures of key production and finance partners, while unsuccessfully trying to secure a site near the original location in upstate New York. To this day, the Woodstock 50 website does not allow people to purchase tickets.
Festival producers additionally confirmed to The New York Times on Thursday that Woodstock 50 officially moved to Merriweather Post Pavilion. The venue has yet to list the festival on its website and instead lists a Smashing Pumpkins concert Aug. 17.
Scott Peterson, a spokesperson for Ball, deferred comment on the particulars of the concert, including whether the move would affect artists' contracts to perform, to festival authorities and the venue. Neither concert organizers nor representatives for Merriweather Post Pavilion or booked artists The Killers and Soccer Mommy returned requests for comment from The Sun. Other booked acts include Jay-Z, Chance the Rapper, Miley Cyrus and Halsey.
Woodstock 50 coincides with a separate commemoration of the 50th anniversary in Bethel, N.Y., where the original festival took place. Baltimore-based artist Dr. Bob Hieronimous, who painted the iconic Light VW Bus, will recreate his iconic journey from Baltimore to Bethel this summer. Those who can't make it to Columbia or Bethel can visit the American Visionary Art Museum on Aug. 12 for a kickoff event with the original bus. The celebration in New York state takes place Aug. 16
Ball noted that Woodstock 50, if it does happen at Merriweather Post Pavilion, will take place at some point in mid-August.

Fall Jazz Fest headliners named; Mayor Melvin Carter at T2P2

Texto completo: While the Twin Cities Jazz Festival is a sure thing – we can count on it happening in July in St. Paul, centered on Mears Park – the Winter Jazz Festival has been a moving target. It’s been on, off, at the old Dakota in Bandana Square, the Millennium Hotel in Minneapolis, the Doubletree, a heated tent in downtown St. Paul (in January!), at MacPhail, the St. Paul Hotel, and Crooners in Fridley.
Now, it seems, the Winter Jazz Fest is the Fall Jazz Fest, and it’s back at Crooners. Which could be the best place for it. Crooners has two indoor stages, lots of free parking, a full bar and a restaurant kitchen. You can easily spend the day there.
Fall Jazz Fest, which takes place on Sunday, Oct. 20, from 1 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., has two strong headliners. Ann Hampton Callaway is a Tony-nominated star of Broadway, concert halls, theaters and jazz clubs. A singer, pianist, composer, lyricist, arranger, and actress, she has made 17 albums of her own and written countless songs with and for other artists including Barbra Streisand. She’s a charming and witty performer and improviser. Callaway usually performs here at Orchestra Hall or the Dakota. She’s a big score for Fall Jazz Fest.
Kenny Werner is one of the finest pianists of our time. He backs singers and other musicians, fronts trios and plays in big bands. But he’s finest (we think) as a solo artist, and he’ll shine on Crooners’ Steinway. We haven’t seen him here since he performed with the Chamber Music Society of Minnesota in 2017; he and CMSM’s founding artistic director Young-Nam Kim are old friends. Werner has made more than 40 albums. His latest, “The Space,” is a solo piano recording that came out in December. If he wants to play Fall Jazz Fest with a trio, that will be lovely, but we hope he makes it a solo date.
Unlike summer’s Jazz Fest, fall isn’t free. But proceeds help to keep summer free. General admission is $40, VIP (includes buffet) $100. Tickets are on sale now.
More plan-aheads
On Friday, Sept. 6, the AACM’s Great Black Music Ensemble will perform at the Cedar. Co-presented with the American Composers Forum (ACF) and the Schubert Club, this is one of the most important events happening this fall. (Technically late summer, but post-State Fair, so fall.) Made up of musicians from Chicago’s legendary and highly influential Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, this is a must for fans of creative, experimental music and improvisation. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($15/20).
The Great Black Music Ensemble concert is the kick-off event to the ACF’s 2019 Racial Equity and Inclusion Forum: Musical Creators Leading Change , which takes place Saturday, Sept. 7, at TPT from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. This will be a convening of artists, administrators, and advocates to discuss racially inclusive and equitable opportunities for creative musicians. It’s free and open to the public, but RSVPs are strongly encouraged. FMI.
Tuesday, Sept. 10, is the pub date for Margaret Atwood’s “The Testaments,” the sequel to “The Handmaid’s Tale.” On that night, “Margaret Atwood: Live in Cinemas” will be broadcast to more than 1,000 theaters across the globe, including several in the Twin Cities. Filmed live from the National Theatre in London, BBC journalist and New York Times best-selling author Samira Ahmed will interview Atwood about her career, her work and why she has returned to “The Handmaid’s Tale” 34 years after its publication. The event will include readings and special guests. 7 p.m. Find a theater and buy tickets here. Watch the trailer. P.S. Atwood was recently longlisted for the 2019 Booker Prize.
On Thursday, Sept. 19, the Ramsey Hill Association will hold its biennial Ramsey Hill House Tour . More than 18 homes and public spaces in the historic St. Paul neighborhood will be open from 3-8 p.m. This tour’s theme is “Contemporary Living in the Homes of Saint Paul’s Gilded Past.” The featured homes were built between 1888 and 1905 and include Queen Annes, neo-Colonials, Victorian painted ladies and examples of the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. A trolley will run between house stops. If you’ve ever wanted to see inside 389 Portland Ave., 443 Holly Ave. or Holly Row (all three row houses), here’s your chance. FMI and tickets ($30 advance, $35 day of tour). Addendum: Catch this terrific new TPT documentary, “St. Paul’s Historic Hill: Salvaging a Gilded Past.”
The picks
Now at Artistry: “Footloose.” Summer fun with music and dancing, this is the musical based on the hit film starring Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormack, a teen from Chicago who moves to a small Utah town where dancing is banned. You know how it ends, but it’s such fun to see and hear. Bacon had a dance double in the movie; newcomer Ethan Davenport doesn’t on Artistry’s stage. Both Angela Steele and Paul R. Coate were in last year’s “Legally Blonde.” They return as Ren’s love interest, Ariel Moore, and her disapproving dad, Rev. Shaw Moore. Benjamin Governor is director, Anita Ruth is music director and Heidi Spesard-Noble is choreographer. 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays. FMI and tickets ($17-46). Closes Aug. 18.
Opens tonight (Friday, July 26) at the Uptown Theatre: “Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love.” Nick Broomfield’s documentary tells the story of Leonard Cohen and his Norwegian muse, Marianne Ihlen, who inspired some of his best-known songs. FMI including trailer, times and tickets.
Tonight through Sunday at Century College in White Bear Lake: Shakespeare & Company 44th Season. Bring a picnic, bring a blanket, bring the kids and let them play on the grass. Founded in 1976 by George Franklin Wade, this classic repertory theater spends summers at the outdoor theater complex of Century College’s west campus. Tonight at 7 p.m.: “The Two Gentlemen of Verona.” Saturday at 7 p.m.: “The Merry Wives of Windsor.” Sunday at 6 p.m.: “Coriolanus.” FMI. Tickets at the box office on the day of the performance ($20 adults/$15 seniors and students, children under 10 free with adult). Cash and checks only. Next weekend (Aug. 2-4) is the final weekend of the season.
Saturday at Franconia Sculpture Park: Music@Franconia. Something else to bring the kids to, and the dog. Franconia is 43 acres of grounds, paths and monumental sculptures, open from dawn to dusk 365 days a year. Saturday’s concert at the Earthen Amphitheatre will feature the Scottie Miller Band. During band breaks, you can take a guided tour and meet artists-in-residence. Music at 6 p.m. Food trucks. The concert is free; you’ll pay $5 to park. In the St. Croix River Valley. FMI.
Tuesday at the Amsterdam: The Theater of Public Policy: Mayor Melvin Carter Returns. His honor will endure another genial but pointed public grilling from the improv wizards of T2P2, who promise to ask him about St. Paul’s new comprehensive plan, early childhood education, how the issues he campaigned on are turning out, and trash collection, the never-ending St. Paul story. Doors at 5:30 p.m., show at 6. FMI and tickets ($12 advance, $15 door).

Democrats miscalculated Mueller hearing

Texto completo: When it comes to tamping down excitement, Robert Mueller is a genius. He soldiered on through two much-anticipated House committee hearings, full of politicians eager to make a splash. The result was ... muted.
OK, actually kind of boring. Not, of course, anything like the scene Donald Trump described later, in which it sounded as if Mueller fell weeping to the floor, admitting his whole investigation was a pile of lies.
"The administration, our president, me, we've done a great job," Trump boasted as only he could. The probe into Russian interference in the election and his own attempts at obstruction of justice, he claimed, had "totally folded."
"Robert Mueller had no material," Trump said of the former special counsel, who authored a 448-page report on presidential misdeeds.
In the real world, Mueller didn't say anything unexpected when he was called before two different committees on the same day. He testified once again about Russia's assault on American democracy and said very clearly that the president was not exonerated on any count.
However, the man is just not good at drama. Think of him as Robert "I'd Refer You to the Report for That" Mueller.
The hearing was a miscalculation on the part of the Democrats, who were a little frustrated that Mueller's report, although damning for Trump, did not have the kind of juicy language that makes for memorable headlines. His big quote, after all, was: "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so."
Plus, how many Americans were going to read 448 pages? One clue came when the FBI director admitted he'd just kind of skimmed. A CNN poll found 3% of the country had read the whole thing.
And even at that, how many of that 3% do you think were fibbing?
A) A lot
B) 2.9%
C) Everybody but vicious political science professors who assigned it as a term paper.
To get the story out, some House Democrats decided to bring Mueller himself before the cameras. Once Americans heard the report's conclusions in his own words, how could they not get ready to impeach? The most riveting bits would be all over Twitter and Facebook and the evening news. What could go wrong?
Zzzzzzzz.
The result was the political equivalent of a movie that makes you want to avoid reading the book. Either through all-purpose weariness or determination not to be pushed, Mueller was pretty consistently ... unexciting.
"We decided we would not make a determination as to whether the president committed a crime," he said, um, determinedly.
The Trump forces seemed to feel the day was a big triumph for their side, which was true only if you'd be encouraged by the news that the world doesn't think you're any more wretched today than it did yesterday.
Even the 97% of Americans who don't claim to have read the report know that the Russians interfered with the 2016 election, and Trump did everything but jump up and lead a cheer with pompoms when WikiLeaks dumped a ton of hacked Clinton emails on the nation.
The president's defense was somewhere between outrageous and pathetic. He refused to talk with Mueller, even though - as Rep. Eric Swalwell noted - during the time he was rejecting those invitations, he met with Vladimir Putin six times.
The Russian connection more than disturbed Mueller, even though he tried to avoid saying anything news-making about it. The closest he came was when someone mentioned Trump's WikiLeaks euphoria. "Problematic is an understatement," he said, in what was the equivalent of a howl of fury.
Mueller had warned that he wasn't going to say anything that wasn't in the report, and you can't claim the man didn't try to keep his word.
"I can't speak to that."
"I defer to you on that. I can't get into the details."
"I am not going to answer that question, sir."
"If that's what was written in the report, yes."
"I can't go into it."
Congressional hearings can be worthy and boring at the same time. Honestly, if you want to complain about something, there are lots of better targets. Tax cuts for the wealthy. Overpopulated Democratic debates. Bicyclists who ride on the sidewalk. "The Secret Life of Pets 2."
And even if Mueller had been way, way more forthcoming, it's unlikely it would have given the impeachment crowd much help. The nation is so divided on the subject of Trump that it's almost impossible to imagine anything would get him kicked out of office.
If he got caught standing with a knife and a pile of murdered puppies, he'd claim that he had actually protected innocent children from a pack of small fuzzy sharks. And around a third of the country would shrug, while Senate Republicans muttered something about danger at the beaches.
Looks like the Democrats are just going to have to run a strong presidential campaign about how to make the country better. If they do that, Trump will not be in the White House in 2021. At which time, we can let the collusion and conspiracy indictments roll.

Trafford Realty in Cocoa closes office after 102 years

Texto completo: A Cocoa real estate office has closed its doors after 102 years of business.
Trafford Realty, previously located at 305 Brevard Ave. in Cocoa Village, closed July 1. The business was the oldest continuously operating retail office in Florida, said Margot Trafford Hester, former realtor and daughter of Chairman Al Trafford.
The closure of Trafford Realty followed the death of both company President Terry Lolmaugh and Vice President Roy Berry this spring.
The company attributed its decades of success to its company philosophy, Lolmaugh said in a 2017 FLORIDA TODAY interview. The company sought to always do the right thing, even when no one was looking, he said.
During its lifetime, the office saw Brevard County endure many changes. The end of NASA's Apollo program cost the county 700 jobs and landed it in an economic slump. The New York Times ran a story in 1970 about the downturn and featured a picture in which Trafford Realty's sign was visible, prompting calls from across the country.
Another hard time came after the explosion of space shuttle Challenger sent the shuttle program into a three-year hiatus. The explosion put plans on hold by many sellers or buyers who didn't know what to expect next.
An upturn followed, though. That was the reality of the real estate business, said Lolmaugh in 2017. It came with peaks and valleys, and the company weathered them all for 102 years.
The company was named for A.R. Trafford, who founded the company in 1917. His son, Al Trafford, started his career in 1938 and took over the company from his father.

Texto completo: It doesn't take much to reenact a scene from a Charles Dickens novel in Pennsylvania. As the national economy continues humming along with the efficiency of the Industrial Revolution, half of the kids in this state qualify for free school lunch.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times," you're tempted to say, echoing the opening line from "A Tale of Two Cities," a novel that acknowledged the social ills visited upon the poor even as the rich got richer in London and Paris.
But this is Pennsylvania. Our literary and social realities bend more toward the "Oliver Twist" end of Dickens' magnificent oeuvre. Recently, the Wyoming Valley West School District in northeastern Pennsylvania sent letters to the parents of students worthy of villainy straight out of Dickens' novel:
"Your child has been sent to school every day without money and without a breakfast and/or lunch. This is a failure to provide your child with proper nutrition, and you can be sent to Dependency Court for neglecting your child's right to food," wrote Joseph Muth, school district director of federal programs, with the finesse of a Victorian-era villain rubbing his hands in delight.
"If you are taken to Dependency Court, the result may be your child being removed from your home and placed in foster care. Please remit payment as soon as possible to avoid being reported to the proper authorities."
Because the district is in Luzerne County, the threat was not taken lightly. Those who remember the infamous "Kids for Cash" scandal that sent former Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas judges Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan to prison for filling for-profit juvenile detention centers with kids in exchange for kickbacks know that our state has more than its fair share of heartless officials and bureaucrats itching to do the unthinkable.
Within hours of sending out the notices, the school district was the focus of national outrage - and deservedly so. Various good Samaritans stepped forward to pay the $22,467 debt so that parents of children targeted by the letters wouldn't have to live in fear of a child being scooped up by social services at school someday.
Until a few days ago, the school district adamantly refused to accept payment from a third party. "It's a fundamental obligation of parents to house, feed, and clothe their children," a school board member told The Philadelphia Inquirer. "It's not our obligation. This nanny-state mentality is troubling to me."
There's a scene from "Oliver Twist" that comes to mind when encountering a quote like this: "Please, Sir. I want some more." That's the point in the novel where the hungry orphan, with upturned bowl and expectant eyes, asks for more gruel. But the cook and all the officials at the workhouse considered withholding food an indispensable part of character development for the orphan wretches.
Todd Carmichael, the CEO and co-founder of La Colombe coffee, a Philly-based company, had been rebuffed several times after offering to erase the lunch debt in its entirety. Mr. Carmichael is a well-known liberal activist in Philly, so there may have been a reluctance on the part of the school district to take his money because of the optics.
Mr. Carmichael, who received free lunches himself as a child, complained to the media about not being allowed to pay the outstanding bill. The onslaught of national and local bad press, including a fiery editorial denunciation by The Philadelphia Inquirer, caused the Wyoming Valley West School District to abruptly reverse itself in a letter to district residents:
"The Wyoming Valley West School District Board of Directors sincerely apologizes for the tone of the letter that was sent regarding lunch debt. It wasn't the intention of the district to harm or inconvenience any of the families of our school district. We want to thank everyone for their concern and generous donation offers to help pay for the unpaid lunch bills.
"We would like to acknowledge Mr. Todd Carmichael's generous offer. We have been in touch with . the Wyoming Valley West Educational Foundation (previously established to benefit the students of our district). After discussions with [it] and all members of the Wyoming Valley West School Board, we have decided to accept Mr. Carmichael's generous donation. It will be directed to the Wyoming Valley West Educational Foundation to eliminate the debt owed by the parents."
Not content to leave it there, the school district slipped in one more self-justifying attempt to mitigate its initial cruelty:
"Wyoming Valley West School District followed all USDA and PDE regulations. All meals served to students were chosen by the students from our regular menu. No shaming occurred and no alternate meals were provided. Again, please accept our sincere apology for any harm or inconvenience the letter caused."
Congratulating itself for not serving literal gruel to the kids whose parents weren't current with their lunch bill is consistent with the cluelessness the school board has exhibited since sending out its original letter.
Because no one has quit or been fired (yet), the appalling lapse in empathy towards the estimated 64% of students in the district who live below the poverty line could happen again. We live in a peculiar age where cruelty is now sanctioned at the very top of the political food chain. It only backs down when it can be sufficiently shamed. But what do we do about those who are both cruel and beyond shame?

Woodstock 50 working with Howard County; Event could be coming to Merriweather Post Pavilion

Texto completo: With barely three weeks to go until its scheduled Aug. 16 opening day, Woodstock 50 might find a new home in Columbia.
Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said during a news conference early Thursday night that the county government is "in talks with the promoter [of the music festival] and Merriweather [Post Pavilion]" to host the anniversary event at the famed amphitheater this summer.
The facility has a history of hosting multi-act concerts such as Capital Jazz Fest and Virgin Festival, Ball said.
"This is a place where we're known for our music festivals," he said. "We're a place that celebrates arts and culture."
Ball also referenced the history of the festival, which originally took place in 1969 against the backdrop of the hippie movement and flourishing counterculture. It turned musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone - both of whom played there - into international stars.
Despite its own problems, including muddy festival grounds and two deaths, Woodstock remains a strong symbol of that generation and introduced many of its performers, including 2019 returnee Carlos Santana, to a bigger audience. It is the third major anniversary festival, after editions in 1994 and 1999 - the latter of which devolved into chaotic violence and property damage.
News of the move, which Bloomberg Businessweek first reported Thursday, came nearly 7½ months after Michael Lang, who co-founded the original Woodstock festival in 1969, first announced the 50th anniversary event. Since then, Lang and his collaborators encountered numerous hurdles, including departures of key production and finance partners, while unsuccessfully trying to secure a site near the original location in upstate New York. To this day, the Woodstock 50 website does not allow people to purchase tickets.
Festival producers additionally confirmed to The New York Times on Thursday that Woodstock 50 officially moved to Merriweather Post Pavilion. The venue has yet to list the festival on its website and instead lists a Smashing Pumpkins concert Aug. 17.
Scott Peterson, a spokesperson for Ball, deferred comment on the particulars of the concert, including whether the move would affect artists' contracts to perform, to festival authorities and the venue. Neither concert organizers nor representatives for Merriweather Post Pavilion or booked artists The Killers and Soccer Mommy returned requests for comment from The Sun. Other booked acts include Jay-Z, Chance the Rapper, Miley Cyrus and Halsey.
Woodstock 50 coincides with a separate commemoration of the 50th anniversary in Bethel, N.Y., where the original festival took place. Baltimore-based artist Dr. Bob Hieronimous, who painted the iconic Light VW Bus, will recreate his iconic journey from Baltimore to Bethel this summer. Those who can't make it to Columbia or Bethel can visit the American Visionary Art Museum on Aug. 12 for a kickoff event with the original bus. The celebration in New York state takes place Aug. 16
Ball noted that Woodstock 50, if it does happen at Merriweather Post Pavilion, will take place at some point in mid-August.

Honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug

Texto completo: You had to become an “honorary white.”
That was the status South Africa used to bestow upon black performers from the United States who visited the apartheid regime. The O’Jays, Tina Turner, Ray Charles and Eartha Kitt were among those who received that designation, allowing them access to hotels and restaurants from which black Africans were barred.
It was, as you might expect, a controversial thing. Or as Eddie Levert of the O’Jays later observed, “We’ve been apologizing ever since.”
While there is no official “honorary white” status in this country, American politics has evolved a rough analog. As lily-white conservatism has lurched deeper into a brazen racism and xenophobia reminiscent of the 1950s, black and brown people willing to use their color to give it moral cover have seen themselves eagerly embraced by those whose sins they abet.
It’s not quite access to “whites only” hotels and restaurants, but it is acceptance into white spaces otherwise closed and hostile to people like you. Sometimes, it even brings a kind of petty stardom in the murky world of right-wing bloggers, social media and cable news. Racist xenophobes get to feel that they’re not racist or xenophobic at all because, hey, “Diamond and Silk” agree with them.
But ultimately, the joke is always on you. In recent days, we’ve seen that lesson learned painfully and publicly by two men: a black Donald Trump voter named Kevin Martin and a Donald Trump friend of Puerto Rican heritage named Geraldo Rivera.
The former told CNN last week that when Trump told four congresswomen of color to “go back” to their countries, it “just came out of left field” and “hit a lot of us in the gut.” The latter, while loyally insisting Trump has “been treated unfairly,” conceded to The New York Times that, “As much as I have denied it and averted my eyes from it, this latest incident made it impossible.”
To which, the only appropriate response is: Wow. Just ... wow.
After the housing discrimination suits, the quote about black laziness, the persecution of the Central Park Five, now it’s suddenly “impossible” for Rivera to deny Trump’s bigotry? After the Mexican rapists crack, the smear against a Mexican-American judge, the Muslim ban, the “very fine people on both sides,” Martin thinks Trump’s latest rancid spew “came out of left field?!”
One can only conclude that honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug. Side effects include cultural amnesia and inability to process reality.
It’s not that people of color can’t or shouldn’t be conservative, as that term was once understood. But this modern iteration doesn’t care about small government or muscular diplomacy. Rather, it is working to normalize racism and enshrine xenophobia, and if you’re black or brown and still don’t realize that, well, again, wow.
The thing is, honorary whiteness has its limitations. Consider Barry Martin, an honorary white black dancer who toured South Africa in 1983 and was in a single-car accident while there. An ambulance picked up the white driver, but left Martin in the wreckage. A black motorist happened by and took him to a white hospital, where he was refused admission. Eventually, Martin wound up in the black section of another hospital.
Somewhere in all that jostling, his injured spine was severed. Martin became a quadriplegic. He never walked, much less danced, again.
Take his story as an object lesson, you honorary whites of American politics: You are not special, only useful.
You’d be wise to learn the difference.

Texto completo: What's on TV
MY GIRL (1991) 8 p.m. on Showtime 2. A young Anna Chlumsky and Macaulay Culkin play best friends in this coming-of-age comedy-drama that takes place over a summer. For Vada (Chlumsky), the summer is jam-packed with many of the markers of a girl growing up and coming into her own: puberty, developing crushes and adjusting to her father's dating a new woman. Though death is a consistent theme in Vada's life -- her father is a mortician and her mother has died -- she will be devastated by an unexpected loss. In an otherwise negative review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin praised the leads, calling Chlumsky a "poised, lovely young actress." Culkin, she added, is "a remarkably funny Everykid."
COACH CARTER (2005) 7 p.m. on VH1. Ken Carter (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is a tough-as-nails basketball coach at an inner-city high school in Richmond, Calif., in this drama based on a true story. Coach Carter's strategy to improve his team's grades -- locking the gym and benching the players -- does not go over well with students, parents, staff members or the larger community. Soon enough, though, the approach that made him unpopular, would transform him into a beloved role model.
NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION (1989) 8 p.m. on CMT. Celebrate Christmas in July by watching Chevy Chase hurt himself over and over (and over) again in this film that centers on the Griswolds, who are celebrating the holiday with their dysfunctional family. The look of the film was described by Janet Maslin in her 1989 review as "tacky, what with flimsy props and occasionally blurry cinematography." She added that "the direction by Jeremiah S. Chechik displays comic timing that is uncertain at best." "In spite of all this, however," she wrote, "the Griswolds do occasionally have their moments." So if a sizable helping of 1980s tackiness is what you're after, consider this cult favorite.
UP IN SMOKE (1978) 9 p.m. on AXS TV. No list of stoner comedies is complete without this movie starring the comics and counterculture personalities Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. In an article in The Times about marijuana-themed films, Linda Lee described Cheech and Chong in "Up in Smoke" as "characters who eluded the police while smoking joints the size of small logs," which about sums it up.
What's Streaming
WORKIN' MOMS Stream on Netflix. The second season of this Canadian import debuts in the United States on Netflix. The comedy series starring Catherine Reitman (who is also the show's creator, writer and executive producer) delves into the lives of four working mothers juggling family and career in present-day Toronto. From breast-pump mishaps at the workplace to defining what makes a good mother, the show addresses serious maternal anxieties without taking itself too seriously. The mommy-and-me class where the women convene serves as a quasi-therapy session with punch lines and existential questions in equal measure.

Which Disneyland attraction has the most riders since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened? You’ll be surprised

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .
The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.
You read that right: The half century-old Small World has had way more riders than the 2-month-old Smugglers Run.
But of course, Small World and Pirates are high-capacity people-eater rides that vacuum up visitors and often still manage to maintain relatively short wait times.
Disneyland officials said Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has performed extremely well with very little downtime during the million-rider run thanks to the hard work and dedication of cast members and Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative arm of the company.
“Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is among our highest rated attractions and we are thrilled by the guest reviews we have received since opening,” Disneyland officials said in a statement.

Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge officially debuted on May 31 after a series of employee and media previews. Disneyland instituted a reservation-only period for Galaxy’s Edge that ran through June 23. Beginning June 24, the new Star Wars land was opened to all visitors. A virtual queue boarding pass system put in place to manage crowds has been rarely used.
While the million-rider mark sounds impressive, other Disneyland attractions likely outpaced Smugglers Run during the same period.
During Smugglers million-rider run, Small World and Pirates could have hit the same mark operating at approximately 45% of their hourly capacity while Big Thunder could have done it at 70% capacity and Hyperspace Mountain at 80%, according to Touring Plans.
Smuggler’s Run can accommodate up to 1,800 riders per hour, according to the New York Times.
The average wait time for Smugglers Run dropped from 47 minutes on opening day to 22 minutes on June 23, according to Touring Plans data. The average Smugglers Run wait time spiked to 59 minutes on June 24 — the first day guests could enter the land without a reservation — and reached a high of 89 minutes over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Using Smugglers Run ridership as a guide, Touring Plans estimates that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has attracted between 2.7 million and 5 million visitors since opening day.
“My strong suspicion is that the number is toward the bottom end of that range based on the low wait times we saw throughout June,” said Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, an online subscription service that lets users create custom theme park itineraries.
Disneyland rarely if ever talks about attendance numbers or ridership figures.
Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is the lone anchor attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge until the Rise of the Resistance dark ride debuts on Jan. 17, six months behind schedule.
To the surprise of many theme park observers, Disneyland has experienced lighter than usual summertime traffic since Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31.

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .
The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former money manager Bernie Madoff, who was convicted of masterminding the largest Ponzi scheme in history, is seeking to have his 150-year sentence reduced by President Donald Trump.
Madoff has filed a petition for clemency with the Justice Department, according to the agency's website. It is unclear from the limited information available on the website when the petition was filed. It has a "pending" status.
In 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts of financial crimes, including fraud, money laundering, perjury and theft, according to the New York Times. He has been serving his sentence at a federal prison in Butner, North Carolina.
Throughout his tenure in office, Trump has rarely pardoned or granted clemency to those who applied through the Justice Department's established process via the department's Office of the Pardon Attorney.

What we learned from Mueller: Seven hours, zero bombshells and everyone declares victory
Last year, he denied requests from 180 people who had applied for pardons and commutations through the Justice Department.
However, Trump has pardoned political allies who have not applied formally, such as Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio. He has also granted clemency to people who have been recommended by celebrities. It is unclear whether or when the president will take up Madoff's petition.
Trump in a 2008 CNN interview called Madoff a “sleazebag," “a total crook," and a "disgrace. "
In his 2009 book, "Think Like a Champion," Trump also criticized Madoff.
"He is without a doubt a sleazebag and a scoundrel without par," he said.

This is how much you should tip your Uber Eats, Door Dash or GrubHub delivery driver

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — At the end of a long day, cooking a meal might be the last thing you want to do. So you open one of the food delivery apps on your phone (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub, to name a few) to find something you’re hankering for.
The problem is by the time you actually hit order, you might be paying twice the price of your meal in delivery fees and decide that instead of paying even more money, your delivery driver is going to have to deal without a tip.
A study from US Foods shows 66% of food delivery app customers base their tip on how much the delivery and service cost them. The good news is that 95% of customers still tip regularly, but 60% of drivers say no tip or a small one is their No. 1 complaint.
“It’s already expensive, but that’s not the fault of your delivery driver, who is getting in their car, working for wages of their own and delivering you the food,” said etiquette expert Diane Gottsman.
So, how much should I tip my delivery driver?
That depends on who you ask, but, generally, both customers and drivers agree that $4 is a fair tip, according to the study. However, that might be low depending on the amount of food you order.
National Drive-Thru Day: Here's how to get deals and freebies year-round
Gottsman suggests tipping at least 20% of the total cost of the meal, or at least $5.
“They are working for gratuity as well,” said Gottsman. “That is part of their livelihood, and I think we should tip politely and appropriately,”
There are other things you should consider when you tip:
Tip in cash: Some food delivery apps use tip money as a way to avoid paying the driver their full payments, as The New York Times recently found with DoorDash. So if a driver is owed a $5 and you tip $2, the app pays them $3 instead of adding the tip as extra. DoorDash changed their tipping model since the article’s publication, but the easiest way to ensure the driver gets the full tip you are paying is to give them in cash.
Do your research: Some delivery services don’t actually require you to tip or have a guide on how to tip their drivers. Look at their website and see what their expectations are.
Consider the circumstances: Think about things like how far does my driver have to drive? How far do they have to park? How many flights of stairs do they have to climb? What’s the weather outside? And factor that into your tip, especially if it’s extraneous.
Tip for future service: If you plan on using one specific app or service for a long time, let them know you’re a good customer and tip them fairly. You’ll probably get better service.
Wine and dine: Kellogg's is selling Cheez-Its crackers with a box of wine for $25
Hey, drivers, you can do things to make sure you get that tip money, as 50% of customers decide on their tip on a case-by-case experience. Customers complain about drivers staying in their car or dropping off the food at the door and leaving. And whatever you do, do not take food from the order – customers really don’t like that, as 85% say restaurants should tampering labels on their delivery orders to ensure no one messes with their order.
And customers, consider giving your driver a bonus if you like them by writing them a good review either on the app or through other rating services. It will go a long way for them.

Facebook fined $5 billion by FTC, must update and adopt new privacy, security measures

Resumen: The Federal Trade Commission says Facebook will be a safer social network due to the agency's $5 billion settlement over privacy violations.

Texto completo: Facebook must adopt new protections for data users share on the social network and pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.
The social networking giant must expand its privacy protections across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and adopt a corporate system of checks and balances to remain compliant, according to the FTC order.
Facebook must also maintain a data security program, which includes protections of information such as users' phone numbers.
The FTC's order also curbs CEO Mark Zuckerberg's oversight in privacy and security matters, with the requirement Facebook create a new privacy committee with independent board members who cannot be removed without a two-thirds shareholder vote. Zuckerberg and designated compliance officers each must submit individual quarterly compliance reports to the FTC.
Big tech: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter likely facing review from Justice Department
Additionally, a third-party assessor will monitor Facebook's privacy-related decisions going forward.
The commission approved the settlement with a 3-2 vote, with the dissenting commissioners wanting tougher action taken against Zuckerberg.
But the order achieves more than the FTC could have achieved by going to court, says chairman Joe Simons and the commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine Wilson, who approved the settlement in their lengthy statement.
"The Order significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg’s power – something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished," the statement says. "The provisions of this Order extinguish the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg to make privacy decisions unilaterally by also vesting responsibility and accountability for those decisions within business units, DCOs (digital compliance officers), and the privacy committee. "
Previously, the FTC’s highest fines were to Google, which paid $22. 5 million in 2012 and Upromise, which paid $500,000 in 2017.
Facebook agreed to the settlement with the agency over allegations it broke a previous agreement over privacy protections. "In reaching the settlement, Facebook has agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty, which is one of the largest in history. But even more important, Facebook will make some major changes to how it builds products and operates as a company," the company said in a statement.
This settlement concludes a year-long FTC investigation, prompted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook suspended the data analysis and political consulting firm in March 2018 for improper access to user data. That move came after The New York Times and The Observer said Cambridge Analytica had access to 50 million profiles and used them to target ads during the 2016 presidential election campaign. At the time, Facebook said it knew the firm had violated its policies by obtaining and secretly passing on the data, which users had agreed to share with a personality prediction app.
The FTC also announced separate settlements with Cambridge Analytica, its former CEO Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. The actions allege Cambridge "used false and deceptive tactics to harvest personal information from millions of Facebook users" and all face restrictions on future business.

Texto completo: RICHMOND, Ind. – Earlham College has been recognized as one of the nation's "Best Buys" by an author.
The 2020 edition of the Fiske Guide to Colleges features Earlham as a "Best Buy" along with 10 public and 10 private colleges and universities. Purdue University was the only other Indiana school on the list. Other schools on the list included Vanderbilt University, Texas A&M University and the University of Iowa.
The guide categorizes schools as "Best Buys" for "outstanding educational value as determined by academic quality in relation to the net cost of attendance." Edward Fiske, a former education editor at the New York Times, is the author of the annual guide.
"I am thrilled that Fiske has once again recognized the wonderful value-added of an Earlham education," Earlham president Anne Houtman said in a press release. "Our students graduate with an impressive toolkit of change-the-world knowledge, skills and values."
This is just the latest resource that recognizes Earlham's qualities. The Princeton Review ranked Earlham 7th nationally in classroom experience and the U.S. News and World Report ranked the school 14th in value in 2018.
Every student at Earlham is eligible to receive up to $5,000 to participate in an internship, project or mentored research experience before graduation.
Earlham has produced Nobel laureates, Rhodes Scholars and winners of the Pulitzer Prize, Guggenheim Fellowship and the Golden Globe Award. The college is also in the nation's top two percent for the percentage of students who earn a Ph.D.

Texto completo: In a historic vote, the U.S. House of Representatives rebuked President Donald Trump by condemning as racist his statements attacking four congresswomen of color.
Mark Meadows, who represents Madison and 13 other Western North Carolina counties, voted against the July 16 condemnation.
"He's not racist," said Meadows said July 15, according to the New York Times. "I probably talk to him more than anyone else, and I can tell you he is certainly not a racist."
In response to a July 17 query by the Citizen Times, Meadows did not address whether he thought the controversial tweets and statements were racist.
Rep. Patrick McHenry, who also represents Western North Carolina, didn't respond to a request for comment. Meadows, the leader of the Freedom Caucus, and McHenry have districts that cover parts of Asheville.
In a tweet on July 14, Trump wrote of representatives Ilhan Omar, Ayanna S. Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came". Only Omar was born outside the U.S. After backlash from many who viewed his "go back" suggestion as racist, the president doubled down on his words, tweeting two days later, "if you hate our Country, or if you are not happy here, you can leave!"
Two days after the president's original tweet, the House voted on a resolution to condemn Trump's words as "racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color."
The resolution passed July 16 in a heated, largely party line vote, 240-187. Four Republicans and one independent voted for the resolution.
In 2012, Meadows made similar comments about then-President Barack Obama at an event in Hendersonville.
"We will send him back home to Kenya or wherever it is," Meadows said of Obama. "We will send him back home, and in doing that I believe what we will find is that we will get a new commander in chief who will hopefully honor the Constitution, respect our military and stop cutting it."
When videos of these comments resurfaced earlier this year, Meadows faced allegations of racism.
Critics painted Meadows' remarks as an endorsement of "birtherism" – a term for the baseless belief that Obama was not born in the U.S. Many believe the effort to deny the citizenship of the first African-American president without evidence was rooted in racism.
In a 2012 interview with Roll Call shortly after he made the remarks, Meadows said it was "probably a poor choice of words on my part more than anything else."
"I believe he's an American citizen," Meadows clarified at the time.
The House debate over the resolution devolved into partisan feuding.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the floor to call Trump's comments "disgraceful, disgusting ... and racist." Representative Doug Collins, R-Georgia, jumped up to object to Pelosi's use of the word "racist" as a violation of House rules.
After minutes spent squabbling over Pelosi's words, the lawmaker presiding over the debate — Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Missouri, — rose from his chair and stormed out of the room.
"We just want to fight," Cleaver admonished, dropping his gavel. "I abandon the chair."
After the resolution passed, Meadows tweeted out a rebuke of the debate.
"House Democrats do nothing on the border for seven months, but are going to spend the entirety of today fighting for Speaker Pelosi's ability to break House rules and call the President a racist on the floor," he wrote.
Later, Meadows called the resolution a "political act", contending that "the majority can't accomplish anything legislatively, so they are trying to accomplish things politically."
After the vote, Trump commended the GOP lawmakers who voted against the resolution.
"So great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today's vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat Congresswomen," the president wrote in a tweet.
William Cummings of the USA TODAY contributed to this report.

The border crisis has reached unprecedented levels

Texto completo: The crisis at our southern border shows no signs of slowing down, as the number of individuals attempting to cross our border illegally continues at a rapid pace. In May of this year, border patrol agents made 132,887 apprehensions. That is three times more than the same month in 2018, and nine times more than the same month in 2017. This has overwhelmed our system as our border patrol agents are overburdened and detention facilities are growing more crowded every day by individuals who have illegally crossed our border. The result has been both a border security crisis and a humanitarian crisis along our southern border.
How did we get here in the first place? Our broken immigration policy is primarily to blame. Central Americans, living in countries without the opportunities and freedoms we have in the U.S., want to come here for a better, more prosperous life. Due to our generous asylum laws, word has spread among citizens in Central America that if they can reach our soil, they can claim asylum and stay in the United States until their court hearing, in which a decision is made whether their asylum claim is legitimate. Because immigration judges are overwhelmed with backlogged cases, the court date is often years away. According to the administration, 90 percent of the asylum seekers fail to show up to their court date. There is currently a backlog of more than 875,000 immigration cases.
Asylum is meant to provide a safe haven for individuals fleeing persecution. It should be a last resort for those sincerely fearing for their lives – not be used as a free ticket into the United States for those who would simply prefer to live in our country. Under current law, those who want to live in the U.S. should go through the legal immigration process instead of falsely claiming asylum to get across the border, and those who want to legitimately claim asylum should do so at the ports of entry at our southern border.
President Trump's administration has recently taken steps to help stem the flow of illegal immigrants by issuing an interim rule that changes the process for those seeking asylum. Under the rule, migrants who enter through our southern border will be ineligible for asylum unless they apply for and are denied asylum in one of the countries they traveled through first.
It's not often that I agree with the New York Times, but a recent editorial declared that "The United States needs an immigration policy that combines border security, justice and humanity." I couldn't agree more. The status quo fails to protect our borders, fails to address the humanitarian crisis and fails to uphold legal immigration which is meant to meet our country's needs. The administration's rule is a good start, as is the border supplemental bill passed in June that provides $4.59 billion in additional funding to help improve the situation at the border. Additionally, the administration authorized the deployment of more troops to the border, for a total force of 6,600 who are tasked with providing support to Customs and Border Patrol. But these are only temporary patches and they don't address the entire problem.
Congress must take action if we are ever to find a long-term solution to strengthen our borders, fix the humanitarian crisis and make certain our legal immigration system is merit-based so we can adequately meet our workforce needs. We must do better, and I continue to stand ready to work with my colleagues – on both sides of the aisle – to fix the crisis once and for all.

THURSDAY’S PAPER: Look for complete coverage in Thursday’s Dayton Daily News
WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN MUELLER TESTIMONY
Democrats want incriminating, hidden-till-now details about Donald Trump and Russia. Republicans want Robert Mueller to concede it was all a waste of time and money, if not an outright hoax.
Neither side is likely to get just what it wants Wednesday, but the former special counsel’s first open testimony on his investigation has Washington and the rest of the political world in a high state of anticipation just the same.
President Donald Trump speaks to reporters while meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, July 22, 2019. Ahead of speci­al couns­el Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress, Trump and his aides sought to dismiss the congressional hearings as nothing more than a desperate attempt to elicit from Mueller something that could justify impeachment proceedings.

Some things to look for when Mueller appears before the House intelligence and judiciary committees to answer questions about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible cooperation with the Trump campaign.
OBSTRUCTION, OBSTRUCTION
Much of Mueller’s report focuses on the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee say that’s where their attention will be, too. And for good reason: His report examines in blow-by-blow detail nearly a dozen episodes in which the new president sought to control the Russia probe, narrow its scope or even have investigators fired.
Democrats say they expect to draw Mueller out in several of these areas. They include his demands that then-White House Counsel Don McGahn press for Mueller’s firing and his push to have former Attorney General Jeff Sessions limit the investigation to future election interference rather than past conduct.
The afternoon session before the intelligence committee is likely to dwell more on Mueller’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to sway the outcome. Mueller found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy there, but did leave open the question of whether Trump illegally stymied the investigation.
MUELLER THE MARINE
Expecting Mueller to stray outside his report and drop scintillating details you’ve never heard before? Well, don’t.
Mueller, an ex-Marine with a famously taciturn style, never relished his congressional appearances in his 12 years as FBI director — and this will be no exception.
He cautioned lawmakers in May that he would not go beyond the pages of his report if called upon to testify. The Justice Department expects him to fulfill that commitment and to also steer clear of discussing the redacted portions of the report or the behavior of people who were investigated but not charged.

That means he’s unlikely to answer certain critical questions, including whether he would have recommended indicting Trump himself if Trump had not been president of the United States. That question matters since Mueller cited Justice Department legal opinions that say a sitting president cannot be charged in explaining his decision to not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had broken the law.
Mueller’s not one for hypotheticals, though, so it’s fair to assume he won’t engage Democrats on that one.
THE “SNITTY” LETTER
Mueller will almost certainly be pressed about tensions with Attorney General William Barr over the way his report was handled and how the Justice Department communicated its findings to the public, including the attorney general’s decision to exonerate the president even when the special counsel pointedly did not do so.
Mueller complained privately to Barr in March that the attorney general’s four-page letter summarizing the main findings of his report “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this office’s work and conclusions.” Barr, in turn, has called Mueller’s note “a bit snitty.”
Mueller has made clear he didn’t think it was appropriate to make a determination one way or the other about whether the president had committed a crime. He has rejected Barr’s assessment that the evidence couldn’t satisfy an obstruction of justice allegation, noting both in his report — and, again, in a public statement from the Justice Department podium — that if he had confidence the president had not committed a crime, he would have said so.
Barr had no such hesitation and has said Mueller shouldn’t have started investigating the president if he wasn’t prepared to reach a conclusion.
Mueller probably doesn’t want to extend a public war of words with Barr, a longtime friend and his former boss. But he’ll very likely be asked about the dispute, and he may have a hard time getting around it.
THE DOSSIER
Republicans aren’t likely to directly attack Mueller himself . The former special counsel is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who steered the FBI through the Sept. 11 attacks and was appointed by a Republican president to run the storied law enforcement agency.
But that doesn’t mean they won’t have areas to mine.
They’re likely to seize on the origins of the investigation and press Mueller on the extent to which the FBI, in the early weeks and months of its Russia probe, relied on information from a dossier of anti-Trump research paid for by Democrats. The Justice Department has acknowledged that the dossier helped form the basis of a secret surveillance warrant it obtained to monitor the communications of a Trump campaign aide, though the investigation had actually begun months earlier and was based on entirely separate allegations.
Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, foreshadowed that line of attack Monday with a tweet that said: “We have to do more than just question Mueller. We have to expose his biased investigation.”
IMPEACHMENT SUPPORTERS WILL BE WATCHING
More than 85 House Democrats — around a third of the caucus — have declared their support for opening an impeachment inquiry, and those who are pushing impeachment are hoping there will be a flood of additional Democrats who side with them after Mueller’s hearing.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she doesn’t favor starting an impeachment process, for now, and would need a public groundswell to change her mind.
The House is scheduled to head out on a five-week recess next week, and reaction from constituents back home after the Mueller hearing will be crucial as Democrats decide how to proceed with their investigations of the president.

Texto completo: Los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) detuvieron solamente a 35 inmigrantes durante las grandes redadas anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump que tenían como objetivo al menos a 2,000 personas.
Este reporte corresponde únicamente a una semana de operaciones y no se mezcla con datos de otros operativos, ya que el director de la agencia, Matthew Albence , dijo a The New York Times, que en los últimos meses ha habido cientos de capturas.
El presidente Trump anunció la operación antes de que realmente sucediera, lo que podría haber dado a las personas el tiempo suficiente para abandonar sus hogares para evadir el arresto, y les dio a los defensores tiempo para informar a las familias sobre sus derechos.
La redada tenía como objetivo exacto a 2,105 personas que han recibido órdenes finales de deportación, una lista supuestamente liberada en febrero.
“No conozco a ninguna otra población donde la gente diga cómo evitar el arresto como resultado de una actividad ilegal” , lamentó el funcionario. “Ciertamente nos hace más difícil realizar estas órdenes emitidas”.
El funcionario indicó que ICE no informa cuando realiza sus operativos, tal como se confirmó al solicitar detalles de las redadas en 10 ciudades, las cuales derivaron en acciones aisladas o “miniredadas” .
Ante las alertas, la agencia ha cambiado de estrategia, indicaron activistas, quienes sugieren a los inmigrantes en peligro de deportación mantenerse en alerta y seguir los mismos consejos ante una eventual redada .
1. Evitar huir.
2. NUNCA mostrar una identificación falsa.
3. Respete a los oficiales migratorios.
4. NUNCA renuncie a su derecho de defensa y realizar una llamada telefónica.
5. NUNCA firme documentos sin asesoría legal.

Texto completo: En un operativo llamado “Cross Check” (“Verificación Cruzada”) , la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) logró la captura de 899 inmigrantes en dos meses, afirmó el director interino de la agencia Matt Albence .
El funcionario especificó a The New York Times que esa movilización ocurrió entre el 13 de mayo y el 11 de julio, es decir antes de las llamadas “grandes redadas” anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump .
“Lo que descubrimos es que la mayoría ni siquiera se presentó a su primera audiencia” , dijo Albence. “Además les enviamos cartas para que tuvieran la oportunidad de entregarse y organizar un proceso de salida más ordenado, lo que incluía el tiempo para organizar sus asuntos y programar vuelos en aerolíneas comerciales”.
Sin embargo, un reporte de ICE dado a conocer en Twitter se indica que fueron 934 las personas capturadas, aunque la agencia no dio detalles al respecto.
Como parte de un enfoque múltiple para frenar la inmigración de indocumentados, Albence dijo que el Gobierno también intensificó las inspecciones de las compañías sospechosas de contratarlos.
La propia agencia reportó que se hicieron operativos en 3,300 empresas , aunque los detalles serían revelados en cualquier momento de este martes.
“Parte de nuestro objetivo es reducir las oportunidades económicas” , dijo Albence. “No podemos tener individuos que ingresen ilegalmente al país y luego vayan a buscar trabajo de manera ilegal”.
En las grandes redadas anunciadas en 10 ciudades, ICE solamente capturó a 35 inmigrantes y Albence acusó la difusión de la información, además de criticar a los activistas por orientar a los extranjeros sobre cómo protegerse.

Venice kicks out, issues $1,000 fine to German tourists for making coffee on bridge steps

Texto completo: The city of Venice issued a $1,000 fine to two German travelers after they were discovered trying to make coffee on the steps of one of the oldest buildings in the city, and then asked them to leave the city, according to reports from The New York Times and the BBC.
An unidentified 32-year-old man and 35-year-old woman attempted to make coffee with a travel stove on the 400-year-old Rialto Bridge, a violation of new rules imposed in May. These rules include everything from littering to sitting down in front of monuments, as well as swimming in the canals, according to The Lonely Planet.
In a statement, Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said: "Venice must be respected and those impolite people who come here and do what they want must understand that. Thanks to the local police, they will be sanctioned and removed. "
"Our city will always be open and welcoming to all those who want to come and visit it," Brugnaro added. "At the same time, we will be intransigent with those who think they will come and do what they want. "
The city is also now charging all visitors who enter central Venice, not just overnight travelers.
Brugnaro said at the end of last year that Italy’s new budget law will allow the lagoon city to charge all visitors for accessing the historic center, not just those spending the night.

Texto completo: If you want to scream with delight, you should ride the Kentucky Flyer at Kentucky Kingdom.
At least, that's what one New York Times writer thinks.
The local roller coaster is one of four rides that everyone must try, according to a New York Times article from July 18 entitled, "Roller Coasters 2019: What to Ride."
The Flyer was praised for having "all the fun ups and downs you could want, gliding out and back on a hilly airtime-heavy track that is mild enough for children to enjoy, but also wild enough to have plenty of adults screaming."
The other three rides mentioned were the Yukon Striker in Ontario; Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure in Orlando; and the Copperhead Strike in Charlotte, North Carolina.
They all bring a bit of "record-breaking new thrills" as well as "simple, enjoyable tradition," according to the article's author, Mekado Murphy.
The Kentucky Flyer, a 1,280-foot wooden roller coaster, joined the Kentucky Kingdom's other five roller coasters this year.
The amusement park announced the addition in October 2018 as a celebration of their 30-year anniversary.

Breaking the cycle of wars

Texto completo: For the Monitor
I've just completed reading The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin. It was recommended by NPR's Evening Edition and the New York Times as the book for the June online discussion. The novel is set in a world where natural disasters are common and often catastrophically destructive. However, the people with powers to mitigate those disasters are feared and oppressed. It juxtaposes these people with a population accepting the inevitability of these life-threatening disasters and fearing even more extreme consequences if attempts are made to change things.
In an interview with NPR, Jemisin said: “I wrote this book while watching (the protests in) Ferguson unfold on the internet … tanks rolling down the streets of an American city, towards an unarmed, peaceful protest and treating them like the enemy. And why are they being treated like the enemy when literally all they're asking for is to not get shot?”
The novel suggests the question, “Who in our society are feared or denigrated for rejecting the inevitability of violence breeding violence?”
In the Hebrew scriptures we read, “I shall pour out my spirit on all humankind; your sons and daughters will prophesy, your elders will dream dreams and your young people will see visions, even the lowly” (Joel 2: 28, 29). However, in our society, these people are often silenced in favor of the way things have always been. Many portray them as “unrealistic,” “impractical,” soft on the opposition, and even dangerous or traitorous – undermining the defense of our country.
For centuries humanity has been trying to cope with coercive force by devising increasingly more devastating counter force. In my lifetime there have been World War II, the Korean conflict, the Cuban conflict, the Vietnam War, and the War on Terror that has taken our military into dozens of countries in the world, including active fighting for more than 20 years in Afghanistan and Iraq. Military force has been the default response to any perceived threat. It has been accepted as a means to confront demonstrations and protests, border crossings, raids seeking undocumented people and even moving checkpoints questioning citizens within our own country. These events have eroded our values of reason, negotiation and the self-evident truth that all people are created equal with the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
For example, some justify torture as a tool against enemies of our country. Many support the U.S. maintenance and upgrade of a nuclear weapons arsenal with the intent to use it if the perceived need arises, even at our own peril. President Donald Trump recently defended the poor treatment of immigrant children saying, “Things were just as bad or worse where they lived in their home country.” Is that really the standard we are willing to accept for the lives of children?
Also, the alternative Independence Day celebration orchestrated by the president in Washington, D.C., on July 4 illustrates the determination of many to equate greatness with military and economic prowess. There was a grand military display of tanks and roaring flyovers by fighter jets and bombers. His speech included a review of America's military history, recounting with reverence the early beginnings of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard. It seems apparent that our country and the nations of the world are on a trajectory to repeat the same military actions over and over hoping for different results.
However, these accounts leave out a significant capacity of human beings. Humans not only have a penchant for war and violence, they also have the aptitude for empathy, care for others and a commitment to equal justice for all. Our nation and the world of nations have a need to nurture this capacity. The world needs a movement of people who have the vision, the energy and the will to solve conflicts in new ways that abandon the display and use of coercive force to demonstrate strength and solve problems.
Some of these people are already among us. For example, consider Vista volunteers, people advocating for children on our border with Mexico, a University of New Hampshire student working this summer with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, World Council of Churches Ecumenical Accompaniers in Palestine and Israel, Doctors Without Borders, community service volunteers, people nonviolently demonstrating for social justice issues and No More Deaths volunteers in border regions of Arizona.
It is time to nurture and celebrate these expressions of human nature. In today's aggressive climate, sometimes empathy and nonviolence are dismissed as unrealistic divisive constructs of intellectuals and idealists. Contrary to this criticism, they can serve to unite people in a common cause. Building supportive relationships can give direction to the more privileged and a sense of justice, strength and self-esteem for those struggling for basic needs of food, housing, health care, education and equal opportunity employment. Working together may be the means to break out of the cycle of violence, war, cultural divides and scapegoating that have plagued humanity for centuries. Such a movement may even contribute to the survival of humanity, and perhaps the Earth.
As our country moves toward the 2020 elections, look for candidates who are among these visionaries. Look for candidates who are willing to reject the centuries of failed dependence on coercive power and lead us toward a time of trust, cooperation and security among all people and all nations. It is a significant part of our nature. May the capacity for this new spirit flourish among us.
(The Rev. John Buttrick, United Church of Christ, lives in Concord.)

Texto completo: It started as a quarrel on a quiet Stockholm street, but the case of A$AP Rocky, :he rapper detained in Sweden on a preliminary charge of assault, has escalated into an international incident, with politicians and diplomats weighing in and his celebrity backers pulling strings at the White House.
On Friday a court in Stockholm approved a request from prosecutors to hold Rocky in detentisn for at least six more days, on :he grounds that the rapper was a flight risk. A spokesman for the Swedish Prosecution Authority said another hearing would be held Thursday to determine whether he would be detained further.
Rocky, 30, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, is accused of assaulting a man in Stockholm on June 30 while he was in the city on tour.
The rapper and two other men were detained July E so that prosecutors could investigate. (An investigation into a fourth man, Rocky's bodyguard, ended without the man being detained.)
Since then, Swedish officials have been defending the country's justice system from accusations of racism and its prisons from charges of human rights abuse - unexpected indictments against a nation often seen as a paragon of social liberalism.
The cause has been raken up by musicians, including Justin Bieber and Diddy, who decried Rocky's detention and shared the petition on Instagram. Several rappers said they would never perform in Sweden again. "No more Sweden for me, ever," said Tyler, the Creator in a tweet.
Several members of Congress, including Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., representing Harlem, where Rocky grew up, also have called for his release. "This incident serves as yet another example of the racially motivated focus and prejudices young men of color are subjected to around the world," said a joint statement from the five House members.
The worlds of music and politics came together to rally for Rocky's cause when rapper Kanye West asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, to call President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to see if something could be done, according to a person familiar with the communications who spoke anonymously because they weren't authorized to discuss them.
Kardashian called Kushner, who raised the issue with the president, the person said. Trump directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to work with Swedish authorities to make sure Rocky's conditions of detention were fair and that the State Department received regular updates.
On Friday, Trump, who has faced a bruising week over his record on race relations for telling four non-white congresswomen to "go back" to their home countries, offered a different account of how he got involved, saying he had received calls from his African-American friends urging him to help. He also credited the first lady, Melania Trump, with bringing the issue to his attention.
"We are one," Trump said. "We hope to get him home soon."
Rocky has said he had acted in self-defense. In a clip posted by the rapper on Instagram, he and his entourage repeatedly tell two men to stop following them. "We don't want to fight you," Rocky says in the video.
But a video clip published July 2 by Aftonbladet, a Swedish newspaper, appeared to show Rocky lifting one of the men off his feet and throwing him to the ground. Another clip posted by gossip website TMZ appeared to show the rapper and two members of his entourage punch and kick the man while he was down.
Even so, the rapper's team started a Change.org petition demanding his release. The petition said the rapper was being held in "horrific" and "unsanitary" conditions in "24/7 solitary confinement." More than 600,000 people have signed it.
The accusations have kept coming, even as,Swedish officials countered that their courts were fair and their jails were world-leading.
Karin Olofsdotter, Sweden's ambassador to the United States, said in a telephone interview Thursday that she was concerned about "misunderstandings" that had arisen.
"We have a fair and just legal system," she said.
Rocky is allowed to be with other inmates for up to three hours a day, Olofsdotter said. Giving detainees their own room, rather than making them sleep with other inmates, is "a good thing," she added. "That is not solitary confinement."
Henrik Olsson Lilja, Rocky's own lawyer, undermined his team's accusation that the rapper was being kept in inhumane conditions in an interview with Dagens Nyheter last week. The lawyer, who visited Rocky in his cell, said he was being "treated fairly" and that, contrary to what the Change.org petition said, he had access to food.
Olsson Lilja said that sometimes the cells, which have no toilets, smell of urine, but this is usually because inmates have relieved themselves in the sink.
Two days later, Rocky changed his legal team.
"If you live in a country where bail is possible, I understand you'd be surprised," Wegerstad said.

Texto completo: Iran's most revered Revolutionary Guard commander says talking with President Donald Trump would be admitting defeat. The country's supreme leader has ruled out any dealings with Washington.
But now, in a surprising split among Iranian hard-liners, some are expressing a different opinion: It's time to sit down and resolve 40 years of animosity with the United States, by talking directly to Trump.
And the most striking voice in that contrarian group is former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, largely known in the West for his anti-American bombast, Holocaust denial, and suspiciously lopsided victory in a disputed vote a decade ago that set off Iran's worst political convulsions since the Islamic revolution.
"Mr. Trump is a man of action," Ahmadinejad said in a lengthy telephone interview with The New York Times. "He is a businessman, and therefore he is capable of calculating cost-benefits and making a decision. We say to him, let's calculate the long-term cost-benefit of our two nations and not be shortsighted."
Ahmadinejad's remarks are among several signals from different ends of Iran's political spectrum that Iranian officials want to talk as the risk of armed conflict with the United States has escalated.
The tensions were punctuated Thursday by Iran's disclosure that it had seized a foreign tanker in the Persian Gulf and by Trump's assertion that U.S. naval forces in the region had downed an Iranian drone, which Iranian officials denied on Friday.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, who had previously insisted there could be no negotiations with the United States unless it rejoined the nuclear agreement Trump abandoned last year, said Thursday he was willing to meet with U.S. senators to discuss possible ways out of the nuclear crisis.
For the first time, Zarif floated modest steps that Tehran would be willing to take in return for the simultaneous lifting of sanctions Trump reimposed.
While Ahmadinejad was disqualified from running for president again two years ago, he still travels around the country making speeches and writing open letters criticizing the government and the judiciary.
Unlike other hard-liners, he dares to criticize the Revolutionary Guard for its influence over Iran's economy and the power it gives Khamenei, who has sole authority to direct the vast paramilitary force.
"Ahmadinejad is shaking things up by boldly talking about all the issues that everyone knows but nobody dares talk about publicly, and be willing to pay the cost," said Roozbeh Mirebrahimi, an Iranian political analyst based in New York.
In The Times interview, which lasted more than an hour, Ahmadinejad said that Tehran and Washington should directly resolve the litany of disputes that began with the 1979 revolution, the seizure of the U.S. Embassy, the taking of American hostages, the mutual accusations of regional meddling and all the rest.
Ahmadinejad said Iran should scrap the approach of enlisting Europe and other intermediaries to influence Trump over his hostility to the 2015 nuclear agreement. This would be possible, Ahmadinejad said, if Trump first eased some of his "maximum pressure" tactics, most notably the onerous sanctions he reimposed after having abandoned the agreement, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, between Iran and the big powers.
"World peace, economy and culture would greatly benefit from us working together," Ahmadinejad said. "The U.S. wants to address wider issues than the JCPOA The issues at stake are more important and wider than whether the JCPOA should live or die. We need to have a fundamental discussion."

As Goes Pa., So Goes The 2020 Election

Texto completo: While Democrats wade through a marathon of intra-party debates, the national punditocracy is increasingly asking two urgent questions about the impending 2020 presidential contest: Can President Donald Trump win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin again? And can he win a second term without those three states?
Both questions reflect a stark reality in American presidential elections: The presidency is won or lost in the Electoral College - a body dominated by a handful of large so-called battleground states that can determine the outcome.
Trump triumphed in 2016 by winning narrowly these three Rust Belt states, which he was expected to lose. Pennsylvania was the biggest surprise as well as the biggest prize among them. In theory, Trump can win without these three - either by replacing them with three other large states, or by picking up several smaller states that equal their combined 46 electoral votes.
But where will those replacement states come from? Presently, according to The New York Times, Trump is far behind in Pennsylvania (16 percentage points), Wisconsin (10 points) and Michigan (11 points). According to the Morning Consult, Trump’s current approval rating in Pennsylvania has plummeted 19 points since Inauguration Day.
The president could go after states he narrowly lost in 2016, including New Hampshire, Nevada and Minnesota. But combined these would not nearly make up a loss in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
In addition, Trump may be on the defensive in states he won in 2016 and must win again in 2020. Florida and even Texas are wobbly while North Carolina, a Trump stronghold in 2016, is trending blue in statewide elections. Even winning all three again won’t make up a loss in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Inarguably then, Trump almost certainly cannot win the Electoral College without winning these three crucial Rust Belt states, which have voted as a bloc seven elections in a row - supporting Democrats in six consecutive elections before shifting to Trump and the GOP in 2016. As goes Wisconsin and Michigan also goes Pennsylvania; and in 2020, as goes Pennsylvania, so goes the election.
Trump’s strategy
But can Trump win Pennsylvania again? What are the keys to the Keystone State?
■ Increase the turnout among his base. Trump’s strength is rooted in rural and small-town western Pennsylvania with its long tradition of old economy “smokestack industries,” as well as the old mining and mill towns in the northeast and southwest. To win he may need a historically high turnout in these areas to overcome an expected anti-Trump surge in the suburbs.
■ Make it a referendum. The president must convince his supporters that he kept his promises: bringing back jobs and business lost to globalism; ending “bad” trade deals; and “fixing” the immigration problem. Presidential elections are almost always a referendum on the incumbent, and these are the issues still important to Trump voters.
■ Be a cultural warrior. Trump must continue to appeal to culturally conservative Democrats, who remain strongly pro-life and anti-gun control. Trump’s 2016 cultural message resonated strongest in western, rural and small-town Pennsylvania and those voters still feel strongly about cultural issues.
■ Expand the base. Republicans must attract new voters who did not support the GOP ticket in 2016. Trump is running with a good economy at his back and no new wars. These conditions strongly favor incumbents and are attractive to independent voters who prefer the status quo.
Democrats’ strategy
Democrats, who have won six of the last seven presidential contests in Pennsylvania, still think they can beat Trump. Here’s how they expect to do it:
■ Nominate a moderate candidate. While Pennsylvania can temporarily lean left or right, its instincts are moderate and centrist. If the Democrats choose a candidate perceived to be “far left,” Pennsylvania will be difficult for Democrats to win.
■ Produce the widely predicted “Democrat surge.” Certainly, there were strong indications during the 2018 midterms and special elections that state Democrats are locked and loaded for 2020. To beat Trump, however, Democrats must now translate 2018’s promise to 2020’s results. If they fail to galvanize the Philadelphia suburbs, Trump will win Pennsylvania in 2020.
■ Tend to the base. Democrats must recover some of the previously Democratic Party voters who now support Trump. Former Democratic strongholds such as Luzerne, Northampton and Erie counties went for Trump in 2016, sealing his sliver-thin win. Democrats must address the fears and hopes of these lapsed party voters, especially white males.
■ Engage younger voters. Finally, Democrats must pull younger voters to the polls in 2020. Voters under age 35 have been among Trump’s fiercest critics. Yet this cohort normally votes at a rate about half that of older Pennsylvanians. Increasing youth turnout could spell the difference between defeat and victory in 2020 for Democrats.
The Democrats’ impressive opportunities notwithstanding, it is foolish to conclude Trump cannot win Pennsylvania - just as it was foolish to write him off in 2016. Trump’s base in rural and western Pennsylvania will support him at least as strongly as in 2016. Furthermore, no incumbent in modern times has lost re-election in an era of economic prosperity such as we are now experiencing.
Undoubtedly the greatest threat to Trump is a Democrat turnout tsunami in Philadelphia and its suburbs. The suburbs and city were disaster areas for Republican candidates in the last midterms - and early polling suggests the anti-Trump sentiment continues.
Right now, Pennsylvania is the Democrats’ to lose in 2020. But that was also true in 2016. How did that turn out?

SOMETIMES, MUM'S THE WORD IN UBER OR LYFT RIDE NOW YOU CAN PAY FOR THAT SILENT TREATMENT

Texto completo: There's one Uber ride, in particular, that Beth Turnbull recalls clear as day. When the 21-year-old Irwin native was picked up, the driver told her that he was a professional SpongeBob SquarePants impersonator.
As a regular user of ride-hailing services, she definitely meets some "colorful characters" that she doesn't mind chatting with, said Ms. Turnbull, an accounts coordinator at Matter Communications, a public relations firm in the Strip District. But most of the time, she prefers silence in the car.
She's not the only one.
San Francisco-based Uber rolled out a new feature in May, aptly named "quiet mode." It's a new service that allows riders to request a no-talking experience.
Uber did not return a request for comment for this story.
Quiet mode is available in every city, including Pittsburgh, although only to those using Uber Black and Uber Black SUV - premium services that routinely cost double the price of a regular ride.
It's a sharp contrast from the earliest days of Uber in the early 2010s, when riders were encouraged to sit up front; it was the anti-taxi service, after all. However, that close proximity to the driver made conversation a necessity, more or less.
Many riders in Pittsburgh choose to sit in the back seat now, a way to help get a silent ride.
And that's good for Uber because the in-app quiet mode may create an incentive for customers to upgrade to a more expensive Uber Black vehicle.
"More than a hired hand'
Kwadwo Burgee, lead analyst for the Department of Homeland Security in Washington, D.C., has no interest in Uber's quiet mode service.
For one thing, the 44-year-old Arlington, Va., resident - originally from Philadelphia - said he was raised to keep quiet during taxi rides.
And why pay extra?
"You could just let the driver know that you're busy and don't want to talk," he said.
Also, Mr. Burgee sometimes likes to engage with his drivers. "It might make them feel better. You're treating them as more than a hired hand. They're a person, and you can treat them that way.
"Every person you come up against, friend or foe, has a lesson to teach you," he said.
Greg Coticchia is director and co-founder of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Founder's Institute, an idea-stage accelerator and startup launch program that holds events in Downtown. As a serial entrepreneur, Mr. Coticchia loves to pick his Lyft and Uber drivers' brains about their gig-economy businesses.
"I always ask them, 'Hey, how long have you been doing it?' ... Then I like to ask them if they make money - is it working for you?" he said with a laugh.
Still, he gets why others may treasure serenity during their commute.
"I did notice the 'do you want a quiet ride?' prompt in San Francisco [while using the Uber app] this week," said Mr. Coticchia, who is currently traveling. "I can imagine some people on business may like that or some people that don't feel social."
A 'conversation menu'
According to a March 2019 poll - it surveyed 576 members of TPG Lounge, a Facebook group set up in 2010 by The Points Guy to create hands-on advice for travelers - an overwhelming majority prefer a silent ride.
The New York-based online media company created the survey after discovering the existence of a driver's "conversation menu" in Seattle.
A rider posted it to Twitter in February, and by March it had gone viral.
Runners-up in The Points Guy study included:
* The Stand-Up Ride: Drivers will "tell you about things that are funny."
* The Rude Ride: The driver promises to be "as rude as possible."
* The Therapy Ride: "Got something on your mind? Let me help take it off. Talk to me."
* The Creepy Ride: "I don't say anything. I just look at you from time to time in the rearview mirror."
The survey may come across a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it summarizes common experiences and points to riders' increasing thirst to design a custom atmosphere.
Shimira Williams is CEO and co-founder at C.C. Busy, an East Liberty-based startup creating a voice-activated platform to assist child care professionals.
Ms. Williams, 40, of Lincoln-Lemington, wrote in a tweet that she always sits in the back of an Uber or Lyft, but she does make a point to at least say hello to the driver.
Others on Twitter agree - the grass is greener in the back of the vehicle.
'They were jerks'
Zak Slayback, 25, sits somewhere in the middle.
He's a self-proclaimed extrovert and loves to learn from drivers - but he has found that Lyft and Uber seem to operate on completely different planets when it comes to customer service.
"Lyft has played up the friendlier element as Uber has played up the villainous, 1980s corporate evil branding," said Mr. Slayback, of Observatory Hill.
When a driver has a Lyft decal only on the car, he's ready to chat. An Uber decal, not so much.
Mr. Slayback, who works in Pittsburgh as a principal at 1517 Fund, headquartered in San Francisco, said he has found that many Uber drivers in larger cities are former taxi drivers.
To put it succinctly? "They were jerks," he said. He remembers one driver, in particular.
"He was passive-aggressive, using manipulative language to have me give him a cash tip and complained about passengers talking to him the whole ride," Mr. Slayback said.
There's good news if you're one of those who can't quite figure out whether to get chatty with your driver. Mr. Slayback has found that Yinzers are more than willing to talk your ear off.
"I'd say it's probably because we never had a good taxi industry here," he said. "I'll complain about Uber all day, but it's the best thing that's happened to the city."

Man and woman shot, killed at nursing home
Delaware State Police say a shooting at a nursing home in Wilmington has left two people dead.

Authorities have not said who the shooter was or released the names of the man or woman.
NEW YORK
Artists withdraw from show over tear gas link
Seven artists have asked New York's Whitney Museum to remove their work from its biennial showcase of American art over a museum board member's ties to the sale of law-enforcement supplies including tear gas.
The artists are protesting Warren Kanders' role as vice chairman of the Whitney's board. Kanders is the owner of the Safariland Group, which sells body armor for police officers as well as tear gas. Critics of Safariland say the tear gas has been used against migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Four of the artists said in a letter published in Artforum on Friday that they refuse "further complicity with Kanders and his technologies of violence."
The Whitney's director, Adam Weinberg, told The New York Times that the museum will comply with the artists' request.
CAIRO

Egyptian officials say Cairo's international airport has been notified by British Airways that the airline is suspending flights to and from London for two days.
Airport officials say the decision came after British official conducted regular security checks earlier this week at the airport. There gave no additional details.
Their comments came as British Airways announced it was canceling flights to Cairo for a week for unspecified security reasons.
The Egyptian officials said all other airlines were operating as usual at the airport. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.

10 killed, 5 missing in blast at gas plant BEIJING — An explosion at a gas plant in central China has killed at least 10 people and seriously injured others, authorities said Saturday. Five people were missing. The explosion on Friday evening, in the city of Yima in Henan province, sent a ball of fire and thick plumes of smoke into the air, according to local state media. The fire charred the factory building, leaving only the frame, the accounts said. As the fire spread, nearby houses collapsed, and windows were shattered as far as 2 miles away, residents said. The explosion occurred in the air separation unit of a factory owned by the Henan Coal Gas (Group) Co., according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. No explanation was given for the explosion.

British Airways halts Cairo flights LONDON — British Airways abruptly canceled all flights to Cairo on Saturday for what it described as security reasons, a day after the British government warned against traveling to some parts of Egypt. The airline told passengers at their departure gate in London that they could not fly. “We constantly review our security arrangements at all our airports around the world," the airline said in a statement, “and have suspended flights to Cairo for seven days as a precaution to allow for further assessment." British Airways did not describe the security issue. The British government released new travel advice for Egypt on Friday, warning against trips to most of the Sinai Peninsula and the area west of the Nile Valley and saying that travelers to Cairo should be cautious, too. “There's a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation," the government said.

Bosnia-Herzegovina
Funeral held for mass killing victims PRIJEDOR — Several thousand people attended a funeral service in Bosnia on Saturday for 86 Muslims who were slain by Serbs in one of the worst atrocities of the country's 1992-95 war. Relatives of the victims, religious leaders, and others gathered at a soccer stadium near the eastern town of Prijedor, standing solemnly behind lines of coffins draped with green cloths. The victims ranged in age from 19 to 61. They were among some 200 Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor who were massacred in August 1992 on a cliff on Mt. Vlasic known as Koricanske Stijene. The victims were shot and killed by the edge of the cliff, their bodies falling into the abyss. The Serbs later threw bombs onto the bodies, which made identifying the victims difficult. The United Nations war crimes tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sentenced several ex-Bosnian Serb policemen for separating civilians from a convoy of people being deported from Prijedor and killing them.

The news avoiders have opted out

Texto completo: NPR in May changed the long-familiar theme music to its “Morning Edition” newscast.
After 40 years of hearing B.J. Leiderman’s original score every weekday, you were either sick of it, or, for sticks in the mud such as yours truly, flummoxed at the very idea of messing with a good thing.
But I’ll get over it. Especially ‘cause the new, poppy, synthy thing is just a rewrite of the old tune anyway. Same chord progression; a few tweaks.
The reason for the move by the public radio commissars in D.C.?
It was, as Josh Benton wrote for Nieman Lab, “for the kids.”
Meaning, trying to get a few listeners under 60 to listen to the show.
The New York Times wrote: “The new theme is intended to attract a younger and more diverse audience, while also aligning with the evolution of ‘Morning Edition’ into a newsier program, said Kenya Young, the executive producer. ‘I wanted a sound and a mood and a tone and a feel and a vibe all mixed in one,’ she said.”
Actual young people seem to consume as much radio news as they do daily print newspapers. Meaning, none. The only reason I know at least one 20something has ever listened to a second of NPR is that Clementine Creevy’s great L.A. rock band Cherry Glazerr takes its name from KCRW’s morning host Chery Glaser, who Clem used to hear in her parents’ car as they drove her to school.
So where do young people get their news? I know, I know, Instagram, fool.
But it’s not just Millennials who don’t follow the old-fashioned definition of what’s going on in the world. Academics who study the subject say that, at a time when it is far easier than ever to get an enormous amount of information about everything by clicking on the screen of that telephone in your pocket, many are simply opting out.
Josh Benton, again, for Nieman: “News, you may have noticed, isn’t that great at generating happiness these days. So lots of people are happy to stick to Keanu and avoid Trump/Iran/Putin/climate change/mass shootings/Brexit/racism entirely.”
Yes, of course, there have been plenty of times as terrifying as these, and people still followed — hungered for — the news. When the Third Reich was bombing London and on the brink of ruling Europe, that didn’t stop people from listening to Edward Murrow broadcasting from the rooftops. So mere logic won’t do here. Something else is going on.
As someone who learned to read at age 4 out of fascination with the morning newspaper, and haven’t stopped since, it doesn’t matter that this makes no sense to me. It’s a thing. Benton cites data from Digital News Report: “In 2017, 29 percent of those surveyed worldwide said they ‘often or sometimes avoid the news,’ including 38 percent in the United States and 24 percent in the U.K. By 2019, those numbers had increased to 32 percent worldwide (+3), 41 percent in the U.S. (+3) and 35 percent in the U.K. (+11). (Even the Japanese — the world’s most devoted news consumers — saw news avoidance increase from 6 to 11 percent.)”
Harshing their vibe is the major reason for news avoidance, 57 percent of the avoiders said: “It can have a negative effect on my mood.”
Second, yes, is the more than a third of us who have concocted a conspiracy theory about the press: “I can’t rely on news to be true,” say 35 percent. You want real untruthiness? Try the internet.
“I haven’t read a newspaper in years,” said one respondent. “It was all too depressing.”
I hear you, dude. But you want real depressing? Try a future in which the creeps and crooks we report on win the day because you decided to just tune out.

Seal Bay Festival deftly displays contemporary American chamber music

Texto completo: Because touring musicians who steer clear of Maine in the winter flock here in the summer, chamber music festivals are plentiful, each with a distinct personality. Some are shaped by the mix of performers on hand and the repertory they bring; others pursue specific repertory agendas.
The Seal Bay Festival, which offers concerts in Portland, Brunswick, Belfast, Waterville, Topsham and Yarmouth over a 10-day run, concentrates on American chamber music, often with Maine composers featured. Between them, more established composers mentor their younger colleagues, and the festival's musicians rehearse and perform their works, and offer practical advice about performance issues.
The festival, in the form of its resident ensemble, the Cassatt String Quartet, and pianist Ursula Oppens, paid its annual visit to Space Gallery on Thursday evening, and presented six new (or, in two cases, newly revised) works. All six composers were on hand to introduce their scores.
An undercurrent of social and political commentary framed the program. In the opener, "Your Questions Online" (2019), Alejandro Rutty muses on the parallel lives we live now, split between our direct interactions in the physical world, and the personalities we project online, where thoughtful or moving comments intermingle with frivolous questions and observations.
The two connected movements of Rutty's piece, a string quartet, were inspired by a pair of questions posed online by someone who first wonders "How Can They Let Children Die" - a reference to the refugee crisis at our southern border - and later asks, "Where Can I Buy a Disco Ball?" Rutty's language is consonant and appealing, and he is strongly drawn to pizzicato scoring.
But he also provides the variety you would expect: The first movement is packed with melancholy themes that travel through the full ensemble, with an emphasis on wrenchingly direct cello and viola lines. The second is strongly rhythmic, veering between a mechanistic pummeling that evokes the Disco era and sinuous figures that embrace everything from tarantella-like figures to hints of tango - an argument, in a way, that complexities can thrive beneath even the most frivolous surfaces.
Though generically named, Laura Kaminsky's Piano Quintet (2018), which closed the program, is a comment on the chaos and brutality of what passes for political discourse in Trump-era America. It is not a broadside, exactly. In "Anthem," the first movement, Kaminsky has Oppens and the Cassatt players paint a diverse but ambiguous portrait of our time, with chorale-like passages giving way to fleeting touches of DvorÃ¡k-like folksiness and then uncompromisingly brusque chordal bursts.
That movement leads to "Lamentation; coming into light," a plangent movement that touches on extremes of pensiveness and gloom at one end and angry, acerbic energy, captured in both the assertive keyboard writing and tense, often brash, string writing, at the other.
But the real action is in the finale, "Maelstrom, and ..." which builds on the second movement's urgency and tension. Whether by design or coincidence, the movement includes, near the end, a call for help in the form of a full quartet figure etched in three fast, three slow and three fast notes - the rhythm of an S.O.S. in Morse code - on a single tone.
Kaminsky's ending is ambiguous: A quietly energetic, ascending keyboard burst, in the work's final seconds, could be taken as a sign of hope. But you could also hear it as a question - specifically, where do we go from here?
Between Rutty's and Kaminsky's social commentaries, the program offered thoughtful, if less time-sensitive, meditations. An innocent lyricism was the driving force of Daniel Strong Godfrey's "Paginula" (2018), a gentle but spirited and attractive score for violin (the Cassatt's first violinist, Muneko Otani) and piano, as well as Michael Alec Rose's "Seventh String Quartet - Maine Title: Sun, Sea, Land" (2018). Rose noted that although he lives in Nashville, he has long been fascinated by the landscapes and watercolors of Maine painter John Marin. The quartet, named for one of Marin's works, is a harmonized piece with melodic turns animating his rich, inviting themes.
The two works by Maine composers were strikingly different. Daniel Sonenberg's "The Sirens of Sombor" (2008, revised 2019) is an essentially lyrical score, with touches of modernist angularity and, at one point, bluesy figures, tempering its overt Romanticism.
Vineet Shende's "... and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms" (2004, revised 2019) explores a complex psychological moment, when belief gives way to disillusionment, which in turn leads to reconsideration and growth. Shende's lightly acidic language, leavened by intriguing themes and a bag of timbral tricks that includes string slides and dynamic swells, as well as stark contrasts between murky string backdrops and sparkling keyboard lines, is perfectly suited to the task.

Trump has done the impossible

Texto completo: President Trump, bless him, has once again achieved the impossible: He has unified the Democrats.
The fractious opposition party had been holding one of its regular Festivals of Gratuitous Self-Injury over the past few weeks on the matter of race. Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and other Democratic presidential candidates had attacked the "hurtful" actions of front-runner Joe Biden from decades ago in opposing busing and in working with segregationist senators. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) split Democrats by accusing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) of the "explicit singling out of newly elected women of color."
Now, Trump has come to the Democrats' rescue by reminding them, and all the world, what racism really looks like. On Sunday, he attacked four nonwhite Democratic congresswomen - Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) - by saying they "originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe" and proposing that they "go back" to the "broken and crime infested places from which they came."
Thus, Trump would have these lawmakers "go back" to Ohio (in Pressley's case), New York (Ocasio-Cortez's birthplace) and Michigan (Tlaib's). Omar, who emigrated from Somalia as a child, grew up in Minnesota. Rather than back down from this notion that nonwhites are not American, Trump broadened his attack on the four on Monday, saying they "hate our country" and proposing they "apologize to our country" and to him.
And Democrats were bickering over Biden's relationship with James Eastland in 1973?
Democrats' differences are trivial, or should be, as they spend the next 16 months preparing for an election that will either affirm America as a multicultural society or define it as a redoubt of white nationalism. Trump's racist words, clearly aimed at firing up his most ardent supporters, will, as in 2018, bring out his opponents in even greater numbers - as long as Democrats can move beyond their own squabbles.
It has been nearly four years since I wrote a column that began: "Let's not mince words: Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist." This was controversial at the time, even though we had already seen Trump's behavior with the Central Park Five and the birther movement, his routine attacks against Muslims and his branding of Mexican immigrants as rapists and killers.
But the past four years should have extinguished any doubt about his racism: his defense of "very fine people" at the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, his attacks against black NFL players, his denunciation of "s---hole countries" in Africa and elsewhere, his claim that Haitian immigrants "all have AIDS," his mockery of "Pocahontas" and the Trail of Tears. During just the past few weeks, Trump threatened, in defiance of the Supreme Court, to change the census in a way that the administration's own expert said would disadvantage nonwhite Hispanics. As then-Speaker Paul Ryan said when Trump declared that a Mexican American judge couldn't be impartial because of his ethnicity, this is "textbook" racism.
Yet even now, there remains some squeamishness about calling Trump what he is. The New York Times said Trump has fanned "the flames of a racial fire." CNN called his words "racially charged." The Washington Post said he "used a trope broadly viewed as racist."
It's long past time to stop pretending. Studies before and after the 2016 election showed that racial animus was the primary motivation of Trump voters, even more than economic concern. Certainly, many Trump voters were motivated by the hope of tax cuts and of Supreme Court picks. But with each of Trump's successive racist outbursts, it should become more difficult for at least some of these Republicans to stomach the white nationalism Trump promotes.
This is surely why Republican officeholders have been almost universally silent about Trump's latest ugliness, and GOP leaders have been shamefully mute. Of the few to speak, Rep. Will Hurd (Tex.), the lone black Republican in the House, denounced Trump's "racist and xenophobic" words. Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.), an independent who recently quit the GOP, likely gave voice to his cowardly colleagues' unspoken sentiments when he called Trump's words "racist and disgusting."
Trump's naked bigotry inspired House Democrats on Monday to set aside the skirmish between Pelosi's leadership team and Ocasio-Cortez's "Squad." Instead, they prepared a House resolution denouncing Trump's words.
That's a start. But for the next 16 months, Democrats must remember that their own differences are relatively insignificant. The latest racism is a new low for Trump, but worse will undoubtedly come. For Trump, there will be no bottom - unless and until voters tell him to go back to the place from which he came.

Texto completo: The 2020 presidential election is poised to have the highest turnout in a century, with the potential to reshape the composition of the electorate in a decisive way.
But perhaps surprisingly, it is not obvious which party would benefit. There are opportunities and risks for both parties, based on an Upshot analysis of voter registration files, the validated turnout of 50,000 respondents to The New York Times/Siena College pre-election surveys in 2018, census data, and public polls of unregistered voters.
It is commonly assumed that Democrats benefit from higher turnout because young and nonwhite and low-income voters are overrepresented among nonvoters. And for decades, polls have shown that Democrats do better among all adults than among all registered voters, and better among all registered voters than among all actual voters.
But this longstanding pattern has become more complicated in the Trump years. The president is strong among less educated white voters, who are also overrepresented among nonvoters. And Democrats already banked many of the rewards of higher turnout in the midterm elections, when the party out of power typically enjoys a turnout advantage and did so yet again, according to 2018 Times/Siena data.
Nationwide, the longstanding Republican edge in the gap between registered and actual voters all but vanished in 2018, even though young and nonwhite voters continued to vote at lower rates than older and white voters.
At the same time, the president's white working-class supporters from 2016 were relatively likely to stay home. Voters like these are likeliest to return to the electorate in 2020, and it could set back Democrats in crucial battleground states.
Democrats have an opportunity to gain by tapping into another group: the voters on the sidelines of American politics, who haven't voted in recent elections or aren't registered to vote at all.
This group, by definition, does not usually factor into electoral analysis, but a high enough turnout would draw many of them to vote. Analysts have speculated about a 70 percent turnout among eligible voters next year, based on the very large 2018 turnout -- the highest in a midterm since 1914 -- and on polls showing unusually strong interest in the 2020 election.
These adults on the periphery of American politics are probably more favorable to Democrats than registered voters are, but the story here is complicated as well.
They are not quite as favorable to Democrats as often assumed, in part because polls of adults include noncitizens, who are ineligible to vote. A large increase in voter registration would do much more to hurt the president in the national vote than in the Northern battleground states, where registration is generally high and where people who aren't registered are disproportionately whites without a college degree.
The registered voters who stayed home in 2018
The voters who stayed home in 2018 were not much more or less likely to approve of the president than those who actually turned out, based on data from nearly 100 Times/Siena surveys, linked to records indicating who did or did not vote.
Over all, the president had a 47 percent approval rating among Times/Siena respondents who voted, excluding those who did not offer an opinion about the president. But he had a higher approval rating (48 percent) among all registered voters in the nearly 60 battleground districts and a handful of Senate contests surveyed ahead of the midterms.
The Republicans lost their typical midterm turnout advantage, even though they didn't give up some of their traditional demographic advantages. Young and nonwhite turnout was markedly higher than it had been in 2014, but still lower than that of older and white voters. Registered Republicans were likelier to turn out than registered Democrats, according to data from L2, a nonpartisan political data firm.
These traditional Republican demographic advantages were canceled out, and in some cases reversed, by two new Democratic advantages. The low turnout among whites without a college degree bolstered Democrats in much of the country, allowing college-educated whites to make up a larger share of the electorate.
As a result, the voters who turned out in 2016 but stayed home in 2018 were more likely to approve of the president: He had around a 50 percent approval rating among those nonvoters in Times/Siena data.
The increase in turnout among the young in 2018 came overwhelmingly from anti-Trump voters, giving the Democrats a wide advantage among voters under age 45. The advantage was largest among those 18 to 24: The president's approval rating was 28 percent for voters in that group, and 45 percent among those who stayed home.
It's important to emphasize that the Times/Siena data is not representative of the country. The 2018 battleground districts were disproportionately white, well educated and Republican-leaning. Urban areas were almost entirely unrepresented, and black voters were underrepresented as well.
After accounting for the differences between the battlegrounds and the country, the Republicans held a narrow turnout advantage on a national scale. The fundamental turnout shifts were similar, but the lower turnout among nonwhite voters hurt the Democrats more nationwide than it did in the relatively white battleground districts.
Over all, the president's approval rating was 45.3 percent among registered voters and 45.7 percent among likely voters, according to our estimates, based on national voter file data, the Times/Siena polling and a district-by-district estimate of the president's approval rating based on national election surveys.
The opportunity for Democrats, however small, is fairly clear here: It's reasonable to assume higher turnout would draw from a pool of voters who are relatively likely to disapprove of the president.
The opportunity for Republicans is somewhat more subtle, but clear as well. The voters who turned out in 2016, but stayed home in 2018, were relatively favorable to Mr. Trump, and they're presumably more likely to join the electorate than those who turned out in neither election. In a high-turnout election, these Trump supporters could turn out at a higher rate than the more Democratic group of voters who didn't vote in either election, potentially shifting the electorate toward the president.
Those who aren't registered but still might vote
A high-turnout election would draw from another group of voters: those who aren't yet registered.
These voters are hard to measure. They are underrepresented in public opinion surveys, and there's reason to wonder whether those who do take surveys are representative of those who don't. They are also less likely to hold opinions on current events, including on the president. (For ease of comparison, those without an opinion of the president have been excluded from measures of the president's approval rating.)
With those caveats in mind, the president's approval rating among nonregistered voters stood at just 37 percent in an Upshot compilation of 12 surveys, conducted between December 2017 and September 2018, by the Pew Research Center and the Kaiser Family Foundation. Mr. Trump's approval rating was at 43 percent among registered voters in the same collection of surveys.
The data includes over 14,000 registered voters and nearly 3,200 voters who aren't registered, allowing for a fairly detailed analysis and comparison of the groups.
The president's weakness among nonregistered voters is consistent with a long record of polling showing Democrats fare better among all adults than among registered voters, including in today's FiveThirtyEight averages.
The potential for Democrats is obvious. But in general, these figures -- and other polls comparing the adult and registered voter populations -- exaggerate the opportunity available to Democrats because they include noncitizens, who aren't eligible to vote.
People who aren't citizens represent 22 percent of the nonregistered adult population, according to the Current Population Survey, and they're very different demographically from citizens who aren't registered to vote.
Just 11 percent of noncitizens are white and non-Hispanic, compared with 59 percent of eligible but nonregistered voters. This means that the pool of potential but not-yet-registered voters is more white and non-Hispanic than it might appear.
And because the Pew/Kaiser data indicates that almost all President Trump's weakness among nonvoters is attributed to demographics -- that is, nonwhite people tend to like him less -- the political difference between registered and nonregistered voters shrinks considerably without noncitizens.
The uncertain consequences of higher turnout
Of course, not all eligible voters, or even all registered ones, will vote in 2020. It's impossible to guess just who will; either side could draw a relatively favorable group of voters to the polls.
Even if every single citizen were to turn out, the effect on the presidential race would not be clear. The president's approval rating would probably sink by around a point, compared with the 2018 electorate. But the effect on individual states could vary widely.
The major Democratic advantage among nonvoters, their ethnic diversity, would do little for Democrats in the Midwest, where the population is more white and where nonvoters are likelier to be working-class whites who appear to view the president relatively favorably. Democrats would gain more in the diverse but often less competitive states.
In the Times/Siena-based estimates, Democrats appeared to be at a turnout advantage in the Rust Belt in the midterms but at a disadvantage in the Sun Belt. The difference between the groups of states might seem small, but it is not. A hypothetical full-turnout election among registered voters would cut this difference in half, and a full-turnout election among all eligible voters might eliminate it entirely.
This is consistent with state-by-state surveys of adults, like a 2019 compilation of Gallup polling data that showed the president's approval ratings in Florida, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania all crowded together between 41 percent and 43 percent, a few points higher than the 40 percent he held nationwide in the poll.
The danger for Democrats is that higher turnout would do little to help them in the Electoral College if it did not improve their position in the crucial Midwestern battlegrounds. Higher turnout could even help the president there, where an outsize number of white working-class voters who back the president stayed home in 2018, potentially creating a larger split between the national vote and the Electoral College in 2020 than in 2016.
There's nothing about the composition of nonvoters that means a higher-turnout election would invariably make it easier for Democrats to win the presidency, or for Republicans to keep it.

Texto completo: Two African-American authorities on the history of Blacks in Mexico died within several weeks of each other. On June 20, Dr. Colin Palmer, whose book "Slaves of the White God: Blacks in Mexico, 1570-1650" established him not only as a leading historian on Blacks in Mexico but secured his place among those studying the African Diaspora, passed away. And last week, we learned that Lamont Muhammad, a local journalist who ventured to Mexico, had also joined the ancestors. Information about his passing is still coming in and later we will submit a longer obituary on the talented writer.
Dr. Palmer was 75 and began his ascent up the academic and intellectual ladder in the 1970s when Black Studies was being popularized. He joined the hundreds of activists and teachers who took on the mantle of Black Power and began influencing a generation of young followers, both inside and outside the classroom.
He was born Colin Alphonsous Palmer on March 23, 1944, in Lambs River, Jamaica. His father, Cecil, was an assistant superintendent of public works for Westmoreland, Jamaica, and his mother, Gladys, was the hometown postmistress.
In 1964, Colin earned a bachelor's degree at the University College of the West Indies at Mona Heights in nis native country. He had begun teaching secondary school when the University ofWisconsin offered him a graduate scholarship on a study he had started on a "comparative tropical history program." Two years later he completed his master's degree and in 1970 his Ph.D. in history from the university. His dissertation topic was the source of his first book on Blacks in Mexico, which he finished after overcoming a mountain of misinformation.
At the beginning of his research he was told that he was on "a wild goose chase," that Mexico had never imported slaves from Africa and that the "nation's peoples of African descent were relatively recent arrivals." Of course, Professor Palmer gave little heed to these conclusions, many of which had been disapproved by earlier scholars such as Ivan Van Sertima in his book "They Came Before Columbus" that was published almost simultaneously with his study. Several other Black scholars, including Kofi Wangara (Harold Lawrence) and a few prominent white historians had presented prior evidence of the African presence in Mexico and other parts of the New World.
Even so, as Professor Palmer focused his attention on Blacks in Mexico his research gradually began to draw a larger circumference on the African diaspora, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean. "To study early humankind is, in effect, to study this diaspora," he wrote in the magazine PERSPECTIVES ON HISTORY, although he acknowledged that "some scholars may argue, with considerable merit, that this early African exodus is so different in character from later movements and settlements that it should not be seen as constituting a phase of the diasporic process."
While his book on Mexico was generally praised, especially for his usage of primary documents and statistics, it was critiqued for lacking any new revelations on the free Black population in Mexico. Such admonishments were secondary to one of his propositions that Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to other parts of Africa and to India. The Atlantic Slave Trade, however, was among the key factors in his overall research.
Among his many teaching posts, his stint at Oakland University was from 1969 to 1980, at a time when Black Studies in higher education was at its apogee. In fact, he helped establish the African American Studies program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as well as serving as chair of the history department.
In 1994 he moved to the CUNY Graduate Center and by 2000 was the Dodge professor of History at Princeton University, where he taught until 2011. Students and residents in Harlem remember his tenure at :he Schomburg Center where from 2000 to 2012 he directed the Scholars in Resident Program. He may not have coined the term "African diaspora," but he became a leading proponent of the concept and "definitely brought a deeper, more nuanced understanding" of it, according to James H. Sweet, who worked with Colin and who is now the Vilas-Jartz professor of history at the University ofWisconsin
Professor Palmer was the recipient of many awards, including the Award for Scholarly Distinction from the University of North Carolina in 2018.
"He argued that the millions of African-descended peoples were united by a past based significantly on the struggles against racial oppression," Professor Sweet told a reporter at the New York Times, "and despite their cultural and political variations, diaspora peoples faced broadly similar historical challenges in realizing themselves.'
Professor Palmer was living in Yonkers and had traveled to Kingston to begin work on an interpretative history of his native country when he died.
He will be remembered for his singular research and his important conclusions as when he cited that 'Africa, in all of its cultural richness and diversity, remained very much alive :n the receiving societies as the various ethnic groups created new cultures and recreated their old ways as circumstances allowed," he wrote in an article for PERSPECTIVES ON HISTORY magazine in 1998. "Consequently, the study of the modern African diaspora, particularly the aspect of it that is associated with the Atlantic Slave Trade, cannot be justifiably separated from the study of the home continent." He also wrote well-regarded articles and books on Caribbean countries, including "Eric Williams and the Making of the Modern Caribbean" (20C6), about the historian and politician who led Trinidad and Tobago to independence.

Texto completo: Las grandes redadas en 10 ciudades programadas por agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) desataron el temor de inmigrantes, pero ante la cobertura mediática y las alertas enviadas por activistas, la agencia ha organizado pequeñas movilizaciones, en busca de objetivos específicos.
Sin embargo, como ocurre en otros operativos, es posible que “La Migra” detenga a otras personas en su camino a hallar a inmigrantes con órdenes de deportación.
“La administración ahora dice que planea llevar a cabo varias redadas de menor escala durante la próxima semana” , publicó The Atlantic, el cual destacó que los operativos serán en viviendas, donde los agentes aplican tácticas disuatorias o coercitivas.
“Los agentes de ICE ingresan a sus hogares mediante el uso de medios coercitivos, incluso forzando su entrada” , cita ese medio un reporte el Proyecto de Defensa de Inmigrantes. “Levantando sus armas, y amenazando con arrestar a todos en la casa”.
The New York Times y CNN habían confirmado que los grandes operativos de ICE anunciados por el presidente Donald Trump serían más discretos, debido a la cobertura mediática y para lograr sus objetivos.
Altos funcionarios del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) descartaron ofrecer detalles a los medios de comunicación sobre sus acciones, pero confirmaron que las motilizaciones continuarían.
“No esperaría una gran movilización que coincida con la histeria que hemos escuchado en los últimos días” , dijo el funcionario.
Los operativos están programados en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans, Nueva York y San Francisco , zonas donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
There are dozens of them on display at the Museum of Shoes for Bound Feet, not far from the town in China where my mother grew up: colorful, intricately embroidered cloth shoes that fit perfectly in the palm of your hand.
When I visited the museum in the southern Chinese province of Sichuan several years ago, I looked down at my big size 9 feet and felt a wave of gratitude that I had been spared the fate that had befallen my great-grandmother and generations of Chinese women before her. Because behind each pair of shoes was a lifetime of unimaginable pain, all in the name of shaping perfect little bound feet -- or "golden lotuses" as they were often called.
I thought back to that moment several months ago when I began reporting my recent article on how Chinese women have been losing ground. Living in Beijing, it is easy to see the progress that China has made in gender equality over the past century. Foot-binding has long been outlawed. Women in China are living longer than ever before. They excel in school, and now outnumber men at universities.
And in a society that for centuries held that a woman's place remained in the home, women now have a major presence in the work force -- one of the few positive legacies of China's repressive Mao era. While the number has been declining, 61 percent of working-age Chinese women participated in the labor force last year -- higher still than many countries, including the United States (56 percent) and Germany (55 percent.)
But in recent years, as the rest of the world seems to be making progress toward greater gender equality, however incremental, China has been backsliding.
As China correspondent for The New York Times, I write about the intersection of politics, culture and society in China. Together with my colleague, Zoe Mou, we began reaching out to Chinese women to hear their stories. I took the bullet train from Beijing to Tianjin to meet with Bella Wang. Over coffee, and then spicy roast fish, Ms. Wang talked excitedly about her love of Marvel movies and Michael B. Jordan. But her mood darkened as she told me about a "special agreement" her employer made her sign promising that she would not get pregnant in her first two years on the job.
When we spoke, Ms. Wang was counting down the days until her two years were up.
"I've been wanting to have a baby all along," she said. "But I haven't dared."
We traveled to a town outside of Shanghai to meet Sharon Shao, who graduated with a computer engineering degree from one of China's top universities. As is only befitting a math whiz, she picked us up at the train station in a white car with an "E = mc²" sticker plastered on the side. We found a private room in a teahouse where Ms. Shao, over several hours, alternated between anger and tears as she told us about her tumultuous relationship with her ex-husband. When she finally worked up the courage to divorce her husband, she said, she walked away with no claim to the apartment that she had helped pay for because, as is the case for millions of other Chinese women, her name was not on the deed.
"My friends always tell me to just keep quiet and move on," said Ms. Shao. "But I want to share my story so other women can learn from my mistakes."
By the end of our reporting, we had talked to dozens of women. I was stunned to find that nearly every woman we spoke with had a personal story to tell about egregious discrimination at the workplace or in the home.
One woman told me about how she dreamed every night of going back to work after she was forced out of a prestigious job when she had a child. Another woman said she wanted to leave her husband but was afraid because her name was not on the deed.
"If I divorce, I will lose everything," she said.
"The more I think about it," she added, "the more difficult it feels to escape this dead end."
But as is increasingly the case in China these days, very few were willing to go on the record. This has become the reality of reporting in an increasingly authoritarian country whose -- mostly male -- leaders are so obsessed with controlling the narrative that even videos depicting extramarital affairs are subject to government censorship.
I understood why many women didn't want to take the risk. Since China's leader, Xi Jinping, took power in 2012, we have seen the detention of feminist activists, a crackdown on the burgeoning #MeToo movement and the emergence of "female morality schools" in which women are made to scrub floors and are taught how to apologize to their husbands.
Despite the overwhelming pressures, Chinese women are finding ways to push back.
We saw a glimpse of their growing anger earlier this year on March 8, known as International Women's Day. In recent years, what is supposed to be a celebration of the women's rights movement has been co-opted by online retailers and transformed into a Black Friday-esque shopping holiday in China known as "Goddess Day."
That day, as women across China browsed online sales on cosmetics and sportswear, one female university student in Beijing walked up to two red Women's Day banners that had been dedicated to the "little fairy" women, channeling the infantilizing tone so often used in advertising aimed at women in China.
She lit the banners on fire.
Photos of the blaze quickly spread on social media before internet censors took them down. We tried reaching out to the student but she declined to talk to us. Later, after she was reprimanded by school administrators, she posted a message on her social media account to clarify her actions.
"Damn it, this day is not meant for consuming gender stereotypes," she wrote.
In a show of the simmering defiance that has quietly spread among women in China today, she concluded with the best non-apology apology that I have seen in a while: "There was indeed a lack of concern for safety when I set the fires so I apologize to my fellow students," she wrote. "I should have used scissors."

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - John Paul Stevens, the bow-tied, independent-thinking, Republican-nominated justice who unexpectedly emerged as the Supreme Court's leading liberal, died Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after suffering a stroke Monday. He was 99.
During nearly 35 years on the court, Stevens stood for the freedom and dignity of individuals, be they students or immigrants or prisoners. He acted to limit the death penalty, squelch official prayer in schools, establish gay rights, promote racial equality and preserve legal abortion. He protected the rights of crime suspects and illegal immigrants facing deportation.
He influenced fellow justices to give foreign terrorism suspects held for years at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base the right to plead for their release in U.S. courts.
Stevens served more than twice the average tenure for a justice, and was only the second to mark his 90th birthday on the high court. From his appointment by President Gerald Ford in 1975 through his retirement in June 2010, he shaped decisions that touched countless aspects of American life.
He remained an active writer and speaker into his late 90s, surprising some when he came out against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation following Kavanaugh's angry denial of sexual assault allegations. Stevens wrote an autobiography, "The Making of a Justice: My First 94 Years," that was released just after his 99th birthday in April 2019.
At first considered a centrist, Stevens came to be seen as a lion of liberalism. But he rejected that characterization.
"I don't think of myself as a liberal at all," Stevens told The New York Times in 2007. "I think as part of my general politics, I'm pretty darn conservative."
The way Stevens saw it, he held to the same ground, but the court had shifted steadily to the right over the decades, creating the illusion that he was moving leftward.
He did change his views on some issues, however. He morphed from a critic of affirmative action to a supporter, and came to believe the death penalty was wrong.
His legal reasoning was often described as unpredictable or idiosyncratic, especially in his early years on the court. He was a prolific writer of separate opinions laying out his own thinking, whether he agreed or disagreed with the majority's ruling. Yet Stevens didn't consider his methods novel. He tended toward a case-by-case approach, avoided sweeping judicial philosophies, and stayed mindful of precedent.
The white-haired Stevens, eyes often twinkling behind owlish glasses, was the picture of old-fashioned geniality on the court and off. He took an unusually courteous tone with lawyers arguing their cases, but he was no pushover. After his fellow justices fired off questions, Stevens would politely weigh in. "May I ask a question?" he'd ask gently, then quickly slice to the weakest point of a lawyer's argument.
Stevens was especially concerned with the plight of ordinary citizens up against the government or other powerful interests - a type of struggle he witnessed as a boy.
He voiced only one regret about his Supreme Court career: that he had supported reinstating the death penalty in 1976. More than three decades later, Stevens publicly declared his opposition to capital punishment, saying that years of bad court decisions had overlooked racial bias, favored prosecutors and otherwise undermined his expectation that death sentences could be handed down fairly.
One of his harshest dissents came when the court lifted restrictions on spending by corporations and unions to sway elections. He called the 2010 ruling "a rejection of the common sense of the American people" and a threat to democracy.
As he read parts of that opinion aloud, Stevens' voice wavered uncharacteristically and he repeatedly stumbled over words. For the 90-year-old who'd worried he wouldn't know when to bow out, it was a signal. "That was the day I decided to resign," Stevens said later. He also disclosed in his autobiography that he had suffered a mini-stroke.
The retirement of Stevens, known as a defender of strict separation of church and state, notably left the high court without a single Protestant member for the first time.
"I guess I'm the last WASP," he joked, saying the issue was irrelevant to the justices' work. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court in 2017, was raised Catholic, but attends a Protestant church.
A great-grandfather, Stevens eased into an active retirement of writing and speaking, still fit for swimming and tennis in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his second wife, Maryan, kept a home away from Washington.
He is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth and Susan, nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Stevens' first wife, Elizabeth, second wife, Maryan, and two children died before him.

Colorscape officials defend Yarrow removal

Texto completo: In the days after organizers of the Colorscape Chenango Arts Festival in Norwich announced its decision to pull folk singer Peter Yarrow from its main stage lineup — citing reaction on social media about his 1970 jail sentence for "indecent liberties" with a minor — the small-town festival found itself in the national spotlight.
On Tuesday, Colorscape organizers released an online statement on the festival's website to defend and provide further context to Yarrow's removal.
"The decision to remove Peter Yarrow from the Colorscape lineup had nothing to do with forgiveness or lack thereof, or the presidential pardon of a conviction, or a presumed attempt to punish him further, or the fact that there are youthful indiscretions in every generation," the statement begins. "It's about what's happening in the present."
Yarrow, part of the legendary folk group Peter, Paul and Mary, weighed in on the decision, telling the New York Times in an emailed statement that he didn't believe the choice was "unfair or unjust" in an article published on July 4.
"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury — most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty," he said to the Times. "I do not seek to minimize or excuse what I have done and I cannot adequately express my apologies and sorrow for the pain and injury I have caused in this regard."
But he did add this: "However, beyond any of my words and feelings expressed, I will walk the walk, do all I can to make amends, and dedicate myself to helping bring more justice and peace to the world."
Many commenters on the New York Times' July 4 Facebook post containing the article opined that someone should not be punished for actions of 50 years ago, and it's time to forgive.
"There is a time to forgive and move on. This now elderly man has stood as a sign of peace and love his entire life," one comment read.
Yarrow was initially scheduled to perform on Sept. 8 along with performance painter Robert Channing. A replacement performer will be announced at a later date.
In 1970, Yarrow was sentenced to three months in jail after the incident in a Washington hotel room. In 1981, he was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter the day before he left office.
In Tuesday's statement, organizers said the decision was made to protect the artists who plan to participate in the festival. Removing Yarrow would also remove the possibility of having artists' work overshadowed by protesters who insist the festival "condones sexual abuse."
"Most of all, this choice has everything to do with the children and youth who are part of this community right now," the statement reads.
While organizers admit they don't think Yarrow would be a danger to festival guests, they fear the pushback would negatively impact the festival.
"Colorscape's regrets are sincere. We work daily to support the integrity of a festival with a long history of being focused solely on the arts, not politics," the statement reads. "We wanted our community to hear Yarrow's wonderful, legendary music. We wanted him to see small-town community arts organizing in action. We will always welcome visitors of all ages to a celebration of the arts."
Channing, who's been featured on "America's Got Talent," and world-champion slam poet Buddy Wakefield have previously been announced as headliners.
The free, two-day festival will be held Sept. 7 and 8 in the east and west parks of downtown Norwich. This year marks the festival's 25th anniversary.
More information can be found by downloading the Attendify app, available for free from the Apple Store and Google Play Store, or by visiting colorscape.org.
"Peter Yarrow will be missed at Colorscape, and we hope our participants and visitors understand," the statement concludes.

'Glamping' (that's luxury camping) goes mainstream

Texto completo: As more travelers indicate a desire to escape into nature - escapes that include gourmet dining and plush bedding - so-called glamping continues to grow in popularity.
A new report conducted by market research firm Arizron projects glamping, or luxury camping, revenues to grow steadily in the next five years, reaching an estimated $1 billion by 2024. The report also noted that the newly founded American Glamping Association signals the industry's migration to the mainstream.
In an attempt to satisfy this growing need, hospitality companies are continuing to create low-impact tented camps around the world that reconnect travelers with the great outdoors in comfort and style.
United States
The American Glamping Association was founded by Sarah Dusek, co-founder and chief executive of Under Canvas, an adventure-hospitality company operating eight eco-conscious rented camps adjacent to national parks.
"Our camps have become infinitely more immersive with designer furnishings, more adventure activities, wellness programs and an elevated culinary offering," Dusek said.
With online bookings more than doubling year over year, the company will add 15 camps to keep up with demand. Under Canvas Yosemite is among those new offerings, debuting as a pop-up this fall. Next spring, expect 90 safari inspired tents scattered among 85 acres of Sequoia forest, just 15 minutes from the park's entrance.
Most tents are outfitted with king beds, wood-burning stoves and en suite bathrooms with hot showers. Using 80% less water and energy than a similarly sized hotel, the company strives to leave the land as untouched as possible. "We aim to be zero-waste by 2021," Dusek said.
The camp will operate seasonally from April to November. Prices start at $189 for basic safari tents with communal bathrooms.
Costa Rica
"Travelers have shifted away from amassing material possessions and toward collecting life-altering, perspective-changing experiences," said Luca Franco, chief executive of Luxury Frontiers, a design firm specializing in top-quality tented camps.
The company is partnering with Nayara Resorts in northwest Costa Rica to develop 29 family-friendly tents overlooking spectacular views of Arenal Volcano. They will launch this December alongside two of the brand's existing properties, Nayara Springs and Nayara Spa, Resort & Gardens.
Constructed on roughly 1,500-square-foot stilted platforms to minimize the camp's footprint, each tent contains open-air living areas and plunge pools with mineral water sourced from nearby hot springs.
"By omitting the tent's fourth wall, our guests are fully immersed in nature," said Leo Ghitis, owner of Nayara Resorts. "They sleep to the sounds of the rainforest."
Rates, from $1,200 per tent per night, include free daily breakfast and morning yoga.
Bolivia
Swiss-based outfitter Amazing Escapes was tapped by the indigenous Jirira community in Bolivia's Altiplano region to build a sustainable tented camp atop the Uyuni Salt Flats, at the foot of the Tunupa volcano.
"Our challenge was to make the camp completely 'clean'," said Paul Kennes, the company's chief executive. Kachi Lodge opened in May, with six geodesic domes powered predominantly by solar energy. The domes have closed-loop water systems, incinerating toilets, local artwork and access to a culinary partnership with the famed La Paz restaurant, Gustu.
"The menu is entirely local and seasonal, including an impressive selection of Bolivian wines," Kennes said.
Prices begin at $1,980 per person based on double occupancy for a minimum two-night stay, and include airport transfers, guided activities and full board.
Rwanda
Wilderness Safaris' new environmentally responsible Magashi Camp opened in May, on the continent that pioneered the tented-camp experience.
"Established in partnership with the Rwanda Development Board and nonprofit conservation organization, African Parks, our core purpose is to conserve Rwanda's diverse savannah ecosystem and threatened species," said Ingrid Baas, general manager of the camp.
Six tented guest rooms are set on a lakeside perch in Akagera National Park - a scenic patchwork of riverine woodlands, papyrus marshes and low-lying mountains - where guests enjoy a parade of wildlife including leopards, elephants, zebras and giraffes. Lions and Eastern black rhinos, which were reintroduced to the reserve in recent years, are also at the park.
Starting rates from $470 per person per night are based on full-board and double occupancy, and include taxes, activities, park fees and laundry.
Australia
Rottnest Island, a car-free nature reserve off the coast of Perth that is popular for its white sand beaches, recently welcomed Discovery Rottnest Island. The retreat, the island's first new lodging in 30 years, comprises 83 high-grade canvas tents tucked behind the dunes of Pinky Beach.
"We have accommodation options to suit all types of travelers, ranging from budget-friendly tents to deluxe family lodgings with kitchenettes and ocean views," said Grant Wilckens, chief executive of Discovery Holiday Parks.
On the property, guests can spot rock parrots and native quokkas, friendly marsupials regarded as "the world's happiest animal."
"We created a tented camp experience so travelers could embrace nature, disconnect from the world and create memories with loved ones," Wilckens said.
Rates from $119 per night for a standard tent based on double occupancy during low season in July and August.

E.U. Officials Say Iran Breaches Are Still Not Major

Texto completo: BRUSSELS -- Scrambling to save the nuclear agreement with Iran, European foreign ministers declared Monday that Iranian breaches so far were not serious enough to take steps that could lead to reimposed international sanctions and a collapse of the accord.
That conclusion, reached at a meeting in Brussels, effectively extended a lifeline for the 2015 nuclear agreement in defiance of pressure by the Trump administration. The agreement has been increasingly imperiled since the United States abandoned the accord more than a year ago and renewed its own sanctions on Iran.
The European Union ministers reiterated their view that the agreement was the only option for curbing Iran's nuclear program.
In recent weeks Iran has exceeded the amount and purity of the uranium it is permitted under the accord, transgressions confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Iranians have said they intend to breach the limits even more unless they get what the accord promised Iran: economic relief.
Triggering the dispute-resolution article in the accord would start a process that could lead to the restoration of all the sanctions placed on Iran. That, many analysts say, would almost certainly would doom the agreement.
The European reluctance to use the provision came despite pressure from both the United States and Israel, which say Iran's breaches are a signal of the country's intent to move toward the capacity to make an atomic bomb. Under the accord, Iran has vowed to never seek such a weapon.
"For the time being, none of the parties to the agreement has signaled their intention to invoke this article," Federica Mogherini, the European Union's top foreign policy official, told a news conference after the foreign ministers meeting in Brussels.
Ms. Mogherini said that "none of them, for the moment, for the time being, with the current data we have had" believe that there has been "significant noncompliance."
The conclusion was quickly denounced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whose government regards Iran as the country's most serious security threat.
"The European Union's response to Iranian violations reminds me of the European appeasement of the 1930s," Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement reported by Israeli news media. "There are probably some in Europe who will not wake up until Iranian missiles fall on European soil. Then it probably will be too late."
Ms. Mogherini, echoing the view of the meeting's participants, said that the nuclear deal was still the only available option.
"The deal has avoided Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and today everyone recognizes that there is no alternative," she said. "This is the most dramatic and difficult stage."
Jeremy Hunt, Britain's foreign secretary, said he saw little time left to save the deal.
"Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear bomb," Mr. Hunt said. "There is still some closing, but small window to keep the deal alive."
The European participants in the deal -- Britain, France and Germany -- issued a joint statement Sunday evening that said they were still committed to it. They expressed regret that the United States had reimposed sanctions on Iran "even though that country had implemented its commitments under the agreement."
"We believe that the time has come to act responsibly and to seek ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue," the three countries said in the statement.
But the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that he saw little reason to be optimistic that the Europeans could save the agreement -- known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- by alleviating the punishing effects of American sanctions against Iran.
"The Europeans claim they were willing to maintain the J.C.P.O.A., but we have not seen Europe yet to be ready for an investment," he said on Sunday after arriving in New York for a meeting of the United Nations, Iran's state-run Press TV reported.
Mr. Zarif, who was educated in the United States, speaks colloquial English and has extensive contacts in Western media and foreign policy circles, has long vexed the Trump administration, which accuses him of spreading lies. It has considered placing sanctions on Mr. Zarif, a move that would sever an important diplomatic conduit with the United States.
In a sign of the antipathy, administration officials granted Mr. Zarif a restrictive visa that limits him to the United Nations headquarters, the Iranian Mission and the Iranian ambassador's residence.
"They are worried about Mr. Zarif's influential work trips and his media interviews, and the impact it will have on American public opinion," said Seyed Abbas Mousavi, an Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman.
[Here are excerpt from an interview Mr. Zarif gave The New York Times in which he discussed the deal.]
Iran has sent mixed signals about its intentions in recent days, with President Hassan Rouhani expressing a willingness to open new talks with Washington -- once sanctions are removed.
"We are always ready for negotiation," he said in a televised speech. "The moment you stop sanctions and bullying, we are ready to negotiate."
But a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said Monday that unless Europe could salvage the deal, his country would return its nuclear program to its status before the accord. Its uranium stockpile was much larger then, and some was much more highly enriched.
Tensions with Tehran have intensified since President Trump withdrew the United States from the accord in May 2018 and reimposed American economic sanctions that had been lifted under the deal. Mr. Trump imposed additional sanctions this year, trying to stop Iran's ability to sell oil, a pillar of its economy.
Britain, France and Germany have made a commitment to ease the impact of American sanctions, but so far have not found an effective way.
The centerpiece of their efforts is the creation of a kind of exchange that would allow European companies to do business with Iran in a way that bypasses the American banking system. Tehran has said that the system, known as Instex, is inadequate.
Arriving at the meeting of Europeans on Monday, Josep Borrell, the Spanish foreign minister and nominee to become the European Union's foreign affairs chief, said, "We will do what we can to guarantee that there is no economic embargo against Iran and that European companies can continue working there."
"It's very difficult because U.S. laws applied in an extraterritorial manner, in a way that we don't recognize, make it difficult," he said, adding that Spain would join the Instex mechanism.
Despite the renewed American sanctions, Iran complied with its commitments under the nuclear deal for a year after Mr. Trump's withdrawal. But the confrontation has escalated since the American president imposed further sanctions.
Iran warned that it would stop complying with the deal's caps on its enriched uranium stockpile unless the Europeans made good on their promises. The European countries were unable to deliver, and Iran surpassed the limits this month.
In May and June, six tankers were damaged near the Strait of Hormuz, the vital waterway that carries much of the world's oil, and American officials said the ships had been attacked by Iran.
Last month, Iran shot down a United States surveillance drone, which American officials said was over international waters but which Tehran said had violated Iranian airspace. Mr. Trump ordered a military strike in retaliation, but then retracted the order.
This month, the British authorities seized an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar that they said was carrying oil to Syria, in violation of European Union sanctions on that country. Days later, London said that one of its naval ships had to chase away three Iranian boats that had been trying to impede a British tanker.
Britain offered on Saturday to return the Iranian ship if the oil were sent somewhere other than Syria.

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

Fear remains high under threat of ICE raids

Texto completo: The federal government appeared to hold back Sunday on a mass enforcement operation targeting undocumented immigrants in South Florida and other communities across the country.
Immigration advocates monitoring the situation had not received any confirmed reports of mass arrests in South Florida, but they said fear remained high amid threats of a crackdown from President Donald Trump.
"People are relating it to a hurricane, stocking up with water and trying to stay in their houses," said Laura Muñoz, hotline director for the Florida Immigrant Coalition. "Immigrant areas that are bustling on Sundays are pretty much dead today. People don't want to leave their houses."
The operation was originally scheduled for late June, but it was postponed amid a backlash from Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates. Trump said Friday the show of force would start on Sunday.
The enforcement action by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is said to target migrants who have received final deportation orders but have not left the country. Other cities expected to be targeted in the raids were Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. New Orleans was also a reported target, but ICE announced that it would halt operations to allow residents to recover from Hurricane Barry.
Boca Raton-based immigration attorney Brian Becker said ICE was focusing on immigrants with recent orders of deportation, including those who were issued deportation orders after they didn't appear in court.
He said others, though, could also be detained if they come into contact with ICE agents.
Immigration advocates have been canvassing communities and telling people they don't have to respond if agents knock unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge.
Citing unnamed current and former Department of Homeland Security officials, The New York Times reported that a last-minute change was made to focus on smaller operations that will be conducted in coming days.
Maria Bilbao, Florida organizer for the immigrant group United We Dream, said advocates are still on guard even though mass raids did not materialize Sunday.
"It is going to happen, but we don't know when," she said. "People need to be ready. They need to be prepared."
Smaller operations were reported across the country Sunday. Immigration advocates in South Florida received unconfirmed reports of immigration agents knocking on doors in Sweetwater and Key West.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Saturday that he had been receiving reports of "attempted but reportedly unsuccessful ICE enforcement actions in Sunset Park (Brooklyn) and Harlem." ICE also conducted raids in San Diego, arresting 20 in a "week-long surge targeting criminal aliens and immigration fugitives with final orders (of deportation)," according to an ICE press release issued Friday.
The nationwide crackdown was previously scheduled for late June, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi intervened and asked for more time for Congress to create new immigration policy. However, Congress was unable to make a decision by the July deadline.
An estimated 656,000 undocumented immigrants live in Florida, according to a 2016 estimate by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
Of that total, an estimated 326,000 were living in South Florida, with 156,000 in Miami-Dade, 98,000 in Broward County and 72,000 in Palm Beach County.
About 74,548 pending immigration cases exist in Florida, according to the TRAC Immigration Project. Only 0.7% of these cases stem from criminal or terrorism charges.
In Florida, the average wait time for one immigrant's case to be completed is 508 days. ICE has detention centers in Moore Haven, Pompano Beach and Miami.
The threatened raids come at a time when immigration is dominating political debate in Washington and in Tallahassee.
A center for housing more than 2,500 migrant teenagers in Homestead has emerged as a campaign stop for Democratic presidential hopefuls.
At Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' request, Florida passed a law banning so-called sanctuary cities that offer protections to undocumented residents.
No sanctuary cities exist in Florida, but Republican lawmakers argued the law was needed to ensure communities would fully comply with federal immigration authorities.

Texto completo: Deodorant donation
Procter & Gamble, a sponsor of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, is now supporting its members' fight for equal pay.
The company, which supports U.S. soccer through its Secret deodorant brand, says it will donate $529,000 – $23,000 for each of the 23 players on the U.S. team that won the World Cup earlier this month – to help close the pay gap. The sponsor took out a full-page ad printed in The New York Times on Sunday urging the U.S. Soccer Federation to “be on the right side of history.”
“Let's take this moment of celebration to propel women's sports forward,” Secret says in the ad. “We urge the US Soccer Federation to be a beacon of strength and end gender pay inequality once and for all.”
In March, 28 members of the USWNT sued the US Soccer Federation for alleged gender discrimination. The suit claims the federation pays the women less than members of the men's national team.

Odd Couples Pairing Up Against Tech

Texto completo: It was not a given that Steve Hilton, the conservative Fox News host, and Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who worked in the Obama White House, would get along.
But when they met by chance at a cocktail party in Washington last year, they quickly landed on one surprisingly strong point of agreement: It was time to break up Big Tech.
"We thought the same way," Mr. Hilton said.
Mr. Wu, who is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, agreed. "There's unusual constituencies arising," he said. He later went on Mr. Hilton's show, "The Next Revolution," for a congenial interview.
The antitrust movement has been revived by a bipartisan loathing of Big Tech that extends beyond lawmakers to the furthest firmaments of the right and the left.
On one side is the progressive left, whose members have been appalled by Facebook's handling of pro-Trump Russian disinformation campaigns and Silicon Valley's consolidated power. On the other side is the Trumpist right, whose members see the power of social media companies to ban content as censorship and worry that the arteries of communication are controlled by young liberals.
The common cause has made for some strange new bedfellows. The left and the right now often have similar anti-tech talking points on cable news and at congressional hearings. Conservatives are showing up at largely liberal conferences, while liberals are going on conservative TV shows.
On Tuesday, that alignment will be evident at an antitrust hearing on Capitol Hill featuring executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, as well as policy experts like Mr. Wu. The hearing, held by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, will examine "the impact of market power of online platforms on innovation and entrepreneurship."
"To the bewilderment of many observers, the ascendant pressures for antitrust reforms are flowing from both wings of the political spectrum," Daniel A. Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote last year in a paper called "Antitrust's Unconventional Politics."
Now those who have found mutual understanding need to figure out if they can actually get along.
It is not easy. Often, it is awkward.
"I think we should be skeptical," said Sabeel Rahman, the president of the progressive think tank Demos and an associate law professor at Brooklyn Law School. "What are the coalitions that we ought to embrace? Who's the we?"
Mr. Rahman said that he was wary of these new conservative allies and that progressives in the movement needed to be cautious. Yes, they both want to take power out of the hands of large tech companies -- but then the two sides have to agree on whose hands that power falls into.
"How do we operationalize this? Who's doing the moderating? Are these new allies coming in good faith?" Mr. Rahman asked. "The devil's in the details."
The detail here is who exactly should be in charge of a company like Facebook, if it is not Mark Zuckerberg. The two sides may both want third-party ombudsmen of some sort, but agreement seems to fall apart beyond that.
"Most people getting involved haven't really gamed out what this means," said Katy Glenn Bass, the research director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, an advocacy group for free speech.
Regulation of online speech is not exclusively an antitrust concern, but today these threads are becoming interwoven. Critics argue that big tech companies need to be broken up or regulated because they are suppressing speech.
Ms. Bass, who is organizing a Knight Institute symposium in October on tech giants, monopoly power and public discourse, said she worried that popular enthusiasm for aggressive regulation of speech on the platforms could get out of hand. She worries that now arguments for moderating speech are coming from groups that once stood against government intervention.
"The idea that these platforms should be pretty tightly regulated on what speech they can host is not a traditional conservative argument," Ms. Bass said. "This has all been a real whiplash."
A case in point: On Thursday, The Washington Post published an essay by Charlie Kirk, the president of Turning Point USA, a group for young conservatives, proposing that digital platforms be regulated the way publishers are.
"Fighting back against private companies with governmental action is a politically and ideologically fraught idea for those of us on the right," he wrote. But he went on to add, "There is now ample reason to believe the market's normal corrective powers are being blocked by anti-competitive forces."
Traditional conservatives said they were feeling the whiplash. James Pethokoukis, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-market think tank, was at a party this spring that included Republican donors in Washington when the conversation took a turn toward big tech companies.
"They were talking about breaking them up, turning them into utilities," Mr. Pethokoukis said. "It's a breathtaking change from even a year ago."
He was shocked. To him these companies were American jewels and some of the best bulwarks against rising power abroad. He has since been writing against the movement with pieces like "The Astonishingly Weak Antitrust Case Against Facebook, Google, and Amazon."
Tech bias has been a longtime concern for the right, and Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, frequently mentioned it. Little came of it.
Now the movement is finding more mainstream allies. Mr. Kirk and others who have complained of an anti-conservative bias by Facebook, Google and Twitter attended a social media summit at the White House on Thursday. At the event, Mr. Trump accused the companies of exhibiting "terrible bias" and said he was calling representatives from all of them to the White House over the next month.
On Friday, Mr. Trump took the tech companies to task again, calling them "crooked" and "dishonest" and adding that "something is going to be done."
"In my circles right now," Mr. Pethokoukis said, "if you say, 'I don't think we're seeing systemic bias against conservatives,' it's like they wonder about your sanity."
Matt Stoller, a former Democratic congressional staff member who is now at the antimonopoly think tank Open Markets Institute, which leans liberal, said he noticed the same thing.
"The white supremacists liked to appropriate this language around antimonopoly and free speech," said Mr. Stoller, who has written a book on the antimonopoly movement, "Goliath." "But now there are real networks on the right that are not white supremacist networks, and the people in them are genuinely concerned about the power of Big Tech."
He said he was having to reassess his relationships with conservatives.
"I always knew we were aiming at different things," he said. "Now, we have some of the same goals."
And so they are building wary coalitions. Mr. Wu said he was working on a movement of state attorneys general to take the antitrust fight to individual courtrooms across the country. The most eager allies are Republicans, he said.
Mr. Hilton, a former British political adviser, built his Fox News show in 2017 around what he predicted would be an anti-elitist populism movement. The 2016 presidential election was just the start, he figured. But the rallying cries fizzled out, and party lines remained unchanged.
Today, he sees a bright spot: the shared antipathy for big tech companies.
"Three years on, it looks like the only remnant of that is this antitrust issue and, if we're really specific about it, anti-Big Tech," Mr. Hilton said.
On Mr. Hilton's show, Mr. Wu argued for breaking up Facebook by forcing its two other popular apps -- Instagram and WhatsApp -- to be spun off.
But Mr. Wu worried about being seen as having a friendly chat on Fox News and felt uncomfortable sharing his appearance on the show with his mostly liberal followers.
"I didn't publicize it a great deal," he said. "I took a selfie. But then I decided not to broadcast it."

Texto completo: A Koch Industries executive was told he could not leave China. An ex-diplomat who helped organize a technology forum in Beijing was hassled by authorities who wanted to question him. An industry group developed contingency plans in case its offices were raided and computer servers were seized.
Business executives, Washington officials and other frequent visitors to China who were interviewed by The New York Times expressed increasing alarm about the Chinese authorities' harassment of Americans by holding them for questioning and preventing them from leaving the country.
They worry that trade tensions between Washington and Beijing could turn businesspeople and former officials into potential targets. Some companies are reviewing or beefing up their plans in case one of their employees faces problems, three people said.
Many of the more than a dozen people interviewed by The Times asked for anonymity because they feared reprisals from the Chinese authorities.
"In a very not-so-subtle manner, the Chinese government has upped the ante by detaining Americans at the borders and at their hotels, and with the obvious intent to send a message to the Trump administration that they can engage in hostage diplomacy if push comes to shove," said James Zimmerman, a partner in the Beijing office of the law firm Perkins Coie, which works with U.S. companies in China.
"If they go in that direction, this would not be received well by the American business community, which puts at risk billions of dollars of investment in China," he said.
The problems escalated after Canadian officials arrested an executive of Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, at the behest of U.S. officials. China then detained a Canadian businessman and a former diplomat.
The fear spreading through the U.S. business community highlights how fraught ties between the world's two largest economies have become. Although President Donald Trump and China's president, Xi Jinping, have agreed to restart trade talks, which broke off in May, the two sides remain far apart on the most contentious issues.
Many U.S. business figures still come and go without major incident. Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, was offered permanent residency by Li Keqiang, China's premier, after he visited China in January to open a factory.
Still, a number of recent run-ins with the authorities have prompted broader worries. In late June, one U.S. industry group sent an email to its members detailing how it was trying to mitigate its own risks.
"Foreign staff in particular have reported a high level of anxiety about the current environment," it said in the message, which was reviewed by The Times. It said it was "in the process of finalizing a detailed crisis plan to be used in the event that one of our offices is raided and/or one of our staff is detained."
Those plans included a procedure if its servers were seized. It also said it had reviewed insurance policies to ensure that staff evacuations were covered, and it recommended that workers not travel to sensitive parts of China.
In early June, a Chinese American executive at Koch Industries, the conglomerate owned by conservative billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, was told he could not leave the immediate vicinity of his hotel in southern China, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. He was then interrogated for multiple days, with the discussion hitting on the trade war and souring relations between the United States and China.
While the authorities told the man that he would not be allowed to leave China, they did not take his passport. After the State Department intervened, tensions subsided and he was able to fly out of the country, the people added.
Given some of the discussion, two of the people with knowledge of the episode involving the Koch Industries executive said they believed it was an attempt to send a message to Trump.

Joe Biden, closet Republican

Texto completo: It didn't come to me right away, but finally I recognized the model for Joe Biden's unusual campaign, the former president whose pitch Biden's most closely resembles:
George W. Bush.
I'm referring to Bush's first presidential bid, in 2000, which is remembered mostly for its surreal climax: the seesawing returns on election night, the Florida recount, the Supreme Court ruling that effectively decided the contest in his favor. To the limited extent that political junkies recall his slogans and stump speeches, the phrase "compassionate conservative" comes quickest to mind.
But Bush's strategy and success arguably hinged less on selling himself as a new kind of Republican than on being seen as a tested, trusted, traditional brand. His surname did much of that work, and he augmented it with a sustained oratorical emphasis on propriety. He pledged to "restore honor and integrity" to the White House in the wake of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and subsequent impeachment.
Biden's core promise is to end the much greater melodrama and expunge the infinitely darker shame of Donald Trump's presidency, also by returning to what preceded it: Barack Obama's administration.
Obviously there are big, glaring differences between Biden and Bush, and not just ideologically.
But Biden isn't exactly campaigning on his three and a half decades in the Senate, not when you consider all the chapters - his fury over busing, his treatment of Anita Hill, the crime bill, the invasion of Iraq - that he wishes voters wouldn't dwell on.
No, Biden is campaigning on his eight years as vice president. He's also campaigning on the nostalgia of his surname, the familiarity of his presence and the comfort of his aura.
The last two Democrats to win the presidency, Clinton and Obama, didn't take a tack anything like Biden's. Clinton was the man from Hope, Arkansas, who was determined to give liberalism a modern makeover and set the Democratic Party on a more profitable course. Obama was hope and change - not to mention the audacity of hope .
Both men were under 50 when they attained the presidency, and both were in keeping with the Democratic Party's flattering (and not quite accurate) image of itself, from John F. Kennedy onward, as youthful, innovative, visionary, trailblazing. But Biden, 76, isn't about exploring uncharted paths. He's about following breadcrumbs back to where we lost our way.
This isn't a bad thing. It's a Trump thing. For many Democrats, Biden included, the insult of Trump is so immense and the threat that he poses so profound that 2020 isn't a year for experiments and idealism. It's a year for survival.
And from that mindset springs Biden's campaign, drab in the abstract but unorthodox in the context of Democratic proclivity and precedent.
Unorthodox in respect to his rivals, too.
Bernie Sanders, with his call for Democratic socialism; Kamala Harris, with her intensifying emphasis on racial disparities; Elizabeth Warren, with her encyclopedia of plans; Pete Buttigieg, with his husband and his mere 37 years on Earth - the election of any one of them would be a bold statement, a milestone.
Biden, in contrast, is trying to get Democrats to do something that Republicans have more practice at: choose a nominee who's due over one who's new.
He has his raft of policy positions - many of them echoes or adaptations of Obama's - but they're not what his supporters think of first. They're not what he thinks of first, either.
That was clear inhis recent interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo. Asked about Harris' attack on his civil rights record, he signaled surprise and hurt.
"She knows me," he protested.
A few beats later: "The American people think they know me and they know me."
And one more time, during that same 30-second span: "People know who I am."
That's the message. It might as well be the bumper sticker. At most other junctures, it would be fatally underwhelming. At this one, there's no telling.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump was criticized Sunday for playing into old racist tropes after he posted tweets calling on an unspecified group of Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to where they came from.
"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.
"Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!" the president said in three connected tweets.
The tweets come on the day a series of immigration raids are expected to begin across the country. It's part of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The cities targeted are Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco.
Many presumed Trump's tweets were directed at the four liberal freshman congresswomen known as "the Squad": Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib. Three of those four lawmakers were born in the U. S. Omar came to the United States as a refugee from Somalia more than 20 years ago.
The four House members have recently had some public squabbles with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , for her support for a bill funding border security measures and comments Pelosi made about their disagreements in a New York Times interview.
Pelosi said Sunday that she rejects Trump's "xenophobic comments meant to divide our nation" and said they reaffirm that "his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. "
"Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power," she said.
Arizonans respond
Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, responded with a Twitter thread of his own.
"Growing up I used to hear “go back to Mexico” from many kids, though I was born in the USA. I thought then that it was just kids . . . I joined the Marine Corps. Fought in some of the hardest battles and still carry the mental scars. I return to Arizona and I am told again to return to Mexico," he wrote. "To people like Trump I will never be American enough. So if you wonder why I give no inch to these racists, now you know. Nothing will ever satisfy them, all we can do is stop them. "
Former U. S. Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, tweeted a brief response to a story on Trump's statement.
"We're all Americans, Mr President," he wrote.
Meghan McCain, daughter of former Republican U. S. Sen. John McCain called Trump's comments "racist" in a tweet of her own.
"This is racist. And I see Trump people are trying to spin this to just be about Rep. Omar, but we all know that’s a lie. But even if it were just about Rep. Omar, it would still be racist. We don’t tell people we’ve welcomed into this country to 'go back,' " she wrote.
"But you don't expect to hear it from the president of the United States," said de Blasio, who is one of two dozen Democrats running to unseat Trump in 2020.
De Blasio said that rather than trying to "make America great again," Trump was trying to "make America hate again" and divide the nation for political gain, which he called "the most unpresidential thing possible. "
The New York mayor tied Trump's tweets to the deportation raids being conducted by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency this weekend saying, "it is all one political strategy, to keep people divided to the maximum extent possible" and "gin up his base. "
Connecting tweets, immigration policies
Pelosi also made a connection between the tweets and Trump's immigration policies.
"Rather than attack Members of Congress, he should work with us for humane immigration policy that reflects American values,Stop the raids - #FamiliesBelongTogether!
The four congresswomen have been frequent targets by some conservative media figures, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who last week called Omar "living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country. "
Trump's tweets had echoes of Carlson's criticisms of Omar, who accused her of not being "grateful" for being welcomed into the U. S. and of instead having "undisguised contempt for the United States and for its people. "
More: Ilhan Omar calls Tucker Carlson 'racist fool' after he says she proves 'immigration has become dangerous'
Ryan Saavedra, a reporter for the conservative Daily Wire, also assumed Trump was referring to Omar, and took amusement in the president's tweet.
"LOL, Trump is telling Ilhan Omar to go back to Somalia," Saavedra said.
Politico reporter Alex Thompson shared a clip of the hosts on "Fox & Friends" laughing in response to Trump tweets, saying Trump was feeling "very comedic today. "
But many more voices on social media did not find humor in the president's tweets.

America is greater than 'just okay'

Texto completo: Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country.
Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America -- except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America.
And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea -- the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 -- just two decades ago -- that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.'"
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world.
Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: By the time servers arrived at our gazebo bearing billowy, sugar-tossed doughnuts beached on a dense daub of macerated rhubarb and strawberries - a mid-June version of chef Jason Williams's signature dessert at The Well at Jordan's Farm - my guests and I had nearly forgotten where we were.
Still smelling of woodsmoke from the crackling fire pit and laughing about how much we had eaten over the past 31/2 hours, the six of us felt comfortable, at home. Perhaps not our own home, but someplace snug and familiar - I came within a few seconds of asking if I could help with the dishes.
For Williams, creating an intimate atmosphere is an important part of his plan. "I want The Well to be a relaxing place where you can spend a night out with friends or your family," he said. "You're close to the city in Cape Elizabeth, but once you're on the farm, inside one of the gazebos, you feel like you're far away."
Not that Portland generates much big-city bustle to escape, but The Well and its surroundings genuinely do feel like a remote getaway hundreds of miles away from the nearest traffic jam.
Now well into its 10th season of nearly sold-out dinners, The Well has instituted some changes since our then-critic awarded it 3.5 stars in 2012, alterations that should help ensure the restaurant's long-term survival (as well as preserve Williams's sanity). One took place in 2015, when the restaurant began serving a three-course, family-style meal ($75 per person, including tax and gratuity) for parties of six or more.
It's true that these meals are less sexy than The Well's soignÃ©e Ã  la carte dishes or its plated, five-course chef's menu ($85 per person). Those are the items you may be familiar with, because nearly every review of The Well focuses on its Instagram-ready tasting menu - which makes sense when your aim is to entice affluent diners from New York and Boston out for a bucolic evening on a working farm.
But those guests are missing out on the real heart of The Well.
"The gazebos are so nice for groups to get together. They're a special spot for family vacations or big groups who know their plans in advance," Williams said. "And they mean we can offer something for everyone from super high-end foodies to people who work in the field. At the end of the day, (the kitchen) is a trailer, so I try not to take it too seriously!"
So when you sit down for the family-style meal, servers top-heavy with shareable platters will nudge open the creaky screen door to your gazebo and leave behind dishes prepared from whatever is available at the William H. Jordan Farm and a half-dozen other local producers.
Many dishes make use of the wood-fired grill as well as The Well's recently added outdoor smokehouses. Like simply seasoned, wood-roasted turnips, king oyster mushrooms and parsnips, or juicy slow-smoked ham from Breezy Hill Farm, butchered in-house and served with a tangy reduction made from balsamic vinegar and pork bones. So too, roasted chicken with a shrunken lattice of crisp skin and yielding, gorgeously smoked meat. I drizzled its accompaniment, a bone-and-broth reduction over a buttered slice of Williams's sourdough-esque ciabatta and startled my neighbor with the volume of my "Mmmm."
She couldn't complain; I caught her cradling the Le Creuset terrine pan in which our potato gratin was served, scraping all the crusty cheese from the walls with a fork. At one point, she asked her husband to take it away from her. "It's so good. I can't stop," she said.
We all wished there had been more crusty soccarat (crunchy, over-toasted bomba rice) sizzling at the bottom of the colossal open-fire-cooked paella we were served, however. Full of peppery andouille, tender chunks of monkfish, Bangs Island mussels and littleneck clams, the dish was large enough to constitute a meal on its own. But it tasted a little flat - something a few more tomatoes or a squeeze of lemon might have remedied.
If you were to judge by the size of that dish alone, you'd peg The Well as a Spanish restaurant. On the other hand, the balanced, yet bizarrely stingy salad of North Spore mushrooms, foraged fiddleheads, Stilton cheese and lettuces picked a few feet away would never lead you to conclude that you were sitting on an arable plot of land. As one of my guests pointed out, the steep sloping sides of the salad bowl made the dish look much fuller than it was.
As missteps go, it's a small one, but it added to another minor conceptual confusion that had a few of my party asking, "What's the theme of this meal?" None of us could pinpoint it, but we all thought we were on the cusp of figuring it out - it seemed to be just out of our view, like the barely hidden image in a Magic Eye puzzle.
Instead, the family-style feast feels like something you'd imagine being served to weary travelers in "Game of Thrones" or "The Canterbury Tales" - gigantic platters of whatever is in the kitchen, with little thought to harmony or progression.
It wouldn't be difficult to resolve the dinner into something that coalesces neatly. Take the roasted chicken, add it to the paella (as is traditional in many versions of the dish), and then play that off the ham to create a cohesive Iberian evening, perhaps side-stepping to finish with buÃ±uelos in place of their doughnut cousins.
All of that said, even without a clearly articulated theme, the gazebo meal is still pretty wonderful, due in part to a controversial change instituted this year: the addition of The Well's own wine, beer and cider list.
Williams and his team have eased the transition with affordable by-the-glass wine pours ($7-$11) and by-the-can cider and beer ($2.50-$7) options, as well as a few extraordinary special importation wines by the bottle. My table couldn't get enough of the quaffable 2018 Post-Flirtation Carignan-Zinfandel blend ($45) from Sebastopol, California - its mulberry and hibiscus flavors a perfect foil for woodsmoke.
According to Williams, not all repeat visitors have welcomed the elimination of the restaurant's BYOB policy. "Yeah, that's been a tricky one," he said. "But in the past, sometimes people would show up with multiple bottles per person ... and it could get a little out of control when people couldn't police themselves, so we decided it was time to rein it in a little bit."
In addition to keeping cockeyed customers from stumbling home (or worse, driving), the extra revenue from booze sales has allowed The Well to reduce its table turnover. This summer, the restaurant serves an average of 60 people a night - around 25 percent fewer diners than in previous years. And while the scarceness of seats might not sound like a plus, it means that a reserved gazebo is yours for the entire evening. You can dawdle to your heart's content.
Being able to settle in to one of the remarkably warm, rough-hewn structures over the course of several hours also contributes to The Well's hominess: a sensation that Williams prizes both at his summer restaurant and in his winter off-season gig. During the chilliest months of the year, rather than stick around Portland to work casual shifts at Back Bay Grill, where he once acted as sous chef, he follows the Red Bull Snowboarding Team on the road as their private chef.
"Hectic, but worth it. I'm lucky to have that balance of jobs," he said. "Those professional athletes travel so much, they don't get home-cooked meals. That's what I give them, but a little bit elevated: fresh bread, fresh butter, no over-the-top ingredients. But in the end, I'm doing the same thing for them that I am at The Well. You know, I just try to invoke that feeling of home."

Texto completo: Blacklisted signatories to 2016 denunciations ponder their prospects
Two and a half years into President Trump's tenure, the Republican national security heavyweights blacklisted from his administration for signing a pair of "never Trump" letters in 2016 face a crossroads - remain opposed or support him in 2020.
While some have become prominent figures of the anti-Trump resistance - denouncing him in op-eds and on cable news - others have offered policy advice from outside perches, and a select few have quietly, though mostly unsuccessfully, angled for administration jobs, hopeful that a mea culpa could end their days in purgatory.
This weekend, a few dozen once-prominent GOP foreign policy figures, including some original "never Trumpers," are gathering at a private Reagan Institute retreat in Beaver Creek, Colo., to promote and preserve the 40th president's "conservative internationalist" approach to foreign affairs. Yet the White House has shown little willingness to tap into this wellspring of expertise, even as Trump cycles through national security aides and faces a dwindling pool of experienced staffers for a potential second term.
The ostracizing of the group has led some to reconsider their roles in a prominent public movement to stop Trump three years ago.
"I'm not comfortable with letters anymore," said Patrick Cronin, head of the Asia-Pacific security program at the Hudson Institute, who signed the first letter, which called Trump "fundamentally dishonest" and "utterly unfitted to the office." In March 2017, Cronin was forced to withdraw from a new position overseeing a Pentagon think tank after Trump allies blasted his appointment by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
"I don't regret the letter in 2016; I thought it was the right thing to do," said Cronin, who has been publicly supportive of some elements of Trump's policies on China and North Korea. "But I'm not writing or signing any letters in 2020. I'm not predicting the outcome of the election. I will be supporting the U.S. government."
Of the 149 experts who signed at least one of the two letters warning that Trump was unfit for office - the first published on the War on the Rocks website during the 2016 GOP primaries and the second on the New York Times's site during the general-election campaign - just one has been hired by the Trump administration. James Jeffrey, a Middle East expert who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was named the State Department's special representative for Syria last summer and in January was given the additional role of special envoy to counter the Islamic State.
Neither of Jeffrey's roles required Senate confirmation, which would have risked Democratic lawmakers reading from the never Trump letters at a public hearing.
The retreat in Beaver Creek was organized by Roger Zakheim, the Reagan Institute's Washington director, who worked at the Pentagon in the George W. Bush administration. He and his father, Dov, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, signed both never Trump letters.
But organizers emphasized that the event includes participants who have supported the president, among them former Trump administration officials. The dialogue is not aimed at countering Trump, said one person familiar with the planning, but rather is intended to build consensus around Reagan's approach to U.S. global leadership in a time of uncertainty.
This person pointed to a new think tank founded by mega-philanthropists George Soros, a liberal, and Charles Koch, a conservative, that offers, in his words, a more "isolationist and protectionist" view of foreign policy.
Trump's "America First" agenda has rattled traditional conservatives, as he has looked skeptically at multilateral alliances, free trade and democracy promotion. He has withdrawn the United States from some international treaties, criticized the United Nations and shown little interest in global human rights issues.
The question of how far Trump has strayed from Reagan's principles has divided the never Trump group. Some praised Trump's choice of conservative Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, who helped dissuade the president from acting on threats to pull the United States out of NATO and shut down military bases in East Asia.
Some of the letter organizers, including Eliot A. Cohen, a State Department counselor in the Bush administration, and Max Boot, a Washington Post columnist who advised the 2008 presidential campaign of the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), have remained prominent critics of Trump's policies and personal conduct.
But others have expressed admiration for his willingness to take a harder line on China's trade practices, even if they remain uneasy about the tariff war between Washington and Beijing. And they asserted that Trump's unorthodox personal diplomacy with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has opened an unexpected avenue to try at least to contain Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
Trump's foreign policy "might not be as bad as feared and not as good as hoped," said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor who served on the National Security Council under George W. Bush and signed both letters.
Feaver, who stands by the letters and said Trump has validated much of what the experts warned of, said he is not seeking an administration position and thinks those who are will remain disappointed.
"Certainly, with the president, I don't sense he's anywhere closer to that kumbaya moment," Feaver said. "It would probably take movement on both sides, but I don't see much evidence the White House wants to move."
Among those at the Reagan Institute retreat is Daniel Blumenthal, an American Enterprise Institute scholar who served at the Pentagon in the Bush administration. Last summer, Blumenthal was among the candidates whom Pompeo was considering to oversee East Asia affairs at the State Department. But his candidacy was derailed, at least in part, by the White House's learning of his signature on the War on the Rocks letter, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the subject.
Another foreign policy analyst who signed that letter said in an interview last week that he regrets his participation. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the issue, accused the letter organizers of turning their opposition to Trump into a "never-ending anti-Trump crusade" that continued after he took office and has vaulted some of them to media stardom while leaving others with limited professional options.
"I didn't sign up for that," this analyst said. "I learned my lesson. I've sworn off ever signing another letter I didn't write."
Some of the never Trumpers expressed hope that the blacklist will erode around the edges; even if the White House refuses to hire them, they said, perhaps a determined Cabinet secretary can bring them on. Along with Jeffrey, they pointed to Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Reagan and Bush administrations who did not sign the letters but wrote an op-ed in 2016 saying Trump should not be president and would lose the election.
Trump foiled then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's attempt to name Abrams as his deputy in spring 2017. But Pompeo succeeded in January of this year in appointing Abrams as special envoy for Venezuela.
Mary Kissel and Brian Hook, two other senior State Department officials, also were vocal critics of Trump during the campaign, though neither signed the letters. Like Jeffrey, Abrams, Kissel and Hook were named to positions that do not require Senate confirmation.
Of those who have accepted their purgatory, some said they have had some modest policy conversations with moderate Democratic presidential candidates even though they recognize it is unlikely they will play a prominent role in any of their campaigns.
Someone like former vice president Joe Biden "is going to be surrounded by all the establishment Democrats," said Michael Green, a former Bush administration official who signed the New York Times letter and works at a Washington think tank. "What's the value added of an old Bush hand?"

Migrants learn rights for ICE raids

Texto completo: LAKE WORTH BEACH — Six moms and their babies gathered Friday at the Guatemalan-Maya Center to learn what to do if federal agents try to arrest them for deportation.
Ask to see a warrant signed by a judge, invoke the Fourth Amendment to withhold permission for police to enter your home, and invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer authorities’ questions until your lawyer is present, volunteers from Miami-based Florida Immigrant Coalition told the immigrants.
The volunteers’ advice may sound familiar to Americans who gleaned their legal education from TV, movies and books, but it was foreign to the mothers, one of whom said she arrived in the United States just months ago. Government officials on Thursday confirmed what President Donald Trump hinted at on July 5, that federal agents would raid and arrest undocumented families nationwide starting Sunday, especially those who recently arrived in the country.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement will target at least 2,000 immigrants that federal officials ordered deported, The New York Times reported on Thursday. But ICE might also arrest immigrants who happen to be at the scene of a raid.
Before that happens, “Have your power of attorney notarized, explaining who would take care of your children,” along with any medicine they take, Florida Immigrant Coalition speaker Diego Guerra said. The mothers received a card they could slide under their doors to ICE agents knocking on the other side, asking the agents to provide a warrant signed by a judge,
which Guerra said the officers could slide under the immigrants' doors.
“We are not lawyers and we can’t give legal advice,” speaker Haidee Cano said. “But maybe we can help.”
Their advice is sound, said two experts: West Palm Beach immigration lawyer Jan Peter Weiss, and Bernard Perlmutter, co-director of the Children & Youth Law Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law.
Weiss, who did not attend the Friday event, said he tells his clients ordered by the government to leave to fill out ICE Form I-246, an application to delay their deportation. Those without deportation orders can fill out Department of Justice Form EOIR-42B to cancel a removal order if the applicant can prove they have lived in America at least 10 years and “have been a person of good moral character” under federal law, the form states.
Weiss recommends that clients save papers proving their residency for the past 10 years, such as prescriptions or school report cards, and additionally, apply for asylum.“Immigration judges like that,” Weiss said, “It shows (an immigrant) is not a flight risk and not a danger to the community.”
The Trump administration’s raid order also has hit local business’ bottom lines.
Shops in West Palm Beach that cater mostly to immigrants cited Trump’s threats for a big drop in sales over the past few weeks. On a typical Friday, washers and dryers at Rub-a-Dub Laundry Service near Belvedere Road and Dixie Highway hum with 40 or 50 customers, laundromat worker Nicole Moronta said. But the day after Trump announced nationwide raids, only 15 or so people came in, she said.
A teen cashier at nearby restaurant Taqueria Guerrero said sales there declined by about $500 a day ever since mid-June, when Trump first announced nationwide raids before canceling them.
The Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County recommends that immigrants apply for a local ID they issue. They’ll hold an information session at 9 a.m. today at St. Juliana Catholic Church, 4500 S. Dixie Highway, West Palm Beach. Florida Immigrant Coalition offers a phone hotline at 888-600-5762 for callers seeking legal assistance and naturalization services.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Grupos proinmigrantes denunciaron este sábado que las redadas anunciadas por el Gobierno del presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, contra indocumentados “aterrorizarán a menores y separarán familias”.
La presidenta de la organización Families Belong Together, Jess Morales Rocketto, señaló en un comunicado que “la crueldad es el punto: las redadas masivas aterrorizarán a menores, separarán familias y creará el caos por el país”.
“La Administración (de Trump) está ejecutando una agenda cruel, supremacista blanca para traumatizar a familias en vez de tomar acciones para abordar las condiciones horribles que están matando a menores migrantes bajo custodia de EEUU”, dijo Morales Rocketto.
Por su parte, Mary Bauer, responsable de Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC, en inglés), hizo hincapié en un comunicado en que el Gobierno actual “está aterrorizando deliberadamente” a familias y comunidades de inmigrantes.
“El maltrato continuado de los menores en instalaciones de detención, los ataques a nuestro sistema de asilo y los asaltos a comunidades de inmigrantes mediante la amenaza de redadas muestran que la prioridad de esta Administración es aterrorizar a comunidades y no resolver los problemas migratorios de nuestra nación”, consideró.
Bauer indicó que “con la reciente aprobación de fondos adicionales para esas agencias (migratorias) sin salvaguardas adicionales, el Congreso también asume ahora la responsabilidad de estas tácticas continuas”.
“Estas agencias, que están maltratando intencionadamente a hombres, mujeres y menores y separando a familias, se han envalentonado por las acciones de los legisladores”, lamentó.
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, confirmó este viernes que su Gobierno iniciará el domingo redadas masivas en unas 10 ciudades para deportar a “miles” de indocumentados.
En declaraciones a los periodistas en la Casa Blanca, Trump respondió afirmativamente cuando le preguntaron si es cierto que el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) empezará sus redadas este domingo, como adelantaron el jueves varios medios de comunicación.
La operación se centrará en las ciudades de Nueva York, Miami (Florida), Houston (Texas), Los Ángeles y San Francisco (California), Chicago (Illinois), Atlanta (Georgia), Baltimore (Maryland) y Denver (Colorado), de acuerdo con fuentes oficiales citadas por la cadena de televisión CNN.
Estaba previsto que también hubiera redadas en Nueva Orleans (Luisiana), pero el ICE comunicó a las autoridades de la ciudad que suspenderá temporalmente la operación debido a la tormenta tropical Barry, transformada ya en huracán.
Según funcionarios consultados por el diario The New York Times, ICE buscará primero a unos 2,000 inmigrantes que ya han recibido órdenes de deportación y que, en algunos casos, no se presentaron a las audiencias en los tribunales de inmigración.
En las últimas horas, grupos y ciudadanos opuestos a las redadas, han realizado manifestaciones en contra de Trump y sus políticas en estados como California, Washington, Utah, entre otros.

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing — to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6 billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
For now, there's lasting damage — to the children. Many already traumatized by the violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.
"Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring," Harvard psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Texto completo: Groups of peaceful protesters held signs and sang songs to raise awareness of what's happening at the border of Mexico and the United States.

Activists from the group Central Mainers to End Family Separations stood on the corners of Main Street in Waterville on Friday afternoon to show solidarity against the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The group, which drew a crowd of 15 to 20 local residents, works with the Witness Shut Down Homestead Movement, a larger group of activists who are based in South Florida. These organizations work to draw attention to the separation of migrant families attempting to cross the border from Mexico into the United States and have the ultimate goal of getting migrant detention centers shut down.
Central Mainers to End Family Separations also operates under the protest group #StandonEveryCorner, a growing national movement of local communities organizing to hold peaceful protests for an array of causes.
According to Mary Dunn, one of the directors for Central Mainers to End Family Separations, the group is laser focused on one goal.
“We’re here to close the camps,” Dunn said.
Dunn was the catalyst behind bringing the protests to Waterville back in March and says the support continues to grow by the week.
“It started with just two of us, but every week we do this more people show up. I think the start of the presidential debates has gotten people more involved now,” Dunn said. “And we get a lot of support from people passing by, people will honk or give thumbs up. Of course we have some hecklers but the response overall has been mostly positive.”
After news of family separation happening at the border began to circulate nationwide last year, Dunn knew she had to get involved.
“I couldn’t believe it at first, I thought the news was wrong I thought they had incorrect information,” Dunn said. “I was just in complete shock.”
Family separation at the border between Mexico and the United States took a turn in April 2018 when new policies were introduced that criminally charged adult migrants attempting to cross the border, where before they were treated as civil violations.
Because children under the age of 18 couldn’t be with their relatives in prisons or detentions centers, the practice of separation has come about.
According to The New York Times, an estimated 700 families have been separated since 2018.
Dunn works remotely from her home in Oakland as a travel organizer with the Witness Shutdown Homestead Movement. She organizes trips for activists to visit the Homestead Air Force Reserve Base where a child detention center is being occupied by the protesters. According to Dunn, the group has been continuously protesting the facility for the better part of 100 days now.
One notable attendee at Friday’s rally was former Waterville Mayor Karen Heck, who has been involved with the Central Mainers to End Family Separation since the beginning.
According to Heck, the issue of separating children from their families runs deeper than political party.
“This isn’t a Republican or Democrat issue,” Heck said. “This is an issue of how we’re caring for children. … If these people are willing to risk everything in order to escape their situations in their home country to come here, that’s the kind of people America needs.”
Heck was distributing sheets of paper explaining the group’s next call to action: getting Maine’s senators and representatives to take action against the migrant camps.
Dunn further explained the group’s intentions in contacting state officials.
“Next week were going to call, email, write, communicate with Susan Collins, Angus King, Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden and demand that they go down to the border and do what they can to shut down these camps.” Dunn said.
Dunn said though the separation of families is still happening, she is hopeful for the future.
“Were going to do it. We’re going to stop this,” Dunn said. “Were better than this. This country is better than taking children away from their parents.”
Central Mainers to End Family Separations rallys from 4 to 5 p.m. every Friday on the corner of Main and Temple streets in Waterville.

Democrats must make Citizens United an issue

Texto completo: Amid the many words that 20 Democratic candidates for president uttered during their opening debates last month, two vitally important ones went almost entirely unsaid: Citizens United. That is the shorthand name for the 2010 Supreme Court decision that has to rank among the most destructive to American democracy ever handed down.
Citizens United opened the floodgates for so-called "dark money" - donations whose source is allowed to remain hidden - to swamp the electoral process. The ruling consecrated the dubious principle that a corporation enjoys free speech just like an individual, and it allowed wealthy donors to keep secret their contributions to fiercely ideological, unofficially partisan nonprofit groups.
While both Democrats and Republicans have played that cynical game, it was the conservative faction of the high court that narrowly pushed through the ruling. And the vast majority of dark money since then has advanced right-wing causes and candidates, as an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics shows.
So, Citizens United should be a galvanizing issue for Democrats, one equally appealing to the party's progressive and moderate wings. Beyond that, a Pew poll last year found bipartisan support - in the range of 65% to 77% - for renewed limits on big money in politics, making an assault on Citizens United potentially attractive to the sliver of swing voters any Democratic nominee for president will likely need to defeat President Donald Trump.
And yet you hardly would have guessed so if you followed the two-part Democratic debate on June 26 and 27. There was plenty of talk devoted to Medicare For All, immigration policy, income inequality and, to a lesser extent, gun control and climate change. The most sizzling moment came when California Sen. Kamala Harris upbraided former Vice President Joe Biden over his past opposition to school busing for racial integration.
Only for two fleeting moments during all the rhetoric did two distantly trailing candidates bother to mention Citizens United. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker dropped the name the first night, and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet called for the ruling's overturning the second night.
Incredibly, though, neither man made any effort to explain what Citizens United was about, much less why it ought to be reversed, or why Democratic voters have reasons other than protecting abortion rights under Roe v. Wade to want to elect a president and seat a Senate that can appoint some liberal and moderate justices to the federal courts.
None of the other candidates picked up the opportunity to discuss Citizens United, even though its protection of stealth wealth would have seemed an ideal target for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Both have built their campaigns as crusaders against entrenched, unaccountable, corrupting plutocracy - the very thing enshrined by Citizens United.
It is true that "social welfare" organizations - as the federal tax code improbably calls them in Section 501©4 - trafficked in political work before Citizens United. But those efforts at least had to be packaged as advocating for particular issues, not candidates. The Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling, with an opinion authored by the Reagan appointee Justice Anthony Kennedy, permitted the nonprofits to explicitly spend money on political persuasion, as long as it wasn't a group's primary activity.
Not surprisingly, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the annual total of dark money soared from about $5.2 million in 2006 to more than $300 million in 2012, the first presidential cycle after the ruling. By now, as the Center for Responsive Politics has calculated, unnamed donors have put more than $2 billion into organizations that are wholly or partly shielded from public disclosure and scrutiny. Individual donors from the right, such as the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and Robert Mercer, have especially enjoyed the legal cloak.
During the first week of January 2019, as a Democratic majority took control of the House of Representatives, its members voted unanimously to pass a sweeping anti-corruption measure that partly addressed the dark-money plague. Naturally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to let the bill come to a vote in the Senate.
To judge by the first round of debates, virtually every Democratic candidate has let the issue die with McConnell's predictable obstruction. Why they would drop the issue, and miss the chance to identify a very convenient villain, is a mystery.
All 20 candidates on stage, and the mass of journalists covering them, will get another chance when the next round of debates takes place in Detroit on July 30 and 31. Somebody on that stage had better be able to make the winning case against Citizens United, its judicial architects and its partisan beneficiaries - the most abhorrent of whom happens to currently occupy the White House. - (CNN)

It’s time to check NASA’s astronomical spending

Texto completo: For a government website, NASA’s homepage is an exciting place. Americans can read news releases brimming with all sorts of interesting announcements. For example, on June 3, Pennsylvania students had “an opportunity to speak live with a NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station.” The agency also lets taxpayers know that NASA is pro-small business, and willing to hand out dollars to startups to develop solar panels. But NASA is less than forthcoming about its mounting cost overruns and schedule delays — which are costing taxpayers billions of dollars and jeopardizing future missions. Taxpayers deserve better.
You wouldn’t know it unless you checked it out for yourself, but NASA has a serious spending problem. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, NASA’s major projects have veered nearly thirty percent over budget, as average launches are typically delayed by over a year. One of the chief culprits behind exploding cost figures is the James Webb Space Telescope, which was originally supposed to cost upward of $3.5 billion and launch by 2011. The latest estimates (but probably not the last) have the telescope launching in 2021 and costing $9.7 billion — a 177 percent increase.
In a 2018 report, NASA’s inspector general pointed out that NASA has a persistent, reckless culture of misplaced optimism, which prevents it from soberly assessing costs on the novel technologies it dreams up. After proposing the project, NASA had to invent 10 technologies in order to even make the JWST viable. In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

Texto completo: Do you have any pet peeves? I've got a couple. And one of them is a restaurant or bar that plays music way too loud.
After all, don't you typically go to a restaurant with someone to enjoy good food and a good conversation? Because it appears they forget to tell many members of the restaurant and bar owners association. 
The latest perpetrator in my world was a bar/restaurant on the main drag in Red Lodge, Mont., last week. After taping interviews for our television show at their Home of Champions Rodeo, we scouted about for somewhere to relax, dine and unwind. 
They have a lot of wonderful restaurants, but choices at that hour were minimal and the one place we did find open had readily available seating, so my cameraman and I plopped down there.
Now, if you're a restaurant manager, waitress, or waiter, this should be clue No. 1: If you can't hear the person ordering food, the music might be too loud. If the person ordering food can't hear you despite the fact that you're shouting, the music might be too loud. If the salt shaker is vibrating off the table, the music might be too loud. And if you're the only bar/restaurant open in town but you're still not full, the music might be too loud.
Of course, we know that you can become addicted to drugs, alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, marijuana and even tattoos, they say. Can you also become addicted to extra-loud music? And do you think we need to consider intervention and counseling for bar and restaurant owners?
Yet, when it comes to high decibels, there's something else that's even more important, and that, of course, is our ears. You see, health inspectors inspect restaurants regularly for any contaminants. But should they also add reduced music volume to the checklist? And since reducing volume levels is hard to control, do they need to put governors on the volume dials? After all, last I heard, the ability to hear is an important function of the human body.
In a New York Times investigation, a reporter got a decibel reading at 37 venues across New York City, including bars and restaurants, and "found levels that experts said bordered on dangerous at one-third of them."
Meanwhile, I found this quote that came from Mother Teresa. She said, "We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass - grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence. We need silence to be able to touch souls."
While doing that I also found this quote by Ulysses S. Grant, a quote that has little to do with this article and everything to do with the immense patriotism that we saw at rodeos this past week in Wyoming, Montana and Oregon: "I suffer the mortification of seeing myself attacked right and left by people at home professing patriotism and love of country who never heard the whistle of a hostile bullet. I pity them and the nation dependent on such for its existence. I am thankful, however that, though such people make a great noise, the masses are not like them."

Texto completo: Tony Bamonte, a three-term Pend Oreille County sheriff and prolific local historian who unearthed evidence of a police cover-up in the murder of the Newport town marshal 54 years after the crime, died Thursday morning. He was 77.
The cause was pancreatic cancer.
Born in Wallace, Idaho, Bamonte grew up the son of a miner in Metaline Falls, Washington. He served as a military policeman for the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War before joining the Spokane Police Department in 1966 as a motorcycle patrolman and served as one of the members of the department's first SWAT team.
That was the start of a long law enforcement career that was, at times, confrontational. Timothy Egan, the New York Times writer who chronicled Bamonte's dogged pursuit of the truth about Depression-era corruption in the Spokane police force in the book "Breaking Blue," said that was because Bamonte had a strong sense of morality that was tied to his military service and upbringing.
"The amazing thing about him, he had a stubborn streak of right and wrong," said Egan, who met Bamonte as a reporter for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "He had this old-fashioned sense of right and wrong."
Former Spokesman-Review reporter Bill Morlin met Bamonte while he was working at the Associated Press. That included covering Bamonte's encounter with an armed robber inside the Bon Marche department store in October 1971.
"He had a knack for being in the middle of everything," Morlin said.
Bamonte, responding to a radio report of an armed robbery, shot 35-year-old Jerry Lewis, who had shot and killed a cashier's assistant on the fifth floor. Prosecutors later ruled the shooting justified, finding that Lewis had raised his weapon at the patrolman's head before Bamonte fired. Bamonte's shot struck sunglasses on Lewis' face - or, as Morlin remembered it, "right between the eyes" of the suspected robber - likely preventing the bullet from killing Lewis.
In 1974, working as a motorcycle officer, he was selected to escort President Richard Nixon to the World's Fair Expo '74 in Spokane. At that time, he also spent his nights at Whitworth University, earning a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1974.
Bamonte left the Spokane Police Department in 1974, according to a biography published on the website of the book publishing firm Tornado Creek Publications, which he ran with his wife, Suzanne. He left for a job as a sheriff's deputy in Pend Oreille County near his hometown of Metaline Falls, near the Canadian border.
Voters there made him sheriff in 1978, a position he'd hold for the next 12 years. One of his first actions in office was to bring a small claims court complaint against a Spokane tire company, alleging they'd provided him radial tires for his patrol cruisers that leaked air.
"I see this type of thing all the time," Bamonte told the newspaper in November 1979. "Some businesses think they can just get away with anything when they're dealing with counties."
While serving in Pend Oreille County, and seeking a master's degree from Gonzaga University, Bamonte would launch the investigative probe into Newport Town Marshal George Conniff's death that landed him on the front page of the New York Times.
Conniff was gunned down in September 1935 in an apparent butter burglary gone wrong at the Newport Creamery. The crime originally was blamed on "fugitives," according to a Spokane Daily Chronicle report at the time. But Bamonte's investigation implicated a Spokane police detective in the murder and located a rusty gun in the Spokane River where a witness, and former Spokane police detective, said the murder weapon had been tossed decades earlier.
Bamonte's examination of the case was featured on "Unsolved Mysteries," prompting some to claim the gun had been planted by Bamonte. Morlin said Thursday the gun showed signs of rust and corrosion that indicated it had been there a long time.
"People had a love-hate relationship with him," Morlin said Thursday, after being notified of Bamonte's death. "He broke that code of silence."
Three months after the gun was located, Egan submitted his story about the case to the New York Times. It was published in the Nov. 16, 1989 edition of the paper under the headline "After 54 Years, River's Quirk Gives Up a Clue in Killing."
"I just thought it was a yarn," Egan said. "It was a cop-on-cop killing, and it took a cop doing his master's degree to solve it."
From that article sprung the book "Breaking Blue," which looks not only into the killing but Bamonte's own struggle to unearth the truth. By the time it was published in 1992, Bamonte had lost his post as Pend Oreille County's top law enforcement officer, losing by 34 votes in a 1990 primary that the incumbent said was partially the fault of the Spokane Police Department.
Then-Chief Terry Mangan, along with the state Attorney General's Office, had publicly criticized Bamonte for questioning the department's investigation into the death of David Ritchey, a Spokesman-Review newspaper carrier, in 1987. Bamonte said Mangan was being "too defensive" in dismissing his findings at the time.
That critique from Mangan came after Bamonte publicly questioned whether a Spokane police detective had killed Conniff after the discovery of the revolver in the river.
"I knew I was involved in a lot of controversy and I knew it came at the wrong time," Bamonte told reporter Jess Walter in an interview conducted as the votes were tabulated in the 1990 primary. "I guess I may be looking for a job."
Morlin said Bamonte refused to remain silent about behavior he believed was wrong. He noted the recent example of deputies refusing to speak up about a Spokane County Sheriff's deputy's allegedly racist comments.
"Tony wasn't that kind of guy," Morlin said. "If he saw something wrong, he'd talk about it."
Bamonte had been working on a book about Ritchey's 1987 murder, Morlin said. He believed the man imprisoned in the killing, Gregory Rowley, was innocent. Rowley died in custody in 2009.
After the 1990 campaign, Bamonte launched a bid to become Spokane County sheriff in 1994. He was defeated in the primary by Democrat John Goldman and Republican Mark Sterk. Goldman eventually won the general election.
Bamonte and his wife wrote numerous history books together. They include works on the Davenport Hotel, Manito Park and Wallace, Idaho. He also was involved in a series of books from the Spokane Regional Law Enforcement Museum documenting the history of the Spokane Police Department.
His wife said he was an accomplished renaissance man.
"He was always pro-law enforcement," Suzanne Bamonte said. "There were a lot of things that he forged ahead that upset people. There were people who just loved him, and others who saw him as a turncoat for the people he exposed.
"He was always driven by his integrity and had a kind heart for the underdog," she said. "He was full of compassion."
Susan S. Walker, secretary-treasurer of the Spokane Regional Law Enforcement Museum, said Bamonte was known for seeking the truth.
"He has left such a legacy for our area," she said.
His most recent book, "Motorcycle Officers of Eastern Washington and Relevant Crime Stories," was published under the Tornado Creek imprint in July 2018.
Co-author and retired Spokane police Officer Jack Pearson said he and Bamonte spent three years collecting information and pictures from former motorcycle cops and their families.
"The more I worked with him, the more I respected him," Pearson said. "He's got a heart of gold."
Pearson also said the Bamontes' compassion was shown by their willingness to take care of feral cats.
"They treated them like they were their sick children," Pearson said.
Egan said he didn't think Bamonte's writing days were over.
"He was just a great man and had a remarkable, multifaceted life," Egan said. "I think he had five more books in him."
Tony Bamonte is survived by his wife, Suzanne Bamonte; his son, Lou Bamonte; his older brother, Dale Bamonte, and his niece, Lani Conrad.

Warren Outlines Immigration Plan That Takes Aim at Trump-Era Abuses

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered an immigration proposal on Thursday that would create new protections for migrants, investigate allegations of abuse under the Trump administration and allow far higher numbers of refugees into the country.
Ms. Warren's plan includes an assertive push for liberal immigration priorities, like decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings. She also pledged to establish judicial review for immigration cases and create an "Office of New Americans" that would provide services to immigrants transitioning into American society, including English classes.
Ms. Warren has gained ground in polling of the Democratic presidential race in recent months by providing a steady diet of detailed policy proposals on issues including a wealth tax and student debt cancellation. But until Thursday, an immigration proposal had been conspicuously absent.
Much of her plan, which she posted on Medium, calls for a suite of measures similar to those that have already been suggested by other Democrats seeking the party's nomination.
Ms. Warren's plan -- like those advanced by the former housing secretary Julián Castro and former Representative Beto O'Rourke -- seeks to reverse what she calls "bigoted" policies imposed by the Trump administration; expand pathways to citizenship for immigrants; and spend more on aid to Central America to help address the root causes of migration.
"Donald Trump wants to divide us -- to pit worker against worker, neighbor against neighbor," Ms. Warren wrote. "We can be better than this. Americans know that immigrants helped weave the very fabric of our country in the past -- and they know that immigrants belong here today."
Ms. Warren said she would aim to resettle 125,000 refugees in the United States in her first year in office, and at least 175,000 per year by the end of her first term. That would be a substantial increase from the levels under the Trump administration, which has said it will cap the number at 30,000 this year. It would also go beyond the annual cap of 110,000 refugees that President Barack Obama put in place before he left office.
The plan also codifies Ms. Warren's support for repealing the section of immigration law that makes illegal border crossings a criminal violation and that has enabled the Trump administration to separate parents and their children. Under her plan, unauthorized crossings would be a civil violation and prosecutors would "prioritize immigration cases with security concerns."
Decriminalizing undocumented crossings was a central pillar of Mr. Castro's immigration proposal, which he leveraged to draw contrast with Mr. O'Rourke during the first Democratic debate. Mr. Castro's debate performance earned him positive reviews from political strategists, if not a significant increase in support in the polls.
Ms. Warren also said she would create a task force in the Justice Department to investigate allegations of abuses of migrants detained by the Trump administration, including "medical neglect and physical and sexual assaults."
"If you are violating the basic rights of immigrants, now or in the future, a Warren administration will hold you accountable," she wrote.
As she has rolled out her plans, Ms. Warren has sought to frame her ideas as the engines of her broad fight for "big, structural change." The immigration plan she outlined Thursday was no exception.
And like her rivals, Ms. Warren is using her proposal as an opportunity to draw stark contrasts with President Trump.
Mr. Trump placed immigration at the center of his 2016 campaign and has since made it a focus of his domestic agenda as president. Over the past two years, his administration has pursued anti-immigration policies that have drawn cheers from supporters and protests from critics, such as banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries, separating families at the border, restricting asylum claims and seeking to build a wall along the southern border.
In the Medium post, Ms. Warren accused Mr. Trump of having "advanced a policy of cruelty and division that demonizes immigrants."
Her announcement came as Immigration and Customs Enforcement was preparing nationwide raids to arrest thousands of members of undocumented families beginning this weekend, according to a report in The New York Times.
If elected president, Ms. Warren would need the help of Congress to fully realize her plans. But her immigration overhaul would probably not pass through a Republican-controlled Senate, a reality she seemed to concede when she promised to "push for" legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.
Her plan also included a pledge to "reshape" ICE, but not abolish the agency as some immigration activists have proposed. She also called for eliminating private detention facilities; expanding legal immigration through more lenient family reunification policies; and sending $ 1.5 billion in aid to Central America each year.
Advocates for immigrants praised Ms. Warren's approach on Thursday. "The proposal shows that Senator Warren has a strong understanding of the complexity of our current immigration system and acknowledges that a single bill is not a solution -- we must get to the root causes by making structural changes," said Marielena Hincapié, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center's Immigrant Justice Fund.
But Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors significant reductions in immigration, called Ms. Warren's view of the country's immigration system "badly distorted."
"Her proposals are unworkable, extreme, and would be disastrous for our country if anyone actually tried to enact them all," Ms. Vaughan said. "No doubt Warren's plan will be a big hit in the halls of Harvard Law School and among the big donor circles of the left, but it's good for other Americans also to hear this so they know what she has in mind for them."
Ms. Warren was among several Democratic candidates scheduled to speak Thursday night at an event in Milwaukee hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens.

Texto completo: A panel on CNN's Inside Politics criticized the beginning of Amy McGrath's senate run, in which she backtracked after saying she would have voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
McGrath, who is running against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, initially told the Courier-Journal Wednesday that she would've voted in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation, but then changed her mind on social media after facing backlash for the remark.
"There are some things a candidate gets a pass on in the minutia of policy. You’re running for Senate against Mitch McConnell. You’ve got to have an answer on Brett Kavanaugh. That’s kind of campaign 101, right?" CNN's John King asked.
CNN panel shames McConnell challenger's Kavanaugh flub
Carl Hulse of the New York Times answered, "If you’re running against Mitch McConnell, judges is the thing you’re going to want to be talking about. What a disaster. This is just a disaster. I’m not sure what was worse, being for Kavanaugh or having to flip so quickly and say you weren’t."
"I mean Mitch McConnell and his people are ruthless," he added. "She was going to have a really hard time anyway with Trump on the ballot in Kentucky and this kind of mistake, they were just rubbing their hands together."
"This whole thing kind of shows how Democrats have to twist themselves into a pretzel to run in a state like Kentucky. I mean part of Amy McGrath’s message is that President Trump won Kentucky by a big margin and she wants to work with him on things like infrastructure and draining the swamp. She’s painting McConnell as a threat to getting Trump's agenda passed," Sahil Kapur of Bloomberg said. "None of it really computes here."
Earlier this week, McGrath was asked to explain her 2017 comparison between Donald Trump's election and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks during an interview on CNN with Jake Tapper.
Despite the negative attention, the retired Marine fight pilot received $2.5 million in donations within 24 hours of her campaign launch, setting a record for first-day campaign fundraising. Story URLPhoto Caption:Brett Kavanaugh and Amy McGrath are seen.

'Offensive': Pelosi singles out AOC’s top aide

Texto completo: On Capitol Hill, no one likes a staffer who oversteps their authority by attacking fellow lawmakers, and that’s exactly where Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff put himself with an incendiary tweet aimed at Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Saikat Chakrabarti, 33, a powerful influence behind the 29-year-old first-term congresswoman, angered dozens of moderate House Democrats last month during an intra-party battle over border funding.
He blasted the centrists on Twitter for backing a bipartisan measure to provide emergency funding and later attacked Pelosi, mocking the notion she was a "mastermind."
Pelosi, 79, this week singled out Chakrabarti in a closed-door meeting with rank-and-file Democrats as an example of what not to do on social media. “Do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK,” Pelosi told Democrats Wednesday.
The California congresswoman brought him up again on Thursday, telling reporters after the meeting that lawmakers are angry about the tweets, without mentioning Chakrabarti by name.
She called it “an offensive tweet that came out of one office.”
Chakrabarti, a progressive activist and Harvard computer science graduate, was Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign manager before becoming her top congressional aide.
He inserted himself into a party feud over border funding by attacking moderates over their support of a Senate bipartisan bill that excluded some key provisions progressives believe are needed to improve the accommodations of illegal immigrants flooding the southern border.
“They certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown peopled today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,” Chakrabarti tweeted.
A week later, he attacked Pelosi following media interviews in which she appeared dismissive of the influence of Ocasio-Cortez and her “squad” of ultra-progressive fellow freshmen, who have a large social media following but not a lot of pull in the Democratic caucus.
Pelosi told the New York Times that Ocasio-Cortez and company have a big social media following but couldn’t get anyone to back their efforts to block a House version of the border funding bill.
Chakrabarti fired back on Twitter, “All these articles want to claim what a legislative mastermind Pelosi is, but I'm seeing way more strategic smarts from freshman members like @AOC, @IlhanMN , @RashidaTlai and @AyannaPressley. Pelosi is just mad that she got outmaneuvered (again) by Republicans,” Chakrabarti tweeted on July 6.
A founder of the progressive activist group Justice Democrats, Chakrabarti worked for the 2016 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign. He played a key role in helping Ocasio-Cortez unseat Democrat Joe Crowley in the New York’s 14th District primary.

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds, adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog, known as an inspector general.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances. ") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
HOMELAND SECURITY: We've done all we could with limited resources
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing — to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for about 2,000 confined children.
Some of Trump's tough-guy policies for staunching the flow of migrants have only made matters worse. When he "meters" lawful asylum seeking at ports of entry down to a trickle, desperate migrants find other ways to enter the country. When he starts threatening deportation of U. S. residents willing to sponsor child migrants, sponsorship declines and children languish in holding cells. And when he cancels or limits programs that allow for release of migrants into the community wearing ankle bracelets or under successful community supervision programs, they're consigned to fetid, standing-room only cells.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents, raising the question of whether another new Trump policy, of using flawed evidence of gang affiliation to separate families, is making matters worse. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care since December.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4. 6 billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
Going forward, Congress could help safeguard children by:
►Creating a multiagency, pilot program to compassionately process children and families.
►Allowing lawmakers to visit sites without advance notice.
►Establishing medical care standards for children and adults in custody.
►Providing best-practices training for border officers.
For now, there's lasting damage — to the children. Many already traumatized by violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U. S. immigration centers.
"Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring," Harvard Medical School psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Texto completo: Immigrant advocates were bracing Thursday for a massive sweep of arrests and detentions amid reports that a roundup in at least 10 major cities could begin this weekend.
ICE officials would neither confirm nor deny a report Thursday in The New York Times, citing multiple administration officials the newspaper did not name, that the sweep would begin Sunday. President Donald Trump said last week that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement would begin a major sweep "soon. "
"No one arrested in the immigration raids should be deported without a fair day in court," the American Immigration Council tweeted. "We are recruiting and training immigration attorneys from around the country to ensure this happens. "
UnidosUS tweeted a list of don'ts and dos for immigrants – don't open doors, say anything to ICE agents, or sign anything, they said; do take pictures and get a lawyer.
"As the threat of ICE raids brings fear to our communities, it is important that you know your rights," the tweet said.
Speaking outside the White House on Wednesday, U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services acting director Ken Cuccinelli declined to say when any raids would begin, but vowed that they were coming.
“They’re absolutely going to happen,” Cuccinelli said, adding that there are "approximately a million people in this country with removal orders. Of course that isn’t what ICE would go after in this. But that’s the pool of people who’ve been all the way through the due process chain. ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday decried the upcoming raids as immoral actions taken to “terrorize children and tear families apart. ”
During a press conference at the Capitol, she stressed that a deportation order is not the same as a search warrant, and urged immigrants to learn their rights before allowing ICE to enter their homes.
“If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, a person may refuse to open the door and let them in,” she said.
The Times said the sweep would target more than 2,000 immigrants facing deportation orders who remain in the country illegally. The sources told the Times that ICE planned to keep family members together at family detention facilities whenever possible.
Trump said two weeks ago that he would delay nationwide raids for two weeks to give Congress time to develop an immigration plan. Trump's hard line on immigration has been a recurring theme in his presidency and is expected to take center stage in his 2020 reelection bid.
ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke, in a statement emailed Thursday to USA TODAY, said ICE cannot provide details on coming raids for security reasons. ICE has consistently maintained that its focus is on people with criminal records but that anyone found to be in the U. S. illegally would face detainment.
"Ninety percent of aliens arrested by ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations component in FY2018 had either a criminal conviction, pending criminal charge, were an ICE fugitive or illegally reentered the country after previously being removed," Bourke said.
That is true, but in 2018 about 66% of people arrested by ICE had been convicted of a crime in the U. S. — a sharp drop from the final years of the Obama administration, which targeted undocumented immigrants with criminal records.
ICE officials previously have said they plan to target new arrivals in an effort to stem a surge of Central American families arriving through Mexico. That surge showed some decline in June, when total border arrests fell 29% according to numbers released by Customs and Border Protection. But the decline came after May totals — more than 140,000 arrests — that were the highest since 2006.
The Trump administration credits its escalating series of threats and new policies for the slowdown, although border crossing traditionally declines in the heat of summer.
"This is not a 'rule of law' operation," Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, tweeted Thursday. "The goal is to terrorize immigrant communities so immigrants do not seek protection in the US. "

A government report released last week found that migrants were being held in overcrowded conditions described as “a ticking time bomb. " In one room at Customs and Border Protection’s Fort Brown station near the U. S-Mexico border in Texas, 51 women were in a cell with a capacity for 40 juveniles, according to the report from the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general’s office. In another cell, 71 men were in a cell designated for 41, the report said.
Trump was dismissive of the report, saying the facilities he visited were clean and well run.
“I think they do a great job with those facilities,” Trump said.

How Scooter Braun became so powerful [Corrected 07/13/2019]

Texto completo: Around this time last year, two of pop music's biggest superstars got unusually candid about their love lives.
Ariana Grande was enjoying a very public romance with "Saturday Night Live" star Pete Davidson. Justin Bieber, meanwhile, was engaged to Hailey Baldwin, a milestone he made Instagram official. Amid this rare constellation of celebrity PDA, one fan called attention to the manager Grande and Bieber share, Scott "Scooter" Braun, in a pithy tweet: "The devil works hard, but Scooter Braun works harder."
It was a joke -- the tweet was deleted after drawing a pointed response from Grande -- but the sentiment spoke to Braun's increasing influence in pop culture. He could make things happen, and fans recognized that. The devil and/or Kris Jenner would be proud.
Braun, 38, famously discovered Bieber back in 2008 when the Stratford, Ontario, native was a preteen crooning R&B covers on YouTube. As Bieber skyrocketed to fame, Braun turned his entrepreneurial talents into a veritable entertainment empire, amassing a slew of in-demand clients including Tori Kelly, Demi Lovato, model Karlie Kloss and, at one point, Jenner's son-in-law, Kanye West.
But Braun's industry reach was highlighted in an unexpected way Sunday when Taylor Swift called him out in a scathing Tumblr post. Braun purchased Big Machine Records, the label on which Swift launched her career, and acquired her master recordings as part of the $300 million deal.
Swift wrote that she had not been made aware of Braun's purchase until "it was announced to the world," a claim Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta later disputed. But the singer-songwriter was particularly incensed that Braun would own her records.
"All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I've received at his hands for years," Swift wrote, citing a 2016 Snapchat incident involving West and his wife, Kim Kardashian.
The ensuing drama has divided celebrities, including Bieber (who has defended Braun), some of Braun's other clients and Swift's supporters. The controversy has also put a spotlight on Braun, whom the New York Times once called "the defining music executive of the social media era, known for aggressive online cross-promotion between clients."
So how did he get here?
Braun got his first taste of the music business in Atlanta, where he attended Emory University. As a freshman, Braun sold fake IDs but soon discovered a more lucrative side hustle: promoting parties. The city's prominent hip-hop scene enabled him to rub elbows with rappers and R&B musicians in the early aughts.
"The singer Ciara referred to him as her 'big brother.' Lil Jon called him 'the white Puff Daddy,' " recalled a 2012 New Yorker article. He became a protege of veteran producer Jermaine Dupri, who asked Braun to head up marketing at his So So Def label. He was fired a few years later, a setback he has described as stemming from a disagreement over the label's direction.
But Braun had enough connections to consult and freelance his way forward.
"Only a few weeks after leaving Dupri, Braun brokered a $12 million campaign deal between Ludacris and Pontiac," explained a 2006 Creative Loafing article that dubbed Braun "the Hustla." Braun eventually set up his own management company, enlisting Asher Roth, the white rapper best known for his debut 2009 single "I Love College," as his first client.
Braun was in search of a younger act when he stumbled across Bieber's baby-voiced videos. A 2009 New York Times article detailed Braun's dogged attempt to track down the singer and his mother, Pattie Mallette: "He tracked down Justin's school, calling board members, imploring them to contact Ms. Mallette."
Braun continued to use his digital savvy to recruit artists for his business. In 2011, after Bieber tweeted about a song he couldn't get out of his head, Braun scrambled to sign the relatively unknown Canadian artist to his label, Schoolboy Records. The song in Bieber's head was Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe."
Bieber's love for the song was central to Braun's strategy -- in early 2012, the singer and his famous friends lip-synced to "Call Me Maybe" in a goofy YouTube video that Braun has hinted he had a hand in. The song became a viral smash. That same year, Braun came across "Gangnam Style," the insanely popular dance track by Korean rapper Psy. "HOW DID I NOT SIGN THIS GUY!?!??!," he tweeted. Months later, he did.
In recent years, Braun has garnered attention for his perceptibly patient response to Bieber's post-adolescent struggles in the public eye, and for staging a benefit concert in Manchester just weeks after a terrorist bombing killed 22 people and injured dozens more after a concert on Grande's "Dangerous Woman" tour. Braun, who has also been praised for his philanthropic efforts, recruited an all-star lineup to support Grande at the event, which, according to the New York Times, raised more than $12 million to help victims of the bombing.
Braun's strategic business approach led author Amos Barshad to label the manager a "Rasputin" (after the legendary Russian mystic), in his 2019 book, "No One Man Should Have All That Power: How Rasputins Manipulate the World." In an interview with Braun, Barshad asked the obvious question.
"On a day-to-day basis, no, I don't manipulate," Braun told him. "I try to be so transparent it's overwhelming. Manipulation, I think, should only be used when it's a life-or-death situation."
Braun told Barshad it ultimately comes down to intent.
"If you're manipulating and you know in your heart you're doing something malicious, then you're just an awful person," he said. "If you're in a situation where you're manipulating something and you 100 percent believe it's for their betterment -- that it's for the benefit of others -- then that's a justification I've found in the past."
Braun has yet to officially weigh in on the Swift controversy -- and he may not. At Fast Company's Innovation Festival last year, Braun recalled being fired by Grande several years ago, joking that her decision was related to a bad relationship the singer was in at the time. His team was angry, he recalled, and wanted him to strike back publicly.
"But I said, 'We're not going to say a word, and this is going to come back around,' " Braun recalled. " I just said, 'Let's stay quiet and let our truth be our actions.' " (Grande returned to his management company within months.)
"There are a lot of people who are smarter than me, who have worked as hard as me, but along the way I got lucky," Braun said of his career path as an entertainment executive attuned to the tastes of a digital generation.
"And I've never taken that for granted."

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jim Kerstetter, deputy technology editor in San Francisco, discussed the tech he's using.
What tech tools do you rely on the most for your job, and what could be better about them?
This will probably surprise no one, but you don't need that many technology tools to be a good editor. If you have a computer, a not-too-painful-to-use publishing system, decent internet access and a phone, you're pretty much all set.
But my internet access at home could be more reliable. Yes, Comcast, you cause angst.
So you keep tech use to a minimum. What's your philosophy for how people should use tech for work?
Steve Jobs was right: Simplicity is harder than complexity. The best products are almost always the easiest to use. I don't even use an external keyboard or monitor. Why bother?
Reporters are relying on me to help them do their work, so the last thing I should be doing is monkeying with unreliable technology. That means avoiding tech's bleeding edge.
The exception to my less-is-more rule is outside of work: I am addicted to my Garmin Forerunner 235 watch for running. The GPS for tracking distance, time and elevation is rock solid, and the iPhone app you use with it is beautiful. It allows you to slice and dice data from runs in all sorts of ways.
It doesn't make me any faster, but it makes running more entertaining.
You've been involved in tech journalism for more than two decades at different publications, including PC Week. How have the tools that reporters use changed over time?
It's easy to forget how much technology has made this job easier. I can edit a story from my living room because I have high-speed internet access (usually) and a MacBook Air that doesn't break my back when I take it home. I can do research on an article in minutes thanks to Google. I can learn that major news is breaking anywhere in the world thanks to Twitter.
I can reach reporters anywhere in seconds because we're all carrying smartphones (I use an iPhone). And I can make sure those conversations are not surveilled thanks to privacy apps like Signal.
All of that would have been significantly more difficult 20 years ago.
When I started at PC Week, I was lugging around a monster Dell "laptop." I didn't even have a cellphone (remember pay phones?), and we used Lotus Notes for email. Watching Notes download email on a dial-up connection while sitting on a convention center floor in Las Vegas was painful.
How has tech reporting as a whole changed over the years?
At the beginning of the dot-com boom in the 1990s, the industry was so much smaller. The executives weren't well known. People were familiar with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, but that was about it. There was more access. Now some tech execs are more famous than movie stars, and they have the armies of publicists that go with that.
The tech press was all about product scoops -- new processors, new software, things that were working well and things that weren't. I suppose that part hasn't changed all that much.
One big change came and went: I was shocked by how many tech reporters took sides and championed the social media companies in their early days. It has been entertaining watching some of the writers who fawned over them position themselves as industry watchdogs in the last year or two.
Today, some tech companies are as influential in the lives of people around the world as governments. They should be scrutinized as closely as governments.
You refuse to ride Uber and other ride-hailing services. Why?
That's not entirely true. I occasionally use ride-hailing services when I have no other choice, like when I'm going to the airport. It's almost impossible to get a traditional taxi in my neighborhood in San Francisco.
But I try to avoid ride-hailing services for the same reason I don't like using food delivery apps and keep my online shopping to a minimum: They extract wealth from local economies and put it in the hands of a small group of people. It is the Walmartization of everything.
I did all of my Christmas shopping at local stores last year. Seriously.
How have you seen the tech industry change San Francisco?
The skyline has a whole lot of new and really big buildings. The cost of living has gone from forbidding when I got here in 1999 to Manhattan-level crazy. We've learned the term "hypergentrification." The population has gotten younger, more childless and more bland.
And people have inexplicably started calling San Francisco the heart of Silicon Valley. (It's not. In truth, Silicon Valley is a stretch of communities along Highway 101 south of San Francisco.)
But despite its many, seemingly intractable problems, I don't buy the notion being played out in the national press (including The New York Times) that the city has turned into an unlivable, dystopian hellscape. What drew me here 20 years ago -- the physical beauty, the diversity, the excitement of a place that's constantly changing and accepts being different -- hasn't gone away.
That said, the San Francisco many of today's newcomers experience saddens me. They pile into the same neighborhood, take the same buses to work, and go to the same bars and restaurants and park (yes, one park in a city full of them) and complain that San Francisco is a monoculture. It's not. Their lifestyle is the monoculture.
I often joke that the worst part of living in San Francisco these days is people whining about living in San Francisco.
What tech product is your daughter currently obsessed with? Do you approve?
The usual for a teenager: YouTube, Snapchat, her iPhone and a near-constant state of Google Hangout with friends. And I'm pretty sure she has "Gilmore Girls," the television show, running on a nonstop loop on Netflix.
She's at an age that if I didn't approve of her tech choices, she'd be even more determined to make them. But I've been blunt with her about the risks, and I hope I taught her to make good decisions. Or at least to learn from Rory Gilmore's mistakes.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: DAMARISCOTTA — Skidompha Library’s Chats with Champions will feature Arlie Russell Hochschild at 10 a.m. Thursday in the Skidompha Library’s Porter Meeting Hall on Main Street. Please allow time for parking.
Hochschild is a renowned professor emerita of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her Chat with Champions at the library will focus on her latest title, “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,” a New York Times Best Seller and finalist for the 2016 National Book Award, according to a news release from the library.
In an era in which most of us live in our own “political bubble,” Hochschild dared to venture from liberal Democratic Berkeley, California, to conservative Republican Lake Charles, Louisiana. By the time Donald Trump had won election to the United States Presidency in 2016, Hochschild had spent five years immersed in the “deep story” of a nation grappling with its identity. Her Chat with Champions will unpack the political trends that elected Trump and offer solutions for moving forward.

Finally, a better bottle for ketchup will soon be everywhere

Texto completo: Remember when ketchup turned upside down? Or when half gallons of milk grew plastic screw caps on their sides? We are resistant to change in food packaging, attached to our squeezy honey bear, Toblerone's triangular prism, the resealable paperboard tube that houses Pringles' neat stack of hyperbolic paraboloid chips.
But what if there's a better way? (Seriously, try going back to doing the pinchy-pully motion to open the cardboard wings of a milk carton without mauling things.)
Something new is coming and soon you will scarcely remember when it didn't exist. It's called the Standcap Inverted Pouch. Daisy brand sour cream led the charge, debuting their Daisy Squeeze in 2015: a soft-sided, inverted wedge shape with a flat, flip-top dispensing closure on which it sits jauntily. It rolls down like a toothpaste tube, uses gravity as an assist and minimizes the introduction of oxygen, thus slowing spoilage.
And now the pouches are coming fast and furious: Chobani whole-milk plain yogurt, Original Uncle Dougie's organic barbecue sauces. A major player in the guacamole business will debut its version Aug. 1.
What's behind the pivot? Some is financially driven: In the first year of its pouch, Daisy reported a 69.7 percent increase in sales (despite charging about 25 percent more per ounce than for the traditional tubs).
But according to Ron Cotterman, vice president of corporate innovation and sustainability for the packaging-solutions company Sealed Air, some of the drive for innovative packaging is a turn away from glass. He says in the past decade there's been a shift for three reasons: One is the cost of transporting and storing a heavy product, the second is the perception of safety (consumers fear breakage and shards) and the third is that there are not a lot of end markets for the glass. There has been a significant shift away from municipalities recycling glass because of the enormous cost associated with it.
"Part of it is consumer-driven, Cotterman says. "But it's also about sustainability. Walmart has its Project Gigaton goal to avoid 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the global value chain by 2030. And Amazon aims to make half of its shipments carbon neutral by 2030.
The race is on to replace heavy, bulky cans and jars with flexible packaging that can be stored flat for shipment before being filled.
That flexible standup pouch requires significantly less water, and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other waste, says Evan Arnold, the director of product development and engineering at flexible packaging firm Glenroy, one of three companies that collaborated on the pouch.
"I just spoke at the Association of Dressings and Sauces technical meeting in Louisville and I asked everyone if they wanted to save the world. And I meant it, kind of, Arnold says.
Fine, world-saving. But let's talk about flips, drips, lips and other quotidian woes. There's the jerking motion required to coax a viscous liquid down the neck of an upright glass or hard plastic bottle (and the anguish of an unexpected deluge), then the wrist-flick flip back upright so gravity halts the flow. There's the goo that accumulates around the lip and cap of a regular bottle. And there's the vexing last 10 percent of a product that clings stubbornly to the container's innards, taunting you and wasting your money.
Aptar is the company responsible for the Standcap's silicone dispensing-valve technology. Regular inverted bottles with dispensing valves have a re-intake of air after you squeeze (like a shampoo bottle). Aptar's invention dispenses and cuts off the product without introducing air. According to Rob Johnson, chief executive of Original Uncle Dougie's, this feature dramatically extends shelf life.
But there are other reasons companies might be shifting to this kind of package. It's about a cultural shift, taking a product like sour cream from an ingredient (the anchor to a casserole or coffee cake) to a condiment.
"All of the research going on would validate this, Johnson says. "More and more people are using dipping sauces as a way for people to add flavor to food. A lot of restaurants are doing that.
The New York Times took some heat several years back for suggesting that millennials were killing breakfast cereal because there was too much cleanup. There is validity to this: Younger generations don't want to dirty silverware if they don't have to. Thus, the condimentization of foods. Look for the Standcap soon for nut butters, salsas and jams, that Aptar valve adjustable for different thickness and chunkiness levels.
For now, the Standcap Inverted Pouch is a novelty that stands out, and up, in the condiment aisle. (The more elongated the package, by the way, the more consumers perceive they contain, so the Standcap may trounce squattier tubs for eye appeal.)
But companies may also be playing to consumer psychology. Products that reside in the door of the refrigerator see more action. A tub gets pushed to the back of the fridge and into Siberia, green fuzz and solitude its inevitable fate. This new technology's upright design makes it door-appropriate, living cheek to jowl with heavy-rotation items. The Standcap Inverted Pouch may, in a sense, give companies a foot in the door.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a clear message for fellow Democrats Wednesday morning after party infighting with some of Congress' most popular new members, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, spilled into public view and on Twitter.
At their weekly breakfast, Pelosi told members of the Democratic caucus that they were a family and have to stick together, while also suggesting they keep their differences private.
"You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it," Pelosi told the group, according to a source in the room. "But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK. "
Pelosi's comments came in the aftermath of bitter party in-fighting with some of the most outspoken progressive members of her caucus: Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. ; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. ; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.
Pelosi's quarrel with the four new freshman members, who each boast large followings on social media, reached a boiling point last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running migrant detention centers.

More: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib fire back at Nancy Pelosi's 'Twitter world' quip
The feud went public, with Pelosi dismissing the four lawmakers in an interview with the New York Times and criticizing them for being the only members to vote against the original version of the spending bill.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said, according to Maureen Dowd's column in the Times. "But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got. "
The lawmakers quickly shot back. "That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment," Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. "And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country. "
In her speech during the weekly morning breakfast on Wednesday, Pelosi seemed to call for peace. She said the fighting was playing "into the hands" of Republicans who want to see divisions.

"On a team you play as a team. If you want to be not on the team, that is OK because that is part of the team spirit – you just want to not play in that round," Pelosi said.
She added, "I hope there will be some level of respect and sensitivity for our – each individual experience that we bring to this caucus. "
She highlighted that the majority of members voted for the border aid bill late last month, sending $4. 6 billion to facilities along the southern border. She said it was fine that she was the target of scrutiny after the House reluctantly passed a Senate version of the bill instead of pushing even further for added restrictions that Democrats said would mandate better care for migrants and children housed in the facilities.
The House version of the funding bill with the restrictions was rejected by the Republican-led Senate.
"I take responsibility," Pelosi said, according to the source. "You make me the target, but don’t make our Blue Dogs and our new Dems the target in all of this because we have important fish to fry. "

Texto completo: The third round of Democratic presidential debates may take place in Houston, according to a report by The New York Times Tuesday.
The New York Times reported that ABC, one of the sponsors of the debates which are scheduled to be held Sept. 12 and 13, is close to completing a contract with a Houston-based venue, though nothing has been signed. The debates, which are expected to feature fewer candidates than the June and July debates because of tougher qualification requirements set by the Democratic National Committee, will also be sponsored by Spanish-language network Univision.
Representatives from the Democratic National Committee did not immediately return a request for comment.
So far, Texas’ presidential hopefuls, Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro, have not yet met the minimum polling requirements to participate in the September debate. Only five candidates have met the stepped-up threshold to participate: former Vice President Joe Biden; U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
The second round of debates will be held in Detroit on July 30 and 31 and televised on CNN.

Texto completo: CLINT — Since the Border Patrol opened its station in Clint in 2013, it was a fixture in this West Texas farm town.
Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town's main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortillería. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickups; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, four miles south.
But inside the secretive site that is now on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.
Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children who were being held in cramped cells, agents said.
The stench of the children's dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents' own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work.
The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.
"It gets to a point where you start to become a robot," said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built.
He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become "heartbreaking."
The little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America's southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw — some of them as young as 5 months old — and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.
Border Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency's El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.
But a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso's eastern edge, shows that the agency's leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.
The accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by The New York Times and The El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
The conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.
By all accounts, the Border Patrol's attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there. "I can't tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed," said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.
Mary E. González, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.
"They said, 'We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us' — agents told me that," Ms. González said. "I genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen."
A forward operating base Architects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base — replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables — from which agents could go on forays along the border. The station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.
Officials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas.
But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station — including lawyers, former detainees and staff members — The Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station's central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.
Parts of the site resemble what might be seen at many government buildings. Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather. But the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.
Beyond the pantry, a door leads to the site's processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children. One of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or "flu cell" for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.
A part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.
Clint is known for holding what agents call U.A.C.'s, or unaccompanied alien children — children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents. Three agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children's rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old.
An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years — and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation — confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.
"We have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of U.A.C. care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can't do that," the agent said. "We can't carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that."
As immigration flows change, the scene inside Clint has shifted as well. The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve overcrowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.
Unaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside. Families, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males "apprehended that morning" were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.
Before the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house ATVs. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.
A chief agent under fire At least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector's brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.
The situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting.
The officials were concerned that Hull had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Hull moved forward with the new procedures. But tension has persisted between Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities.
The officials believe that Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.
Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.
Officials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.
Last month, the acting head of C.B.P., John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation — which is being conducted by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and the department's inspector general — has examined allegations of misconduct. As part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.
The uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant detention centers in the United States.
That is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.
Lawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.
An inspector arrives One day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection's chief accountability officer.
The Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Moak's visit, bulging with 291 children. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.
One girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.
Two sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility's hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. "The sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station," Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls' time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed. Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.
One of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad — 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.
She looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. "My God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here," she recalled.
One teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.
"Did they throw away anything else?" Binford said she had asked her.
"Everything," she replied. "They threw away my baby's diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything."
Once at Clint, she told Binford, the baby's fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. "Who told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?" one of the agents told her, according to the young woman's account to Binford.
Border Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants' needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.
Children sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. "It's never because they're mistreated; it's because they're homesick," she said.

KAMALA'S PROBLEM SHE TENDS TO BLUFF AND FOLDS WHEN CALLED

Texto completo: In the viral moment of the first Democratic presidential debates, Sen. Kamala Harris attacked former vice president Joe Biden over his opposition to forced busing to integrate public schools. The Harris campaign is now waffling on the issue. Over time, we may look back on that as a moment revealing Ms. Harris' underlying weakness as a candidate.
Immediately after the debate, while clips rolled of Ms. Harris touting how she personally benefited from busing, Ms. Harris surged in the polls and Mr. Biden sagged a bit. It is less clear that Ms. Harris successfully cracked Mr. Biden's appeal with black voters, which is likely key to the success of both candidates.
In live dialtests during the debate, Stanley Greenberg found Mr. Biden's favorability with black voters increased 18% as a result of perceived attacks on the Obama-Biden legacy. The ABC News/Washington Post poll indicates Mr. Biden scoring with 41% of black voters and Ms. Harris only 11%.
Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Ms. Harris is having trouble with her position on busing. At first, Ms. Harris leaned into her debate position: "Listen, the schools of America are as segregated if not more segregated today than they were when I was in elementary school. And we need to put every effort including busing into play to desegregate the schools."
By last Wednesday, Ms. Harris reversed her emphasis. When asked whether she supports federally mandated busing, she replied: "I believe that any tool that is in the toolbox should be considered by a school district." The Biden campaign wasted no time pouncing on the shift, with Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield tweeting: "It's disappointing that Senator Harris chose to distort Vice President Biden's position on busing - particularly now that she is tying herself in knots trying not to answer the very question she posed to him!"
Why the waffle? Perhaps Ms. Harris looked at historical polling indicating just how unpopular busing was. Famously, in a 1973 Gallup poll, only 9% of blacks and 4% of whites chose busing as the preferred solution for integrating public schools. In fairness, when polling busing alone, the National Opinion Research Center found consistently stronger support for the idea among blacks and whites, though the trend tended to improve as busing died as a live political issue.
Ian Sams, Ms. Harris' national press secretary, has made two attempts to clean up for the senator. Mr. Sams argued "Harris absolutely believes the federal government was right to step in in the 60s/70s. But surely we can all agree 2019 is not 1975." This line does not square with Harris asserting that schools are more segregated today than in the 1970s.
Mr. Sams also pointed to Mr. Biden's claims that busing is racist. The problem with this line is that racial quotas are not popular and implying Mr. Biden is himself a racist is a problem, given that Ms. Harris denied it in post-debate interviews. To be sure, Ms. Harris probably enjoyed denying it in the sense of not asking people to not think of an elephant. The former prosecutor knows the value of making objectionable statements when the bell cannot be unrung.
Ms. Harris climbing out on limbs is part of an underlying pattern of high-risk publicity-seeking. For example, Ms. Harris garnered headlines during a CNN town hall for declaring she would abolish private health insurance as part of her support for the Medicare-for-all plan proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. She backtracked the next day.
The holiday weekend provided cover to Ms. Harris' latest waffle, but her rivals are beginning to notice. Lis Smith, the communications advisor to Pete Buttigieg, tweeted: "The story of the 2020 Democratic primary shouldn't be how individual candidates used debates to deep-six rivals and push litmus test policies they're gonna disavow once they get a poll back."
If the debate exchange on busing damaged Mr. Biden more from creating the perception he has lost a step, it may damage Ms. Harris by highlighting that she tends to bluff and folds when called. She has not been called often, but if she were the nominee, you could bet on Mr. Trump doing so. That is a bigger problem for Ms. Harris (and Democratic voters) than her position on busing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Ross Perot isn't a familiar name to young Americans, and many older ones are more likely to recall Dana Carvey's impersonation of Mr. Perot on "Saturday Night Live" or his quirky appearances on Larry King's talk show in the 1990s.
But Mr. Perot was a significant figure in modern American politics: He won 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 presidential race against George Bush and Bill Clinton, making him the most successful third-party White House candidate since Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose campaign in 1912.
Mr. Perot did not win any electoral votes, but he ran competitively with those two major-party nominees in much of the country and even outpolled then-President Bush in Maine and Mr. Clinton in Utah. All told, nearly 20 million Americans cast a ballot for Mr. Perot.

Perhaps more important, the unlikely candidacy of Mr. Perot, the Texas business executive who died Tuesday at 89, signaled the tremors beneath the surface of the country's political system that presaged the full-blown earthquake of 2016. President Trump was not the first wealthy, quippy outsider who entered politics by running for president and disrupted the status quo by borrowing from the hymnals of both parties.
Here are four takeaways about Mr. Perot's influence in American politics and how, intentionally or not, he charted a path for Mr. Trump to the White House.
The rise of outsiders
The two men couldn't have looked or sounded much different, but the diminutive, Texarkana-born Mr. Perot and the tall, outer-borough-bred Mr. Trump shared a nose-against-the-glass view of the political class.
By dint of their financial success, both men had ready access to elected officials. But Mr. Perot and Mr. Trump were very much detached from Washington's swirl of lawmakers, lobbyists and policy mavens, and they harbored both contempt and envy for these elites.
[Read the New York Times obituary of Ross Perot here.]
Mr. Perot first broke the mold. There was no precedent for a wealthy, private-sector tycoon upending a presidential race until the founder of Electronic Data Systems came along in early 1992 with his charts and one-liners.
Yet with his loss in 1992 and again in 1996 after a more limited campaign, Mr. Perot demonstrated the limitations of running outside the two-party system.
Mr. Trump flirted for years with his own third-party bid, including in 2000 on the ticket of the Reform Party that Mr. Perot created. But, crucially, Mr. Trump decided to run as a Republican in 2016 and effectively staged a hostile takeover of the G.O.P.
"He said, 'You just have to either be a Democrat or a Republican to win,"' recalled Roger J. Stone, Mr. Trump's former political adviser, in a telephone interview on Tuesday. "He just didn't think it could be done as an independent. Even the weakest Republican candidate begins with 35 percent of the vote."
Neither red nor blue
Presidential campaigns changed in hugely important ways between 1992 and 2016, but one common thread between those two campaign years was the political homelessness of a pivotal, and oft-discussed, segment of the electorate: working-class white voters.
Often too culturally conservative to support Democratic candidates, yet with more fiscally liberal views than those of Republican leaders, these voters drifted to Mr. Perot and then surged to Mr. Trump.
Both Mr. Perot and Mr. Trump ran fiercely anti-free-trade campaigns while also calling for a hard line on immigration. Would Mr. Trump's jeremiads against Nafta have been as effective if Mr. Perot hadn't laid the predicate by attacking Nafta in the 1990s and warning against the job losses he argued it would bring? Indeed, the line most people remember from Mr. Perot is his prediction from the second presidential debate in October 1992 that enacting Nafta would send American jobs to Mexico. "There will be a giant sucking sound going south," he said.
While some Republicans and others initially assumed that Mr. Bush would have won re-election in 1992 election without Mr. Perot on the ballot, many political scientists believe Mr. Perot's change-hungry voters would have stayed home or supported Mr. Clinton if the businessman had not been in the race.
As James Carville, Mr. Clinton's top strategist in 1992, put it in a documentary on Mr. Perot: "If Donald Trump is the kind of Jesus of the disenchanted, displaced non-college white voter, then Perot was the John the Baptist of that sort of movement."
Notably, though, Mr. Perot did not use the sort of divisive language against immigrants and refugees that was a centerpiece of Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and his presidency.
Going around the filter
Mr. Perot and Mr. Trump were hardly anonymous businessmen when they plunged into electoral politics. Mr. Perot had gained fame when he financed a campaign to rescue employees of his company in Iran -- a daring mission memorialized in "On Wings of Eagles," a best-selling book and mini-series -- and he was a vocal supporter of attempting to rescue remaining prisoners of war in Vietnam. Mr. Trump, of course, was a New York tabloid fixture in the 1980s and resuscitated his flagging business career by starring in a reality show.
So when they began running for president, both men knew they would have an ability to amplify their political message beyond the traditional news media and campaign trail reporters.
For Mr. Perot, that meant frequent appearances with Mr. King, who offered an open microphone and millions of viewers for the graphs the businessman liked to hold up for the cameras. In Mr. Trump's case, it was his adoption of Twitter and, during the 2016 campaign, his willingness to call into just about any television program that invited him.
The art of the sound bite
Untethered from the constraints of the political establishment, both Mr. Perot and Mr. Trump were willing to make provocative comments that drove news coverage and helped shape the contours of the debate.
They knew that catchy sound bites would resonate with many voters more than in-depth policy proposals, and they believed entertaining was essential to electioneering. Indeed, long before Mr. Trump was bestowing juvenile nicknames on his rivals, Mr. Perot was doing down-home bits in his Texas twang that was the stuff of dreams for satirists.
"The debt is like a crazy aunt we keep down in the basement," Mr. Perot said about another of his favorite topics. "All the neighbors know she's there, but nobody wants to talk about her."
The voices, the tics, the facial expressions -- both candidates at times could have been mistaken for "S.N.L." characters, or caricatures, playing themselves.
As Dr. Larry J. Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist, put it: "You didn't even need a comic to imitate them."

Texto completo: Retired Marine to run against GOP leader, cast as Trump's accomplice
Democrats are increasingly focused on making Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a political villain as they attempt to win back control of the Senate in next year's election and galvanize the party's liberal base.
That effort gained new momentum on Tuesday as Amy McGrath, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and combat pilot, announced she would challenge McConnell (R-Ky.) and blamed him for turning Washington into "something we despise" in a campaign video that drew millions of views.
While McGrath faces a steep climb against McConnell in ruby-red Kentucky, which President Trump carried by 30 percentage points in 2016, she is expected to raise significant funds from national Democrats and provide the party with a relentless and high-profile opponent.
McGrath's entry comes two weeks after Democrats succeeded in recruiting Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon to run against Sen. Susan Collins (R). Gideon previewed her campaign by putting McConnell front and center in her announcement video, showing several clips of him and criticizing Collins for working with the GOP leader and Trump to overhaul the federal judiciary and tax code.
"The majority leader has extraordinary power and is the primary obstacle to getting things done here in the U.S. Senate," Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in an interview Tuesday. "He is also the face of acquiescence to Trump and the Republicans' lack of a spine. The most effective arguments are often about a personality, a personal face and a story, and this story has the great virtue of being true."
The latest critiques reflect a growing movement within Democratic ranks to make the 2020 election cycle not just a referendum on Trump, but also a purging of McConnell and entrenched Republicans who have given conservatives immense sway over policy and judicial vacancies while enabling Trump's priorities, from hard-line immigration policies at the U.S.-Mexico border to sweeping deregulation.
Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority, and Democrats see opportunities to reclaim the Senate with an unpopular president at the top of the ticket and the GOP defending nearly twice as many seats. But a handful of marquee recruits, like former state legislative leader Stacey Abrams in Georgia, have declined to run, and a few presidential candidates have shown no interest in abandoning a White House bid for a Senate campaign.
Joining the anti-McConnell chorus are the presidential candidates, who have called the Republican a direct threat to making progress on signature party issues such as gun control, health care and climate change.
"We're not going to get anywhere as long as Mitch McConnell has the keys to the car," Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democratic presidential contender, said earlier this year at a forum in Austin.
That sentiment was evident at last month's Democratic presidential debates in Florida when 2020 candidates were asked by moderators about their plans to deal with McConnell if they win.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who favors getting rid of the legislative filibuster to eliminate obstacles if Democrats win the Senate, said she would push McConnell "from the outside, have leadership from the inside and make this Congress reflect the will of the people."
McConnell later said he was "thrilled" with the mentions.
The fixation on McConnell has echoes of how Republicans used Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as a strategic bugbear in their 2010 campaign to capture the House majority, and consultants say it could help Democrats draw attention to contests that until recently have flown under the radar as the crowded presidential primary has heated up and Trump makes headlines.
"Whether Trump wins or loses, a Democratic Senate is the ultimate way of stopping him and his agenda, once and for all," Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic senatorial aide, said. "And in a hyperpartisan environment, making McConnell a symbol could serve as a powerful inducement."
Still, Manley said, Democrats must work to raise McConnell's profile nationally and keep up sustained attacks because Trump's overwhelming presence makes McConnell an effective but far lesser known foil.
McConnell, one of the nation's highest-ranking leaders, is the polar opposite of Trump in terms of personality: an exceedingly dry, clipped and occasionally droll politician. He relishes his reputation as the "grim reaper" of the Senate who blocks Democratic legislation and liberal ambitions.
Democratic leaders, such as Pelosi, have worked to remind voters this summer that McConnell should be held responsible for his alliance with Trump and the conditions at migrant detention centers. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said Monday that she is "appalled by the conditions" facing families who have crossed into the United States.
"Mitch McConnell doesn't care about the children,'' Pelosi said in a recent interview with the New York Times.
McConnell did not express any concern about McGrath on Tuesday, telling reporters it would be a "spirited race."
"Particularly since I've become leader of my party in the Senate, I've noticed I get more attention than I used to," he said.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called McGrath a "great candidate" and said "she realizes this is a tough fight. She realizes that Mitch McConnell will throw the kitchen sink at her."
McGrath, 44, narrowly lost a House race last year against Rep. Garland "Andy" Barr (R-Ky.) and has since remained in the political spotlight. In December, she said she would not run for governor, stoking speculation that she would run for the seat that McConnell, 77, has held since 1985.
McConnell's campaign responded with a video of its own, which used McGrath's statements from her House race to portray her as "too liberal for Kentucky." The video included clips of McGrath calling Trump's proposed border wall "stupid" and advocating for single-payer health care.
She is also shown comparing the way she felt after Trump's election in 2016 to the way she felt after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Trump tweeted his support for McConnell Tuesday evening, calling him "our great Kentucky senator" and writing, "Why would Kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in Congress, the Senate Majority Leader, for a freshman Senator with little power."
While the 2020 Senate landscape is more favorable to Democrats than in the brutal 2018 midterms, where they saw a net loss of two seats despite a massive surge in national Democratic turnout, the uncertainties of the presidential race and a decline in ticket-splitting offer them only a narrow path to a majority next year.
Democrats would need to capture at least three additional seats and win the White House to control the Senate in 2021.
Thirty-four Senate seats are up next year, with Republicans defending 22 and Democrats 12. Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Collins are widely considered the most vulnerable Republicans.
Democrats, meanwhile, have to defend two seats in states Trump won in 2016 - Alabama and Michigan.
But Democrats are buoyed by possible Republican pitfalls in Alabama and Kansas, where party infighting has complicated Senate primary races.
In Alabama, Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court justice who lost to Sen. Doug Jones (D) in a 2017 special election amid accusations of sexual misconduct with underage girls in the late 1970s, is running again. Trump, who backed Moore in 2017, has called for him to stand down.
In Kansas, Kris Kobach - the former Kansas attorney general who lost his race for governor last year and has struggled to win votes in suburban areas of his state because of his hard-line views on immigration, voting rights and fiscal policy - announced his Senate bid on Monday to fill the Republican seat being vacated by Sen. Pat Roberts after four terms.
McConnell expressed optimism Tuesday when asked about both races. "In all likelihood, the voters of Alabama are not going to need any advice from us," he said. "I think they've seen quite enough of Roy Moore, and I anticipate we will have a different nominee in the fall election."
On Kobach, McConnell said, "The Kansas race is open, and I'm not sure the president agrees with me, but I'd like to see the secretary of state (Mike Pompeo) run for the Senate in Kansas." He said he continues to try to recruit Pompeo, who had represented Kansas in the House. The filing deadline for the Senate race is next June.
Democrats, while enthused about McGrath and Gideon, among others, are eager for some presidential candidates to end their campaigns and "jump into the Senate mix," Manley said.
Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, all of whom have failed to gain traction in the polls, are at the top of most Democrats' recruiting list.

Tariffs, retaliation, and the flu

Texto completo: History shows that “easy” tariff wars are not all that easy. In the current battle between the Trump administration and China, the EU, Mexico, Canada, and others, the conflict has seemed to be about economics such as tariffs. However, the administration has now linked them, in the case of Mexico, to immigration and drug policy and even a salve to farmers hurt by ongoing tariff wars — all in non-specific and seemingly ad hoc terms. But tariffs wars may soon careen into issues of public health.
Specifically, China has signaled that in part in response to President Trump’s trade tactics, it has stopped the process of sharing information concerning Avian flu viruses emanating from its chicken farmers. These viruses travel annually westward, and will again this year, to infect human populations. The most important strain, H7N9, is lethal to 40 percent of the people who contract it.
In a report in the New York Times late in the summer of 2018 (Aug. 27), Emily Baumgartner noted that despite repeated requests, China has not provided samples of H7N9, usually exchanged readily by the World Health Organization (WHO). Unlike shortages in aluminum or rare earth minerals or soybeans, the article cites Dr. Michael Callahan of the Harvard Medical School, who noted that such restrictions on access to new flu strains could counter our ability “to protect against infections which can spread globally within days.” As Andrew C. Weber, who was responsible for biological defense programs in the Obama administration said, “not sharing it immediately with the global network of WHO laboratories like CDC is scandalous. Many could die needlessly if China denies international access to samples.”
Noteworthy impact
While the interface of trade policy and public health is not often mentioned, the impact of trade disputes on the transmission of human illness — both direct and indirect — is noteworthy. While economic disputes over soybeans or aluminum or other goods and services may seem unconnected to dying from the flu, they are not. The Trump administration’s tariff measures, announced by the U.S. against China and more recently in immigration-linked threats against Mexico, have been driven by an extraordinary naiveté about and ignorance of history.
In the early 1930s, the U.S.-imposed Smoot-Hawley tariff led to an escalating series of countermeasures from Europe that deepened and prolonged the Great Depression. It also led to privation in Europe in which Fascism festered, and encouraged, if it did not cause, World War II. Millions of lives were spent. The realization that tariffs played such a role led to a set of rules which reduced net effective rates of protection from close to 50 cents on the dollar after World War II to about 5 cents in the mid-1980s. Since then, however, especially after the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) in the early 1990s, the postwar consensus on trade liberalization has broken down, as memories fade and grievances mount.
Despite the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement, paired with NAFTA in 1992 and 1993, these grievances, especially in the U.S., have created fertile ground for protectionists such as Trump to exploit. It is striking how much of his rhetoric over NAFTA and trade, claiming that American workers have been cheated by globalization, resembles the exhortations to Germans in the 1930s to rise up against their betrayal by the Versailles Treaty and the ill-advised reparations imposed by the Allies after World War I. While NAFTA and other trade agreements have surely encouraged sectoral reallocation and some unemployment, they are not prime movers compared to robotics, informatics and other technological changes.
An invitation to retaliation
Specifically, they fail to appreciate the basic game-theoretic idea that the countries targeted by U.S. tariffs will not sit still and simply take it. In addition, economic theory strongly suggests that tariffs are most effective when you pick on someone smaller (perhaps it’s no coincidence Melania has taken an interest in juvenile bullying, domestically). But to pick on someone nearly your economic equal, like China, is to invite retaliation you may grow to regret. In the case of Mexico, while U.S. threats are credible, the impact of NAFTA, by encouraging growth in the Mexican economy, has actually been to ease the economic motive for migration.
China has shown itself to be both restrained and sophisticated in response to U.S. provocations, targeting commodities for retaliation, especially in the agricultural Midwest, where Trump’s electoral base largely resides. But Chinese retaliation and resentment runs deeper, indicating the profound damages that brusque trade-bullying tactics may incite, to potentially lethal effect if the world’s largest nation turns toward breaking down international collaboration on issues of health security.
One of the great challenges of government policy in this century is understanding the links from politics to science. In this respect, quite apart from Trump’s inability and unwillingness to acknowledge the threats of climate change, the current administration has failed the country. Whoever runs against him in the next election would do well to note that Trump has not only failed to competitively position the U.S. in the world economy, but toward external threats to health security, he has made our defenses weaker.

Texto completo: The day after his dismal showing in the first Democratic debates, former Vice President Joe Biden said in Chicago: "Folks, the discussion in this race shouldn’t be about the past." He’s right, of course. American politics is always about the future. But Biden doesn’t take his own advice. The candidate and his surrogates seem obsessed with talking about his resume: 36 years in the Senate, eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president. The effect is to reinforce his advanced age — he’ll be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 — and his disconnection from current trends and topics.
Even as a younger and more vigorous figure, Biden was a deeply flawed presidential candidate in 1988 and 2008. And all his weaknesses, aggravated by age, were on full display during the debate in Miami. A post-debate poll by CNN saw him dropping 10 points, from 32% to 22%, while two younger female senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, surged upward.
Here’s the huge and growing problem staring Democrats in the face: Biden might be a miscast messenger, but his political position as a pragmatic progressive gives the party its best chance of defeating Donald Trump. If the Democrats abandon the middle ground and veer too far to the left, they are doomed to four more years of Trump in the White House and a generation of conservative justices dominating the Supreme Court.

Texto completo: The day after his dismal showing in the first Democratic debates, former Vice President Joe Biden said in Chicago: "Folks, the discussion in this race shouldn’t be about the past." He’s right, of course. American politics is always about the future. But Biden doesn’t take his own advice. The candidate and his surrogates seem obsessed with talking about his resume: 36 years in the Senate, eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president. The effect is to reinforce his advanced age — he’ll be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 — and his disconnection from current trends and topics.
Even as a younger and more vigorous figure, Biden was a deeply flawed presidential candidate in 1988 and 2008. And all his weaknesses, aggravated by age, were on full display during the debate in Miami. A post-debate poll by CNN saw him dropping 10 points, from 32% to 22%, while two younger female senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, surged upward.
Here’s the huge and growing problem staring Democrats in the face: Biden might be a miscast messenger, but his political position as a pragmatic progressive gives the party its best chance of defeating Donald Trump. If the Democrats abandon the middle ground and veer too far to the left, they are doomed to four more years of Trump in the White House and a generation of conservative justices dominating the Supreme Court. The debates in Miami showed that’s exactly where the party is headed. On a range of issues from immigration and health care to tax rates and climate change, the loudest voices espoused policies far outside the American mainstream. Rick Tyler, a conservative Republican strategist, accurately summed up the main lesson coming out of the Democratic debates for The Washington Post: "They are not talking to the blue-collar workers that I understand that vote in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Are they seriously capable of choosing a nominee who is going to beat Donald Trump? Right now I have my doubts."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors have intensified their wide-ranging federal investigation into Elliott Broidy, a top fund-raiser for President Trump, signaling the Justice Department's continued interest in questions about foreign influence on the administration.
In recent months, federal authorities have searched Mr. Broidy's Southern California office and subpoenaed records related to him from a onetime business partner and from Mr. Trump's inaugural committee. They have reportedly asked the authorities in Romania for assistance investigating associates with whom Mr. Broidy worked to win military intelligence contracts potentially worth as much as $ 64 million.
They have also charged four people who worked with Mr. Broidy on plans to influence the administration, including on behalf of interests in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. While the charges against three of his associates were unrelated to their work with Mr. Broidy, most have been asked about their relationships with him, according to several people familiar with the investigation.
Taken together, the steps suggest mounting pressure on Mr. Broidy. And they underscore the legal questions raised by his efforts to parlay his access into business advantage in the frenetic weeks after Mr. Trump's election, and then to influence the new administration's policies toward the Middle East, where he was pursuing contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
The scrutiny comes as the Justice Department has stepped up its enforcement of foreign lobbying laws and continues to investigate whether foreign money was illegally funneled into Mr. Trump's super PAC or inaugural committee.
Mr. Broidy's lawyers have contended that he did not do anything that would require him to lobby. One of the lawyers, Chris Clark, said in an email on Monday that he dismissed as "utterly false" the idea that his client used his connections to Mr. Trump to drum up business.
During Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and transition, few establishment power brokers had ties to him, creating a vacuum that gave tremendous influence to the relatively small group of people who could demonstrate real connections.
While Mr. Broidy had initially supported a succession of Mr. Trump's Republican presidential rivals, he enthusiastically joined Mr. Trump's campaign when he emerged as the party's presumptive nominee. After helping raise money for Mr. Trump's campaign, Mr. Broidy became a finance vice chairman of Mr. Trump's inaugural committee, helping it raise a record-shattering $ 107 million.
Mr. Broidy, who bought a defense intelligence company called Circinus in 2015, marketed his access to Mr. Trump and his inauguration to prospective government clients around the world, including some with unsavory records, according to dozens of interviews and thousands of documents stolen from Mr. Broidy's accounts and provided to The New York Times and other news outlets.
Three weeks before the inauguration, Mr. Broidy emailed invitations to coveted inaugural events to Angolan officials. He also sent them a version of a proposal under which Angola would pay Circinus as much as $ 64 million for security services over five years. The Angolans submitted a $ 6 million payment to Circinus three days before the inauguration, correspondence shows, though the company did not collect any additional funds from Angola, according to people close to Mr. Broidy.
One of the Angolan officials invited by Mr. Broidy, André de Oliveira João Sango, who was then serving as the director of external intelligence, was identified by The Times' TV show, "The Weekly," on the red carpet at a candlelight dinner attended by Mr. Trump the night before the inauguration. Another of the Angolan invitees, João Lourenço, has since been elected the country's president.
At an informal inauguration week dinner at the Trump International Hotel near the White House, Mr. Broidy introduced Mr. Trump to two politicians from Romania, from which Circinus was seeking contracts valued at more than $ 200 million. One of the Romanian politicians, Liviu Dragnea, was facing corruption charges that have since led to a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence.
Mr. Dragnea, Mr. Lourenço and Mr. Sango were among the individuals named in a subpoena sent to Mr. Trump's inaugural committee in April.
The Embassies of Romania and Angola in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. But Romanian news outlets have reported that the Justice Department has asked Romanian authorities for assistance in collecting information from Mr. Dragnea and others about their inauguration week visit to Washington.
Also named in the subpoena was Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the longtime president of the Republic of Congo, who has been accused of funding a lavish lifestyle with public resources. He was invited by Mr. Broidy to a handful of inauguration week events, including the candlelight dinner, while Circinus was pursuing business in that country. The business never materialized, and Mr. Sassou-Nguesso declined the invitation to the inauguration festivities, according to people close to Mr. Broidy.
The inaugural committee has responded to the subpoena, a person familiar with the committee said. The subpoena to the committee was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and was issued by the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn.
A person close to Mr. Broidy rejected the suggestion that the subpoena represented an escalation of or an expansion in the investigation of Mr. Broidy. The person said that for the past year, Mr. Broidy has been the subject of an investigation being conducted by the public integrity section of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, using a grand jury empaneled in Washington.
The public integrity section late last year issued a subpoena to Lisa Korbatov, a Los Angeles conservative activist who worked with Mr. Broidy on his arrangement with the Angolan government, for documents related to Mr. Broidy, Circinus and other companies, according to a person familiar with the investigation.
But, highlighting the overlap between the work of different federal prosecutors, Ms. Korbatov was also named in the Brooklyn prosecutors' subpoena of the inaugural committee. So, too, were two other Broidy associates involved in the Angola arrangement -- Dolapo Asiru, a Nigeria-born California investment banker, and Nickie Lum Davis, a political fund-raiser who has retained the prominent trial lawyer Abbe D. Lowell to represent her.
Ms. Davis and Mr. Broidy have also attracted scrutiny in a related matter being handled by the Justice Department's public integrity section -- the investigation into an alleged scheme to launder millions of dollars into the country to help a flamboyant Malaysian financier known as Jho Low end a Justice Department investigation.
Another figure in that investigation, the entertainer and businessman Pras Michel, was charged in May with conspiring to funnel millions of dollars of Mr. Low's money into the 2012 presidential election. Mr. Michel, a former member of the Fugees, a defunct hip-hop group, has been asked by prosecutors for information on what Mr. Broidy did to help the financier.
Mr. Broidy's lawyers have said he never lobbied the Trump administration to end the investigation into the Malaysian fund.
Two other associates of Mr. Broidy's have cooperated with prosecutors after being caught up in the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Rick Gates, who was paid at least $ 125,000 by Mr. Broidy for advice on navigating the Trump administration, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the F.B.I. And George Nader, a political adviser to the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates who helped Mr. Broidy's company win contracts worth at least $ 200 million with the oil-rich gulf nation, cooperated with Mr. Mueller's team before being arrested this month on child pornography charges.

Texto completo: The townhouse where the financier Jeffrey Epstein is accused of engaging in sex acts with underage girls is one of the largest private homes in Manhattan, a short walk from Central Park.
The seven-story residence at 9 East 71st Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, sprawls across 21,000 square feet and has five bathrooms, a two-story reception room and many bedrooms, including three three-room suites on the fourth floor.
It also has a heated sidewalk in front to melt the snow during the winter months. On the second floor is a mural that Mr. Epstein had commissioned in recent years: a photorealistic prison scene that included barbed wire, corrections officers and a guard station, with Mr. Epstein portrayed in the middle.
"He said, 'That's me, and I had this painted because there is always the possibility that could be me again,"' said R. Couri Hay, a public relations specialist invited by Mr. Epstein to a meeting at his home and to view the mural three months ago.
A person who visited the townhouse last year remembered Mr. Epstein doing work at the mansion while seated at a large dining table that fit 20 people, with multiple computer monitors and a phone alongside.
Mr. Epstein answered calls while hosting visitors, according to that person and another visitor last year who saw similar behavior. Behind him was a table covered with framed photographs of celebrities and dignitaries, including a signed photograph of former President Bill Clinton.
The visitors each said they were greeted by a tall woman who spoke with an Eastern European accent, who led guests up a marble staircase to a study on another floor. At the base of the stairwell, one of the visitors said, Mr. Epstein had placed a chess board with custom figurines dressed in underwear -- each piece, he noted, was modeled after one of his staffers.
He decorated the home with other oddities, like a life-size female doll hanging from a chandelier, and had arranged a small dining room to resemble a beach scene.
A wall of the study was covered with photographs of famous people, including Woody Allen, and another that Mr. Epstein pointed out was of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Epstein, 66, is accused of engaging in sex acts with young girls from 2002 to 2005 during naked massage sessions and paying them hundreds of dollars in cash, according to an indictment unsealed on Monday.
During the search of his townhouse on Saturday, investigators seized photographs of nude underage girls, federal prosecutors said. "The alleged behavior shocks the conscience," Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said on Monday.
Prosecutors said they were moving to seize Mr. Epstein's townhouse.
Mr. Epstein, however, was not even supposed to become the owner of the opulent stone house on the Upper East Side.
In 1989, Mr. Epstein's mentor, Leslie H. Wexner, the founder and chairman of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, bought the seven-story Beaux-Arts home for $ 13.2 million. At the time, it was the highest recorded sale price for a townhouse in Manhattan.
Mr. Wexner then spent at least that much on artwork -- including multiple works by Picasso -- Art Deco furnishings, Russian antiques, rosewood tables and doors and a gut renovation of the home. Security devices, including a network of cameras, were installed. A cellar was divided into separate spaces, one for red wines and another for white. The renovation was featured on the cover of the December 1995 issue of Architectural Digest.
The townhouse had been a longtime private school and Mr. Wexner spent years converting it into a lavish estate.
Mr. Wexner, however, never moved in; he decided to stay in Columbus, Ohio, where L Brands has its headquarters.
But another person did move in: Mr. Epstein. "Les never spent more than two months there," Mr. Epstein told The New York Times in 1996.
The home has a history of going unoccupied by its owner. Herbert N. Straus, an heir to the Macy's fortune, commissioned the 40-room mansion in the early 1930s and hired the prominent architect Horace Trumbauer to design it. But Mr. Straus died in 1933, leaving the property unfinished and unoccupied.
The Straus family gave the residence to a hospital in 1944. In 1962, the private school, Birch Wathen School, bought it and converted it into a schoolhouse. The school, which was started in 1921 with an emphasis on the arts, relocated after Mr. Wexner bought the house. (It later merged with another private school to start the Birch Wathen Lenox School.)
Mr. Epstein said in the 1996 interview that the mansion was now his, though the transaction has never appeared in New York City records online. In 2011, he transferred ownership of the property from a trust connected to Mr. Epstein and Mr. Wexner to Maple Inc., a United States Virgin Islands-based entity under Mr. Epstein's control, according to records.
The transfer document, from Nine East 71st Street Corporation to Maple Inc., did not list a purchase price, indicating that it did not involve any exchange of money.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Wexner said that he "severed ties" with Mr. Epstein about a decade ago. Erika Kellerhals, a lawyer in the Virgin Islands who handled the 2011 transfer for Mr. Epstein, did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Prosecutors say the home is valued at $ 77 million, but the city's Department of Finance estimated this year that the mansion was valued closer to $ 56 million. The 2019 property taxes for the home, which are based on a much lower assessed value, were an estimated $ 347,000. (The property's tax bill in 2008 was the fourth-highest-taxed single-family home in New York City.)
Mr. Epstein also owns a home in Palm Beach, Fla., a 7,500-acre ranch in New Mexico and an apartment in Paris. He also owns Little St. James Island, a private island in the Caribbean, and at least 15 cars.
A spokesman for Mr. Clinton, whose photograph was on display in Mr. Epstein's mansion, said that the former president "made one brief visit" around 2002 to the New York home with a staff member and security officials. Mr. Clinton has not talked to Mr. Epstein in more than a decade and has not visited his properties in the Caribbean, Florida or New Mexico, the statement said.
From the street, Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion has features that make it a commanding presence on the block: a 15-foot-tall oak front door (which the police pried open with a crowbar on Saturday during a search of the property), large arched windows on the ground floor and a balcony on the second floor. Mr. Epstein's initials are on a brass plaque near the front door.
While Mr. Epstein has tried to maintain a private life, he did allow a reporter for Vanity Fair magazine to visit the mansion for a 2003 profile, "The Talented Mr. Epstein."
The article describes a main hallway that was covered with rows of artificial eyeballs from England that had been made for wounded soldiers.
The room connected to the hallway was a marble foyer adorned with a painting that resembled works by the French artist Jean Dubuffet. "The host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it," the reporter, Vicky Ward, wrote.
The article was published around the same time that he started to recruit underage girls to the mansion, according to the indictment unsealed on Monday.
Nellie Bowles, Matthew Goldstein and Sarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Headnote 'Heritage Taken Away'
Since the 1930s, the women of Bennett College, one of the nation's two historically Black colleges for women, have dressed in white and sung their "Preference Song" over an annual breakfast. They wave white linen napkins in the air, cheering "dear old Bennett College," and welcome incoming freshmen.
The tradition, near and dear to the Belles of Bennett College, may soon be lost, along with the school itself.
In December, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges voted to eliminate Bennett's accreditation because of the school's bleak financial report. Without it, the small, North Carolina-based private school is ineligible for federal funding, a likely death knell.
Bennett, founded in 1873, is fighting the decision in court. If it loses, it will become the latest in a long line of historically Black colleges and universities to succumb to time and financial woes.
For nearly 200 years, since the opening of Pennsylvania's Cheyney University in 1837, HBCUs have educated thousands of students, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, Toni Morrison, Rep. Elijah Cummings and Sen. Kamala Harris.
But from a high of 120 such schools to about 101 in 2019, many have faced an uncertain future. In the last 20 years, six have closed, and several others remain open in name only after losing accreditation.
Cheyney University, the nation's oldest HBCU, is also at risk of losing its accreditation. Years of unbalanced budgets and declining enrollment have led the school, which is a part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, to cut majors and programs.
Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the regional accrediting body, has already granted Cheyney a two-year extension to balance its budget and the university has been on probation since 2015. Cheyney must meet a handful of obligations in the coming months to maintain its accreditation. Among those was a June 30 deadline to balance its budget, which school administrators said they have done. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education will evaluate the school and determine the status of its accreditation in November.
According to students, the loss of just one historically Black university - at one point the only option for Black students seeking a college degree in America - is bound to reverberate for generations. We spoke to three Black HBCU graduates whose schools are now closed about what the loss of these institutions means to them.
Concordia College, Selma, Alabama (1922-2018)
Maria Moore, 31, graduated from Concordia on April 28, 2018, with more than 150 other students. She transferred there in 2014 from Alabama's Wallace Community College.
Moore said she had a hard time adjusting. The school lacked basic resources such as a student center and the smart boards that were available at Wallace, and the buildings were old, as were the classrooms and desks, she said.
"The school was a culture shock for me. Even though I am African American, I was used to seeing different people," Moore said. She attended Concordia for one semester and withdrew.
But after an unsuccessful move to Georgia, Moore decided to return a year later to complete her degree. It was the sense of community at the school that brought her back. "It was like a family, people actually cared and coached me through things," she said. "When I was tired, I could go to my teachers, my advisers, unlike at community college. The people wanted you to be there."
When Moore learned the school would close, she said she was devastated. "I was really concerned about the staff and teachers looking for other jobs - this was their livelihood. Some had to move out West, some are still out of work. That is a form of trauma," she said.
Moore now works at AmeriCorps, a nonprofit social justice organization, as a facilitator focused on King's strategies of nonviolence. She said she worries about the fate of the nation's remaining HBCUs.
"African-American community culture has already been whitewashed, so to not have anything at all that's not yours, I don't want to think about it," she said. "It's like a part of your heritage is taken away, like during slavery."
Morristown College, Morristown, Tennessee (1881-1994)
Robert Johnson, 53, graduated from Morristown College in 1988, with a class size close to 100.
Johnson, a Philadelphia native, said that attending Morristown College was his first time away from home, but that the school, which had a predominantly Black staff and a majority of students from out of state, had a tight-knit community.
"It gave a feeling of being home and also growing up," he said. "It's a place where I grew so much, more than I did anywhere else. I grew as a person, grew spiritually because Morristown had a rich spiritual life."
The school merged in 1989 with Knoxville College, another HBCU in Tennessee, but closed in 1994. Johnson said the quality of the education he received at Morristown was high, and that despite the school's financial troubles, it was a place where students could matriculate to a larger university.
"We understood that there had to be an air of excellence: This was where we were to go to the next phase of the journey. We couldn't be as good as, we had to be better than," he said.
After receiving an associate degree from Morristown, Johnson attended Albright College in Pennsylvania, graduating with a bachelor of arts, and then the United Theological Seminary in Ohio, where he received a master's of divinity. He is now the senior pastor at the historical Tindley Temple United Methodist Church in Philadelphia.
"HBCUs need investments from our own community. Our millionaires and philanthropists and churches should take the time to invest in HBCUs," he said. "They are struggling because there has always been a shoestring mentality."
In May, billionaire investor Robert F. Smith pledged to pay the collective student debt of the entire 2019 Morehouse College graduating class.
"HBCUs are definitely needed on two levels," Johnson said. "One, there is something about HBCUs that lends itself to a pride for community; it calls us into a culture of oneness. There is a need for them to be nurtured and not to be swallowed up at traditional universities.
"Second, they are needed because we are rapidly losing our history and sense of belonging. They are needed now more than ever due to violence and other things going on in the community."
Saint Paul's College, Lawrenceville, Virginia (1888-2013)
Sonya Perdue Bolton, 55, graduated from Saint Paul's College in 2013. It was the school's last graduating class. Bolton initially attended Saint Paul's in 1983, and made the dean's list in her first semester.
"Saint Paul's was large enough,to be a college, but small enough to be a family," Bolton said. "I am friends today with people from Saint Paul's, I am still in touch with my first roommate."
In Bolton's sophomore year, her mother passed away. "The college was very supportive, they took two van loads of people from college to my hometown for mom's funeral. Some people drove, including a couple of deans," she said.
Bolton returned for her junior year, but withdrew and got married.
After raising her family, she learned about the school's accelerated adult completion program, which helps working adults gain a degree through a schedule of night classes and abridged courses. Bolton decided to finish her degree.
"I kept saying, 'I am going back to school.' I wanted to go back to Saint Paul's, I wanted my degree to be from Saint Paul's," she said.
Twenty-six years after first enrolling, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. Bolton, who now works as a deputy for the Portsmouth City Treasurer's Office in Virginia, said she was "absolutely heartbroken and saddened about the closure of the school."

Texto completo: In 2016, when the Zika virus first made headlines, people canceled vacations to Latin America and the Caribbean as the mosquito-borne virus spread through the region and into Texas and Florida. While the illness caused by Zika is mild, it can cause severe birth defects when pregnant women are exposed to it. But almost as quickly as it had taken over headlines, it seemed to disappear from the news.
But last week, the World Health Organization, as part of a report on the virus, updated its guidance for travelers planning to visit areas where Zika is known. It has been identified in 87 countries, including Brazil, China, India and Egypt.
"The good news is that we haven't been hearing about Zika because transmission has been low," said Dr. Eve Lackritz, who leads the Zika Task Force at WHO. "Transmission dropped dramatically through 2017 and 2018, but when we have an end of an epidemic we don't stop our work."
The WHO update comes a few months after the Centers for Disease Control downgraded its Zika warning. The CDC and WHO said that although the disease has for the moment receded around the world, it is still circulating at a lower level.
"The only way to avoid it is to not travel at all, but ultimately the risk will not be zero," Lackritz said. "People have to make their personal choices accordingly, but we have a number of messages for how they can protect themselves."
Here are answers to questions about Zika and travel.
Q: Is travel to a country with Zika safe?
A: For most people, yes. Zika symptoms are relatively mild and last only a few days, but issues arise for women who are pregnant or couples thinking about getting pregnant. Zika is mostly spread through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes, but it can also spread through sex with an infected person, so couples should talk to their doctors about risks before traveling.
"If there's a place that someone has to travel while pregnant then all the strategies for prevention are paramount after you've had a conversation about whether you absolutely must go," said Dr. Emily Adhikari, assistant professor of maternal fetal medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the medical director of the obstetric infectious disease clinic at Parkland Hospital in Dallas.
Q: Is there a better time to go?
A: The virus is still circulating in Brazil and other countries that were at the center of the epidemic, but it is less prevalent in colder months than in the summer. Travelers can take that into account when planning a trip.
"Summer in the north is winter in the south and vice versa, so you have to consider that," said Dr. Ernesto T.A. Marques Jr., associate professor at the Infectious Diseases Department at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. "The mosquito season is usually the summer in the southern hemisphere. In the winter the population of mosquitoes is much lower, so try to plan, if possible, to go in winter and stay in cities."
Q: How can I protect myself?
A: The WHO suggests a number of ways to protect your skin while in an area with Zika transmission, including wearing light-colored clothing that covers as much of the body as possible and using mosquito repellent. If you use repellent and sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and then the repellent, the guidelines say.
"Avoid exposing the skin, the least skin you have exposed, the odds of being bitten reduce a lot," Marques said.
Physical barriers go a long Way in protecting against mosquito bites. While traveling in affected areas, keep doors and windows closed and sleep under mosquito nets. The guidelines also recommend using insecticide-treated netting materials on doors and windows.
To avoid risk of sexual transmission of Zika while traveling, men and women should practice safer sex, including the consistent use of condoms, or abstinence.
"It's not just Zika to think about," said Adhikari. "There are destinations that might have other diseases that are potentially a bigger deal like dengue, yellow fever, malaria chikungunya. That's why it's important to tell your doctor exactly where you intend to go."
Q: What about when I get back?
A: The WHO recommends that travelers who have returned from a trip and develop a rash, fever, painful joints or red eyes should contact their physicians, inform their provider of their travel history and get laboratory testing and clinical care as indicated.
That can help with the overall tracking of the spread of Zika, too, since many of the countries where it has been identified lack the public health infrastructure needed to identify new cases.
If you've returned from a place with Zika outbreaks you should continue to use repellent for at least three weeks to avoid being bitten and potentially spreading the disease.
The WHO guidelines also recommend that people traveling to areas with potential transmission practice safer sex, or that they consider abstaining from sex for at least three months after the last possible exposure for men, or two months for women. Sexual partners of pregnant women should practice safer sex or abstain for at least the duration of the pregnancy.

Texto completo: Re: "Defying death for a better life" (June 30, Page A1):
I can't commend the paper, Staff Writer Rob Wolfe and Staff Graphic Artist Michael Fisher enough for the front-page map and article on the asylum seekers.
I had no idea what these people had gone through to try to reach Portland. All too often when I heard the word "refugee," I thought only about those who are trying to get over the border from Mexico. And as depressing and disturbing as those images and stories were, I had no appreciation for the journey that preceded it.
But now you've given us a much more complete story of these courageous people and what they had to endure to gain freedom. And, yes, I am in awe of what they were willing to risk to come here. But I am also inspired by their example. I will no longer take my freedom for granted or hold it too lightly.
And I am also very proud of Portland and its people and all that they have done to welcome the asylum-seekers from Africa. This is what America stands for. This is America at its best. And this is what we should celebrate with, as John Adams said, "pomp and parade ... bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other" each Independence Day.

Reporting illuminates risks taken to get here
Your article on the front page of this morning's paper was by turns searing, horrifying, heartbreaking and essential ("Asylum seekers defy death for a better life in Portland," June 30).
Thank you for documenting our new neighbors' stories. And thanks to the hundreds of volunteers who have pitched in to help. Here's hoping that the asylum seekers all happily live and flourish wherever they decide to settle down.
If you're one of those people who believes our country doesn't have room for our new neighbors, or if you agree with how the Trump administration is traumatizing and abusing children at our southern border - well, I don't think I can properly express what I think of your opinion in a family newspaper.
Kudos to the Press Herald and Staff Writer Rob Wolfe. Well done.

Response to migrants shows kindness' scope
It was heartbreaking to read in the June 30 Maine Sunday Telegram of the misery and prospect of death sustained by so many of the Congolese refugees seeking a new life in the United States and, specifically, Portland. It was heart-affirming to read in the same edition of the enormous outpouring of help and goodwill offered by thousands of Mainers.
A quote by the late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould is apt here, from an op-ed he wrote for The New York Times in the wake of 9/11:
"We may reaffirm an essential truth too easily forgotten, and regain some crucial comfort too readily forgone. Good and kind people outnumber all others by thousands to one. The tragedy of human history lies in the enormous potential for destruction in rare acts of evil, not in the high frequency of evil people. ... Thus, in what I like to call the Great Asymmetry, every spectacular incident of evil will be balanced by 10,000 acts of kindness, too often unnoted and invisible as the 'ordinary' efforts of a vast majority."
This quote can also bring comfort in the age of Donald Trump.

To stop child deaths, learn about the 'whys'
Re: "Our View: Build a better child welfare system - finally" (June 30):
You make a great suggestion, but it is easier said than done. In October 2016, in a report titled "Within Our Reach A National Strategy to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities," the federal Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities informed President Barack Obama that there are three deaths each day within programs designed to protect children. Furthermore, the authors, all experts in child welfare, said that they do not have enough information about why the deaths are occurring to prevent them.
If my memory serves me correctly, this is one in a long line of reports on child abuse that admit we don't know what we need to know about social behaviors and society's response to them. This is an important observation and probably should be a starting point for moving forward. There are many such behaviors that we need to know more about in order to effectively deal with.

City's open-door policy lacking in common sense
The transport of hundreds of Congolese to Portland is astonishing and troubling. It demonstrates how chaotic our legal immigration system is and how little our elected officials care to repair that system or protect the interests of Maine citizens.
In a cohesive community committed to the preservation of what ancestors created for their posterity, the event should have provoked alarm, if not outrage. The reaction of our politicians, media and humanitarian activists has been completely contrary to common sense and prudence.
If one subsidizes and encourages an activity, then there will be surely more of that activity. UNICEF projects the population of Africa to quadruple from 1 billion to 4 billion in the next 80 years. That should cause concern about the economic, social and environmental impact of encouraging foreigners to take advantage of our foolish and naively generous immigration laws.
Those laws desperately need change, and we need to find the collective wisdom and will to elect leaders with the fortitude and rectitude to protect the culture of our forebears and inheritance of our children and grandchildren.

Carbon-dividend bill could save baby lobsters
The Associated Press article published in the June 30 Maine Sunday Telegram on the below-average numbers of baby lobsters off the coast mentions in passing that "some scientists have said the shellfish appear to be moving north as waters warm."
At least as important as the changes intended to protect whales and the availability of bait, the effect of climate change seems worth another sentence or two.
There is clearly an opportunity for a larger story on the interconnection of these problems, and the need for our government, media and business leaders to connect the dots for all the ways that our food supply, and those who plant and harvest it, are affected by climate change.
Some members of Congress are seeing the light - the Climate Solutions Caucus was recently relaunched. They understand the need to find effective solutions that can gain bipartisan support. Perhaps they they will seriously consider H.R. 763, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act.
The lobster industry will thank us if we tell our leaders that action to reduce carbon in our atmosphere is urgently needed.

Your home won't fund retirement

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger "forever" homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families.
It also supports one of the most controversial things I've ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don't bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can't buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn't a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery — a point that a chart in Davidson's story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location.
The housing market isn't uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco's property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That's your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it's cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren't guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well.
But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location.
You're betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You're betting some hot new suburb won't steal your hamlet's thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don't shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn't stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn't.

Texto completo: CLINT, Texas — Since the Border Patrol opened its station in Clint, Tex., in 2013, it was a fixture in this West Texas farm town. Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town's main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortillería. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickup trucks; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, four miles south.
But inside the secretive site that is now on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.
Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children's dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents' own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.
"It gets to a point where you start to become a robot," said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built. He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become "heartbreaking."
The little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America's southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw — some of them as young as 5 months old — and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.
Border Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency's El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.
But a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso's eastern edge, shows that the agency's leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.
The accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by The New York Times and The El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
The conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.
By all accounts, the Border Patrol's attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there.
"I can't tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed," said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.
Mary E. González, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their
superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.
"They said, 'We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us' — agents told me that," Ms. González said. "I genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen."
A forward operating base Architects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base — replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables — from which agents could go on forays along the border.
The station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.
Officials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas. But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station — including lawyers, former detainees and staff members — The Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station's central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.
Parts of the site resemble what might be seen at many government buildings. Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather.
But the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.
Beyond the pantry, a door leads to the site's processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children.
One of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or "flu cell" for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.
A part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.
Clint is known for holding what agents call U.A.C.'s, or unaccompanied alien children — children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents.
Three agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children's rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old. An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years — and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation — confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.
"We have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of U.A.C. care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can't do that," the agent said. "We can't carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that."
As immigration flows change, the scene inside Clint has shifted as well. The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve overcrowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.
Unaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside.
Families, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males "apprehended that morning" were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.
Before the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house ATVs. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.
A chief agent under fire At least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector's brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.
The situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Mr. Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting. The officials were concerned that Mr. Hull, an agency veteran who speaks with a pronounced Texas twang, had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Mr. Hull moved forward with the new procedures.
But tension has persisted between Mr. Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities. The officials believe that Mr. Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities
in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.
Mr. Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.
Officials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.
Last month, the acting head of C.B.P., John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation — which is being conducted by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and the department's inspector general — has examined allegations of misconduct.
As part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.
The uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant detention centers in the United States.
That is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.
Lawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.
But Mr. Hull painted a far different picture of his need for supplies in April, when the numbers of children held in Clint were soaring. Mr. Hull told commissioners in Doña Ana County in Las Cruces, N.M., in April that his stations had more than enough supplies.
"Twenty years ago, we were lucky if we had juice and crackers for those in custody," Mr. Hull said, as quoted in the Las Cruces Sun-News. "Now, our stations are looking more like Walmarts — with diapers and baby formula and all kinds of things, like food and snacks, that we aren't resourced or staffed for and don't have the space to hold."
An inspector arrives One day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection's chief accountability officer.
The Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Mr. Moak's visit, bulging with 291 children. Mr. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.
One girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Mr. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.
Two sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Mr. Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility's hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. "The sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station," Mr. Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls' time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed.
Mr. Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.
One of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad — 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.
She looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. "My God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here," she recalled.
One teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.
"Did they throw away anything else?" Ms. Binford said she had asked her.
"Everything," she replied. "They threw away my baby's diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything."
Once at Clint, she told Ms. Binford, the baby's fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. "Who told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?" one of the agents told her, according to the young woman's account to Ms. Binford.
Border Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants' needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.
Children sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. "It's never because they're mistreated; it's because they're homesick," she said.
A father finds his sons Not long after Mr. Moak signed off on the conditions inside Clint, a man named Ruben was desperately trying to find his sons, 11-year-old twins who both have epilepsy.
The boys had crossed the border together in early June with their adult sister. They were hoping to reunite with their parents who had come to the United States earlier from El Salvador in order to earn enough money to pay for the boys' epilepsy medications. They require daily injections and a strict regimen of care to prevent the seizures they began having at age 5.
But the twins were separated at the border from their sister and sent to Clint.
The first time they spoke to Ruben on the phone, the two boys sobbed intensely and asked when they would be able to see their parents again.
"We don't want to be here," they told him.
Ruben asked that his last name and the names of his sons be withheld for fear of retaliation by the American government.
Only later did Ruben learn that the boys had been given at least some of their epilepsy medication, and neither one had had a seizure. But one boy reported breaking out in a skin rash, his face and arms turning red and flaky. Both had come down with fevers and said they had been sent temporarily to the "flu cell."
"There is no one to take care of you there," one told his father.
It took 13 days after the boys were detained to speak to their father over the phone. A lawyer who had entered the facility, Clara Long of Human Rights Watch, met the boys, tracked down their parents, and helped them make a call. The boys were stoic and quiet, she said, and shook her hand as if "trying to act like little adults" — until they spoke to their father. Then, they could answer only with one- or two-word answers, Ms. Long said, and were wiping tears from their faces.
Much of the overcrowding appears to have been relieved at Clint, and overall arrivals at the border are slowing, as new policies make migrants, mainly from Central America, return to Mexico after they request asylum, as the summer heat deters travelers and as Mexico's crackdown on its southern border prevents many from entering.
A Border Patrol agent who has long worked in the El Paso area said agents had tried to make things as easy as possible for the children; some bought toys and sports equipment on their own to bring in. "Agents play board games and sports with them," he said.
But the Border Patrol long "took great pride" in quickly processing migrant families, and making sure children did not remain in their rudimentary stations for longer than 72 hours, the agent said. Clint, he said, "is not a place for kids."
In the surrounding town, many residents were puzzled and sad at the news of what was happening to children in the station on Alameda Avenue.
"I don't know what the hell happened, but they've diverted from their original mission," said Julián Molinar, 66, a retired postal deliveryman who lives in a house facing the station. He served in the Army in Europe as the Berlin Wall came down, he said, and was dismayed that there was now talk of building a border wall near his home. As for the Clint facility, he said, "children should not be held here."
Dora H. Aguirre, Clint's mayor, expressed sympathy for the agents, who are part of the community in Clint and neighboring El Paso. "They're just trying to do their job as a federal agency," she said. "They are trying to do the best they can."

America's many silly candidates

Texto completo: If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance. Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18% of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost - if they ever had - an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All" and was asked: So, people "who like their [private] insurance, they don't get to keep it?" She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that." More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times - not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign - says, "waffled" regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as Mr. Sanders," the Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?"
The next morning on MSNBC, Harris said "No, I do not" support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their" in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell and Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans - 80 million more than voted in 2016 - something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4% of whites and 9% of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools.
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering" is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering - modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia." Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Texto completo: There is some sort of hard-to-define spiritual crisis across the land, which shows up in rising depression rates, rising mental health problems. A survey that the Pew Research Center released late last year captures the mood. Pew asked people to describe the things that bring meaning to their lives. A shocking number of respondents described lives of quiet despair:
"I no longer find much of anything meaning, fulfilling or satisfying. Whatever used to keep me going has gone. I am currently struggling to find any motivation to keep going."
"It would be nice to live according to my being rather than my blackness. I will never know how a totally worthwhile life will feel because of this."
"Drugs and alcohol are the shining rays of light in my otherwise unbearable existence."
"I don't feel very satisfied with my life. I'm a stay-at-home mom and my life is endless monotony and chaos."
The Pew survey reveals a large group of Americans down the income and economic ladders who are suffering from economic scarcity, social scarcity and spiritual scarcity all at once. Less educated people were less likely to say that friendship was a source of meaning in their lives. They were less likely to say hobbies were a source of meaning, nor was learning, nor good health nor stability.
When people overall described the sources of meaning in their lives, they stuck close to home. Nearly 70% identified family as a source of meaning, followed by career, making money and practicing a spirituality or faith. Only 11% said learning added meaning to their lives. Only 7% said helping others was a meaningful part of their life.
If you ask philosophers how people fill their lives with meaning, they usually point to some version of serving a cause larger than self. William James said that meaning was found in tireless struggle on behalf of some sacred ideal. Susan Wolf says that meaning is found in active engagement in important projects.
But the meaning of meaning seems to have changed. When people in this survey describe meaning, they didn't describe moral causes or serving their community, country or God. They described moments when they felt loved, satisfied or good about themselves. They described positive personal emotions. As one respondent put it, "It's easy to forget what's wrong in the world when you are pretending to be a puppy with your daughter."
It's as if people no longer see life as something that should be organized around a specific vocation, a calling that is their own way of doing good in the world.
Everything feels personalized and miniaturized. The upper registers of moral life - fighting for freedom, struggling to end poverty - have been amputated for many. The awfulness of the larger society is a given. The best you can do is find a small haven in a heartless world. One respondent said he found meaning in the tiniest things: "Small-scale nature - individual bugs and plants - are quite pleasing. I like to be able to focus on things that don't care about me or the larger world."
I've just finished a four-month tour for my book "The Second Mountain," talking with thousands of people, and I certainly encountered the disillusioned America described in the Pew survey. But the big thing I encountered was the seismic generation gap. People my age rag on the younger generation for being entitled and emotionally fragile, etc. But this generation is also seething with moral passion and rebelling against the privatization of morality so prevalent in the Boomer and Gen-X generations.
They can be totally insufferable about it. In the upscale colleges on the coasts, Wokeness is a religious revival with its own conception of sin (privilege) and its own version of the Salem Witch Trials (online shaming). But the people in this movement have a sense of vocation, moral call and a rage at injustice that is legitimate rejection of what came before.
I recently met a group of high school kids from around the United States and Africa involved in the Bezos Scholars program. In our conversations they didn't define their identity by where they were from, or even by their ethnicity and race. They defined themselves by what project they work on - serving Native Americans, working for clean water. Similarly, high school students generally are more likely to define themselves by their political stances and their vocations, rather than whether they are jocks or drama kids.
I've also found that college students are eager to talk about a moral project entirely absent from the Pew survey: Doing inner work, growing in holiness. Many seem to have rediscovered the sense, buried for a few decades, that one calling in life is to become a better person. Your current self is not good enough. You have to be transformed through right action.
It's often uncomfortable and over the top, but we're lucky to have a rebellion against boomer quietism and moral miniaturization. The young zealots may burn us all in the flames of their auto-da-fe, but it's better than living in a society marked by loneliness and quiet despair.

Texto completo: Billionaire coal baron Chris Cline, whose mines were among the most productive in the country, died in a Fourth of July helicopter crash that killed seven people traveling from the Bahamas to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to multiple reports.
Cline, a West Virginia native, would have turned 61 on Friday.
Bahamanian police said four women and three men on board died in the crash, but they did not name the victims -- and civil aviation authorities said their identities were unknown. All seven passengers were Americans, The Associated Press reported.
West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, told the Register-Herald newspaper that Cline was among the dead and took to Twitter to call Cline "a W.Va. superstar" and "a very close friend."
"Chris Cline built an empire and on every occasion was always there to give," Justice wrote. "What a wonderful, loving, and giving man."
Brian Glasser, an attorney for Cline, confirmed to Bloomberg News that his client was killed in the helicopter crash.
"He was a young man," Glasser said. "He was audacious. He was a great man, and he will be missed."
Glasser wrote on Twitter that Cline was the most courageous person he had represented.
"A billionaire, he never lost touch with the days he lived in a double wide and used a blow dryer to thaw his winter pipes," Glasser said.
The helicopter took off from Big Grand Cay around 2 a.m. Thursday and was reported missing in the afternoon when it did not arrive in Fort Lauderdale, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a statement. Authorities said police and local residents found the helicopter overturned in 16 feet of water about two miles off the island.
Police did not identify a cause of the crash but said officials, including the Department of Civil Aviation and the Defense Force, were investigating.
Evan Jenkins, a justice of West Virginia's Supreme Court, said in a statement that Cline, his daughter, friends and pilot had died in the wreck. Cline had loved West Virginia, Jenkins wrote.
"His selfless and generous support for programs and projects throughout the state improved the lives of countless West Virginians," Jenkins said. "His life's story was one of hard work, love of family and caring support for others."
At the age of 22, Cline followed his father's and grandfather's footsteps into the underground coal mines of southern West Virginia, according to the website of his company, Foresight Energy. He later formed his own energy development company, the Cline Group, which rose to become one of the top 20 coal producers in the United States.
Cline also founded Foresight Energy to operate mines in Illinois. The firm earned $1.097 billion in coal sales in 2018, according to its website.
That success led Cline to a life of luxury, radio network West Virginia MetroNews reported. His 150-acre property in Beckley, West Virginia, included a go-kart track, a lake and pastures for Cline's goats, horses and llamas, MetroNews said. Cline also owned a yacht called Mine Games, the report said, and a mansion in North Palm Beach, Florida.
In 2010, Bloomberg dubbed Cline the "New King Coal." By 2015, Bloomberg had made a slight change to the nickname, calling him, simply, "the King of Coal."
Cline, a major Republican donor, later gave $1 million to President Donald Trump's inaugural committee, according to OpenSecrets.org from the Center for Responsive Politics. He also donated to the failed presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., according to The New York Times.
Cline's family foundation has donated millions to Marshall University, including a $5 million gift for sports medicine research. The athletic complex on campus is named in Cline's honor. Cline attended Marshall but dropped out to get into the coal business with his father.

Texto completo: WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. -- A black man in a cage is a potent and horrible symbol. But in Jonathan Payne's "A Human Being, of a Sort," it is also more than that. It's history.
In 1906, Ota Benga, a 23-year-old man of the Mbuti people in what was then the Congo Free State, was put on display at the Bronx Zoo as an example of "the African pygmy." The New York Times, not especially perturbed at the time, described him in a news article as "one of a race that scientists do not rate high in the human scale."
A separate editorial stated that "it is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation he is suffering" -- this even though he shared his cage, in the Primate House, with an orangutan and a parrot.
The animals are not depicted in Mr. Payne's play, which finishes a brief run at the Williamstown Theater Festival's Nikos Stage on Sunday. But Benga, in the person of Antonio Michael Woodard, is brought to vivid if ultimately unknowable life in a story that sends out long ripples.
I felt some of those ripples at two other productions I saw while in the Berkshires this week: Williamstown's revival of "A Raisin in the Sun" and, oddly enough, Barrington Stage Company's "Into the Woods." Perhaps merely by proximity, or perhaps because of the moment we're in, they all seemed to be involved in the same conversation.
In "A Human Being," the conversation is enhanced by a blending of historical and fictional elements. Benga's captor, a white adventurer named Samuel Phillips Verner, is based on a real figure, and so is the zoo's director, William Temple Hornaday. It's not clear why Verner (Matthew Saldivar) turned Benga over to the zoo, but Hornaday (Frank Wood, creepy and intense) justified his own actions as a matter of enlightened science.
Also true is the backlash from the black religious community, represented here by three ministers who argue with Hornaday over the morality -- and symbolism -- of displaying Benga as a creature to be gawked at and ridiculed. The ministers want to transfer him to an orphanage they run.
These historical elements of the production, a world premiere directed by Whitney White, are not yet cohering. But Mr. Payne's main fictional gambit pays off. The invented character of Fred Engelholm, known as Smokey, is a black man nearing the end of a sentence for a petty crime -- stealing two apples -- that under Jim Crow in Tennessee led to three years on a prison farm and a chain gang. When Hornaday hires Smokey (the formidable André Braugher) as Benga's keeper, it feels as if the theme of black male incarceration, literal and figurative, has suddenly grown a new dimension.
The relationship between Smokey and Benga -- at first adversarial but gradually turning warmer as they recognize comparable suffering in their lives -- is the emotional heart of the play. Mr. Braugher is instantly convincing as a man whose apparently easygoing nature is at least partly a front for anxiety: If he loses his job he'll be sent back to prison. And yet as he contemplates the wider implications of Benga's treatment, he cannot make peace with the situation. The result is no less painful for being foreseeable.
And Mr. Woodard is extraordinary. In his performance, what could have come across as an exploitation comparable to Hornaday's is instead rounded into the full dignity and mystery of humanity. Mr. Payne -- the author of "The Revolving Cycles Truly and Steadily Roll'd," presented Off Broadway last year -- smartly avoids noble or "savage" clichés but loads the character with traits and back stories that eventually coalesce into character.
And yet I was acutely aware that Benga, however much he is based on a real man, is also a theatrical construct. He weeps over the loss of his family in Africa, but also clowns for and hisses at the tourists watching him. Theatricality can be another kind of imprisonment: the packaging of tragedy -- however delicately, in Ms. White's staging -- as entertainment.
At Williamstown's main stage, in the same complex, "A Raisin in the Sun" (through July 13) has been pointing at the same theatrical paradox more directly. As my colleague Ben Brantley noted in reviewing the revival, its director, Robert O'Hara, has made several blunt interpolations in the 60-year-old play. I agree that some seem to rip the neat hems of Lorraine Hansberry's dramaturgy, extending the story both backward (through flashbacks to the Younger family's late paterfamilias) and forward (to the future of their young son, Travis.)
The interpolations are shocking; I overheard one husband informing his wife afterward that the final gesture in particular was "totally unnecessary" and "overkill."
Maybe so, but for me they were fully congruent with Mr. O'Hara's aim of awakening a play whose prescience has, over time, become congealed under a layer of sentimentality. His version, which I found mostly electrifying, pulls at the thread of black men in crisis both to elucidate the play itself and to explain how we got where we are in real life. Travis, around 10 years old at the time of the play's early 1950s setting, may have survived to our time, but what about his son?
It's a stretch -- and not just the 20 miles from Williamstown to Pittsfield, Mass., where Barrington Stage's "Into the Woods" plays through July 13 -- to find related themes in a work based on fairy tales. And yet the widely produced 1987 musical by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine is fundamentally about curses. There's the kind that witches put on neighbors who steal from their gardens, but also the kind that parents put on children by too much care or carelessness.
Usually it's that angle -- the price young people pay for their elders' sins -- that comes through loudest in this almost indestructible show. But as directed here by Joe Calarco, in a beautifully sung if indifferently staged production, the most salient trap is that of the parents themselves, who in their desire to have and keep their children will do almost anything.
When the Witch is played by a black man, as she is here by the blistering Mykal Kilgore, that theme takes on added resonance. Or at least it did for me after seeing "A Human Being, of a Sort" and "A Raisin in the Sun."
"Don't you know what's out there in the world?" the Witch sings in a warning to her daughter, Rapunzel, whom she tries to keep in a castle. It doesn't take a play to tell you that incarceration, whether literal or metaphorical, is a tragedy that mostly creates more tragedy.

Texto completo: CHICAGO, 111. - What's happening on the border is an international disgrace and moral outrage.
We can't sit idly by and watch this man-made disaster destroy so many innocent, young lives. Churches and labor, human rights organizations and people of conscience from every walk of life must mobilize and challenge what's going on at the border.
The Rainbow PUSH Coalition sent a delegation of ministers to Texas last night (June 25, 2019). They are on the ground now.
We talked with Texas Con-gresswomen Veronica Escobar and Sheila Jackson Lee. We talked to the mayor of El Paso. They have our full support in this fight for justice.
We want to collect at least 5,000 diapers and undergarments, toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap and other hygiene products - essentials for "a safe and sanitary" environment.
We want the children out of the detention centers in a timely manner. These places aren't suitable for adults for an extended period, let alone children as young as a few months old.
Our government can't separate what's happening at the border with what's happening in the country's where these children of God are fleeing. They are fleeing grinding poverty and political and gang violence.
Jesus was in the same situation. He was born under a death warrant. Mary and Joseph took him to Egypt as a refugee.
Jesus was a border baby.
The United States doesn't have a border crisis. It has a leadership crisis in the White House, a failure of vision, a betrayal of what America is supposed to stand for.
As he did in the aftermath of the devastation of Hurricane Maria across Puerto Rico, President Trump and his administration seem completely unable, or more likely, unwilling to ease the suffering, especially the suffering of people of color.
We say no to ICE raids, no to breaking up families, no to separating children from their parents, no to locking up children in unsanitary conditions, no to Muslim bans, no to mass deportations. We stand proudly with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her refusal to allow the city to cooperate with ICE. She is not the only light in this darkness. Mayors across the country have taken the same position.
President Trump, the master of fake news, has used immigrants and asylum seekers to divide people since his infamous escalator ride and declaration that Mexicans are criminals and rapists.
We applaud the House for voting last night - almost strictly along party lines - to send $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid to the border. But the package, according to The New York Times, faces a tough path to enactment.
In the meantime, we the people must fill the breach. Save the children, stop the disgrace at the border.
(Diapers, hygiene supplies and other donations can be sent to Annunciation House, 1003 E. San Antonio Ave., El Paso, Texas 79901.)
Rainbow PUSH Coalition is a multi-racial, multi-issue, progressive, international organization that was formed in December 1996 by the Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr. through merging of two organizations he founded Operation PUSH People United to Serve Humanity (est. 1971) and the Rainbow Coalition (est. 1984).
With headquarters in Chicago and offices in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, New York and Oakland, the organization works to make the
American Dream a reality for all citizens while advocating for peace and justice around the world.
RPC is dedicated to improving the lives of all people by serving as a voice for the voiceless. Its mission is to protect, defend and gain civil rights by leveling the economic and educational playing fields while promoting peace and justice around the world.

Ethical photos?
In response to July 2 letter "Migrant Photo Should Not Be Shared by Media," I would like to make two points. First, the dead bodies have names. They were Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his daughter, Angie Valeria.
Second, the letter opines that many people have died attempting illegal entry (a misdemeanor) into the U.S.; that their photos were not published; and that the publication of this graphic photo crossed some sort of ethical line and is meant to prejudice American public opinion. I disagree.
As to the graphic nature of the photo, this is nothing new for American journalism. Perhaps the writer doesn't recall the photo published in The New York Times of Kim Phuc, burned by napalm, running down the street of her village on June 8, 1972. And as for influencing public opinion, I trust that each individual can form his or her own opinion given the facts.
Of course, if we never read or see all the data, our inferences would be faulty. Is this what the writer is advocating, that the media protect us from ourselves? That perhaps we as a people are too immature or weak to comprehend what is occurring in the world? Maybe. I like to think not, but it is true that Donald Trump's America is far different from the America I came of age in.

Real issues
I read the June 28 Tony Norman column "For Those who Have Eyes to See, Let Them See." He should take his own advice.
He used a photo of two dead Salvadorian migrants attempting to cross the Rio Grande illegally to slam President Donald Trump's border policy.
If Mr. Norman were honest, he would be calling out the House Democrats for their failure to take action to strengthen our border control and discourage these attempts to illegally migrate to our country. Our president has tried several times to work with Congress to fix this real threat. Instead of agreeing to address this problem, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has mocked and denigrated the president for his efforts.
Would Mr. Norman be as happy with the publishing of pictures of hundreds of young men murdered in our American cities every week? Would he like to see the pictures of illegal immigrants and homeless people destroying some of our previously beautiful California cities?
His constant attack on Mr. Trump and his administration is unwarranted. Why not tackle the real issues we have facing our country?

Labor activists
In two national appearances over four hours, the only Democrat out of 20 presidential candidates who mentioned collective bargaining rights was Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state. Is this the party of labor?
Workers' pay has been flat, and working conditions have worsened since 1980. During this period, unions have been under constant attack, yet workers' rights were barely mentioned.
While acknowledging Mr. Inslee, the union activists who knock on a million doors each election should revolt.
The far right targets unions while President Donald Trump woos our members because they know our power. Do the national Democrats?

The resistance to Trump takes a threatening turn

Texto completo: The toxicity of the resistance to President Donald Trump has risen in recent days, with the nation’s most respected newspapers publishing rationalizations for denying Trump supporters public accommodation and for doxxing career federal employees, while a journalist found himself under physical attack from the so-called anti-fascist group Antifa, which has stepped up its violent activities since Trump’s election.
The justification for denying public accommodation came from The Washington Post in an op-ed by Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. Wilkinson became famous in June of last year, when she refused to serve White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and told Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant. Wilkinson’s staff then followed the Sanders group in protest as they tried to find another place to eat.
Wilkinson later told the press she ejected Sanders because the Trump administration is "inhumane and unethical" and because the Red Hen "has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion and cooperation."
In her new column, Wilkinson discussed the case of The Aviary, a trendy bar in Chicago where a waitress recently spat on Eric Trump, the president’s son. Wilkinson wrote that the incident, along with her own decision to oust Sanders, shows that in the age of Trump, "new rules apply" in public accommodations: Americans who work for the administration or support the president should stay away.
"If you’re directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home," Wilkinson wrote.
Wilkinson noted that "no one in the industry condones the physical assault of a patron," but at the same time declared that Americans should understand that a "frustrated person" — for example, a restaurant employee — will "lash out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs." Americans should accept that such things will happen.
"If you’re an unsavory individual," Wilkinson concluded, "we have no legal or moral obligation to do business with you." Better to stay home than risk the spittle. (And, of course, Wilkinson and her colleagues in the hospitality industry will decide who is "unsavory.") The apology for doxxing came from The New York Times in a piece by Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London. The article focused on the treatment of illegal immigrant children in detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Cronin-Furman discussed the detentions, as well as actions by employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in terms of the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda. Those are, of course, contexts which most Americans would likely dismiss as preposterous and offensive but which Cronin-Furman and the Times apparently take seriously. Her idea is that opponents of the administration should publicly identify and shame low- and midlevel Customs and Border Protection employees who care for migrant children.
Such workers would be dismayed at being publicly shamed because they are "sensitive to social pressure," Cronin-Furman wrote, "which has been shown to have played a huge role in atrocity commission and desistance in the Holocaust, Rwanda and elsewhere. The campaign to stop the abuses at the border should exploit this sensitivity."
"This is not an argument for doxxing," Cronin-Furman continued. "It’s about exposure of their participation in atrocities to audiences whose opinion they care about. The knowledge, for instance, that when you go to church on Sunday, your entire congregation will have seen you on TV ripping a child out of her father’s arms is a serious social cost to bear. The desire to avoid this kind of social shame may be enough to persuade some agents to quit and may hinder the recruitment of replacements. For those who won’t (or can’t) quit, it may induce them to treat the vulnerable individuals under their control more humanely. In Denmark during World War II, for instance, strong social pressure, including from churches, contributed to the refusal of the country to comply with Nazi orders to deport its Jewish citizens."
Needless to say, that was a clear argument for doxxing.
Finally, there was Antifa’s recent attack on Andy Ngo, a freelance journalist often associated with the pro-free thought cultural publication Quillette. At a demonstration in Portland, Oregon, at which Trump was a focus of dispute, Antifa fighters beat up and milkshaked Ngo, apparently because he was there and he was not on their side.
The president is not always at the center of such demonstrations, but Antifa has become an angry and violent fringe force in the Resistance. It has played an ugly role in a number of events, most notably Charlottesville, in which feelings about Trump have been central.
Shunning, shaming, doxxing, attacking. As the 2020 campaign reaches full speed, would it surprise anyone to see all of it increase? And all from people who congratulate themselves for standing against hate. Perhaps our politics will cool down at some point in the future. But not now.

He Prefers Midsummer Nightmares

Texto completo: Shocking family tragedies? Rituals, cults and conflagrations? Characters losing their heads (in more ways than one)? You might be watching an Ari Aster film.
The writer and director has made only two features, but he is creating a name for himself as a new genre auteur -- first with the harsh, 2018 domestic horror film "Hereditary," and now with the sun-drenched, maypole-circling folk horror entry "Midsommar." Both are emotional powder kegs, containing bleak moments that are difficult to erase from memory.
Aster's new movie stars Florence Pugh as Dani, a young woman who has suffered a family tragedy and seeks comfort from her already-checked-out boyfriend, Christian (Jack Reynor). They go on a trip with friends to a remote Swedish village called Harga to celebrate a purification ritual that happens only once every 90 years. A journey that begins as a time to heal progressively turns into a time in hell.
In contrast to the heartache his characters experience, the filmmaker was in good spirits during a recent interview at The New York Times. He spoke about what pulls him toward his films' specific subject matter, the amount of research that went into "Midsommar" and how the film ultimately avoided an NC-17 rating. Below are edited excerpts from that conversation.
Your first two movies involve horrible things that happen to families. Why have you been drawn to that?
My family has definitely undergone a lot of hardship. And when I was writing this script and "Hereditary," I was certainly working through feelings.
But that family was in no way a surrogate of my own. Ultimately, I find that I am often writing my way through some sort of personal crisis, which can be very therapeutic.
You have called "Midsommar" a breakup movie, although this one has a bit more brutality and sacrifice than, say, "The Way We Were."
I'm a big lover of melodrama. And one tradition of melodrama is having the scope of a story match whatever the characters are feeling. So I wanted to make a breakup movie that felt as big as breakups tend to feel, which is cataclysmic, because a big part of your world is now gone. So I wanted to make this big operatic, apocalyptic breakup film.
Ritualistic gatherings and cult behavior are also factors in both of your films. Where did that interest come from?
I've written a lot of screenplays, like 11 films. But I wrote these two scripts pretty close to each other, about five years ago. So I guess I was mining the same territory without realizing it.
Both films are about tribalism. And it's hard to imagine making some meta statement about families without thinking about people as tribal animals. And a cult, whether or not that's what we're dealing with in "Midsommar," is a pretty strong metaphor for that.
Have you been to the actual Midsummer celebration in Sweden ?
I went out to celebrate Midsummer when I was writing the script. It's a pretty harmless tradition. There is a maypole, which the Swedes like to joke about as a phallic symbol, because it is. It does have pagan ties.
You seem to lean into that part in your film.
I did a lot of research into Swedish tradition, Swedish folklore, Norse mythology. I learned the runic alphabet. Every rune has a different meaning. There are stable runes and unstable runes, negative runes and positive runes. And those are used accordingly in the film.
But my research wasn't just native to Sweden. I looked at British and German Midsummer traditions. I turned to Frazer's "The Golden Bough," which is a treasure trove of insights into pre-Christian traditions. And I did research into other spiritual movements that I find very beautiful, as opposed to ones that I'm skeptical about.
Why so many influences?
I was pulling from all these because I didn't want the people of Harga to be easily dismissed as lawless, mustache-twirling villains. I wanted them to be tethered to something real.
And ultimately these people are much more connected to each other and the world they live in than the visitors, who find themselves ensnared.
This is primarily being billed as a horror movie, even if you have other things on your mind. Did your producers give you expectations on the amount of horror there should be?
I was very lucky in that I was given a lot of freedom and was able to do it my way. I know the genre well, and I know what the expectations are. If you're going to make a film like this, there is this unspoken contract between the audience and the filmmaker that you have to hit certain beats if the film is going to be satisfying at all. So for me, it wasn't a matter of subverting the genre, but rather treating these things as a given, and then finding a way to get from A to B.
Did you want to go further with any scenes than you were ultimately allowed to?
The sex scene [that includes full-frontal nudity in a group setting] was actually longer. And we had an NC-17 for about a month and a half. There was a long back-and-forth with the M.P.A.A. where they told us to keep cutting. Then we would send them a new cut. They'd say, keep cutting, it's still NC-17.
They didn't tell you what they wanted cut?
They're specific about what their problem is but not about how to fix it. It's really just an argument. But we got the R rating recently and that was a relief. I had never directed a sex scene before, so this was quite the way to jump in the pool.
One scene has the lead character wailing and the women of Harga surrounding her, mimicking her actions and crying along with her. How did you land on that?
These people speak a language of empathy, which is something that is missing in Dani's life. There are several scenes that could be read as just horrific. Or they could also be read as therapeutic for the character, where she is encouraged to face the unfaceable.
The characters sleep in a giant room with runic drawings everywhere. Where did that idea come from?
As I was gathering research with my production designer, Henrik Svensson, we went up to northern Sweden and to different farms that had houses that were centuries old. In a lot of these houses, every room is covered in paintings and murals. We based the aesthetic of the paintings on those.
But the drawings in the movie often connect to plot points.
I really just love layering my films with prophetic details that I hope encourage more active engagement on the part of the viewer. I like to put my exposition on the walls, as opposed to in characters' mouths.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , had a campaign-defining moment last week during the first Democratic primary debate that has led to a jump in polls. Harris' sudden surge has arguably secured her status as a top contender in a Democratic 2020 field of two dozen candidates.
During last week's debate, Harris had a powerful exchange with former Vice President Joe Biden, where she called out Biden for opposing federally mandated busing to integrate schools while he was in Congress.
Since then, several polls have shown Harris surging ahead of other leading Democrats in the party's crowded primary field.
Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, Harris is at 20% nationally — just two percentage points behind from Biden, who is at 22%, according to a Quinnipiac Poll released Tuesday.
In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday, 41% of Democratic-leaning voters said Harris stood out in the debate. In that same poll, however, Harris trailed behind Biden, who was 29%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who was at 23%, as the preferred candidates among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Harris stood at 11% alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , who was also at 11%.
CNN poll: Joe Biden slides, while Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren surge after debates
Iowa poll: Kamala Harris surges as Bernie Sanders suffers after debate
In most polling, Biden has repeatedly been the front-runner in the sprawling Democratic field. However following his performance at last week's debate, the former vice president's support has seen a significant drop. In last month's Quinnipiac poll, Biden was at 30%, meaning Tuesday's poll represents an 8-percentage point drop for him. Biden also dropped 10 percentage points to 22% in a CNN poll published Monday.
In Tuesday's Quinnipiac poll, Warren came in third at 14%. Sanders was the only other candidate in the double digits at 13%.
This was one of three recent polls showing a surge by Harris. The California senator has jumped into second place in Iowa with 16%, according to a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll released Tuesday. Harris also surged to second place nationally in Monday's CNN poll
But what does Harris' growing front-runner status mean for her campaign? It will almost surely lead to more scrutiny and attention from her many opponents, including the president of the United States.
Here's what to watch out for:
Trump is taking notice
President Donald Trump had been mostly mum on Harris' campaign throughout the primary season.
However, that changed just two days after she took to the debate stage when the president sought to downplay Harris' performance.
"I thought that she was given too much credit," Trump told reporters in a news conference in Japan following the G-20 summit. "I think she was given too much credit for what she did.
"It wasn't that outstanding," he concluded.
The president added that Biden "didn't do well" and "maybe the facts weren't necessarily on his side. "
The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. , also commented on Harris. Trump Jr. has repeatedly criticized several Democratic presidential contenders, including Biden.
Trump Jr. caused backlash from a number of other 2020 Democrats who came to Harris' defense when he retweeted a post by Ali Alexander – a conservative commentator whose Twitter profile claims to have "exposed Kamala Harris. "
Alexander's tweet said "Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican. I'm so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It's disgusting. "
"Is this true? Wow," Trump Jr. wrote in a retweet, before deleting the post that same night, according to The New York Times. Harris is American and was born in Oakland, Calif.
Harris campaign communication's director Lily Adams called Trump Jr. 's attack "racist. "
“This is the same type of racist attack his father used to attack Barack Obama,” she said in an interview on CNN. “It didn’t work then and it won’t work now. ”

Will Harris have a fundraising surge?
The second quarter fundraising period ended June 30, three days after Harris' challenge to Biden on the debate stage.
Although Harris has yet to announce her second-quarter fundraising totals, pundits and voters will be closely watching how many contributors she tallied and how much money she took in.
South Bend, Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced he raised more than $24. 8 million in the second quarter, outraising Sanders who raised $18 million and Biden who raised $21. 5 million.
During the first quarter, Harris raised $12 million. And in the first 24 hours after the start of last week's debate, she raised $2 million online, according to the New York Times.

Given her recent polling surge, her second-quarter fundraising will be scrutinized to see how she measures up to the other top-tier 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
Harris' history as a prosecutor
Throughout her campaign, Harris has invoked her record as attorney general for the state of California and embraced her past as a prosecutor.
While campaigning in South Carolina last month, Harris said that she is best positioned to "prosecute the case" against Trump due to her history.
“I know how to get that job done,” Harris said. “We need somebody on our stage when it comes time for the general election who knows how to recognize a rap sheet when they see it and prosecute the case. ”
However, many progressives have criticized Harris for her record as California attorney general, arguing she was part of an era of "tough on crime" Democrats. And those criticisms will likely become more salient as Harris continues to gain national attention.
Lara Bazelon, a law professor and the former director of the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent in Los Angeles, wrote in a New York Times op-ed in January that Harris was not a "progressive prosecutor. "
"Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state’s attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent," Bazelon wrote. "Most troubling, Ms. Harris fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors. "
Scrutiny of her record will continue to rise as Harris continues to appeal to voters. Over the past couple years, criminal justice reform has been a growing issue for voters, according to several polls and surveys.
Rising support from black voters
In addition to her surge with the national electorate in recent polls, Harris is also gaining traction with black voters.
In Tuesday's Quinnipiac poll, 27% of black Democratic voters backed Harris. Last month, Harris was at 9% among non-white Democratic voters, according to the Quinnipiac poll. However, Biden still currently leads with black voters. He is at 31% with black Democratic voters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.
Biden also has won the support of several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, despite the fact that two African American senators and members of the caucus -- Harris and Cory Booker of New Jersey — are also seeking the Democratic nomination.
Black voters are a crucial bloc for Democrats. Many of the Democratic wins in the 2018 midterms were driven by black voters, particularly black women, according to many political observers and an analysis from the NAACP.
Over the past couple of weeks, Harris has also tried to specifically appeal to black voters. Early last month, Essence Magazine announced Harris would have a monthly column with the only black woman in the Senate. On Saturday, Harris will be at the 2019 Essence Festival in New Orleans.
Since her debate performance, Harris has also raked in a new endorsement from Congress.
Rep. Jahana Hayes — the first Black woman elected to Congress in Connecticut — endorsed Harris on Wednesday, citing her debate performance.
"During last week’s debate, we watched all the Democratic candidates for President discuss their hopes and plans for our country," she wrote in an op-ed published in Essence. "We watched as one candidate in particular had the courage to ask the tough questions and demonstrate the strength to handle difficult situations. We watched Kamala Harris remind us of how policy directly affects people. "
Hayes wrote that Harris is "the perfect antidote to our current President’s false narratives. "
"Kamala knows what it takes to move us forward as a country, and I am proud to endorse her for President of the United States," Hayes concluded.

New York Times uses misleading data to make case that America isn't great

Texto completo: The New York Times decided that the Fourth of July was the best time to post a video titled, "Please Stop Telling Me America Is Great" that makes the case that the United States is "just okay."
My colleague Tom Rogan already replied with a post defending the honor of the U.S., but I wanted to go into a bit more detail on a few misleading data points that the video relies on.
Two arguments in particular caught my ear, based on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development data.
"America is the richest country in this [OECD] club, but we're also the poorest, with a whopping 18 percent poverty rate — closer to Mexico then Western Europe," the narrator tells us.
The problem with using this metric to draw the conclusion the way video authors Taige Jensen and Nayeema Raza do, however, is that the relative poverty rate measurement they're relying on is based on the percentage of people who are below 50% of median income in that country. In other words, because richer countries have higher levels of median income, there is a considerably higher threshold to get above this poverty line.
This is how the U.S. ends up with a higher relative poverty rate than Mexico, Turkey, Latvia, and Lithuania, where nobody would seriously argue the poor have higher standards of living than in the United States.
In terms of median income, the U.S. actually ranks fourth — well ahead of most of Western Europe save Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland, which have a higher cost of living.
The other piece of data is to look at OECD information on life expectancy and infant mortality, to suggest that we have a worse healthcare system than even Bosnia.
But relying on infant mortality and life expectancy is seriously flawed, because records are not kept uniformly across countries, and the statistics are heavily influenced by external factors that have nothing to do with the quality of a health system.
Among other things, an American Enterprise Institute paper noted, "babies who are not viable and who die quickly after birth are more likely to be classified as stillbirths in countries outside the United States, especially in Japan, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France ... In the United States, however, nonviable births are often recorded as live births, making the US infant mortality rate appear misleadingly high. "
Additionally, American doctors are more inclined to go further in attempting to save babies who have low odds of survival. "In this case, the additional health care may actually worsen reported infant mortality rates and misleadingly suggest poor care in the United States," the paper explained.
The video says that "we live sicker and shorter lives" than other countries despite paying more for healthcare. But the problem with life expectancy statistics is that they do not control for a number of factors including demographics, early deaths due to crime, or accidents that have nothing to do with the healthcare system. If one were to look at life expectancy at 65 (as opposed to birth), which controls for some of these factors, the U.S. is at 18.1 years, which is ahead of the OECD average of 18.
Unfortunately, the videomakers at New York Times were too eager to attack America on its birthday to avoid misleading their viewers. Story URLPhoto Caption:The White House in Washington DC with waving United States flag

Resumen: Low-emissions New York taxis contributed to a decline in air pollution, and millennial farmers in Ghana are rethinking farming techniques.

Texto completo: Russia Russian authorities backed down after a public outcry about freedom of the press. Ivan Golunov was investigating corruption within the funeral business when he was arrested for alleged drug dealing on June 7. State-owned and independent media alike spoke out – three newspapers published “I/We are Ivan Golunov” on their front pages. Russian journalists set up pickets and celebrities recorded supportive videos. Journalists rallied worldwide and signed a petition to free Mr. Golunov. Within a week, he was released and criminal charges were dropped. (CNN)
United States Since New York enacted clean-air taxi legislation in 2004, air pollution associated with the taxi industry has abated. An analysis by Columbia and Drexel universities has found that taxi fuel efficiency more than doubled since 2004. As a result, the two major sources of air pollution have substantially decreased: nitrous oxide emissions by 82% and particulate exhaust emissions by 49%. Researchers conclude that air pollution legislation is effective in improving urban air quality. (Columbia University)
Ghana College-educated millennials are challenging the stigma of farming. In Ghana, farming is synonymous with poverty, and the farmer population is growing older. But younger individuals are entering the field with a different approach; “agripreneurs” incorporate data and scientific research to increase yields and, they hope, profits. Africa contains 65% of the world’s arable but uncultivated land, and yet $35 billion worth of food is still imported annually. Agripreneurs see their college degrees as an opportunity to reduce imports and find solutions to problems that have plagued the industry. Farming tech startups across Africa increased substantially over the past few years, according to a report by Disrupt Africa. Since becoming president in 2017, Nana Akufo-Addo has focused on the agricultural sector, encouraging younger farmers and deploying more than 2,700 educators on motorbikes to teach farmers about sustainable practices to improve climate change resiliency. (The New York Times)
Netherlands Women in soccer are getting a pay raise. In June, the Royal Dutch Football Association announced that women’s team salaries will increase incrementally until women are paid the same as men by 2023. Australia has also announced that professional women footballers will receive an equal hourly rate, resulting in a 33% increase. Despite being reigning World Cup champions, the U.S. women’s team has not had as much success with payment. In March, the team filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation for “purposeful gender discrimination.” But women are gaining ground in this year’s World Cup, with prize money doubling to $30 million since the previous tournament in 2015. This still pales in comparison with the $400 million in prize money that men’s teams shared in the 2018 World Cup. (Yahoo Sports)
Canada Whales, porpoises, and dolphins can no longer be taken into captivity under a bill passed by Parliament. Lawmakers called the move a “moral obligation.” Animal rights activists have long criticized the confining spaces of tanks; many also see the treatment of the animals during training as abuse. The new law does not apply to animals already in captivity, and animals can be kept for rehabilitation and licensed scientific research. (NPR)

Trump not boosted by strong American economy, poll finds

Texto completo: The solid economy is doing little to bolster support for President Trump.
Americans give Trump mixed reviews for his economic stewardship despite the growth achieved during this presidency, according to a new survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Nearly two-thirds describe as "good" an economy that appears to have set a record for the longest expansion in US history, with decade-long growth that began under former president Barack Obama. More people consider the economy to be good today than did at the start of the year.
But significantly fewer approve of Trump's handling of the economy, even as it remains a relative strength compared with other issues. The survey indicates that most Americans do not believe they're personally benefiting from his trade policies. And only 17 percent said they received a tax cut, despite government and private sector figures showing that a clear majority of taxpayers owed less after the president's tax overhaul passed in 2017.
These doubts create a possible vulnerability as Trump highlights the economy's solid performance in his campaign for reelection in 2020.
Nearly half of Americans, 47 percent, approve of Trump's handling of the economy, but his overall approval rating — 38 percent — is low compared with what past presidents have enjoyed in strong economic conditions. Only about 4 in 10 Americans approve of his handling of taxes and trade negotiations.
The public skepticism has persisted even as the president routinely congratulates himself on the economy, including the 3.6 percent unemployment rate and stock market gains.

Buttigieg raised $24.8m in quarter, campaign says
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., raised $24.8 million over the past three months, his campaign said Monday, a head-turning total that is likely to be among the largest disclosed by any of the Democratic presidential candidates for the second quarter of the year.
Buttigieg's haul, from more than 294,000 donors, is the clearest indicator yet of how a candidate who only months ago was little known among voters has become a formidable contender in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Buttigieg had more than 230,000 new donors in the quarter, bringing his total number of donors during his presidential bid to more than 400,000, his campaign said. The average contribution over the course of his campaign has been $47.42, according to his team.
His campaign said it now had more than $22.6 million in cash on hand.

Trump congratulates N.J. on blocking tax on millionaires
President Trump on Monday congratulated New Jersey's Democratic-led Legislature for passing a budget that did not include a proposal by Governor Phil Murphy to raise taxes on millionaires — a move Trump claimed would have driven high earners from the state.
In subsequent tweets, he complained about how "ridiculously high" taxes are hurting his children and businesses in New York.
Murphy, a Democrat, was seeking to raise additional revenue by increasing the top marginal rate paid by those making more than $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Fellow Democrats, who control both chambers of the state Legislature, balked at the move. On Sunday, Murphy signed a budget bill without the provision.
"Congratulations to legislators in New Jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state," Trump tweeted Monday morning. "Many were planning to leave, & will now be staying."
Murphy responded in kind later Monday, writing on Twitter: "We all know @realDonaldTrump is fighting for millionaires like himself. I'm fighting for New Jersey's middle class and all those working to get there."

Is a ‘Marshall Plan for Central America’ the best way to stem migration?

Texto completo: If you believed all the scary stories, it might seem that nearly everyone in Honduras is planning to flee to the United States, if they haven’t already. The fact is, though, that a lot of people are on the streets fighting, and a few dying, for a chance at a better life at home.
The plight of people fleeing Central America’s “Northern Triangle” countries — Honduras, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala — was highlighted this past week by the tragic photo of a Salvadoran man and his 23-month-old daughter who drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande. Immigration was a major focus of the first two debates among Democratic candidates for president, including calls for a “Marshall Plan” for Central America – an idea proposed by Mexico’s new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Central America has been receiving U.S. attention — wanted and unwanted — for a long time. Aid continues to flow. President Trump in March ordered aid to the Northern Triangle countries frozen, but the government announced in mid-June that it would go ahead with the majority of it. Protests in Honduras, however, show that some of the advice and assistance Central America gets is counterproductive.
Massive infusions of aid to improve living conditions have been tried elsewhere. It’s an attractive idea. But it’s also very easy to throw away a lot of money and get relatively little for it. So caution is warranted.
After negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, Honduras’ unpopular U.S.-backed President Juan Orlando Hernandez tried to impose reforms this spring that protesters feared would privatize the education and health care sectors and lead to large job losses. The moves have since been rescinded, but once protests got under way, they grew to include demands that the president resign.
The army and military police have been deployed across the country of 8 million people, and they’re using live ammunition. Several people have been killed. Protesters started a fire at the gates of the U.S. Embassy and trucks with logos of the Dole food company have been attacked.
To many, Hernandez looks like another corrupt, old-fashioned Central American strongman. Opponents charge that he shouldn’t have been allowed to run for re-election in 2017. Even then, he appeared to be losing until vote counting was halted. After it was restarted, he came out on top. There is also the drug trade. The president’s brother was arrested in Miami last November and charged with cocaine trafficking. U.S. court documents filed in May revealed that the president himself had been under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration in the same probe.
Until recently, at least, Hernandez looked a lot better the farther north you went. His pro-business policies have the economy growing. The World Bank reported in April that Honduras’ economy grew by 4.8 percent in 2017, 3.5 percent last year, and is projected to add 3.6 percent this year.
The IMF and the U.S. might be quite pleased with that growth rate, but it’s not helping most people. As the World Bank points out, Honduras has the highest level of inequality in Latin America. More than 60 percent of its people live in poverty.
Honduras also managed to cut its astronomical homicide rate in half between 2011 and 2017. U.S. training, weaponry and other security assistance certainly helped. But gangs are still a huge problem, as this New York Times report from May makes clear. And U.S. equipment and training also has been used by units cracking down on protesters.
According to these charts compiled by the Washington Office on Latin America, the U.S. spends considerably more on security, justice, drug and border control in Honduras than it does on economic growth, development, good governance and human rights. Overall, the total amount of aid Trump ordered cut in March was $615 million ($432 million was restored). To put that in perspective, Congress just approved $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid for the border. And Trump shut down the government over his demand for $5 billion for a wall.
So is a Marshall Plan the answer? If you spend more ensuring people have jobs and security at home, it stands to reason that you won’t need to spend as much at the border. But it depends on the details, most of which have yet to be filled in.
Here are a couple of pretty obvious ideas for how to start.
First, Central Americans have been dealing far too long with what North Americans want. The U.S. for decades has been pursuing policies that encourage inequality along with growth. But protesters in Honduras don’t appear to want that. How about focusing on what would work for them rather than force feeding them on U.S. policy dogmas?
Second, some money inevitably will be wasted on boondoggles or siphoned off by corrupt officials. It happens; deal with it. The trick is minimizing losses, picking partners (probably not Hernandez) and programs carefully, and getting the most bang out of the good investments.
Even with the best strategy, things would change slowly and partially. But unlike a wall, at least some of the money actually would help someone. It might save another father and daughter from floating face down in the Rio Grande.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – California Sen. Kamala Harris' rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination defended her after criticisms based on her race circulating on social media, which were amplified when Donald Trump Jr. shared one such post with his more 3. 6 million followers on Thursday.
Trump Jr. retweeted a post from Ali Alexander – a conservative commentator whose Twitter profile claims to have "exposed Kamala Harris" – that said "Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican. I'm so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It's disgusting. "
"Is this true? Wow," President Donald Trump's oldest son wrote, before deleting the post that same night, according to The New York Times.
Tucker Carlson comments on Cory Booker's race: Fox News host calls Booker one of 'whitest candidates' among 2020 Democrats
"Don’s tweet was simply him asking if it was true that Kamala Harris was half-Indian because it’s not something he had ever heard before," Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Trump Jr. told the Times. "And once he saw that folks were misconstruing the intent of his tweet, he quickly deleted it. "
The 2020 candidates: Who is running for president? An interactive guide
Harris, 54, was born in Oakland, Calif. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan came to America from India where she met Donald Harris, an immigrant from Jamaica. Both civil rights activists, they met while pursuing graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, Harris said in her memoir, "The Truths We Hold: An American Journey. "
Many took note of Trump Jr. 's retweet, including those competing against Harris for the Democratic nomination. Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff thanked "the 2020 candidates and everyone else for calling out this crap for what it is. "
"Donald Trump Jr. is a racist too. Shocker," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , said on Twitter Saturday, along with a link to the Times story about Trump Jr. 's retweet.
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro called the attacks on Harris "disgusting" during an interview with CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday and called Trump Jr. a "coward" for his tweet.
"He knows what he's doing," Castro said. "He's giving voice to these racist utterances about Senator Harris. We need to dispel them immediately and condemn them, and then not give them any more life, because they're disgusting. "
"The attacks against @KamalaHarris are racist and ugly," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, in a tweet. "We all have an obligation to speak out and say so. And it’s within the power and obligation of tech companies to stop these vile lies dead in their tracks. "
"This is racism. It was wrong before, and it’s wrong now. We won’t allow it again," Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N. Y. , said on Twitter.
"There's a long history of black Americans being told they don't belong – and millions are kept down and shut out to this day. @KamalaHarris is an American. Period. And all of us must call out attempts to question her identity for what they are: racist," said former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said the attacks on Harris "represent the worst of us. "
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J. , put it more simply, tweeting that Harris "doesn’t have s--- to prove. "
Former Vice President Joe Biden compared the budding social media campaign about Harris' background to the "birtherism" conspiracy theory that questioned former President Barack Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as president.
Donald Trump, then a reality TV star, was a leading voice of birtherism during the Obama era.
"The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It’s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America," Biden said in a tweet.
Biden and Harris had a feisty exchange on the issue of race and racism during the first Democratic debate of the 2020 campaign season.
Harris campaign spokeswoman Lily Adams weighed in on Donald Trump Jr. 's retweet.
"This is the same type of racist attacks his father used to attack Barack Obama. It didn’t work then and it won’t work now," Adams said in a statement.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also compared the attacks to birtherism.
"The presidential competitive field is stronger because Kamala Harris has been powerfully voicing her Black American experience. Her first-generation story embodies the American dream. It’s long past time to end these racist, birther-style attacks," Buttigieg said in a tweet.
Similarly, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee called it a "coordinated smear campaign" and said the "Trump family is peddling birtherism again and it’s incumbent on all of us to speak out against it. "
"It is more than 'birtherism again' to question the race of @KamalaHarris. It’s racism," said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.
Alexander said in a statement that it was Harris' claim to African-American identity during the debate that he was denouncing, and denied that he was trying to make any kind of "birtherism" argument, acknowledging that Harris was born in Oakland, California to parents "who were naturalized citizens. "
“Me pointing out that Kamala Harris has a mother from India and a father from Jamaica went viral last night because many people assume she descends from Black American Slaves,” he said. "She does not. I corrected Kamala Harris last night because she stole debate time under the premise that she is an African-American when she is in fact a biracial Indian-Jamaican who is a first generation American. "
Some on social media said the viral spread of Alexander's post appeared to be aided by artificial accounts, commonly referred to as bots. Such accounts were central to the social media element of Russia's "sweeping and systematic" effort to interfere in the 2016 election, according to the special counsel Robert's Mueller's report.
One post by freelance journalist Caroline Orr was cited by several news publications.
"A lot of suspect accounts are pushing the 'Kamala Harris is not Black' narrative tonight. It’s everywhere and it has all the signs of being a coordinated/artificial operation," Orr posted after the debate.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. , indicated she believed bots played a role in disseminating Alexander's tweets.
"These troll-fueled racist attacks on Senator @KamalaHarris are unacceptable. We are better than this (Russia is not) and stand united against this type of vile behavior," Klobuchar tweeted.
Rep. Seth Mouton, D-Mass. , said "these attacks are being promoted by the same kind of bot activity the Russians and others used to hijack our democracy in 2016. Don't fall for it. "
But a Twitter spokesperson told The Hill, "Reports of malicious automation and 'bots' are false. "
"We've see no coordinated activity around the debates, or this particular content. It is organic users sharing these views, much of which is not in violation of our policies. "
Harris is not the only candidate whose identity as an African-American has been questioned by conservatives. After Wednesday night's debate, Fox News host Tucker Carlson referred to Booker, who is black, as one of "the two whitest candidates on stage" in a screed against Booker and O'Rouke's use of Spanish.

Fritz Lang's Interstellar Overdrive

Texto completo: Fritz Lang's last silent film, "Die Frau im Mond" (1929), known in English as "Woman in the Moon," was also a first -- the earliest movie to depict space travel as a realistic possibility.
The film impressed even those familiar with newfangled talking pictures. The New York Times reported that Lang's movie, titled "By Rocket to the Moon" on its United States release in 1931, gave audiences "a breathtaking jaunt into the mysteries of interstellar communication."
If Georges Méliès's silent fantasy "A Trip to the Moon" was the "Star Wars" of 1902, it can be said that "Woman in the Moon" was the "2001: A Space Odyssey" of 1929. Lang's movie was at once pedantically scientific and outlandishly speculative -- a spectacle low on human interest and high on cutting-edge special effects, some developed by the avant-garde animator Oskar Fischinger. "Motion picture technology celebrates its triumph," a German reviewer wrote.
Working from a novel by his wife, Thea von Harbou, Lang sought the imprimatur of Hermann Oberth, whose 1923 book, "The Rocket Into Interplanetary Space," fueled a German craze for spaceflight. Oberth and his young disciple, the science writer Willy Ley, served as technical advisers, adding weight to von Harbou's flimsy story about a privately funded rocket, with an unconventional crew, in search of gold on the moon. As a favor to Oberth, and as a publicity ploy, Lang helped finance a planned rocket launch to celebrate the movie's premiere. (Although the proposal fizzled out, Oberth was later recruited by the Nazi missile program and contributed to the development of the V-1 rocket.)
"Woman in the Moon" begins as an energetic, if routine, reprise of Lang's previous film, "Spies" (1928). The first half is largely devoted to criminal conspiracy. A gang of plutocrats, fronted by a master of disguise and suave thuggery named Turner (played by German cinema's favorite villain, Fritz Rasp), plot to steal a rocket designed by an aging mad scientist from his earnest young protégé, the entrepreneurial astrophysicist Helius (the popular leading man Willy Fritsch).
As a counterpoint to the assorted burglaries and deceptions, the movie establishes a romantic triangle involving Helius and his two assistants, the cowardly Windegger (Gustav von Wangenheim, the hapless hero of "Nosferatu") and the courageous Frieda (the Croatian actress Gerda Maurus). As resourceful as she is noble, Frieda had managed to produce close-up movies of the lunar surface, which resembles something grown in a petri dish. Amid much talk of trajectory, velocity and the "weightless zone," a lunar expedition is organized that will involve all five of the principals and a young stowaway, first seen reading a science fiction pulp magazine.
"Woman in the Moon" reaches its emotional peak midway through with the rocket launch -- a full-scale media event complete with search lights, a grandstand, a frenzied crowd held back by the police, and, as the full moon rises, the unveiling of a huge silver rocket, as godlike as a Kubrick monolith. The hysteria, which some have said anticipates the Nazi propaganda film "Triumph of the Will," was paralleled by the movie's premiere (the first covered live on the radio), which had Albert Einstein among the invited guests. The facade of the Ufa Palast theater was redesigned as a monumental bas-relief to dramatize spaceflight. A sculpted rocket, launched from a three-dimensional skyscraper city, shuttled back and forth to the moon against a heavenly deep blue backdrop of a thousand twinkling light bulbs.
In the movie's most suspenseful sequence, the countdown to blastoff (a convention Lang invented) gives way to agonizing pressure on the space travelers, followed by the requisite weightless scene. The lunar landing is also stressful. Fortunately, the moon turns out to be a giant sandbox. (Unfortunately, it also provides an arena for the travelers to play out all the conflicts they brought from Earth.) A desperate overlay of mawkish sentiment notwithstanding, the end of "Woman in the Moon" combines an overwhelming sense of desolation with an agoraphobic fear of the void. More than presaging Kubrick's "Space Odyssey," this horror vacui anticipates the terror of Alfonso Cuarón's "Gravity."
"Woman in the Moon" proved a box-office success despite hostile reviews, particularly from left-wing critics who perceived the movie as a showpiece for the right-wing media mogul Alfred Hugenberg, who had bought a controlling interest in the film studio Ufa. The film theorist Rudolf Arnheim began his review with the declaration that Lang's films were "parvenus, trashy novels that have come into money" and ended by mocking the notion that Frieda and Helius would be spending their honeymoon on the moon.
Other critics recognized "Woman in the Moon" as a juggernaut, beyond good and evil. With regard to Lang's extravaganza, "great praise or great damnation would count little," one wrote. "Everybody will want to see the film, and they should certainly do so." Why not? "Woman in the Moon" (which is cited repeatedly in the Thomas Pynchon novel "Gravity's Rainbow") has a primal hubris to match its lunatic premise.
Two decades later, two Hollywood movies -- "Destination Moon" and "Rocketship X-M," released within weeks of each other in mid-1950 -- picked up the lunar saga. The well-publicized George Pal production "Destination Moon," shot in Technicolor and based on a screenplay by Robert Heinlein, was a straightforward brief for projecting American military power beyond Earth. Although flirting with Lang and von Harbou's romantic lost-in-space ending, it concludes on a more positive note.
A quickly made rival "Rocketship X-M," directed by Kurt Neumann from a script doctored by Dalton Trumbo, then blacklisted and hence uncredited, took a less aggressive position. The rocket of the title misses the moon and lands on Mars to find Earth's alternative future, a civilization destroyed by atomic warfare -- a desolation far more cosmic than that envisioned by Fritz Lang.
"Woman in the Moon" streams from Kanopy and Amazon Prime . "A Trip to the Moon" is available on YouTube . "Destination Moon" may be found on Vimeo and "Rocketship X-M" has been posted on several archive sites .

These researchers study terrorists. Sometimes, they also stumble across scoops.

Texto completo: He typed the names of his targets on a spreadsheet: "sheila jackson ... Chris hayes ... ilhan omar." He searched online for the best ways to kill black people and for the addresses of a couple of U.S. Supreme Court justices. By the time federal authorities arrested U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson at his house in Silver Spring, Md., in February and began to release details of his alleged plot to kill prominent politicians and journalists in court filings, Hasson had been stockpiling weapons for at least a decade.
News of his arrest reached the public in typical fashion, on Twitter. But the source was not typical. Instead of the U.S. Department of Justice or a major media outlet, it was a little-known researcher in Washington named Seamus Hughes.
Hughes, 35, is the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, a research group that collects information about radicalism and terrorism in the United States, then turns it into reports, graphics and other easily digestible forms. It tends to find newsworthy tidbits by accident, rather than by design, according to the program's director, Lorenzo Vidino. "We don't want to steal your job," he said with a laugh when I spoke to him earlier this year. "Because of the work that we do, we come across a lot of interesting information."
Vidino and Hughes rely on a variety of sources. They mine public databases, passively monitor Islamic State propaganda online and track the group's members on encrypted messaging apps like Telegram. "[Lorenzo] and I will wake up - at our separate homes - at 5 a.m. and nerd-out on a case or write up a five-page report really quickly because it's really interesting to us," Hughes told me one morning in March over his second cup of coffee. "For us, it's not necessarily a job - it's much more fun than that. You have a challenge of trying to figure out how to answer the question of why a guy in New York decided to join ISIS."
A self-proclaimed digger, Hughes is a master of PACER, a database of federal court documents that can be hard to navigate. Hughes happened to be trawling PACER, looking for terrorism-related cases, when he stumbled upon Hasson's detention memo. When he comes across an interesting case that the program doesn't have the time or resources to pursue, he turns to Twitter. "We throw it out in the wind and hope The Washington Post or somebody else runs with it," he says.
Hughes also finds notable cases that are unrelated to the program's work. For instance, in January, he broke news on Twitter of the FBI's investigation into Los Angeles City Council member Jose Huizar for bribery and money laundering. While releasing such material isn't part of his job, doing so is "a welcome respite," he says. "If you look at beheading videos every day, at some point you're going to need a break, and that's part of my break."

Hughes began investigating terrorism cases in the aughts, first as an intern and later as a staff member for the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. In 2011, he went to work for the National Counterterrorism Center. In 2015, a former Senate colleague introduced him to Vidino, who hired him to work at the newly launched Program on Extremism.
Vidino, 42, started the program after holding positions at Harvard University, the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Rand Corp. "We thought there was an appetite for some nonpartisan research and analysis on extremism, particularly on religiously inspired extremism, looking mostly at the domestic scene," he says. "Paradoxically, you'll find a lot of research being done on al-Qaeda and ISIS, but not so much on the process of radicalization of Americans." The program is funded by foundations, Hughes says, "the Mellons of the world."
By carving out this niche, the program has become a standout in the close-knit terrorism research community, which includes academic centers and think tanks. Hughes and Vidino have created "an amazing clearinghouse of information ... that puts them in a position where they can be literally the most authoritative voices out there talking about extremism in the United States - and that's a tremendous resource for the rest of us," says Nicholas Rasmussen, the senior director for national security and counterterrorism programs at the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a think tank in Washington.
Vidino and Hughes are joined by seven other staffers at GW and oversee more than a dozen nonresident fellows who are scattered across the country. Since the program began, the center's researchers have uncovered about 20,000 pages of legal documents - pertaining to everyone who's ever been arrested for international terrorism in the United States - and pulled about 1.5 million English-language tweets about the Islamic State.
Vidino is currently leading a research project in partnership with the New York Times where he's tasked with digitizing, translating and publishing roughly 15,000 pages of internal Islamic State documents. The project was "very much in line with our focus and expertise and we were naturally happy to partner with them," Vidino says, adding that the program works with many domestic and international media outlets. He is also a frequent contributor to the BBC.
The program's research goes beyond documents and social media. It includes interviews with former Islamic State members, relatives of terrorists, FBI agents and attorneys. Encounters with family members of Islamic State militants, in particular, can be difficult and require sensitivity. "You've got to put it in context. I'm the parent of two kids, so if I'm sitting across the room from a mother whose son just joined al-Shabab, I can think of myself and how I would feel if my son did the same thing," Hughes says. "You can't discount that the individual joined a foreign terrorist organization that's doing horrible things to a lot of people, but you also can't discount the human cost of those who are left behind after that decision is made."
The work could soon become more labor-intensive: Lately, social media platforms have come under fire for not removing extremist content, as happened after a video of the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March was widely shared on Facebook. If the platforms take down this content, Hughes says, they are likely to drive the material to a larger number of smaller sites - an outcome that would create new challenges for researchers. For law enforcement, meanwhile, such a change would probably have both drawbacks and benefits, he explains: "It does make the intelligence and law enforcement jobs more difficult from the standpoint of looking at a target, but probably better from the standpoint of not getting more recruits."
Will there be more scoops coming from Hughes? Maybe not quite as many, since he is sharing his PACER techniques with more journalists. In the past two months, he has trained more than 500 reporters across the country on how to use the site. And they, in turn, have shared tips on filing Freedom of Information Act requests. "I wasn't expecting that level of response; it's been mildly overwhelming," he says. "And it's been really interesting to me and quite useful to exchange notes with reporters, because in many ways the tips that they have when it comes to doing investigations are skill sets that I didn't necessarily have."

Texto completo: Over the past several years, we have all heard the term "fake news thrown around. However, there is a less-discussed issue that I am increasingly concerned with: omission by the press.
We see it almost every day, when mainstream news outlets like CNN and The New York Times refuse to cover positive news coming out of the Trump administration, such as the booming stock market or positive jobs reports.
Unfortunately, that is now happening right here in the Mountain State. On Tuesday, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that West Virginia led the nation in personal income growth during the first quarter of 2019. When the average income across the U.S. increased by a rate of 3.4 percent, West Virginia incomes increased by an average of 5.6 percent.
This is great news that every West Virginian should be proud of. Yet the Charleston Gazette-Mail, in an editorial on the Opinion page, remarkably found a thread of opportunity to question this incredible economic metric and spun it into doubt over whether it would be sustainable into the future.
A couple weeks ago, Gov. Jim Justice released the latest revenue numbers, which were off the charts. Revenue collection for this fiscal year set an all-time West Virginia record and is among the very best of any state in the country. The state is on pace to reach about $500 million in revenue growth this fiscal year alone, an all-time best for any single year in West Virginia history.
For perspective, from the entire decade before Gov. Justice took office --from 2007 to 2017 - combined revenue growth reached only $314 million. $500 million this year. $314 million over the previous 10 years.
Additionally, over the first 10 months of the fiscal year, the general revenue growth rate came in at a staggering 11.5 percent. Only five out of 50 states can boast double-digit revenue growth rates. West Virginia's 11.5 percent is the second-best such rate of any state.
Unfortunately, if you are one of the many West Virginians who rely on the Charleston Gazette-Mail for your news, along with many other papers across our state, you would have no idea about this exciting development. Nor would you have kept abreast of the state's overall economic health.
As our state's flagship paper, the Gazette-Mail has a responsibility to bring the people of this great state the news in an unbiased manner. Sadly, it is now clear that the paper has no interest in covering news that paints Gov. Justice's agenda and achievements in a positive light.
West Virginians should be joining together to celebrate this great news, and so many other positive developments of the past two years, from turning deficits into huge surpluses without tax increases to significant investments in education to historic road funding. Industries from coal to construction to tourism are booming, and the leadership of President Donald Trump and Gov. Justice is making this possible.
Regardless of the Gazette-Mail refusing to acknowledge success, I am proud of this great state and believe Gov. Justice and our legislative leaders deserve praise for all of their efforts to bring economic opportunity back to West Virginia.

Texto completo: "Their deaths came at the hands of ISIS in an attack officials described as merely 'inspired' by the group. In Tajikistan, we learned that it was far more than that."
Rukmini Callimachi
New York Times investigative reporter
Roughly one year ago, University of Delaware graduate Jay Austin and his girlfriend Lauren Geoghegan were killed by an Islamic State group while bicycling through Tajikistan.
On Sunday, New York Times investigative reporter Rukmini Callimachi revisited their deaths in a new episode of "The Weekly," a documentary series centered on stories that appear in The Times and the journalists who report them.
The show reveals new details about the terrorist attack and the men behind it, as Callimachi interviews not only the lead investigator on the case but Hussein Abdusamadov, the man who organized it.
Videos, photos and metadata from Abdusamadov's phone are used to reconstruct the terrorists' movements and explore their motives for killing not only two Americans but a Dutch and a Swiss bicyclist. Callimachi also visited the apple orchard where Austin and Geoghegan spent their last night.
"Their deaths came at the hands of ISIS in an attack officials described as merely 'inspired' by the group," Callimachi said on Twitter before the show aired Sunday night. "In Tajikistan, we learned that it was far more than that."
A trip around the world Austin and Geoghegan quit their jobs in Washington, D.C. in 2017 to travel the world, writing on their blog "Simply Cycling" that they wanted to "travel not as a means, but as an end."
Before the trip, Austin worked for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Originally from New York, he studied international relations at UD before getting his master's degree from Georgetown University.
"I initially did not think he could do it," his former adviser Alice Ba told UDaily, the university's online news source, after his death.
"But of course, I soon knew better," said the political science and international relations professor. "His excellent grades and record gained him admission to some of the most well-regarded master's programs in international relations. He embraced his experiences, clearly to the very end — on the road, exploring the world and what it had to offer."
Austin was also a minimalist, who believed in environmental sustainability. On official documents and applications, he referred to his occupation simply as "real human being."
Geoghegan, who grew up in California, studied government, Spanish and Arabic at Georgetown University and interned twice with U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff. She loved the efficiency, accessibility, wellness, open air, vulnerability, community, intimacy, and joy of bicycle riding, according to "Simply Cycling."
Austin's mom, Jea Santovasco, said the couple was special.
"They just were these wonderful, generous people," she told The News Journal in 2018, adding that they were lucky to find each other.
"I knew there was a very good chance I'd get a call," she said, knowing how dangerous it could be for two "skinny white kids" to traverse the globe. "But I never thought terrorism. That just wasn't on my scope. I thought maybe they'd fall off their bikes, or they'd be victims of robbery."
Austin and Geoghegan left the U.S. in July 2017, starting their trip in Cape Town, South Africa. They then rode to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, before hopping on a plane to Casablanca. From there, they cycled through Europe, Turkey and Kazakhstan, sometimes flying to make connections.
The couple had planned on biking through eastern Asia before heading back to the Americas but never got a chance. On July 29, 2018, they were killed by ISIS in Tajikistan.
They were part of a group of seven cyclists hit by a car. After knocking them over, the assailants exited the vehicle and shot and stabbed the bicyclists. A Dutch and Swiss rider also died in the attack, while three others were seriously injured, according to media reports.
Tajikistan lies along the northern border of Afghanistan.
Killed in Tajikistan Callimachi has spent the last five years reporting on ISIS, but said on Twitter that she spends the majority of her time covering the organization, with little time left over to focus on its victims.
But she was drawn to the story of Jay Austin and Lauren Geoghegan, who believed if they opened their hearts to the world, it would open itself back.
For 99 percent of their journey, that philosophy held true, Callimachi said.
And then they were killed.
"As I began researching their lives, it occurred to me that their philosophy was, in essence, the direct opposite of ISIS," Callimachi said in a tweet. "And it was on Day 369 that these two worldviews collided."
The night before they were killed, Austin, Geoghegan and five other cyclists camped at an apple orchard along the Pamir Highway in Tajikistan, Callimachi reported. The next morning, the group set out for the country's capital of Dushanbe.
They stopped at a gas station to freshen up, then started biking up a hill. They were followed by five men in a car, according to "The Weekly" episode.
The car came up from behind and the driver ran over the bicyclists, according to media reports. Then, the men got out and started stabbing them. After getting back in the car, the men turned around and ran over Rene Wokke, who was biking with his partner Kim Postma, a 56-year-old psychologist from the Netherlands.
Austin, Geoghegan, Wokke and a Swiss man named Markus Hummel all died in the attack. The other three bicyclists were injured.
Investigating the attack After the attack, the five men in the car fled down a remote road, likely headed for the Afghanistan border, Callimachi reported. But when they passed through the small town of Tutbuloq with blood on their car and a cracked windshield, the villagers became suspicious.
The men got out of the car, according to "The Weekly," and the villagers followed them until authorities arrived.
One was killed after attacking authorities and one was taken into custody. The next day, the remaining three were killed.
Callimachi reported that four of the men — Zafarjon Safarov, Majidov and two brothers named Asliddin and Jafariddin — were young men who had spent time as migrant workers in Russia. She was also able to confirm that they were the same men who pledged allegiance to ISIS in a video shot in Tajikistan before the attack.
The man taken into custody was Hussein Abdusamadov, the ringleader of the attack, according to "The Weekly." He recruited the other men to help him carry it out.
The lead investigator on the case shared information with the New York Times, including pictures of the scene and the victims after they were killed. Authorities seized Abdusamadov's phone, which he had used to send encrypted messages to his ISIS handler.
Investigators told Callimachi that Abdusamadov spent weeks scouting out locations for an attack in Tajikistan and bank surveillance footage showed him collecting money sent from contacts in Russia.
Two days before the attack, he bought a large cleaver, Callimachi reported.
After a trial held behind closed doors, he was assigned to life in prison, the maximum sentence in Tajikistan.
No regrets over the killing In an interview with Callimachi, Abdusamadov said he had no regrets over killing the bicyclists.
"When Muslims are being killed everywhere, we must try to kill non-believers wherever we find them," he said in the interview. "When they stop killing Muslims we will stop, too."
"We received an order and followed it."

Jay Austin and Lauren Geoghegan were on their way to the Kyrgyzstan border when some children stopped them to see if they wanted some hot tea, fresh bread or a rest in the nearby yurt. "With a storm brewing on the horizon, we were all too happy to duck for cover and spend a little time with this lovely family," Austin wrote on Instagram.

"Cycling along the Mediterranean can be a challenge at times (lots of development, lots of cars), but wayfinding has never been easier," Austin wrote on Facebook.
"We have been in Europe for six months," Austin wrote on Instagram. "We have enjoyed plenty of adventure and plenty of biking: sometimes rainy, sometimes cold, mostly quite beautiful. We have enjoyed plenty of breaks, too—leisurely weeks out of the saddle with each other, with family, with old friends and new friends."

Texto completo: What's on TV
RAMY YOUSSEF: FEELINGS (2019) 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Chances are you hadn't heard of Ramy Youssef before his breakout comedy series "Ramy" landed on Hulu in April. Youssef, an Egyptian-American comedian, stars as a fictionalized version of himself, a young Muslim man in New Jersey who takes pride in his cultural and religious beliefs but struggles to balance them with partying and dating. (In a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon, Youssef said he created "Ramy" to humanize a Muslim family, "which turned out to be a lot easier than humanizing New Jersey.") On the heels of the show's success -- it has a 97 percent "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has been picked up for a second season -- Youssef is starring in his first HBO special, "Feelings." In his signature mellow delivery, he shares his father's immigration story, questions his love of LeBron James and contemplates the baggage that comes with having sex.
THE BOBBY DEBARGE STORY (2019) 8 p.m. on TV One. This new biopic puts a spotlight on Bobby DeBarge (Roshon Fegan), the former lead singer of the 1970s R&B group Switch and a member of the family musical group DeBarge. The movie delves into his highs and lows -- celebrated as a falsetto master, he struggled offstage with drug addiction and spent five years in prison on drug trafficking charges. He died in 1995 at age 39 from AIDS-related complications.
THE SON 9 p.m. on AMC. The second and final season of this Western about a Texas ranching family comes to an end. The young Eli (Jacob Lofland) welcomes major changes in his life while the older Eli (Pierce Brosnan, who doesn't have enough Texan genes), wages a final showdown with the Standard Oil company.
What's Streaming
THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME (2018) Stream on Amazon or Hulu. The "spy" in this zany espionage comedy (Justin Theroux) pretty much sums up the plot early on: "Some bad people are after me, and now they're after you." He's talking to Audrey (Mila Kunis), the girlfriend he dumped in a text exchange, who learns that he doesn't actually work for NPR only after their breakup. He's out of the picture pretty quickly and the targets become Audrey and her airhead best friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon). They get swept up in an international conspiracy that takes them all over Europe, and their bond gives this flick some much-needed oomph. "The two of them find a relaxed, nimble rhythm that keeps the movie going through so-so action sequences and less-than-fresh plot twists," A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. Action abounds, but this caper's best asset is McKinnon.
THE SON OF JOSEPH (2017) Stream on Mubi; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. A Parisian teenager (Victor Ezenfis) raised by a single mother (Natacha Régnier) learns that his father is a self-centered, famous publisher in this absurd take on the Nativity directed by Eugène Green.

Texto completo: UNITED NATIONS -- The life of Riyad H. Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, has been shaped by the conflict with Israel. But he is also a child of the American antiwar movement.
His father, a Palestinian refugee, came to the United States in the 1950s, found employment as an Ohio steelworker and later brought over Mr. Mansour and the family's six other children from Ramallah, in the West Bank.
When Mr. Mansour attended college in Ohio, he plunged into student activism. He marched not only to protest Israel's occupation of the West Bank and other land seized in the 1967 war but also for civil rights and to get the United States out of Vietnam.
His circle of contacts, he said, included antiwar activists like Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda. He once helped lead a demonstration at Kent State University against a speech by the Ku Klux Klan's grand wizard, David Duke.
"When you're young, you're radical," Mr. Mansour, the top representative of the Palestinians at the United Nations for the past 14 years, said in an interview. "I was happy to be involved."
At 72, Mr. Mansour likes to cite his background as a steelworker's son to underline his humble roots. But he is better known as a leading critic of both Israel and the United States for what he sees as their collaboration to foil Palestinian statehood.
Mr. Mansour has dismissed a still-secret Middle East peace plan devised by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as this week's American-sponsored Palestinian investment conference in Bahrain, billed by the Trump administration as a $ 50 billion economic foretaste of its peace plan.
"The underlying assumption of this meeting is not congruent with the rights of the Palestinian people, and the issue is not money," he said. "You cannot prolong occupation by giving us Band-Aids of some money."
Long involved in Palestinian politics, Mr. Mansour began his professional career as a research assistant at Youngstown State University, his alma mater. He moved into diplomacy in 1983 as the deputy in what was then the Permanent Observer Mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization to the United Nations.
Mr. Mansour detoured from diplomatic life starting in 1994, joining the management of an Orlando investment firm and teaching at the University of Central Florida, among other pursuits. He returned to the United Nations in 2005 as ambassador of the Palestinian observer mission, which was not then regarded by the global body as representing a state.
He is perhaps best known for tactics advancing the cause of Palestinian statehood in ways that have bypassed Israel. Seven years after his return to the United Nations, the body recognized Palestine as a nonmember observer state, an upgrade that gave the Palestinians the right to join global treaties and groups including the International Criminal Court, and one that angered Israeli officials and their American allies.
In Mr. Mansour's view, such tactics are necessary because direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians have done little and, he says, Mr. Trump has corrupted the United States as a mediator.
Breaking with decades of American policy, Mr. Trump relocated the United States Embassy last year from Tel Aviv to the holy city of Jerusalem -- which the Palestinians also want as their future capital. This year Mr. Trump terminated American funding to the United Nations agency that helps the roughly five million Palestinians who are registered as refugees.
This month, the American ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, suggested in an interview with The New York Times that Israel could annex parts of the West Bank, where Israeli settlements are regarded by much of the world as illegal.
Such steps, Mr. Mansour said, all point to what he called an unacceptable outcome from Mr. Kushner's long-awaited peace plan.
"For those who think they are the masters of the art of the deal, in a relationship of two, if you give one side all these free gifts, what is the incentive for the other one to negotiate the crumbs?" Mr. Mansour said, referring to Mr. Trump and his advisers on the Middle East.
It would be an understatement to say that Mr. Mansour has not been on speaking terms with Ambassador Danny Danon, his Israeli counterpart at the United Nations. Mr. Danon urged the Palestinians to adopt a different approach in a New York Times opinion piece on Monday in which he asked, "What's wrong with Palestinian surrender?"
Israeli officials say Mr. Mansour infuriated Mr. Danon three years ago during a Security Council meeting by refusing to condemn militant Palestinian attacks. This past April, as Mr. Danon spoke to the council about Jewish connections to disputed lands claimed by Israel, the Israelis accused Mr. Mansour of rudely walking out.
The rancor has not always been so strong between Mr. Mansour and Israel's diplomats. He had a far more cordial relationship with Dan Gillerman, the Israeli ambassador at the United Nations from 2003 to 2008. They once engaged in a testy exchange outside the Security Council in 2006 but ended up shaking hands. And in a gesture that touched Mr. Gillerman, Mr. Mansour attended his end-of-tour reception.
Yossi Beilin, a longtime Israeli politician who played a central role in the Oslo Accords, the basis for talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, noted the significance of the gesture. "The fact that Mansour decided to come to the farewell party of our ambassador was very telling," he said. "He wanted to show there are differences, but there are prospects for cooperation and peace."
Mr. Beilin, an outspoken advocate of a two-state solution to the conflict, said he had met Mr. Mansour several times over the years and held him in high regard.
"This is the kind of adversary whom you want to be with," Mr. Beilin said. "There are different views, but you feel the goal is the same."
There is little doubt that Mr. Mansour is well liked by many diplomats at the United Nations. He is greeted warmly when he walks the halls. When the Trump administration announced in late 2017 that it would move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the 193-member General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn the change, in what was seen as a morale boost, at least, to the Palestinians.
And last year, the nonmember observer state of Palestine was chosen as the 2019 leader of the largest bloc of developing nations in the General Assembly, known as the Group of 77, giving Mr. Mansour a more influential gavel and further irritating Israeli leaders.
"They're still denying we are a state," Mr. Mansour said at the time. "We walk like a state. We quack like a state. Therefore, we are a state."
Mr. Mansour spent his childhood as a refugee in Ramallah before coming to the United States, where he became an American citizen, attended college and met his future wife, Caryl, an American of Polish and Italian descent. They have two grown children.
He is also a grandfather and amateur golfer, and he has advanced degrees in psychology and philosophy. Had he stayed in Ohio, he said, "I would have been a clinical psychologist."
Mr. Mansour said he marvels at how, having lived in the United States for more than a half century, he has become a patriarchal figure in a diverse extended family that includes Japanese-American in-laws.
"That's a typical American story -- everybody came from somewhere, and brought other families, and they start growing," Mr. Mansour said. "That is the story."
He recalled how his father, who won a lottery spot under an American government program to emigrate to the United States, was able to establish roots in Ohio, go to work in the steel mills and later become a shopkeeper. His father would send money back to Ramallah to help his mother and siblings.
His mother, whom he described as the person "who taught me all good things," never moved to the United States, and died in Ramallah. His father retired in Ramallah, where he also died.
Asked if he was an optimistic person, Mr. Mansour said he had to remain positive -- there was no other choice. He called himself "a prisoner of hope," quoting a passage he had read recently by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the South African anti-apartheid leader.
"I like that line," he said, "and I'm using it more often now."

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- There is an air of expectation on both sides as the Taliban and American diplomats gather to meet for the latest round of peace talks on Saturday.
Afghan and Western officials say that if the Taliban express willingness to finally go to the negotiating table with the Afghan government, American diplomats might be willing to play their main negotiating card: offering some sort of provisional schedule for the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan.
That phase of agreement has evaded negotiators for more than nine months, through six rounds of talks in Doha, Qatar. The hardest work, however, might come only after the Taliban and Afghan officials agree to begin discussing a political settlement.
The Taliban have remained officially vague about what kind of government they envision. But some clues to how the insurgents view power and governance can be found in a constitution that the group drafted while it ruled Afghanistan but that was never ratified before the Taliban were ousted by the United States invasion in 2001.
The New York Times obtained a rare copy of that draft constitution -- a 14-page document that was confirmed by people close to the Taliban, including some former officials who worked on the draft. It remains the only known official codification of the movement's political vision.
The draft shows flashes of sophistication, but also provides a snapshot of a movement that had deep contradictions within itself about issues like women's education, justice and tolerance of minorities.
Even while the group was in near-total control of Afghanistan, some of the basic questions that might be addressed in a constitution, like ensuring education for girls, were simply put off or just hinted at, to avoid any internal resistance from the movement's influential and usually more dogmatic military commanders, former officials said.
That dynamic is still present within the Taliban today, according to active members. And it presents a huge obstacle to any negotiations with a new Afghan government that was founded as a republic with protections for women and minorities who are fearful at the prospect of returning to the Taliban's restrictive code.
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which is what the Taliban called its government during its rule from 1996 to 2001, was based on the allegiance of religious scholars to an all-powerful supreme leader who had ultimate authority. That was Mullah Muhammad Omar, the group's founding leader.
Jalaluddin Shinwari, the deputy minister of justice under the Taliban government, and who still maintains contact with its leaders, said the modern insurgency will not settle for anything less than the return of the Emirate, and has a fundamental distaste for democracy. Even if the Taliban's political leaders were willing to show flexibility, its military commanders still decide the negotiating red lines, he said.
"The Taliban will not accept elections," Mr. Shinwari said. "The Taliban are telling Americans: 'You accept our Emirate -- return it to us the way you took it."'
He added: "If the political leaders step back, the military leaders won't. And if there ends up being a division, the situation will grow more dangerous than it is now."
For their part, Afghan government officials say that a return to an emirate system would not be acceptable to Afghans.
"Peace under the shadow of an Islamic Emirate is not peace; rather, it is surrendering of one party to the other," said Mohammad Karim Khalili, the chair of Afghanistan's High Peace Council. "Neither will the Taliban surrender, nor the people of Afghanistan accept an Islamic Emirate."
Twenty years and a couple of leadership changes later, the Taliban is an evolved force. But its political leaders who are negotiating in Doha -- some of whom never fought on the front line, and others who have been away for more than a decade -- know they have to walk a tight line with a military wing that is finding success on the battlefield against the Afghan government and the dwindling American and European forces who support it.
Mr. Shinwari knows well how invested the Taliban are in their strict interpretation of politics and governance through an Islamic lens: He was one of the officials central to the effort to draft a constitution for the Islamic Emirate.
In 1998, Mullah Omar convened about 500 religious scholars to draft a constitution for his government. The men arrived from across the country, and were put up for three days at the forsaken presidential palace that Mullah Omar never used.
Mr. Shinwari's staff made copies of all the country's previous constitutions, he said, and divided the clerics into committees to go through the documents, cross out what they considered to be against their interpretation of Islam, and then come up with a draft of their own.
One of the first items to be crossed out was an article from the last monarchy that left inheritance of the throne open to female members of the royal family.
"There was protest that it was against Shariah," said Mr. Shinwari, referring to traditional Islamic law. "So items like that were scrapped."
The document the scholars drafted over those three days was more a codification of the way the movement was already governing than any attempt to look forward.
It set out an all-powerful emir as the head of state and supreme leader, but left no mention of how one might be chosen, seemingly taking it for granted. Under the emir there was to be an Islamic council to which the government, headed by a chief of the council of ministers (a prime minister, of sorts), would report.
There is little acknowledgment that Afghanistan's minorities existed, with the document declaring the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam as the official religion of the state and that nothing could go against Shariah's dictates.
Yet the draft also offered certain freedoms -- though almost always left to Shariah interpretation -- that would have been a huge leap from what the Taliban actually practiced: It promised "liberty," as long as it did not hurt others' liberty or go against Islamic principles; a fair trial without use of coercion or torture; and freedom of thought and expression "within the limits of Shariah."
The constitution even included an article on telecommunications privacy, at a time when phone lines and electricity were rare in Afghanistan.
It also outlined mandatory military service, and mandatory primary education.
"Women's education, within the limits of Islamic Shariah, will be arranged through a special law," the document says. But in reality, any schooling for girls was vanishingly rare during the rule of the Taliban, who became known for whipping women who sought to go out in public dressed in anything less than full-body cover.
Ghezal Hares, an Afghan constitutional scholar, said that while there was precedent in earlier Afghan constitutions for the narrow definition of Islamic jurisprudence that the Taliban ordered, there are too many contradictions in how the group's old document lays out a vision for governance.
The current Afghan Constitution, while making clear that nothing in the country can go against Islamic principles, leaves enough wiggle room and vagueness that accommodates the diverse interpretations of Islam in the country.
But the Taliban insisted on Shariah as the only source of law, as opposed to being just one of the sources, complicating compliance with international laws and treaties, she said.
"The differences are very, very fundamental," Ms. Hares said. "They have tied so many elements of so many different constitutions together, and then put a flavor of Islam on everything -- be it foreign policy, be it economic system, be it whatever -- to an extent that the constitution talks about how the state is going to regulate how the individuals practice Islam."
In response to a question of whether the current Taliban want to bring the whole country back into an Islamic Emirate, the group's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, again remained vague.
"Our goal is Islamic government," Mr. Mujahid said. "How this Islamic government will come about is something we cannot decide now. On this issue, the clerics, analysts, and authoritative Afghans make decisions in its right time."
In private interviews, as well as in informal discussions with Afghan politicians, some Taliban figures leave the impression that the group still sees itself as a government forced into exile. What they want is the return of their Emirate with a more open embrace that shares power, but not a renegotiation of the fundamentals of how they view power.
"What they are saying to Americans is this: You have accepted Saudi Arabia, and we won't do more than their basic code -- retribution for murder, chop off the hand for robbing," Mr. Shinwari said. "If you have accepted Saudi, what's wrong with us being another? The rest will be your priorities: aid, friendship, economic relations."

Listening, and Editing, With the Third Ear

Texto completo: Every industry has its clichés, and no cliché gets more mileage in and around book publishing than "editors don't edit anymore."
That may be a gross exaggeration, but it's unlikely that any editor has a process as intimate, with shades of psychoanalysis, as the one often employed by Judith Gurewich, the publisher of Other Press.
But then Gurewich is not the average publisher. She grew up in Belgium and came to the United States with a law degree from Brussels University. She earned a Ph.D. in sociology from Brandeis, writing a thesis about the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's work and its possible applications to the field. She became a Lacanian analyst and still practices part-time.
When she founded Other Press in 1998, with Michael Moskowitz, also an analyst, the company published academic books about psychoanalysis. After a few years, Gurewich took the reins and left that niche behind. As a general-interest publisher, she still leans toward the intellectual: literature in translation, philosophy-inflected nonfiction.
Gurewich -- "I am too European to reveal my age" -- is an energetic, inquisitive and heady conversationalist. In her elegantly accented English, she refers to the subject of psychology as "a subverted form of theology." She outlines Hegel's master-slave dialectic in the easy way some people recap last night's Yankees game. During a discussion of Lacan's esoteric principles, she levels her piercing gaze and says: "The heart is the enemy of change."
The British novelist Rupert Thomson called Gurewich "a complete maverick, a force of nature."
She brings her intensity to her uniquely aural editing process, hosting authors at her home in Cambridge, Mass., for days at a time while they read their manuscripts aloud to her.
"I thought, 'Oh God, I'm going to be a prisoner of my editor,"' Michael Greenberg said of the invitation. "I had never encountered anything like this." At that point, in 2007, neither had Gurewich. Greenberg was her first test case.
He was working at the time on "Hurry Down Sunshine," a harrowing and lyrical memoir about his teenage daughter's bipolar disorder. When he started reciting at Gurewich's dining-room table, for what would turn out to be five or six hours a day for three days, he remembers thinking that the process felt "a little crazy."
"Judith would say, 'Something's not right there.' She'd scrunch up her face," Greenberg said. At first, he was defensive when Gurewich flagged what she heard as problems. "Her English is very good, but it's not her first language. I would hold that above her: 'You don't know what you're talking about.' But she never gave ground."
When Thomson sat down to read his novel "Katherine Carlyle," the book had two endings, one of them labeled an epilogue. He was "quite proud" of this clever doubling, he said, and "felt wonderful" as he read it. When he finished, though, Gurewich "was just shaking her head and saying, 'That doesn't work."' A few minutes later, one of the endings had been moved to the front of the book.
Gurewich described her interruptions as physical reactions as much as, or more than, intellectual ones. "When my stomach intervenes, I stop the reading," she said. "I ask what happened. My job is not to interpret." She repeatedly emphasized that she's not there to offer specific solutions, but to identify problems.
"You have to point to the defense that's blocking the desire," Gurewich said. "Never put your desire in place of theirs."
Thomson recalled the novelist and literary critic John Gardner's maxim about the "vivid and continuous dream" of reading fiction. "I think that's what Judith gets in touch with when she listens," Thomson said. "If she stops me, it's because I've done something to break the dream."
As a child, Gurewich began to narrate her own life in the third person. "It's not because I'm smart" that the editing process works, she said. "It's because I'm incredibly primitive." While listening to an author read a manuscript, she added, "I forget who I am. I'm gone in the text."
"Judith made me feel both tense and relaxed at the same time," Greenberg said. "And both the tension and the relaxation came from the quality of her attentiveness. It was self-confrontational, not confrontational between us. You would have to confront things as you would with an analyst. She would prompt you."
Christine Coulson, a longtime writer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art whose first book, a work of fiction set at the museum, is being published this fall, was the rare writer who did her sessions with Gurewich over the phone. "Every time, she was right," Coulson said of Gurewich's interventions. "I needed her instinct on things. I really wanted to know what she thought. It's a funny dependency that develops."
And as in a therapeutic relationship, that dependency can produce bumpy moments.
"We have opposite personalities," Bonnie Nadzam said of her relationship with Gurewich. "Especially at that time in my life." The author was 30 and living in Colorado when she made the visit to Gurewich's home in 2010. "I was very meek, very unsure of myself. And Judith said, 'This is how it's going to go. This is the chair you sit in."'
The two were working on Nadzam's unsettling first novel, "Lamb," about a grieving middle-aged man who befriends an 11-year-old girl. Nadzam was pleased with the vocal editing process. One key development was Gurewich's suggestion to scale back moments of suggested physical intimacy in the book, so that they wouldn't overshadow its psychological elements or potentially alienate readers.
It was afterward, when Nadzam was publicizing the novel, that tension arose. The press was interested in comparing the book to "Lolita." Nadzam found the comparison facile and resented the emphasis on it, but Gurewich disagreed, thinking it was a fertile area of discussion.
"I had to begin to navigate this ground of becoming more confrontational and protective of my work with Judith," Nadzam said. "It was uncomfortable because we had a great working relationship, but I needed to push back. And she wasn't used to me pushing back."
Despite that tension, and the fact that Gurewich passed on publishing Nadzam's next novel, the two have become close friends.
Issac Bailey's work with Gurewich was a clear case of the relationship feeling as much like therapy as editing. Bailey's 2018 memoir, "My Brother Moochie," is about the experience of his large, African-American family in South Carolina after his oldest brother received a life sentence for murdering a white man in 1982. Bailey was 9 at the time. All these years later, he had deep emotional concerns about how to write about sensitive family material. Gurewich "pushed me beyond that," he said, and "made it very clear that I should not tiptoe."
"At least initially, it seemed a bit off-putting," Bailey said of the editing sessions. "She has this laserlike intensity. All of the niceties just go by the wayside. Once you get used to that, it's much easier to be very frank with her as well. And it sharpens your thinking all around."
The niceties might take a back seat during the readings, but the rest of the visit is amenity-filled. "You're embraced with the most wonderful hospitality," Greenberg said. "You're enfolded into her family life and her social life. There's a dinner every night." Nadzam compared the experience to an extended Thanksgiving and mentioned that Gurewich and her husband, Victor, introduced her to the TV series "Mad Men" while she was there, watching five episodes each night.
Thomson said he reads his writing aloud when he's alone but that reading to Gurewich is a "much purer, starker version of that process." He said he's "slightly confounded" when he tries to name the difference, but he can feel it.
"There's even less room for self-deception if there's two people in the room," he said. "Maybe there's no room."

Texto completo: The human comedy struts the boards in "The Queen," Frank Simon's 1968 documentary of the Miss All-American Camp Beauty Pageant -- a small movie with a big heart that is being revived at the IFC Center in a new 4K digital restoration.
Female impersonation was illegal in New York when "The Queen" was made, except onstage. (Ridiculous theater was in its glory days.) The pageant, a brainchild of the promoter Jack Doroshow, was held in Manhattan in 1967 and advertised as "a satirical happening."
Mr. Doroshow, then in his mid-20s and an organizer of many previous such shows, plays a fond, if acerbic, materfamilias both offstage and on, under the name Flawless Sabrina. Resplendently coifed, wearing drag she describes as a "bar mitzvah mother thing," Sabrina bears a slight resemblance to Joan Rivers and exhibits a showbiz savvy to match, riffing on the difficulty of finding a hotel "hip enough" to house her contestants. (It turns out to be a Times Square fleabag.)
Directed and partly shot by Frank Simon, "The Queen" is a credible exercise in Maysles Brothers-style cinéma vérité focused on subjects who clearly enjoy being on camera. Answering questions posed by two of the pageant's judges, the writer Terry Southern and the painter Larry Rivers, the contestants openly discuss past beauty shows, their families, their interest (or lack thereof) in transitioning to women, and, relevant to the moment, their draft status.
Their solidarity is impressive up until the pageant's final moments. One of the few manifestations of diva temperament is a sulky demand for an "emergency wig" by Miss Harlow, an 18-year-old native of Philadelphia and the eventual winner, doted on by the camera and Sabrina. There is reason to wonder if the fix is in, which is exactly what the second runner-up, Miss Crystal, claims, seizing the drama queen crown with a splendid tantrum.
Released by Grove Press in June 1968, "The Queen" played well at the Kips Bay Theater and went to the Cannes International Film Festival. In her review in The New York Times, Renata Adler was enthusiastic about the film, which she said "shows us another America." But she was also a bit patronizing: "It is good to watch for about an hour these colorful human beings whose entire self-image is a put-on." Andrew Sarris, the critic for the presumably less square Village Voice, was simply patronizing: "The drag-queen contestants are eminently likable in curiously peripheral ways."
Talented too, I'd say: One of them belts out a witty version of "Honey Bun," the cross-dressing showstopper from "South Pacific." Best of all, the underground superstar Mario Montez, introduced with the honorific "Mister," drops by to perform a slightly mangled version of "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend." Endearingly disheveled, he serves as reminder that all the contestants are self-created works of art.
Also on the bill, "Queens at Heart" is a mid-1960s relic, subjecting four people in various stages of gender transition to a pseudo-sociological interrogation. Much is made of their double lives -- something mirrored by the 22-minute movie itself, at once an exploitation film and an educational one, with a tone variously prurient, dismissive and nonjudgmental.

Texto completo: It could be argued, in this era of "fake news," that revealing the actual process of really great reporting can help combat the narrative of fake news. It could be that I'm biased — I've, admittedly, got a passion for good reporting, and I think that "The New York Times" is among the very best in the game.
"The Weekly," the new television series produced by "The New York Times" for FX and Hulu, takes the newspaper's reporting to another level. The new series, now at four episodes, takes a deeper, documentary-style look at some of the Times' best reporting.
Each half-hour episode features a Times journalist investigating one of the most pressing issues of the day. With more than 1,550 journalists scattered across 160 countries, The Times produces 2,500 stories a week – investigative reports, political scoops, cultural dispatches. And each week, "The Weekly" chooses to tell just one of these stories in a visual and unforgettable way.
Episode one, which premiered on June 2, profiles the T.M. Landry College Preparatory — which attracted national attention for sending a large number of minority students to the Ivy League. Erica Green and Katie Benner's investigation proved that the viral success stories were full of deception, and that the truth was much darker.
Episode two looks at New York City taxi drivers, who have been pushed to bankruptcy, foreclosure, and even suicide. Brian Rosenthal and Emma Graves's year-long investigation into the collapse of the taxi medallion industry reveals how the system was rigged against the drivers, and those who profited from it.
In episode three, Caitlin Dickerson looks at the separation of children from their families at the Mexico–United States border remains among the most controversial practices of President Donald Trump's administration. Dickerson uncovers the untold story of baby Constantin, who spent most of his first 10 months of life separated from his parents by the American government.
Episode four examines an idealistic American couple, bicycling around the world, who cross paths with a group of young men radicalized by ISIS. Rukmini Callimachi investigates how these lives tragically intersect on a remote Tajikistan road.
This weekend, I watched them all. Each episode is compelling in its way. Critics say the reporting comes across as a little too "meta" or self-congratulatory. I'm not left with that impression while watching. The reporting feels organic, and the storytelling is masterful. These are great reporters, sharing great work in a new way. And, aesthetically, it's quite beautiful.
The photography is gorgeous — because it's The New York Times. And each episode kind of pulls back the curtain on how the paper got the story.
It could be argued, in this era of "fake news," that revealing the actual process of really great reporting can help combat the narrative of fake news. It could be that I'm biased — I've, admittedly, got a passion for good reporting, and I think that "The New York Times" is among the very best in the game. The Times' reporters are about as good as it gets, and "The Weekly" pulls back the curtain to give the viewer a look at how these stories are reported.
The stories that are showcased are really wonderful, and show why "The New York Times" is so good at what it does.
If you have Hulu, I'd recommend that you check out "The Weekly."

Texto completo: Kim Kardashian-West has no plans to change the name of her Kimono line.
The makeup mogul faced accusations of cultural appropriation after announcing her new shapewear line, Kimono Solutionwear. Although Kimono is a play on her first name, fans slammed the reality star for trying profit off the term for a traditional Japanese garment.
However, Kardashian-West is standing by her product's moniker.
"I made the decision to name my company Kimono, not to disassociate the word from its Japanese roots but as a nod to the beauty and detail that goes into a garment," she said in a statement to The New York Times Thursday.
'#KimOhNo': Kim Kardashian's plan to trademark 'Kimono' angers Twitter
Kardashian-West told the outlet that she has no plans "to design or release any garments that would in any way resemble or dishonor the traditional garment," adding that she has "deep respect for the significance of the kimono in Japanese culture. "
And for anyone who took particular offense to her trademarking the word? It's just business, Kardashian-West explained.
"Filing a trademark is a source identifier that will allow me to use the word for my shapewear and intimates line but does not preclude or restrict anyone, in this instance, from making kimonos or using the word kimono in reference to the traditional garment," she told the Times.
Watch out Spanx: Kim Kardashian is launching her own shapewear line
Despite being accused of being culturally insensitive, Kardashian-West said she actually built her shapewear line with "inclusivity and diversity at its core. "
"I’m incredibly proud of what’s to come," she added.
Kardashian-West first revealed her product on Twitter Tuesday, writing, "Finally I can share with you guys this project that I have been developing for the last year. I’ve been passionate about this for 15 years. Kimono is my take on shapewear and solutions for women that actually work. "
The announcement sparked the Twitter hashtag #KimOhNo.
"Been here since kimonos were still part of Asian culture and heritage, and not rebranded by American billionaires for more money," one user tweeted.

Survivor of Oslo rampage sows peace

Texto completo: After narrowly escaping the gun rampage that slaughtered 69 of his campmates at a youth retreat in 2011, Bj¸rn Ihler began poring through the manifesto of the man responsible for Norway's deadliest terrorist attack.
What he found was not a monster, but something worse: the attacker, Anders Behring Breivik, was not so different from him. He was a creation of the same country Ihler called home.
"We can't just say that this is the act of a monster or a madman -- someone who is not like us," Ihler said in a recent interview. "Because the reality is ... he is a human being like us and so, for me, it was really important to recognize that and recognize his humanity. To say his name and not give him any mythical power."
Ihler's insight, shared on a tour of the Twin Cities this month, was meant to help communities around the state and country come to terms with a wave of recent deadly attacks on places of worship. It also comes as state and federal officials are scrambling to respond to a sustained rise in hate crimes and attempting to curb all types of extremist violence. Minnesota law enforcement agencies recorded 146 hate crime incidents in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available. That was a 22% increase over the 119 reported in 2016.
The 27-year-old peace activist was featured in Twin Cities forums on the intersection of intolerance and violence and the fear so often behind decisions to take deadly action.
Ihler's visit came at the invitation of Heartland Democracy Executive Director Mary McKinley, who met the shooting survivor last year at the United Nations General Assembly. There, during a panel discussion on youth and violent extremism, Ihler asked why only speakers from the Muslim world were called on to attend.
"Why is this something that we should only engage Muslim youth when the reality is it comes not just from the Muslim community but from my community?" Ihler recalled asking as he spoke Monday at a gathering at Macalester College in St. Paul.
McKinley and her Minneapolis nonprofit have sought to broaden community conversations in Minnesota on violent extremism beyond Islamist-inspired terrorism, which has dominated public discourse in response to waves of young Somali men charged over the past decade with supporting al-Shabab and ISIS.
"We really saw after the ISIS trials [in 2016], like with many things that happen in communities, there is kind of a crisis response in the moment and not much that happens afterward," McKinley said.
The latest example of hate-inspired violence in Minnesota -- the 2017 bombing of Bloomington's Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center -- was carried out by a trio of Illinois militia members who sought to strike fear in the local Muslim community.
"We see it as a call to action," McKinley said, pointing to more recent attacks like the massacre of 51 Muslims in New Zealand and a series of synagogue shootings in the U.S. since last fall. "We see that this does live in our communities. We've seen it recently in Minnesota. But we don't need to just be fearful about it and angry about it. There are actions we can take to build better relationships and have honest conversations about change."
Ihler has traveled the world meeting with former extremists and the victims of their terror. Since the 2011 attack in Norway, he said, Western countries are still failing to understand that violent extremism is not something foreign to their societies, but instead part of them.
The day he arrived in Minneapolis, Ihler noted, the New York Times published a report on intolerance toward Somali Muslims in St. Cloud. The irony did not escape him that the story included a quote from a conservative policy group leader that the influx of refugees "aren't people coming from Norway."
Fear of the unknown, Ihler said, also proves to be a common catalyst for extremist movements ranging from white supremacists to Islamic jihadists. And all violent extremism, he said, "is tied to ... a violent denial of diversity."
"Most extremists have a narrative of, our tribe is under threat of extermination and our only option is to fight back through violence," Ihler said. "Really the only way to deal with that is to build societies where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated -- in which we see the inherent value of having different persons and having difference experiences come together to create societies that thrive."
Heartland Democracy, which sponsored Ihler's visit, attracted global attention for its counseling of Abdullahi Yusuf while he was in federal custody after admitting trying to join ISIS alongside eight other young Twin Cities men in 2014. Ahmed Amin, an assistant principal at Sanford Middle School in Minneapolis, described his two years of working with Yusuf during a forum with Ihler last week at Hamline University.
Amin recalled a young man experiencing an identity crisis and who saw his family encountering bigotry as he grew up. "He was seeking a narrative in the world that in many ways helped him make sense of what was happening," Amin said.
Yusuf bought into an ideology that was "dangerous and reckless," Amin said. Yusuf has since emerged from a federal halfway house to become a productive member of society, according to Amin. Amin asked the Hamline audience to envision building communities where a sense of belonging prevails: "Does anyone think someone will want to hurt a community that they feel like they belong in?"
'He was ... one of us'
James Denley, a sociologist studying mass violence and co-founder of the Violence Project, corroborates Ihler's assessment of fear as a leading driver of hate crimes. Denley casts some of the blame for a three-year nationwide surge in hate crimes on rhetoric by President Donald Trump and his response to 2017 white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. But while it's tempting to assign blame to one person, Denley added, the rise in hate is "a broader systemic problem and we should look at it as such."
On Monday, Ihler was asked how he deals with anger in the years since the 2011 attack in Norway. He described the car ride home with his father in the hours after being rescued from the island in the camp, and how the two discussed where to go from there. He could choose to fill himself with anger and act out destructively, Ihler recalled, or turn it into something positive.
Ihler also recalled seeing Breivik in shackles and without a weapon at the first public court hearing in the months after the attack -- his first look at the man since he pointed and fired at him on the island. In an interview, Ihler said he eventually decided to speak out, rejecting the popular tendency to speak of Breivik only in hushed tones or not at all. He also welcomed a court ruling that Breivik was mentally competent to stand trial.
"He was ruled to be one of us, and for me that was important," Ihler said. "If we say Anders Breivik is mentally ill, we say everyone with that belief system is mentally ill. We rule out that entire side of the dialogue at the same time and lose the ability to bring people back into society to show them that their belief system is wrong: that people should be able to live together with backgrounds of a diverse nature."

Texto completo: Writer E. Jean Carroll came forward last week with a rape allegation against President Donald Trump, and on Thursday the two women she privately confided in after the alleged assault spoke publicly for the first time.
In an interview on the New York Times podcast “The Daily,” Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin, journalists who have worked in New York media for decades, describe their conversations with Carroll, the conflicting advice they gave, and what has happened since.
In a detailed excerpt from her upcoming memoir, “What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,” published in New York magazine on Friday, Carroll accuses Trump of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. She said he pulled down her tights and penetrated her. Trump has repeatedly denied the allegation — as he's done with the 19 other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct — claiming, “I’ve never met this person in my life. " (A picture in New York magazine shows Trump and Carroll together at a 1987 party. )
ANALYSIS: Why are we so reluctant to talk about Carroll's accusation?
EXPERTS: Why the 'too ugly to rape' argument doesn't hold up
Carroll recalls in the podcast that she fought back vigorously during the alleged assault. Afterward, she ran out of the department store, got onto 6th Avenue, pulled her phone out of her purse and called Birnbach, who was home on the Upper East Side with her two kids, then aged 6 and 3.
Birnbach said she remembers Carroll "laughing" as she told the story. She said repeatedly that Trump pulled down her tights. Birnbach said at first she was laughing, too, but as Carroll continued she stopped, realizing what her friend was describing was rape.
"Honestly, you said 'he put his penis in me,'" Birnbach recalls. "And I said 'what? He raped you?'"
Birnbach said she encouraged Carroll to go to the police. She said she would go with her, but Carroll declined.
"It was 15 minutes of my life. It's over. Don't ever tell anybody. I just had to tell you," Birnbach remembers Carroll saying.
Sometime later, between one and three days, Carroll told Martin. She was no longer laughing.
"She was like, 'I can't believe this happened. " Martin said.
Fearing Trump was too powerful to take on, Martin's advice to Carroll was the opposite of Birnbach's. She remembers telling Carroll, "Don't tell anybody. I wouldn't tell anybody this. "
After these conversations, the women say they never spoke about the alleged attack again. Not during the presidential campaign, nor after the leaked Access Hollywood tape (on which Trump is heard saying he's famous enough to freely sexually harass and assault women).
Carroll told the New York Times she didn't come forward then because she suspected her story wouldn't make a difference. She's faced criticism for coming out with her accusation now, including from Trump, who said "She is trying to sell a new book — that should indicate her motivation. "
However, she's not the first writer to disclose sexual abuse in a memoir.
"I think oftentimes, the place that the public and the media go is to thinking this is something someone is disclosing because of what they have to gain — to sell more copies," said Laura Palumbo, communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. "But for a lot of survivors, a book is really an opportunity to tell their story on their own terms. "
Carroll said she had no expectations her book would have an impact.
"I've learned as a woman of 76 years to have absolutely no expectations, because if you have even a half of an expectation, you will be disappointed," she said.
Since Carroll's story was published, the National Sexual Assault Hotline reports it has seen a 53% increase in calls.
If you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800. 656. HOPE (4673) or visit hotline. rainn. org/online and receive confidential support.

Texto completo: U.S. Soccer said Wednesday that it would create an anonymous, third-party reporting system to field complaints from employees after more than a dozen current and former staff members castigated the federation for allowing what they said was a "toxic" workplace environment at the organization's Chicago headquarters.
The announcement, made in a letter to all federation employees, was released less than a day after a New York Times article that, through interviews with current and former employees, substantiated a variety of anonymous complaints posted on a networking website.
"You have a voice and we want to hear it," U.S. Soccer's president, Carlos Cordeiro, wrote in the letter, which acknowledged the Times article in its opening sentence.
{Far from the World Cup, a rebellion brews inside U.S. Soccer .]
Details of the new system, set to be run by an outside party apart from U.S. Soccer's current leadership, would be explained "in the days ahead," Cordeiro's letter said. In the meantime, he said, employees could take advantage of an existing reporting hotline handled by U.S. Soccer's legal department. That system, Cordeiro noted, accepts anonymous complaints.
In the Times article, current and former federation employees described the online reviews as a campaign to alert leaders like Cordeiro and federation board members to a troubled workplace culture in which employees' comings and goings were monitored, and in which those with dissenting views were either reprimanded or marginalized. One employee described the campaign as "a cry for help."
The culture, several employees said in telephone interviews, has been allowed to fester under the federation's longtime chief executive, Dan Flynn, and one of his top deputies, Jay Berhalter.
Flynn has announced his intention to retire, and Berhalter, U.S. Soccer's top commercial officer, has emerged as a leading candidate to replace him, perhaps as soon as next month.
Cordeiro, whose letter praised Flynn's 19-year tenure as the chief, said he was personally leading the committee looking for a successor. Before a public announcement on the hire, U.S. Soccer employees will learn the search committee's decision and the board will confirm the new chief, Cordeiro said in the letter.
"I sincerely hope that we have your confidence to make the right decision," he added.

At a Florida Shelter, Days Become Months For Migrant Children

Texto completo: HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- About half of the roughly 2,300 children confined in a privately run Florida facility intended as a temporary shelter for migrant teenagers have been there for more than 20 days and many of them for months, despite legal standards that require children who cross the border to be speedily released or sent to state-licensed shelters that are equipped to offer longer-term care.
The Homestead center near Miami, the only one in the government's large network of shelters run by a private, for-profit corporation, is intended to keep children for only a few days, but has been holding them for much longer as a result of the unusually large number of unaccompanied children arriving in recent months along the southwest border.
A recent population census, from June 25, showed that 1,162 children at the shelter had been there longer than 20 days. The report, obtained by The New York Times from a Homestead employee, listed 840 children who had been there more than 30 days, and 224 for at least 60 days.
A Guatemalan boy had been there the longest, 122 days, according to the report. A 14-year-old Guatemalan girl had been there 119 days.
The Homestead shelter has been the subject of close scrutiny in recent days, as overcrowding at migrant facilities along the border has led to growing concerns about the handling of migrant children not just at the border, but across the country. For several days, the Trump administration has been under attack for filthy housing conditions observers saw at a border station near Clint, Tex.
On Wednesday, ahead of the opening presidential debate, a parade of Democratic presidential contenders streamed out to the Homestead facility to criticize the conditions under which migrant children are being held at facilities along the border.
"What is happening at Homestead to children -- what is happening as the direct result of activities of the United States government -- is wrong," said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who led the pack. "It is a stain on our country, and we must speak out." Following Ms. Warren later in the day were Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Jane Sanders, the wife of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Children living at Homestead have complained that it is extremely crowded and noisy, and that they enjoy no privacy, according to reports filed with a federal court. They report feeling increasingly despondent because they have no idea when they will be released, lawyers said. Rules prohibit them from listening to music or writing in a journal. Some reported having suicidal thoughts.
Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist who has visited the facility, said the noise level was extremely high, especially in a tent with no soundproofing where "children are crammed" and teachers must use microphones to be heard above the noise.
"One child told me that many of the girls used requests for a bathroom break as a means to just briefly escape the noise and insufferable crowding, but that teachers had caught onto this and were refusing the requests," she said.
In many shelters, children are occasionally taken on outings for a change of environment. At Homestead, Dr. Cohen said, "the children never get out of this place, unless they have a medical appointment."
Immigrant advocates have gone to court to argue that Homestead should be required to meet the rigorous standards established for detaining migrant children -- though government officials argue that the facility, operated as a temporary "influx" shelter, not a detention center, is not legally required to do so.
Under those standards, established under a 1997 consent decree, children must generally be released within about 20 days, or transferred to a licensed shelter that has comfortable living accommodations and a full education program.
Costing over $ 1 million a day to operate, Homestead opened in February after the Trump administration closed a teeming tent city for migrant children in the desert at Tornillo, on the Texas border, which critics had described as a juvenile prison.
Sandwiched between a former Job Corps campus and the Homestead Air Reserve Base, the Homestead facility houses adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18. The facility's beige barrackslike dormitories and white tents feel a world apart from the upscale gated communities nearby with names like Waterstone and Malibu Bay.
Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees government shelters, said the agency was struggling to accommodate a surge in arrivals of migrant minors, who are mainly from Central America. Shelters across the country are currently holding more than 13,000 children and are at 90 percent capacity, with new referrals totaling more than 52,000 children so far this year -- a 60 percent increase over 2018.
"As you are aware, we are responding to a historical crisis at the border," she said, adding that in the current fiscal year her agency had received more referrals than for the entire 2018 fiscal year.
In May, the average length of stay at Homestead was 35 days, she said, compared with 44 days at the state-licensed, longer-term shelters.
Tetiana Anderson, a spokeswoman for Caliburn International, the private company that operates Homestead, said in response to questions that, "Every day at the Homestead shelter, over 4,000 bilingual Caliburn employees strive to provide the highest level of care and to unite each child with a vetted sponsor as swiftly as possible."
"The truth is the children at the Homestead temporary emergency shelter are provided a wide range of services -- medical and behavioral care, daily educational classes, recreational exercise both inside and outside. The physical and emotional well-being of each and every child is the shelter's primary concern," she said.
After the closing of the tent camp for migrant children at Tornillo, the government announced that it would double the capacity at Homestead, which had operated briefly under President Obama.
Unlike Tornillo, Homestead is operated by a for-profit company, Comprehensive Health Services, owned by Caliburn -- and there is no sign that it will be functioning only temporarily.
But like the tent city in Texas, the facility in Florida is not subject to state regulations and inspections intended to guarantee child welfare -- only to a loose set of Department of Health and Human Services guidelines.
In contrast, permanent shelters traditionally used to detain minors must abide by state requirements for staff vetting and training, as well as standards that ensure minors are educated and safe.
Ms. Stauffer, the spokeswoman for the refugee agency overseeing Homestead and more than 165 other migrant shelters in 23 states, said the agency was preparing to open another temporary influx shelter in Carrizo Springs, Tex., expected to hold 1,300 minors. A new permanent facility just opened that will house about 100 youngsters in Lake Worth, Fla.
The pilgrimage of Democratic candidates began on Tuesday, when Representative Eric Swalwell of California dropped in to greet a cadre of regular protesters.
More than a dozen candidates are expected to visit by the end of the week; Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii scheduled stops for Thursday.
On Friday, a local congresswoman, Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Miami, plans to arrive with a gaggle of candidates: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro of Texas; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Kamala Harris of California; former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado; and the spiritual guru Marianne Williamson.
During her visit, Ms. Warren, mobbed by television cameras, took the hand of Summit Wicks-Lim, 8, and they climbed step ladders to peek into the shelter property.
At first, there was little activity. "There's no children out right now," said Summit, who had come from Massachusetts with her mother.
Then, several children came out in single file, Ms. Warren said.
Some of them looked over. Ms. Warren, in sunglasses and a baseball cap, and Summit, in sunglasses and braids, waved. Ms. Warren lifted Summit up so she could see a little better.
"Los queremos!" activists yelled out to them in Spanish. We care about you.
"Estamos luchando por ustedes. No están solos," read one of their banners. We are fighting for you. You are not alone.
Some of the protesters raised big red cardboard hearts.

Texto completo: Apple hopes to lure political junkies to its Apple News service with new at-a-glance candidate profiles of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.
These curated candidate guides will appear ahead of the first two Democratic debates, taking place Wednesday and Thursday in Miami and broadcast on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.
Guides will include content from several of Apple’s news partners, including USA TODAY, ABC, Axios, CNN, Fox, NBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, TIME and Vox.
Profiles are being set up for the same 20 candidates who will take the Democratic debate stage, 10 on each night. Candidates left out of these first debates won’t have an Apple News profile either, at least for now.
As contenders along the way drop out of the race, the guides will also be whittled down, giving more bandwidth to the candidate pages of those who remain.
The guides can be found in the Top Stories section within the Apple News app on iPhones, iPads and Macs. They'll include an illustration of the candidates, plus bios, quotes and their key positions on select issues chosen on the basis of their specific platforms.
iOS 13 beta:10 reasons to get the software now if you're feeling brave
Apple News itself is free, though the premium Apple News+ service costs about 10 bucks monthly, giving you access to some 300 magazines, plus The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star.
Any paywalled articles related to a Democratic candidate will only be made available to those who subscribe or are trying out Apple News+.
Apple hopes voters will not only skim profiles before and during the debate but continue to follow favored candidates throughout the election cycle; stories about them will appear within Apple News feeds.
Apple is also working with NBC to get real-time fact-checking and video clips of key moments during the debate.
Each candidate guide will more or less get the same amount of space, with some variation for those who have been in the public eye longer.
And yes, Apple plans something similar for any GOP candidates who might challenge President Donald Trump during the primary season.

Debate could give Warren a boost

Texto completo: With the first Democratic presidential debate looming, Elizabeth Warren's supporters are hopeful her performance Wednesday will extend her already-growing reach.
Recent polls show the Massachusetts senator's numbers rising by 6 to 11 percentage points since March. One poll, which measures electability, has her "virtually tied" with Bernie Sanders for second place after front-runner Joe Biden at 32%. But both Biden and Sanders have seen some slippage, the former vice-president by as much as 5 percentage points in the Quinnipiac University poll.
"Warren has been rising in the polls, and the debate is a chance for her to lock in her status as a top contender for the party's nomination," reported the June 22 Boston Globe.
A cover story on Warren in Sunday's New York Times Magazine credits her for "stepping into the vacuum for economic populism the president has left." Calling her "a policy wonk who was also a force and a symbol," it cites polls in California and Nevada showing her tied for second place there.
Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign (PCC) in Washington, D.C., a PAC supporting Warren, attributes that rise to more people being "in the room with her" and hearing her address issues they're dealing with. "It's tying her plans to her own personal struggle," he said in an interview. "She was a single parent and she struggled (too)."
The PAC was at first concerned when a random drawing landed Warren in the first of two debates. It's in Thursday's lineup that most of the heavy hitters will be. But Green now sees an advantage. "She'll drive it," he predicts of Warren's performance on Wednesday.
This week the PCC kicks off a website, SwitchtoWarren.com, featuring voters who have done that.
Interviews with some Iowa Warren supporters help explain why. Hilary Becker, 30, of Spencer, connects deeply with her as a struggling mother. After her 5-year-old daughter, who has some costly special needs, was born, Becker was hospitalized, causing her to miss work as a certified nursing assistant. While medical bills piled up, her factory-worker husband had his hours cut and was told to collect unemployment to make up for them.
"We are able-bodied people that can work and we felt guilty using that, but we needed the benefits," Becker said. Ultimately, the company moved to Alabama. The couple patched together their work schedules to minimize child care expenses. Becker says Warren knows what it's like to delay her own goals, while "So many people in politics don't get where the average person is coming from."
"We shouldn't have to be living in poverty. My husband has a four-year degree," said Becker, who was raised in a conservative Republican household. At 18, she cast her first vote – for Barack Obama. She's working to further her education and supported Sanders in the last election, calling him a "great activist." But she thinks Warren's the one now.
More surprising is the support Warren gets from 68-year-old Margaret Klee of Des Moines, a retired Navy captain of 23 years, who considers herself independent. She voted for George W. Bush in 2000 because she thought Al Gore only talked of representing the poor and middle class. But Klee, who has been going to see as many candidates as she can, credits Warren most for staying consistent in her message of "making government work for everybody, not just the lobbyists."
She supported Sanders in 2016, but can't see him winning with his self-described socialist stances. She thinks Biden isn't "up to date enough for young people." Klee calls Warren "very much a capitalist," while supporting Social Security, Medicare, and free college tuition.
Warren proposes spending $1.25 trillion for free college tuition and to cancel student debt. Her support of a wealth tax to pay for child care, her creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other anti-corruption work have garnered the support of 62-year-old Matt Tapscott of Decorah, a home day-care provider. He was a Sanders supporter in 2016 but says Warren's intellect, experience and engagement persuaded him. A small experience with Sanders also played a role. Tapscott was with his 12-year-old son at an event with Sanders in a group of about 25. When he introduced Sanders to his son, he was disappointed the senator had no words for him.
"I really like Bernie but he is kind of curmudgeonly," Tapscott said.
The Iowans I interviewed are white, as is Warren. People of color are expected to cast pivotal votes this year, and the field includes several black, brown or mixed-race candidates. But the Associated Press noted that Warren had thousands of black women "on their feet roaring cheers and applauding," at an April women's forum at Texas Southern University. The cheers eclipsed those for Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, it observed. And Green recalled a March event at Jackson State College in Mississippi, where Warren was asked about her favorite Bible verse. Noting she used to teach Sunday school, she offered one about the powerful and powerless. The crowd went wild, he said.
Much can change with this unusually crowded field. Momentum is that esoteric, unpredictable driver of turnout that simply has to be felt. We saw it around Obama in his first primary campaign, and around Sanders before Clinton clinched the nomination. And hopefully we learned that momentum can't be created or suppressed by a party or other entity; it has to be acted on.

Texto completo: We have reached the breaking point. Hundreds of thousands of migrants are throwing themselves in to the care of border agents, who now function almost exclusively as babysitters and healthcare providers, courtesy of the American taxpayer.
There is no more space in the detention centers for the still hundreds of thousands more making their way here. The Department of Homeland Security, running low on cash, is now making cuts to legal services and other goodies we’re forced by law to give to anyone who shows up at the border, so that agents can at least try keeping some semblance of a system in place.
But Democrats and liberals in the media are instead wilding out about how scared the children are and how it’s too bright in the detention centers for the hordes of illegal immigrants get their beauty sleep.
The next time a liberal judge or a House Democrat complains about turning the lights off in detention centers, Trump should direct ICE to do it. When 30 people are raped in the dark in just one facility as a consequence, let those who complained about the lights be the ones to explain why this happened.
The New York Times reported in February that the Justice Department had reviewed more 1,303 cases of alleged sexual abuse of migrant minors in U.S. custody. Nearly all of them, 1,125, “were allegations of minors assaulting other minors,” the report said.
Liberals: Here’s an idea! Now let’s cram all the little tykes in pitch black rooms for a slumber party! Maybe next we’ll open up high school girls' locker rooms to Roy Moore.
The pressing issue right now is the crush of migrants that has overwhelmed the country, diverting billions of dollars of resources away from, say, black American families in need of federal housing.
Sorry, such cases must wait while we accommodate every person south of the border who can pronounce the word "asylum."
Democrats and other liberals don’t care about the minor discomfort of migrants who have to wait a few days in a detention center before they’re turned loose. If they did, they would have passed some form of legislation by now to stop the chaos. What they really want is exactly what’s happening — the full collapse of the southern border so that anyone from anywhere is allowed in, no questions asked.

Billionaires want wealth tax

Texto completo: Some of the richest people in the U.S. are calling for a federal wealth tax.
Financier George Soros, heiresses Regan Pritzker and Abigail Disney and Facebook Inc. co-founder Chris Hughes are among those calling for the levy to help address income inequality and provide funding to address climate change and public health issues.
“We are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1% of Americans — on us,” according to a letter signed by 19 individuals — one anonymously — and posted online Monday. “The next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle-income and lower-income Americans.”
Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke support the idea, according to the letter. Warren has proposed a 2% tax on assets of $50 million or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1 billion. It is estimated to generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years.
The wealth tax isn’t embraced by all Democrats because many believe it would be difficult to assess objectively the value of wealth like artwork and jewels. There are also concerns that such a tax is unconstitutional because the federal government is prohibited from taxing property, only income.
The New York Times reported on the letter earlier Monday.
Some of those signing have already expressed concerns about America’s rising inequality. Hughes has evangelized for higher taxes on the rich in his book “Fair Shot.” Disney, whose grandfather and great-uncle founded Walt Disney Co., recently called Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger’s $65.6 million compensation package “insane.”
Another signatory, entrepreneur Nick Hanauer, first warned his “fellow zillionaires” about the country’s growing wealth divide in 2014, writing that “there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didn’t eventually come out.”
Such inequality has only deepened. Last week, Bernard Arnault joined Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates as the third person with a fortune of at least $100 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, whose 500 members have a total net worth of $5.5 trillion, up from $4.9 trillion two years ago.

What to Ask the Democratic Candidates

Texto completo: To the Editor:
It is shocking that not a single one of the questions The New York Times posed to the Democratic presidential candidates in "18 Questions. 21 Candidates. Here's What They Said" (nytimes.com, June 19) related to women's economic security, dignity or equality.
American voters would like to know what these 21 candidates plan to do to ensure that all working people have access to paid family leave, which only 17 percent of American workers have now; to narrow the wage gap, which won't close until 2059 for all women and well beyond for women of color without a change of course; and to expand protections against workplace harassment and discrimination for the 4 in 10 women who experience them.
A handful of candidates have spoken on these topics already, but until every candidate is asked, too many will ignore these critically important kitchen-table issues.
The economic security, dignity and equality of women -- who are 47 percent of the work force, 51 percent of the population, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters and 64 percent of primary or co-breadwinners in families with children -- must not be sidelined any longer.

Texto completo: The hosts on ABC's The View panned 2020 candidate Pete Buttigieg's town hall, in which he addressed the police shooting in South Bend, Indiana, that led to the death of Eric Logan.
The city's reaction to the incident was becoming so severe that Buttigieg had to leave the campaign trail to address it.
"I have this feeling that these guys who are running who are mayors and governors should keep doing their jobs," Joy Behar said, adding that Buttigieg leaving South Bend to run for president "seems like an unfinished job."
Sunny Hostin said the South Bend mayor has "a problem with the African American community" in his city.
"And I thought he did a really piss-poor job of listening to those people in that town hall and feeling the pain," Meghan McCain said. iFrame ObjectThe town hall took place after protesters heckled Buttigieg, with the tense moment all caught on camera.
"You running for president and you expect black people to vote for you?" a protester asked.
Buttigieg replied, “I’m not asking for your vote.”
"You ain’t gonna get it either," the protester shot back.
Whoopi Goldberg said the “I’m not asking for your vote" line was a bad response.
People also heckled Buttigieg during the town hall, shouting, "We don’t trust you," according to the New York Times. While Buttigieg has not campaigned the past week, he does plan to participate in the first Democratic primary debate this week.

China’s Great Firewall and the end of globalization

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Biden's problem with Democrats is that he doesn't hate Republicans

Texto completo: Let's get this straight: Joe Biden is leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination because he's the most "electable" candidate in the Democratic field? A guy who doesn't realize that I worked with segregationists isn't a winning message with Democrats in 2020?
This is what you get when you turn to a candidate who has been in Washington for 46 years. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, when the Democratic Party was very different than it is today. As a freshman senator, he had to get along with the senior leadership of his party -- which included segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
You may be thinking: Who in the world are James Eastland and Herman Talmadge? You're not alone. Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of living Americans had either forgotten their names or never heard of them in the first place, until Biden decided to dredge them up from the fever swamps of the Democratic Party's sordid racial past.
Why, you ask, would he do such a thing? Because that's what Joe Biden does. He is a walking, talking gaffe machine. His point didn't even make sense. He was trying to argue that he can work across the aisle with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. But Eastland and Talmadge sat on the same side of the aisle as Biden in the Senate; they were Democrats.
So now his younger, less popular Democratic opponents are pouncing on Biden's mistake. California Sen. Kamala Harris (averaging 7.1% in the polls) declared that for Biden "to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it's just misinformed and it's wrong." New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2.3%) declared, "Vice President Biden's relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone." New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (0.3%) tweeted, "It's 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal."
Give me a break. No reasonable person thinks that Biden was defending or even sympathetic to segregation. What Biden was trying to do -- in his own, Bideny way -- was to defend not segregation but civility and compromise. But sadly, in today's Democratic Party, those ideas are just as controversial.
Recall that in February, Biden was forced to apologize for declaring -- brace yourself -- that Vice President Pence was a "decent guy." Then, a few months later, Biden had to backtrack on his effort to craft a middle-ground approach to climate change that would be embraced by both environmentalists and blue-collar voters. After Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thundered, "There is no 'middle ground' when it comes to climate policy," Biden soon embraced the Green New Deal.
And this month, Biden was forced to flip-flop and abandon his four-decade-long support for the Hyde amendment -- bipartisan legislation that bars public funding for abortions -- after his Democratic opponents attacked him for reaffirming what he once proudly called his "middle-of-the-road" policy on abortion. Biden has also been forced to apologize for his support for the bipartisan 1994 crime bill, which was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton but which Democrats now blame for the mass incarceration of African Americans. "I haven't always been right" on criminal justice, he declared earlier this year.
In today's Democratic Party, "compromise" and "consensus" are dirty words. Biden's problem is not that he is a closet racist; it's that he does not hate Republicans and other political opponents. As he put it on Tuesday, "Today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore." That is the point he was trying to make in his ham-handed way. And that is what his Democratic opponents are really upset about.
In a January speech, Biden said, "I read in The New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. Okay, well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned." Apparently, for many on the left, that sin is unforgivable.

Texto completo: If you want to keep a secret from the general public, a blog post about accelerating gender parity in globalization is probably a good place to hide it. Even a nerd like me recognizes that it can be hard to turn a new analysis of gender data into clickbait.
I'm going to try anyway, though, because in a blog post this week, the World Economic Forum released a new projection that demands our attention.
Based on data from its widely-respected Global Gender Gap Index, WEF estimates that it will take the United States another 208 years to reach gender equality. You read that right. At the current pace of change, gender equality won't arrive in the U.S. until the year 2227.
Underneath triumphant headlines about women running for office in record numbers, changing the face of Congress and breaking glass ceilings are trend lines that tell a much more somber story about the pace of progress for women in our country.
Although women now earn college and graduate degrees at higher rates than men, they remain concentrated in certain majors and, early in their careers, they are often channeled into less lucrative jobs. Men are 70% more likely to be executives than women their same age. In 2018, there were more Fortune 500 CEOs named James than there were women.
A damning number could spur us to action On the political front, women are 51% of the U.S. population, but hold only 24% of seats in Congress. And unlike 59 other countries — including India, Israel, Liberia, Slovakia, Mali, and Malawi — the U.S. has yet to have a female head of state.
WEF's projection also reflects the grim reality that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation where maternal mortality rates are actually getting worse. The risks are especially high for African American women, who are three to four times more likely to die during or after delivery than white women.
While 208 is a damning, daunting number, it is not destiny. The projection is based on the assumption that the rate of change will remain constant. If we can accelerate the pace of progress, that number will start to go down. And therein lies our call to action.
I know from experience that a startling statistic can be an animating force. About 25 years ago, Bill and I learned from a New York Times article that in developing countries, hundreds of thousands of children were dying of diarrhea each year. Bill and I had already decided that we wanted to give the majority of the wealth from Microsoft away, but until that article, we weren't sure how. That data point gave us direction and ultimately led us to start our foundation.
As it turned out, we were far from alone in wanting to do something about the unconscionable number of children dying preventable deaths. Our foundation was quickly connected to a wide range of partners eager to play a role in driving progress. Together, we created a new organization — Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — which has spurred a 40% decrease in the number of children in low-and-middle-income nations who die before their fifth birthday.
Spend money to speed up women's progress Once again, we find ourselves facing an urgent challenge that calls for new investment and collaboration. Shrinking the number 208 is going to require many people across many sectors. But I believe progress is possible, and as a philanthropist, I'm particularly interested in the role that philanthropy can play in accelerating it.
While comprehensive data on U.S. philanthropy is hard to find, there's evidence that gender equality in the U.S. has been chronically underfunded. Preliminary, unpublished research based on foundation data from Candid suggests that for every $1 spent on gender equality by private donors, there is $9.27 spent on higher education, and $4.85 spent on the arts. What's more, 90% of the money that is going toward women's issues is going toward women's reproductive health specifically. If we want to make gender equality a priority, we need to be spending more — and spreading those resources more broadly.
In addition to writing checks, philanthropists can play a critical role in driving progress by creating new platforms to bring people together. As we saw with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, it's essential to have a mechanism for getting a diverse range of stakeholders around the same table.
We need to tackle systemic inequality When it comes to the fight for gender equality, one of the most important assets we have is the huge array of people who are already activated — from the thousands of organizations that have been working on these issues for years to the more than 4 million women who joined women's marches across 600 cities. That's why I think there's a lot of potential in new efforts to channel existing energies and expertise more effectively into one broad-based assault on systemic inequality. My company, Pivotal Ventures, recently invested in two of these efforts — Time's Up and The Collaborative Fund for Women's Safety and Dignity. Both are creating new partnerships to tackle harassment, discrimination and inequality at scale.
The gender gaps in our country are real, and they aren't going away on their own — at least, not any time in the next 200 years. If we want to see them close in our lifetimes, we will need to come together to insist in one voice that equality can't wait. Over two decades ago, a statistic in a newspaper called me to action. I hope the statistic WEF published this week does the same for others. If we commit to being part of the solution, the number 208 is ours to reject.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said the "biggest mistake" of his presidency was picking Jeff Sessions for attorney general.
In an interview that aired Sunday morning on "Meet the Press," host Chuck Todd asked Trump, "If you could have one do-over as president, what would it be?"
To which Trump replied, "It would be personnel," before lashing out at his former attorney general.
"I would say if I had one do-over, it would be, I would not have appointed Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. That would be my one . . . that was the biggest mistake. "
It's not the first time Trump has openly criticized the former attorney general.
Trump fired Sessions as attorney general the day after the 2018 midterm elections, ending a year of open criticism. Trump had been incensed by Sessions' recusal from overseeing the Mueller investigation and railed against the former Alabama senator as "beleaguered" and "disgraceful," and he expressed "disappointment" in him.
The president told The New York Times in July 2017 that he would not have appointed Sessions if he had known Sessions would have recused himself.
In September 2018, Trump went so far as to tell Hill. TV: “I don’t have an attorney general. It’s very sad. ”

Sanders not a real socialist

Texto completo: That the Democrats' two nights of dueling oratory snippets this week are called "debates" validates Finley Peter Dunne's prediction that "when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy." Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun "socialism." So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America's puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: "All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie." Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders' socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in "a defining and pivotal moment." Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for "rights" to "useful" jobs, "good" education, "adequate" food and clothing and recreation, a "decent" living for farmers, a "decent" home, "adequate" medical care, "adequate" protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders' agenda for "completion" of FDR's New Deal is a right to a "decent" job, "quality" health care, "complete" education, "affordable" housing, a "clean" environment, a "secure" retirement. Details later.
Sanders says "what I mean by democratic socialism" is "economic rights are human rights." Really. That's it. FDR said "necessitous men are not free men," implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR's unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
The morning after Sanders' speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: "Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life." This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6% and the GDP 25.7% smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate Eugene Debs received (913,693) while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson's administration.
A young adult - a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism - who attended Sanders' exegesis of socialism told the Times: "In America we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks." Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a "major force" think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth ("I have a plan for that") Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a "capitalist to my bones," is a more authentic socialist than Sanders because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity. So she, even more than the other participants in this week's Democrats' presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Texto completo: I've been a student of L.G.B.T.Q. history for more than two decades. O.K., "Student of L.G.B.T.Q. history" is kind of a fancy term for a closeted 14-year-old furtively reading about leather bar etiquette and hanky codes (colored hankies were once used by some gay men to signal sexual interests) on GeoCities websites, but along the way I did manage to absorb a decent understanding of gay history in the United States.
To coincide with the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, I made a video, "Who Threw the First Brick at Stonewall?" Spoiler alert: No one knows for sure who threw it, or even if a literal brick was thrown. But I wanted to try to find out why the first brick had remained such a popular myth.
[The New York Times wants to capture the ever-evolving ways in which we describe ourselves. Tell us who you are.]
Those of you who don't spend hours online gossiping and arguing over RuPaul's Drag Race contestants might not know how pervasive first brick memes have become in certain queer internet communities.
They fall into three categories: earnest attempts to honor giants in the L.G.B.T.Q. movement ("Marsha P. Johnson threw the first brick at Stonewall"), tongue-in-cheek diva worship ("Madonna threw the first brick at Stonewall") and satirical takedowns of straight celebrities who overplay their hand trying to be queer allies ("Nick Jonas threw the first brick at Stonewall").
I love the silly first brick memes -- my favorite to date being that Mario Kart Toadette threw the first brick -- but the sincere ones that credited Sylvia Rivera or Marsha P. Johnson with inciting the Stonewall uprising gave me pause. The impact of Ms. Rivera and Ms. Johnson on the trans and gay movements can't be overstated, but it doesn't take much digging to learn that they didn't start the Stonewall rebellion.
It shouldn't surprise anyone that the internet can spread misinformation, but why had this particular fantasy of Stonewall taken on such importance in the queer imagination?
To find out, I interviewed people who participated in the Stonewall uprising, historians who had devoted years to studying L.G.B.T.Q. history and contemporary queer writers. It turns out that it wasn't just the question of who threw the first brick: Apparently no one can agree on almost anything about Stonewall.
Was a brick thrown, or a cobblestone, or rocks? Was the atmosphere on the street fun and festive, or grave and violent? Were patrons of Stonewall that night grieving Judy Garland's death? No one could come to consensus on these or many other questions.
In a sense, I was comforted by the disagreements of past generations of L.G.B.T.Q. people. While shooting the video, more than once I found myself thinking, "See? Millennials didn't invent queer infighting!"
But I also began to see these disagreements as fundamental to my history. When I interviewed Mark Segal, who was present for several nights of the protests at Stonewall and who was an early member of the Gay Liberation Front, he described the G.L.F. as both "the most dysfunctional organization that has ever existed in the L.G.B.T. community" and "literally why we have everything that we have today."
Indeed, the G.L.F., which was the first queer activist organization formed after Stonewall, argued about everything -- its structure, its purpose, its leadership, its mission, and on and on. My favorite anecdote was a disagreement about whether men's beards posed a masculine insult to women.
But the G.L.F. also set the stage for one of the most successful civil rights movements in the United States. Within a year of Stonewall, the G.L.F. organized three simultaneous gay pride marches in three cities -- before the concept of a "gay pride parade" even existed. Then they went on to create the first L.G.B.T.Q. community center and the first organization for gay youth and, from what I was told, they never once stopped arguing.
And that was a revelation to me -- disagreement was not tantamount to ineffectiveness.
There is much hand-wringing about disagreements in my community. I hear things like "we can't get anything done because all we do is argue" or "we're eating our own instead of banding together." Producing this video and conducting these interviews reminded me that separating disagreement from effectiveness is a false binary.
Granted, the arguments at the G.L.F. were happening face to face, and the disagreements in my community are largely mitigated by algorithms and social media platforms -- and therefore ultimately controlled by money and capital. But after talking with many L.G.B.T.Q. elders, I'm more wary of the medium of social media than I am of the disagreements themselves.
Fifty years after Stonewall, we're still arguing about what happened on that night. And that's kind of the point: Stonewall was, at its core, about people reclaiming their narratives from a society that told them they were sick or pitiful or didn't even exist.
Getting to tell your own story is a gift, but it means that you have to contend with other people's stories, and I guess that can mean arguing, maybe for 50 years straight. And that's O.K.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he would delay nationwide raids aiming to round up undocumented immigrants and deport them, saying that he would give Congress two weeks to sort out a deal on immigration.
"At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border," he wrote on Twitter. "If not, Deportations start!"
The raids were reported to begin in 10 major U. S. cities on Sunday, according to multiple news outlets, including the Washington Post and the New York Times.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump on Friday evening and asked him personally to call off the raids during a 12-minute phone call, according to a source familiar with the call. Pelosi also released a statement Saturday, hours before Trump's announcement, pressuring him to delay the operation.
"Tomorrow is Sunday, and as many people of faith attend religious services, the President has ordered heartless raids," said Pelosi, D-Calif. "It is my hope that before Sunday, leaders of the faith-based community and other organizations that respect the dignity and worth of people will call upon the President to stop this brutal action which will tear families apart and inject terror into our communities. "
The raids were reportedly planned in cities including Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York and San Francisco, according to CNN.
ICE raids on immigrants: Trump revives old pledge to remove migrants ahead of Florida campaign rally
Earlier this week, Trump announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would begin a massive deportation effort that he said would remove "millions" of undocumented immigrants from the U. S. The threat was made less than 24 hours before he officially kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign in Florida.
“Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States,” Trump posted on Twitter on Monday. “They will be removed as fast as they come in. ”
The president provided few details of the plan, and White House officials declined to provide specifics earlier this week. Instead, the administration referred USA TODAY to Trump's tweet and to a June 4 briefing by Mark Morgan, acting director of ICE. Morgan signaled then that the agency would increase deportations of families who had received deportation orders.
“We will be going after individuals who have gone through due process, who have received final orders of deportation," he said. "That will include families. Right now we’re talking about that and what it should look like. ”
The president has previously vowed to remove undocumented immigrants who had been ordered removed from the country by an immigration judge. It happened just days into his presidency. On Jan. 25, 2017, Trump signed an executive order instructing ICE agents to prioritize the nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants who have such orders of removal.
But removing "millions" of undocumented immigrants, like the president asserted, would involve clearing budget and logistical hurdles, experts said.
ICE agents have been following orders, arresting undocumented immigrants who were showing up for their regular, annual check-ins at ICE offices. But the administration has struggled to deport all of those undocumented immigrants because of historic backlogs in immigration court and the administration’s decision to deploy ICE agents to the southern border to respond to the growing number of Central American asylum-seekers.
ICE also faces budget constraints from Congress that limits how many people it can deport to about 400,000 a year. Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute, said the threat to deport “millions” of undocumented immigrants was "wildly unrealistic" and logistically, not possible.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A U.S. official said the military made preparations Thursday night for limited stri- kes on Iran in retaliation for the downing of a U.S. surveillance drone, but approval was abruptly withdrawn before the attacks were launched.
The official, who was not authorized to discuss the operation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the targets would have included radars and missile batteries.
The New York Times reported that President Donald Trump had approved the strikes, but then called them off. The newspaper cited anonymous senior administration officials.
The White House on Thursday night declined requests for information about whether Trump changed his mind.
According to the official who spoke to the AP, the strikes were recommended by the Pentagon and were among the options presented to senior administration officials.
It was unclear how far the preparations had gone, but no shots were fired or missiles launched.
The military operation was called off around 7:30 p.m. Washington time, after Trump had spent most of Thursday discussing Iran strategy with top national security advisers and congressional leaders.
Asked earlier in the day about a U.S. response to the attack, Trump said, “You’ll soon find out.”
Trump declared that “Iran made a very big mistake” by shooting down the U.S. drone over the Strait of Hormuz. But he also suggested that shooting down the drone was a foolish error rather than an intentional escalation of the tensions that have led to rising fears of open military conflict.
“I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said at the White House. “I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it.”
On Capitol Hill, leaders urged caution to avoid escalation, and some lawmakers insisted the White House must consult with Congress before taking any actions.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have advocated hardline policies against Iran, but Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said “the president certainly was listening” when congressional leaders at the meeting urged him to be cautious and not escalate the already tense situation.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said no specific options for a U.S. response were presented at the more than hour-long meeting. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “The administration is engaged in what I would call measured responses.” And late Thursday, House Republicans on the Foreign Affairs, intelligence and Armed Services committees issued a statement using the same word, saying, “There must be a measured response to these actions.”
The downing of the huge, unmanned aircraft , which Iran portrayed as a deliberate defense of its territory rather than a mistake, was a stark reminder of the risk of military conflict between U.S. and Iranian forces as the Trump administration combines a “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions with a buildup of American forces in the region.

New York Times reporter misidentifies Democratic segregationist senators as Republicans

Texto completo: A reporter for the New York Times incorrectly claimed, during a Thursday appearance on "CNN Newsroom," that the segregationist senators whom Joe Biden recently mentioned were Republicans.
Astead Herndon, who covers national politics for the Times, weighed in on the former vice president providing his work with former Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia as examples of bygone civility in the Senate.
"He has often praised what he called a bygone era of civility in the Senate and that sometimes comes with these uncomfortable figures, figures who are vocally open racist and segregationist," Herndon explained. "But Sen. Biden had working relationships with them in the Senate and we also know that as we look forward toward the campaign from now that he’s going to be forced to try to change some of that language."
"Our reporting yesterday was that some of his advisers, and even some of his supporters, were a little shocked with the way he was characterizing his relationships with those senators. And they’ve said, if you want to talk about bipartisanship, why not mention other Republicans — not the kind of the most controversial of them. And we know that the other Democrats are going to try to seize on this to create differences and stand out."

The gaffe comes a day after NBC's Capitol Hill correspondent Kasie Hunt made the same error. "Earlier today, I inaccurately said Sens. James Eastland & Herman Talmadge were Republicans. They were, of course, both Democrats. We regret the error. We’ll make sure to correct it on the show tomorrow, but wanted to correct the record here in the meantime," Hunt said.

'That will not stand': Democrats plan next steps after ex-Trump aide Hope Hicks didn't answer key questions in testimony

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Democratic lawmakers accused President Donald Trump's former aide Hope Hicks of rejecting questions about her time in the White House during a marathon hearing on Wednesday.
While Democrats aimed to unearth new aspects of Hicks' role in the White House, which spanned some of the most controversial moments of Trump's presidency, both sides of the aisle seemed to agree that very little, if anything, was learned from the all-day testimony. But despite the roadblock, Democrats vowed that their fight was only beginning, one that would likely go to court, so key officials may testify before lawmakers.
Hicks, Trump’s former White House communication director and campaign spokeswoman, is the first senior administration official mentioned in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to testify before Congress.
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks because of her proximity to Trump during several episodes that Mueller’s report described as attempts to thwart the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The incidents include Trump helping draft the explanation about a Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russians and his firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director James Comey.
Mueller’s report found no conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia, despite repeated foreign attempts to influence the election on Trump’s behalf. Mueller said he didn't have the option to charge Trump with obstruction of justice despite 10 episodes of potential illegalities listed in the report.
'I will never ever let you down': Trump launches reelection bid
Congressional Democrats on the committee said Hicks’ appearance amounted to her not complying with the subpoena. They claimed she did not answer questions about her time in the White House or the findings outlined in the Mueller report. Lawyers for the administration, who were at Hicks' side during her testimony, objected to question after question, claiming she was immune from answering anything related to her time in the White House, Democrats said.
But she did answer some questions about her time on the Trump campaign, and Democrats said every piece of information was helpful for their investigations into the president.
Hicks did not answer questions from reporters as she left the hearing after about eight hours testifying.
Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler said he was satisfied in "some ways" with Hicks' testimony but said the blanket objection to answering questions about her time in the White House would "not stand. "
"She answered some of our questions. We learned considerable information," said Nadler, D-N. Y. "The White House pleaded a non-existent, absolute immunity and that will not stand. "
Some Democrats said her testimony felt more like a roadblock that only pushed them further down the path toward impeachment proceedings.
“This is an obstruction of Congress’ ability to do our job and uphold our oath. It’s unacceptable. We have to begin an inquiry soon,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. “They’re not even allowing her to comment on what’s in a publicly available report, the Mueller report. It’s unbelievable. ”

The next step for Democrats, some committee members said, is going to court and forcing Hicks and others to fully comply with subpoenas and answer questions, though Nadler did not say that was the next step for the committee.
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. , tweeted some of the questions that attorneys objected to, including where Hicks' office was and what the weather was like on her first day of work. He said he's ready for a court battle.
“She is basically relying on the Department of Justice to assert objections every single time it’s related to anything during her tenure in the White House,” he said. “There is no such thing as absolute immunity. The White House is just making stuff up. ”
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , said Wednesday’s hearing amounted to another witness failing to comply.
“We have more lawlessness when it comes to witnesses refusing to testify. It’s frustrating,” said Swalwell, who is running for the Democratic nomination for the White House. “All this does is just take us back to the court and just waste the taxpayer’s dollars. ”
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said Hicks was only "one peg on the board" and the committee needs testimony from Mueller and Don McGahn, the former White House counsel who defied a subpoena from the committee to appear.
Central Park Five: Trump doesn't apologize to Central Park Five: 'You have people on both sides of that'
Trump complained in a tweet that Democrats put Hicks "through hell, for 3 years now, after total exoneration by Robert Mueller. "
Republicans on the committee agreed.
"It's unfortunate that Hope Hicks has been dragged down here and forced to go through this," said Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas. "I'm amazed that people would be willing to serve in any administration when they're harassed like this for just doing their jobs. "
Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, said the hearing was a waste of time, an effort by Democrats to just redo the work of Mueller and his team.
“There’s nothing new here,” said Collins, R-Ga. “Democrats continue to try to relitigate the Mueller investigation. ”
Other Republicans said there are other priorities that the committee should be investigating and holding hearings on. Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, questioned why House Democrats believed they would learn anything new that Mueller’s team didn’t already outline.
“I don’t know why we’re on a path to try and interview all of the witnesses that Bob Mueller has already interviewed,” he said, adding that the hearing was a futile effort.

Hicks left the White House in March 2018 and is chief communication officer and executive vice president at Fox, the parent company of Fox News and other networks.
Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said a transcript of her testimony will be made public within the next two days.
Nadler has dismissed claims of executive privilege or immunity for Trump administration witnesses by arguing that the president waived immunity by allowing top aides to speak with Mueller's team.
White House departures: Who's been fired and who resigned
Hicks' appearance stands in contrast to McGahn, who defied the committee’s subpoena. McGahn cited administration reservations that his testimony is protected by executive privilege, to ensure that presidents get candid advice from aides.
Attorney General William Barr, who redacted portions of the Mueller report dealing with grand jury testimony and evidence in pending cases, also defied a committee subpoena to provide Congress the full Mueller report and millions of pages of underlying evidence. The committee found him in contempt but negotiated a compromise to receive documents.
The full House authorized litigation to enforce the subpoenas against Barr and McGahn.
Hicks’ name appears more than 180 times in the Mueller report’s text and footnotes. She described meetings and dealing with the aftermath of incidents, including:
Trump helping draft a response to media questions about the meeting June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower, when Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner met with Russians offering damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. On June 28, 2017, at Kushner's lawyer's office, Hicks reviewed emails setting up the meeting. She said they looked “really bad” and that media coverage would be “massive” when the story broke, the report said. During a foreign trip, Trump helped draft a statement July 8, 2017, for his son to provide The New York Times that said the meeting was "primarily" about adoptions and didn’t mention disparaging information about Clinton.
Sessions recusing himself from the Russia inquiry because he worked on Trump’s campaign. Trump scolded Sessions in Hicks’ presence. Trump, who was "extremely upset" about Mueller's appointment in May 2017, told Sessions he should resign. “Hicks said she had only seen the president like that one other time, after the 'Access Hollywood' tape came out during the campaign,” the report said, referring to a televised recording of Trump saying he grabbed women’s genitals. Trump pocketed Sessions' resignation letter for a year and a half but fired him the day after the midterm election in November 2018.
Trump telling Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on May 10, 2017, in the Oval Office that he fired Comey. “He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump told the Russians, according to the report. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off. … I’m not under investigation. ” When Hicks told Trump about news stories about the meeting, Trump didn’t look concerned and said Comey “is crazy,” the report said.

Texto completo: ALBANY — NXIVM leader Keith Raniere, who surreptitiously led a secret master-slave group whose members were sexually exploited and branded with his initials on their pubic area, was convicted Wednesday of seven felonies in Brooklyn federal court.
A federal jury returned its verdict around 2 p.m. after less than five hours of deliberation.
The verdict followed a wild six-week trial where jurors heard explicit testimony about Raniere's graphic sexual exploits and how he manipulated the many followers of NXIVM, a purported self-help group based in the Albany area.
For more than two decades, Raniere, who grew up in Suffern, Rockland County, portrayed himself as an all-knowing guru who was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the smartest men in the world.
But prosecutors said Raniere, 58, was a fraud. They painted him as a conniving, jealous con man who methodically groomed his followers for sex and was nearly kicked out of college after struggling to keep up his grades.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for New York's Eastern District said Raniere was convicted of all charges, including forced labor conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, sex trafficking and racketeering charges, which included underlying acts of child pornography possession, identity theft and child sexual exploitation, among others.
"His crimes, and the crimes of his co-conspirators, ruined marriages, careers, fortunes and lives," U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a statement. "The evidence proved that Raniere was truly a modern day Svengali."
There was no immediate comment from Raniere's attorneys.
Critics long called NXIVM a cult Raniere founded NXIVM in the late 1990s after shutting down his previous business, Consumers Buyline Inc., which had been investigated by several state attorneys general as a pyramid scheme.
NXIVM, which was based in Colonie, Albany County, was billed as a self-help organization. People paid thousands of dollars to take classes based on Raniere's curriculum, but the group quickly and repeatedly faced accusations that it was a cult whose members were manipulated into lionizing Raniere.
The organization built up a series of influential followers, including Clare Bronfman, a wealthy heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune who bankrolled many of Raniere's efforts and lawsuits against detractors.
More recently, Raniere secretly founded DOS, a women's group whose members were known as "slaves" who had to follow orders from their "masters." Most members didn't know Raniere was the top "master."
"Slaves" had to give up damaging collateral — naked photographs, false confessions — in order to join the group, which was billed by leaders, including actress Allison Mack, as an empowerment organization but was used by Raniere to further his sexual interests.
Mack, 36, who was best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's "Smallville," pleaded guilty in April to two racketeering felonies. She is due for sentencing in September.
Also pleading guilty for their roles in the criminal enterprise were Bronfman, NXIVM co-founder Nancy Salzman and her daughter, Lauren Salzman, who was a high-ranking NXIVM official.
Jurors heard explicit testimony Throughout the lengthy trial, prosecutors detailed how Raniere possessed sexually explicit photographs of one his followers who was 15 years old at the time and how he kept a woman imprisoned in her own home for nearly two years for showing interest in another man.
Jurors heard from a one-time "slave" who was forced to strip naked and wear a blindfold while another woman was told to perform a sex act on her as Raniere watched. The sex act was videotaped.
"Slaves" were told their collateral could be released if they didn't perform the acts ordered by their "master."
Some of the "slaves" were also told to strip naked for an initiation ceremony, where they were branded on their pelvis with a hot cauterizing iron. The brand was a logo that contained the initials of Raniere and Allison Mack, who was a top-level "master."
Victims speak out After the verdict was announced, women who had been victimized by Raniere — some of whom had attended the trial in its entirety — spoke to the media outside the courthouse, thanking the jury for its decision.
Among them were Catherine Oxenberg, the former "Dynasty" star whose daughter, India, was a member of DOS, and Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman whom Raniere harassed with lengthy, expensive lawsuits and legal threats after their eight-year relationship ended in 1999.
Oxenberg and Natalie called themselves "bookends."
Natalie was one of the first people to speak out publicly against Raniere and accuse NXIVM of being a cult, while Oxenberg's decision to speak out in The New York Times in 2017 helped spur the federal investigation that ultimately brought him down.
"She started this, and I finished it," Oxenberg said.
Natalie, who was painted as NXIVM's foremost enemy by Raniere and his inner circle, said that after she and Raniere broke up, he told her she would be "dead or in jail" the next time he saw her.
"Well, I'm alive and he's in jail and it looks like for the rest of his life," Natalie told reporters. "The good guys won today."
Natalie, who attended the entire trial, spent years locked in litigation with Raniere and his followers, who challenged her bankruptcy, fought for years-old patents from an old business and forced her to spend thousands and thousands of dollars in legal fees.
On Wednesday, Natalie wore a black-and-white striped shirt to wait for the jury's verdict.
She called it her "jail shirt."
"I wore this so he knew what he would be looking at for the rest of his life," Natalie said.

Texto completo: Tyler Boyd's goal in the 51st minute of the United States' 4-0 win over Guyana in Tuesday's Concacaf Gold Cup opener was the 1,000th in U.S. men's national team history.
There are conflicting reports about who scored the first, but the National Soccer Hall of Fame credits Charles H. "Dick" Spalding with the honor, in the 22nd minute of a game against Sweden on Aug. 20, 1916 in Stockholm . Twelve years later, Spalding was patrolling right field at D.C.'s Griffith Stadium for the Washington Senators, toward the end of his brief second career as a major league baseball player.
Spalding, a fullback, was playing for Disston Athletic Association Football Club in Philadelphia when he was selected for the United States' all-star soccer team that traveled to Norway and Sweden in 1916.
Spalding went on to play in the original American Soccer League for Harrison AA and Fleischer Yarn. The New York Times reported that he entered organized baseball as a 29-year-old in 1927. Spalding hit .296 with 25 RBI in 115 games for his hometown Phillies that year.
The Washington Post described Spalding as one of the "newer stars of baseball" after his promising rookie campaign.
Spalding fractured his ankle while sliding into third base on a triple late in his rookie season. The injury became infected, and the Phillies released him during spring training the following year. Spalding asked Senators Manager Bucky Harris for a tryout in May 1928 and earned a spot on the roster as a reserve. He appeared in 16 games for Washington that season, going 8 for 23 (.348), primarily as a pinch hitter.
After being released by the Senators, Spalding played with Buffalo and Rochester of the International League before becoming a coach and scout.
The Times reported he died Feb. 3, 1950, at age 52 after a long illness. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame that same year.

Three reasons Trump-Russia hasn’t turned into Watergate

Texto completo: Why haven’t efforts to impeach President Trump gained Watergate-style momentum? The lack of energy has created a sense of bafflement and disappointment among some of the president’s most determined adversaries. But there are some simple reasons for it. Here are three: 1. The facts are different. In Watergate, the underlying crime was a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters, perpetrated by burglars paid by President Nixon’s re-election campaign. The scandal proceeded from there. In Trump-Russia, the underlying crime was the hacking of the DNC’s and John Podesta’s emails — a crime committed by Russians in Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who indicted a number of Russians and Russian entities for their actions, spent two years trying to find conspiracy or coordination between the Russians and the Trump campaign. He failed.
That single fact has shaped every other aspect of the Trump-Russia affair. In Watergate, the cover-up flowed from Nixon’s desire to conceal his campaign’s involvement in the break-in and other political dark acts. It formed the bulk of the obstruction of justice case against Nixon, which in turn served as the basis for articles of impeachment.
2. The press is different. Just as the facts of Trump-Russia are quite unlike Watergate, so the media environment of 2019 is quite unlike what existed in 1974. Back then, there were three 30-minute broadcast network newscasts: CBS, NBC and ABC. There were two big newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, and TV network executives sat down each day, within a few blocks of each other in Manhattan, to produce newscasts that basically illustrated the papers’ latest stories. There was no internet, no cable news, no podcasts, no social media and no talk radio. Nixon, even if he had had strong defenses, faced a solid wall of media opposition.
Today, the situation is much, much different — and infinitely better. There is far more diversity of opinion in the media writ large, and, importantly, popular access to primary sources. That troubles some media figures who miss the old days of news monopoly.
"During the Watergate era ... there were three networks," Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote recently. "Back then, what was said on those three networks ... was largely believed. Much more than now, there was a shared set of facts."
But it was a limited set of facts — just the ones selected by those network producers in Manhattan. Today’s media diversity, in terms of the Trump-Russia affair, means more facts see the light. And people inclined to support the president, or just be skeptical of the government’s investigative targeting of the Trump campaign, have a way to make their case beyond what anyone had 40-plus years ago.
3. Congress is different. Differences in the facts of the cases and differences in the media’s ability to report those facts have had a profound effect on lawmakers. They’re better informed, if they want to be, and can make a better defense of the president of their party. And having a significant number of constituents supporting the president makes representatives more likely to support him, too. (Unlike today, in 1974 opposition party Democrats controlled all of Congress, with 243 seats in the House and 56 in the Senate.) So this is a new world. It is perhaps not surprising to hear Democrats wish they could somehow turn today’s Trump-Russia affair into yesterday’s Watergate. If they could just hold televised hearings, they say, that could capture the nation’s attention and give Trump-Russia a Watergate-like urgency. Americans would turn against the president by the millions.
Others believe they just need time. It took Watergate years to grow big enough to oust Nixon, they say. But look at the numbers. The break-in was in June 1972, and Nixon resigned in August 1974 — a period of two years and two months. In Trump-Russia, the FBI began its investigation nearly three years ago, in July 2016. The Senate began investigating in January 2017. And Mueller took office in May 2017. It’s been a long time.
Trump-Russia could go longer still, and it would not change the basic facts of the case. It is simply a different case in a different world. Try as they might, the president’s opponents can’t make it 1974 again.

23-year-old black columnist says reparations would make young black people 'victims without their consent'

Texto completo: A 23-year-old black columnist argued during a Wednesday Senate hearing that reparations should only be paid to those who lived in slavery and not their descendants.
Coleman Hughes, a writer for Quillette, argued that distributing reparations to young black people would make them slavery "victims without their consent," an assertion that was met with an eruption of boos from those in attendance.
"I understand that reparations are about what people are owed, regardless of how well they're doing," Hughes said in his statement. "But the people who are owed for slavery are no longer here and we're not entitled to collect on their debts. Reparations, by definition, are only given to victims. So the moment you give me reparations, you've made me into a victim without my consent. Not just that: you've made one third of black Americans who poll against reparations into victims without their consent."
iFrame Object
A columnist on race with pieces appearing in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who is also studying philosophy at Columbia University, Hughes' testimony was met with dissenting cries from the gallery with multiple individuals seen shaking their heads behind him. Hughes was part of the second panel of witnesses in the committee's hearing on "H.R. 40 and the Path to Restorative Justice." H.R. 40 is named the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act and allocates resources to the development of different solutions to satisfy the desire of some to establish restitution for the United States' history of slavery and the lingering effects it had on the black community since its abolition, including Jim Crow laws that were ended in 1965.
Hughes was one of only two voices opposed to the idea of reparations on the panel and was joined by former National Football League player Burgess Owens, who won Super Bowl XV with the Oakland Raiders in 1980. The other six witnesses supported reparations in some form, including actor Danny Glover, the Rev. Eugene Taylor Sutton of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland, and economist Julianne Malveaux.
"If we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further. Making it harder to build the political coalitions required to solve the problems facing black people today," Hughes said. "We would insult many black Americans by putting a price on the suffering of their ancestors. We would turn the relationship between black Americans and white Americans from a coalition into a transaction. From a union between citizens into a lawsuit between plaintiffs and defendants.
"Black Americans have fought too long for the right to define themselves to be spoken for in such a condescending manner. The question is not what America owes me by virtue of my ancestry, the question is what all Americans owe each other by virtue of being citizens of the same nation. And the obligation of citizenship is not transactional. It's not contingent on ancestry. It never expires and it can't be paid off. For all these reasons, Bill H.R. 40 is a moral and political mistake."
H.R. 40 was introduced into the House of Representatives in January, but has had no other actions taken beyond Wednesday's hearing.

Texto completo: With 1,000 troops dispatched to the Middle East in response to tension with Iran, conservative war hawks in government are giddy with renewed hope of another war. The only thing standing between them and another war: President Trump.
His voters were derided for the excuse they often gave for endorsing him in the primaries. “He’s a successful businessman,” they often said. “That’s good for our country.” Unfortunately, since his election, that business intuition hasn’t made him popular with a lot of world leaders.
It has driven him to make friendly relationships with some unsavory characters, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He’s played dangerous games of hard-ball with Mexico, China, and the EU. Indeed, he can create less-than-ideal situations for our nation.
But here, on the eve of sending 1,000 troops into the Middle East, we face the prospect of another destructive war. What we need now is Trump’s gut reaction. We desperately need the negotiator, the sweet-talker, the deal-maker. We need Trump the businessman.
In the past 40 days, the U.S. has been subject to a variety of “attacks.” Since May 12, six tankers were attacked in the volatile Strait of Hormuz, a rocket crashed near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, a U.S. drone was shot down in Yemen, another was targeted in the Persian Gulf, and a missile fired by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia exploded at Saudi Arabia’s Abha International Airport.
The sole perpetrator of all these random acts is Iran — allegedly. At least that’s what Secretary Mike Pompeo argued Sunday morning. In fact, he claimed the most recent tanker attacks were “unmistakably” committed by the hand of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pompeo refuses to rule out the possibility of war as a means of retribution. “Everything,” he said, “is on the table.”
But there’s nothing “unmistakable” about any of this, and blaming Iran without firm confirmation of guilt is a recipe for disaster.
Indeed, we’ve been horribly wrong before. We were positive that communism would engulf the world if Vietnam fell. Lest we forget, we were certain that Iraq maintained a large arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. The list goes on. Even if the United States intelligence is actually right on this one, it doesn’t matter; none of these attacks warrant waging war.
Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have tremendous sway over U.S. foreign engagements. We all remember Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi and John Kerry’s carnage in Syria. But when it comes to Iran, we don’t want Trump listening to Pompeo and Bolton’s whispers of hawkish sweet nothings. As the New York Times noted on Saturday, what happens in Iran could very well depend on whether or not he does just that.
The reasoning behind a military clash is weak. In an appearance on "Face the Nation," Sen. Tom Cotton proclaimed that “unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike.” In similar fashion, during his own TV spot, Pompeo quickly shifted his from discussion of the targeted oil tanker to a polemic on preventing Iran from creating a nuclear arsenal. For Bolton’s part, he has never quite proven himself sympathetic to the idea of negotiations to de-escalate.
That’s why Americans of all political persuasions need, for this moment, to jump on the Trump train — to hope our chatty blowhard of a president is utterly himself.
As of now, the man who vowed to stop endless wars is our only hope to avoid starting a new one. Sure, President Trump is often ill-suited for the diplomacy his job demands and, given both nations’ propensities to pull out of deals, any agreement he would make with Iran would be shaky at best. But let’s face it: Whatever it looks like, another deal struck with Iran is the much lesser of two evils, and, at this point, the most we can hope for.

Men's abortion stories should be heard too

Texto completo: Norman Pearlstine, executive editor of the Los Angeles Times, has written an essay about his college girlfriend's abortion, which nearly killed her. Eventually they married, he writes, but they were never able to conceive because of the damage to her uterus.
The abortion was 57 years ago, pre-Roe v. Wade, and was performed by an osteopath working out of an office in south Philadelphia.
"I have mostly kept this story to myself, and even now, I find it difficult to write or talk about it," Pearlstine writes. "I believe many men, under similar circumstances, have shared my preference for silence while encouraging women to assert their reproductive rights."
That may be starting to change.
On Friday, the Chicago Sun-Times published a column by Mark Brown about an ex-girlfriend's abortion "a long time ago in a place that seems far away."
"That's a memory I normally keep pushed way back in the recesses of my mind," Brown writes. "It's something I try not to think about and never discuss."
Until now.
"Because it's weighing on my mind more than ever these days with abortion so much in the news, as some states move to criminalize it, while Illinois pushes back in the opposite direction -- both sides anticipating a potential Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade," Brown writes. "Also because I keep thinking that, for every woman who has an abortion, there was a man somewhere in the equation, his part an unexplored secret."
Two op-eds do not a groundswell make. But it struck me, reading them back-to-back, that they are the first male voices I've read sharing their abortion stories.
Women have been sharing theirs with increasing frequency in the past five years, as reproductive rights are debated on a state and national level, as Planned Parenthood funding comes under fire, as the #MeToo movement keeps power and sex and gender and stigma swimming among the cultural waters.
Writer Lindy West and her friend Amelia Bonow created a #ShoutYour Abortion Twitter campaign in 2015, which hundreds upon hundreds of women joined. The stories have been made into a book of essays and photos, titled "Shout Your Abortion."
U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, published an op-ed in Thursday's New York Times about an abortion she had 22 years ago.
Activist Gloria Steinem dedicated her 2015 memoir, "My Life on the Road," to the doctor who performed her abortion in 1957. In her 2018 memoir, "In Pieces," Sally Field writes about her abortion at age 17, which she traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, to obtain.
Even in fiction, abortion is frequently explored as a plot device, a turning point, an agonizing, life-altering decision. Usually through the lens of a woman.
I hope we hear from more men. We need their voices in the mix. I want to hear their fears and hopes and what-if's and sadness and gratitude and every other emotion that abortion triggers in humans, and not just humans with wombs.
"A recent Pew Research Center poll shows there isn't a significant difference between the number of women (60%) and men (57%) who think abortion should be legal," Pearlstine writes in his LA Times op-ed. "Still, most pro-choice men view the campaign for abortion rights as a 'women's issue,' even though we must, obviously, share responsibility for unwanted pregnancies.
"Bestsellers like 'Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women' have understandably given priority to women's voices," Pearlstine continues. "Pregnancy and childbearing create physical risks for women, not men. In doing so, they may have, inadvertently, reinforced the silence of men who respect women's autonomy, while so many of their patriarchal counterparts routinely speak out against abortion."
There's room for both male and female voices on this topic. There are male and female stories, too many to count, on this topic. We need to hear them, I believe, in order to fully understand this topic.
I hope we're at the beginning of a movement within a movement.

As Venezuela Falls Deeper Into Crisis, Economic Ties With Russia Fray

Texto completo: MOSCOW -- In his toughest moments, President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has turned to Russia for support.
When the United States sanctioned the Venezuelan energy industry in January, Russia's oil firm Rosneft helped to divert its oil exports to Asia. And when rumors of an armed American intervention reached fever pitch in March, two airplanes with Russian military technicians landed in Caracas -- a reminder Russia was on Venezuela's side.
Yet there is growing evidence that, beyond these high-profile gestures with limited effect on the ground, economic ties between Venezuela and Russia are fraying. Russian banks, grain exporters, even weapons manufacturers have all curtailed business with Venezuela, driven away by the very economic collapse they intended to help Russia's South American ally withstand.
"Russia's economic ties to Venezuela have really slowed down in the past few years," said Maximilian Hess, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in London. "The policies today are really low-cost, but they get a lot of geopolitical play."
Russia's public display of support came at a number of crucial moments since the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, proclaimed himself the country's interim president in January, challenging Mr. Maduro's grip on power and plunging the country deeper into political crisis. Russia's support allowed Mr. Maduro to claim the backing of a powerful ally and to maintain critical support in the military and the ruling party.
But in economic matters, Russian state-owned companies are cutting back on the business they do with the bankrupt nation to protect their bottom line, showing the limits of President Vladimir V. Putin's strategy of propping up an ally and antagonizing the Trump administration. The Russian government has not filled the breach, refusing to issue Venezuela new credit lines, to commit to new investments or even to provide relief on existing debt to ease Mr. Maduro's battle with the opposition.
The Kremlin's preference for symbolic displays of support instead of long-term investments in Venezuela is partly tied to Russia's own economic woes. Russia's five-year stagnation has led to the biggest outbreak of protests since 2013, to an exceptionally steep decline in Mr. Putin's trust ratings and to growing public aversion to costly foreign adventures, according to Russian polls.
Russia exported just $ 36 million worth of goods to Venezuela in the first four months of this year, less than half the amount it sent three years ago, according to Russian customs data.
Russian wheat sales to Venezuela, which Mr. Maduro touted as the replacement for American grain, plummeted 60 percent, to 187,000 tons, during Russia's agricultural export season ending in April, compared with the same period a year earlier, the customs data shows. These amounts cover only a tenth of Venezuela's annual wheat demand.
Moscow's largest banks have largely shunned Mr. Maduro's attempts to move Venezuelan government accounts to Russia to escape American sanctions, according to two people knowledgeable about the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The widespread use of the dollar in the Russian financial system means the risk of American sanctions greatly outweighs potential earnings from new Venezuelan business, they said.
None of the top 15 Russian banks had meaningful loans to Venezuelan entities as of April, according to their regulatory filings. State-controlled Gazprombank, which used to be one of the main European bankers for the Venezuelan national oil company, Pdvsa, in April erased nearly all of its Venezuelan credit portfolio after having quit a joint banking venture with Mr. Maduro's government, the filings show.
Even Russian weapons trade with Venezuela, the cornerstone of the countries' economic relations, has been hit by Mr. Maduro's financial woes.
Russia's industrial conglomerate Rostec, which accounts for the bulk of the country's defense exports, has reduced its exposure to Venezuela because of unpaid invoices, according to two people close to the company who discussed national security matters on condition of anonymity. The company has chosen not to renew some weapons maintenance contracts and freeze other projects, they said.
This includes the Kalashnikov machine gun factory in the central city of Maracay, which remains unfinished 12 years after the start of construction.
Arms sales can be a politicized business, but it is still business, and it has to make economic sense, said one of those familiar with Rostec.
A Rostec spokeswoman said the company's staff in Venezuela has remained unchanged in recent years and its technicians come and go according to its projects' needs.
The multibillion-dollar deals for Russian weapons signed by Mr. Maduro's charismatic predecessor, Hugo Chávez, are long gone. In the past two years, Russia exported $ 1 million worth of goods to Venezuela under the "secret" customs code that includes military and security equipment, according to Russian customs.
"We absolutely, officially have sold weapons to Venezuela," Mr. Putin told reporters last week. "We have not done it for quite a while now."
Though limited, Russia's economic help did allow Mr. Maduro to maintain some revenue flow amid tightening American sanctions. The Moscow-based bank Eurofinance Mosnarbank, which is jointly owned by the Russian and Venezuelan governments and is under United States sanctions, continues to process payments for Pdvsa, according to bank wire receipts seen by The New York Times.
The Russian government responded to American sanctions against the bank in March by taking control of the lender.
Despite these moves, Russia remains overtly supportive of Mr. Maduro's administration, and is part of his major remaining economic and political bulwark.
"Our relations with Venezuela are of strategic nature," Moscow's ambassador to Caracas, Vladimir Zaemsky, said after the arrival of two Russian military planes in Venezuela in March. "We're prepared, as always, to provide complete support to the lawful government of Venezuela and the Venezuelan people."
Rostec's inauguration of a helicopter training center in Venezuela in late March provided an important public relations boost to Mr. Maduro.
Rosneft, in particular, has helped Pdvsa to redirect some of its oil exports, targeted by American sanctions, to Asia. The Russian firm bought the oil in five of seven tankers that left Venezuela in the first half of May, according to Pdvsa data.
Rosneft, which has taken on the risky but lucrative role of Pdvsa's partner of last resort, has said its operations in Venezuela are strictly commercial and compliant with American sanctions. But even it has refrained from putting new money into Venezuela. The company's outstanding loans to Pdvsa have fallen by more than half in the past year to $ 1.8 billion, according to its financial statements.
And Rosneft's lifeline has not been enough to prevent the collapse of Venezuela's already struggling oil industry. The national oil output plummeted 35 percent since the American sanctions in January, one of the steepest declines of production in modern history, according to estimates by the Institute of International Finance.
"If I was a Venezuelan general debating my future, I wouldn't count on Russia coming to the rescue," said Mr. Hess.

Company behind Peet's and Panera atones for Nazi past

Texto completo: Should we eat food that exists because of circumstances we find morally reprehensible? I recently posed this question in a story after learning that Peet's — producer of Major Dickason's Blend, my daily brew — is owned by a company, JAB Holding, with Nazi ties. (Its portfolio also includes Stumptown, Intelligentsia, Panera, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Krispy Kreme, and more.) Previous honchos Albert Reimann Sr. and Albert Reimann Jr. had actively supported the Third Reich, and they built their fortune utilizing Nazi Germany's forced-labor system.
The UK-based Mail on Sunday broke the story in September 2018, when JAB was on the verge of acquiring sandwich chain Pret a Manger. But no one took much notice until March, when German tabloid Bild Am Sonntag reported on the company's past, coupled with an announcement that the Reimann family would donate about $11 million to charity as a result. Which charity? What was the timeline for the donation? The Reimanns are reportedly Germany's second-richest family, with a fortune estimated at about $37 billion last year. What is the price tag for atonement?
Some of these questions were answered last week, when a New York Times story announced that the money will be donated to “institutions that help former forced laborers and their families." The article also told the complicated story of the Reimanns' ancestry: Albert Jr. had an affair with a half-Jewish woman named Emilie Landecker and later adopted their three children, who today are partial owners of JAB. The Reimanns are renaming their family foundation after Alfred Landecker, Emilie's Jewish father, who was deported in 1942 and murdered by the Nazis, the New York Times reported. The Alfred Landecker Foundation will have an annual budget of about $28 million, used to “raise awareness of the Holocaust and support and promote projects in research and education, designed to uphold the memory of all the victims of the Nazis," according to the foundation's website.
I am not sure how much more one could ask of a company aiming to make up for its Nazi past, short of bowing out of business entirely. Many German companies have similar histories and have done much less, without the same transparency. (Companies including Bayer, BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens, and Volkswagen did contribute to the Foundation EVZ — the acronym for “Remembrance, Responsibility, and Future" in German — which paid restitution to former forced laborers from 2001 to 2007 and continues to work on related projects.) The Reimanns commissioned a report looking into the family's past in 2014, years before it became public, an indication of sincere motives beyond mere damage control. The New York Times story quotes Reimann Jr.'s grandson Martin, who is 30 years old: born the year the Berlin Wall fell and more than four decades after the end of the Nazi regime. Post-World War II generations of Germans have interrogated the actions of their forebears. Now far-right ideologies are on the rise again, in their country, and in ours, and beyond. We need as many Alfred Landecker Foundations as we can get.
So next time I run out of coffee, I won't mind buying from Peet's. But it is no longer my main brew, for reasons that have less to do with ethics than possibilities. After the initial story ran, so many of you wrote to tell me about your favorite coffee companies (or the ones you own) — Allegro, Birds & Beans, Dean's Beans, Equal Exchange, George Howell Coffee, Indigo Coffee, Karma Coffee, Mystic Coffee Roaster, Recreo, Redeye Coffee Roasters, Six Depot, Vermont Artisan Coffee & Tea Co., Virgin Hill Coffee Roasters, Wicked Joe, and many more. Some of them I've tried; others I'd never heard of. It will take me many mornings to work my way through them all.

Texto completo:  When actor-director Hannah Pearl Utt first read  Katherine Friedman Holland 's 2006 essay “Live Without Me. I'll Understand," she started to cry.
Holland recounts a near-death experience on a plane to Mexico with her husband of six months, and the trauma that lingered for weeks after Holland survived.
So Utt kept tissues at hand when she got up onstage in the Provincetown Town Hall on Friday evening to read the essay out loud in front of nearly 100 guests as part of “Modern Love Live," a joint production of WBUR and The New York Times.
It was a reflective pause in a sunny weekend of celebrity mingling, open bars, and film screenings at the 21st annual Provincetown International Film Festival, which opened June 12 and closed Sunday.
Host Meghna Chakrabarti moderated the hourlong event, which featured Utt, actor-turned-director Matt Kane , and John Cameron Mitchell performing live readings of reader-submitted essays from the Times's popular column Modern Love. Audience members sitting on wooden seats laughed, and some dabbed away tears.
Friday marked the second time “Modern Love Live" partnered with the Provincetown festival to bring the live podcast to the Cape. Last year, actor Chloë Grace Moretz performed.
Kane read Brian Gittis 's 2014 essay “At the Hospital, an Interlude of Clarity," the comical, poignant tale of a first date that ends in an overnight emergency room visit.
Mitchell (“Hedwig and the Angry Inch," “Shortbus") read Ephi Stempler 's 2016 essay “Platonic, Until Death Do Us Part," about a gay man and his live-in, straight best female friend — a PLP, or “platonic life partner."
Sound designer Matt Reed mixed the actors' voices with sounds that evoked the narratives, like the tinkle of a wine glass on a first date, or the mechanical creaks of a plane in a deep dive to the ground.
Two Provincetown natives, guitarist Peter Ciluzzi and singer and tenor recorder player Roxanne Layton , provided live music between readings to set the mood, including a soulful cover of George Gershwin's “Summertime."
At a garden party the next day, Utt said that her essay selection spoke to her. “The proximity of death is something [the essay] captures really well," Utt said. “And I felt like it was kind of a beautiful metaphor for depression — living in that in between place, where you're like, 'I'm not dead, but I'm not alive.' "
Utt also attended the festival this year with her directorial debut film, “Before You Know It," starring herself, Jen Tullock , and Judith Light . The film closed the festival on Sunday night.
Kane's first feature film, “Auggie" (2018), made its New England premiere at the festival. The movie tells the fictional story of a lonely retiree who discovers companionship in Auggie, a virtual-reality character similar to Siri.
Mitchell was awarded the 2019 Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the festival on Saturday.

San Francisco tries 'blind charging' to reform criminal justice

Texto completo: While riding the train in San Francisco three years ago, a white man told an African-American man that he smelled bad and should move away from him. An argument followed, and the African-American man, Michael Smith, was eventually tackled by police officers and accused of assaulting them.
The San Francisco District Attorney's Office charged Smith with seven counts, including battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. But after viewing body camera footage, a jury acquitted Smith, then 23, on most of the charges, and the prosecutors dropped the other counts. Smith's lawyer said he does not believe a white person would have been arrested or prosecuted.
While the district attorney's office disagreed with that assessment of the case, George Gascon, the district attorney, has acknowledged that a disproportionate number of African Americans are prosecuted in the city, which led him to ask a troubling question: To what extent does bias affect the work of prosecutors?
As a result, the office has begun experimenting with an approach it describes as "blind charging," which prevents prosecutors in one of the nation's busiest district attorney's offices from seeing demographic information before making an initial decision on whether to charge someone.
Criminal justice experts said San Francisco appeared to be the first such office in the nation to test that approach.
"The question we want to ask ourselves is, 'Would you charge based just on the behavior, without the race and other demographic information?'" Gascon said. "We wanted to see what might be causing a disparate application of the law."
In recent weeks, the office has begun by removing details - like race and names - from police reports before turning those cases over to prosecutors to decide whether to press charges. Starting in July, the office intends to employ computer software designed by Stanford University researchers to redact a suspect's race and name, and that of victims. Also removed will be locations where crimes were said to have been committed.
The only information prosecutors will initially have access to is an officer's incident report, which generally includes the reason someone was stopped before an arrest, evidence that a crime was committed, witness statements and anything a suspect might say.
Only after assistant district attorneys make a preliminary decision about charges would they be permitted to access other information, including race and other demographic details, body camera footage and photos. In each case, regardless of the initial charging determination, all of the evidence will ultimately be reviewed, prosecutors said. If a prosecutor comes to a different conclusion between the first and second steps, that will be recorded and compared to historical data. Prosecutors will also be required to explain what changed their minds, and those patterns will be studied, the office said.
The experiment in blind charging comes as prosecutors' offices across the nation have been instituting policy changes to grapple with what has been found to be extensive racial bias in the criminal justice system, which has led to disproportionate levels of incarceration among African Americans.
District attorneys in Brooklyn, Dallas County and elsewhere no longer prosecute low-level marijuana cases. Prosecutors in Philadelphia now handle shoplifting as a minor offense rather than a serious crime if the amount stolen is less than $500. And other district attorneys around the nation have stopped demanding bail for people facing misdemeanor charges.
Legal analysts said the San Francisco policy appears to go a step further by directly confronting ingrained racial bias that leads some prosecutors, for example, to file charges against African Americans for low-level drug offenses more frequently than against whites, even though studies show that white people use illicit drugs at higher rates.
"It strikes me as an interesting and intriguing thing to do because I don't get a sense that there's a lot of systemic change being attempted in this way," said John Pfaff, a Fordham University law professor and author of "Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform."
Pfaff said the potential for bias might be greater among prosecutors than police officers because prosecutors are more likely to be white than police officers, and are generally from higher than average socio-economic backgrounds-
So far, blind charging has not been opposed by prosecutors' organizations, police unions or crime victims' rights groups.
Although there have been few detailed academic studies about bias among prosecutors, a 2017 report by Carlos Berdejo at the University of Loyola Law School found that white defendants in Wisconsin were 25% more likely than their Black counterparts to have criminal charges dropped or reduced to less serious crimes.
Studies have repeatedly shown that San Francisco arrests and prosecutes African Americans at disproportionately high levels. And a 2016 Justice Department report found significant evidence of racial bias in the way the city's police department enforces the law.
Although African Americans make up only about 6% of San Francisco's population, they accounted for 41% of those arrested, 43% of those booked into jail, and 38% of cases filed by prosecutors between 2008 and 2014, according to the city.
Gascon, whose term expires early next year and who is not running for reelection, has frequently proposed ideas that run counter to notions about the work of district attorneys. He supported Proposition 47, an initiative that reduced punishment for some drug and property crimes; ordered his office to automatically wipe away old marijuana convictions; and supported legislation to seal people's criminal records for misdemeanors and low-level felonies once they complete prison or jail sentences.
Gascon said an examination of cases handled by his office had showed no indication that his prosecutors make decisions motivated by implicit bias, but he said that the lopsided number of African Americans in the city's criminal justice system compelled him to look deeper.
"We've found no bias, but we still have concerns," he said.
For instance, a 2017 study commissioned by the district attorney's office and performed by two independent criminologists determined that African-American suspects in San Francisco are less likely to have their cases dropped or dismissed than white suspects, and receive longer prison and jail sentences than others. The study concluded, however, that those results were likely not the result of bias, but of other factors, including that African-American defendants were more likely to have previous arrests, convictions and open cases.
In the 2016 case which led to the arrest and prosecution of Smith, the train passenger who told Smith that he smelled bad called 911 after Smith responded angrily, said Glenn Katon, Smith's lawyer.
The man told the emergency operator that Smith had tried to rob him and might be armed, although Smith did not have a gun, accordingto court records.
Once the transit police arrived, a mobile phone video appeared to show Smith, who was with his pregnant girlfriend, being punched in the head by a police officer while he was handcuffed. The police say Smith spit at them.
After Smith was acquitted on most counts and the others were dropped, he sued the transit system and the officers and won a $40,000 settlement, Katon said.
Gascon's office declined to comment on the case, but Max Szabo, a spokesman, said that "removing implicit bias and the implications of race" would help "enhance fairness in a system long plagued by inequities."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A war crimes trial involving a Navy SEAL who is charged with killing a teenage Islamic State prisoner began Monday, according to several media outlets.
Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher is accused of using a knife to kill a teenage Islamic State prisoner in Iraq. He is also accused of killing unarmed Iraqi civilians, which included a school-aged girl, according to the New York Times.
Gallagher has pleaded not guilty and denies all the charges, the Times also reported.
Jury selection for the trial began Monday, and is expected to take one to two days, according to Reuters. The jury will include between five and 15 active-duty Navy servicemembers -- half of whom are officers and half of whom are enlisted -- who will hear the case and render a verdict, Reuters also reported.
The lead prosecutor, Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, has been removed by the court-martial for tracking the defense team’s emails. Gallagher's case also recently received national media attention after suggestions by President Donald Trump that he may pardon the Navy SEAL, according to the Associated Press.
Last month, several outlets reported that Trump was considering a pardon for Gallagher. The president in March also moved Gallagher to "less restrictive confinement" due to the "honor of his past service to our country. "
A SEAL medic said he had stabilized the teenage prisoner when Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in the neck and body, according to prosecutors. He went on to pose with the prisoner's body and included it as a prop in his re-enlistment ceremony. He bragged that he "got this one with my knife. "
More: Trump may pardon troops in war crime cases, including SEAL Edward Gallagher, reports say
In addition, investigators said Gallagher fired randomly at crowds of civilians. He was accused of shooting an elderly man carting a water jug in Mosul in June 2017, as well as a girl walking along a riverbank in the same area just a month later.
Gallagher has been charged with premeditated murder in the killing of the teenage prisoner and attempted murder in the shootings of the two civilians. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He contends that his accusers, members of his platoon, "disgruntled subordinates who could not meet his high standards," the New York Times reported.
The Times also reported that a Facebook page regularly updated by Gallagher's family recently posted a message that said in part: " 'Over the course of the trial we will expose the false narrative spread by these accusers for what it is … a smear campaign full of lies. ' "
At hearings last month, it was revealed that the prosecution sought to track emails from Gallagher's defense team in an effort to find a leak to the media. Czaplak and agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service sent emails embedded with hidden tracking software to Gallagher's lawyers and a journalist for the Navy Times, according to the New York Times.
The trial, which is taking place at U. S. Naval Base San Diego, is expected to last three weeks, Reuters reported.

Fox News is reporting bad numbers for Trump -- so they must be fake!

Texto completo: Like most supporters of President Donald Trump, I have the good sense to know when I'm being flimflammed by liberal media nincompoops.
I expect such flimflammery from the likes of Fake News CNN and Even Faker News MSNBC, but now I see it coming from my beloved news network of choice: Fox News.
That's right.
The network I believed I could trust to always tell me President Trump is beloved by all Americans and has never made even a minor mistake has suddenly pumped out outrageous misinformation that it refers to as "a poll."
This so-called poll, released Sunday, alleges that the greatest U.S. president in history -- Donald J. Trump, long may he reign -- is looked on negatively by 53% of Americans and is polling neck-and-neck with some smartypants DEMONcrat mayor from South Bend, Indiana.
Yeah, right.
Nobody I interact with on pro-Trump Facebook pages or talk to during weekly meetings of my gun club's Hillary for Prison Committee ever has a negative thing to say about the president. How dumb does Fox News think I were?
Here, if you can believe it, is more obviously made-up information from this FAKE POLL Fox News put out:
* 50% of "Americans" think the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election, up from 44% in March.
* 50% of people polled think Trump should either be impeached and removed from office or impeached but not removed.
* 54% of apparent knuckleheads think the Trump administration should be more cooperative with ongoing congressional investigations, and only 11% think the administration should be less cooperative.
* If the election were held today, 49% of people would vote for Joe Biden and 39% would vote for Trump.
* If the choice were Bernie Sanders, 49% would vote for him and 40% would vote for Trump.
* Elizabeth Warren would beat Trump 43% to 41%.
* Kamala Harris would beat Trump 42% to 41%.
* South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would beat Trump 41% to 40%.
* If Trump were reelected, 50% of respondents said they would be either "displeased" or "scared."
THESE ARE OUTRAGEOUS LIES!!
You expect phony poll results from the Amazon Washington Post or the Failing New York Times. But coming from Fox News? It's just unacceptable. Even if the poll is accurate -- and I know it's not because I don't want it to be -- Fox News should know better than to report such a thing.
I know some of you are saying, "Rex, the president is a great and honest man who has done more in the first two years of his presidency than any other president in history and, possibly, more than any other world leader in history, but how can you be so certain these poll results are made-up and that we should give Fox News the nickname Lyin' Fox News?"
To which I say, "It's simple." I just apply the same accuracy test President Trump has used since he took office and throughout his amazingly successful business career:
Does the information make Trump look bad in any way, shape or form? If the answer is yes, the information is made up and the people behind that information are dishonest dopes jealous of Trump's incredible abilities and good looks.
I know Trump is infallible because all information to the contrary is deeply flawed, the work of shrill liberals who want to destroy America. Duh.
Just look at how the president handled recent reports about leaked internal polling data from his reelection campaign that showed him running well behind Biden in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida and barely ahead of Biden in Texas.
In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Trump sensibly denied the existence of those garbage numbers.
"Nobody showed you those polls because those polls don't exist, George. Those polls don't exist," Trump said.
And that was completely true, until Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale confirmed to ABC News that the leaked poll numbers were real. That was a smart move, as I'm sure Trump told Parscale to contradict him and the president is always one step ahead of everyone.
Parscale said those bad polling numbers are old and don't count, so that technically means they don't exist, which we already knew because Trump said they don't exist. And besides, we know anything that makes Trump look bad is fake.
This stuff isn't complicated, folks.
The Trump campaign responded to these nonexistent, don't-count, old, imaginary leaked polls over the weekend by cutting ties with three members of its polling team. That was also a smart move. And now the president and his supporters MUST take the same approach with Fox News, as the network is equally guilty of reporting polling data that makes the president look bad.
Fox News has apparently decided to join the rest of the mainstream media and engage in PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT by publishing nonfawning information about Trump, and that kind of dishonesty cannot go unpunished.
As we await the glorious kickoff of Trump's 2020 reelection campaign Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, I call on all devoted MAGA supporters to join me in calling for Fox News to be SHUT DOWN.
It's clear the network can't be trusted, and I hope President Trump will order his attorneys at the Department of Justice to investigate and possibly prosecute everyone who works there except for Sean Hannity.
Until further notice, I encourage all patriots to get their news only from my Hillary for Prison Committee's weekly newsletter.
Thank you, and may God bless President Trump, whose favorability rating is currently 199% and who, if the election were today, would beat Sleepy Joe Biden eleventy-billion to zero.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is coming to New York in search of cash - and he's not alone.
With the clock ticking down to a key fundraising deadline, Biden is leading a parade of Democratic presidential wannabes on the prowl for Wall St. donors.
The ex-vice president and 2020 front-runner was set to be introduced by Gov. Cuomo at a Monday fund-raiser at the Manhattan home of hedge fund titan James Chanos, a source said.
California Sen. Kamala Harris will be in to town for a similar event Tuesday night at the home of money man Marc Lasry, who is co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team.
Wall St. lawyer Brad Karp, meanwhile, is hedging his bets by hosting meet-and-greets in Manhattan for Biden (photo) and Harris Tuesday, according to The New York Times.
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in town last week wowing donors at the home of billionaire Hamilton James.
The three Democrats are sprinting to the end of the cash race for the second quarter of 2019, which ends June 30.
For Biden, it's important to show an impressive money haul to cement his place as the early leader in the race. It will also be the ex-veep's first fund-raising disclosure since jumping into the race April 25.
Harris wants to show that she is right at the top of the list to take on President Trump despite less-than-impressive poll numbers.
Buttigieg is riding a wave of popularity with voters and donors. A big Q2 performance could set him up to be seen as a keeper at the top of the race.
Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - and the locals of the 2020 race, Mayor de Blasio and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand - have sworn off big donations in favor of courting small donors.

Texto completo: Whatever happened to pride?
I ask because reports regularly surface about Donald Trump berating or insulting someone, often an aide, who just takes it. A recent example comes from Michael Wolff's new book "Siege," in which Paul Manafort, once Trump's campaign chairman but now domiciled in stir, was vulgarly upbraided by the president: "You're terrible, you can't defend me!" Trump allegedly told him in a train wreck of a verbal assault.
Trump also berated Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, but he, as it happens, shouted back. Not so Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, who was soaked by a drizzle of demeaning tweets in addition to an Oval Office tirade he later characterized as the most humiliating experience of his public life. He offered to resign, but he stayed on anyway and never asked the president to step outside.
Bob Woodward recounts similar episodes in his own book, appropriately and ominously titled "Fear: Trump in the White House." The list of administration aides that Trump belittles is long and, with some omissions, distinguished. It includes Gary Cohn, once of Goldman Sachs; Gen. H.R. McMaster, once of the U.S. Army; Rex Tillerson, once of Exxon Mobil; Gen. John F. Kelly, once of the Marine Corps; and, of course, the incessantly insulted Reince Priebus.
What's largely missing from these accounts are reports of pushback - of people telling Trump that he can, in the hallowed words of David Allan Coe's classic song, "take this job and shove it." With the possible exception of "e pluribus unum," it is the most American of phrases, evoking an exemplary "don't tread on me" ethos. This is who we are. At any rate, this is who we used to be.
Now, though, an icky toadyism has been normalized. The White House staff have the spines of nightcrawlers, oozing their way from meeting to meeting, trying to circumvent some idiotic presidential order or simply concealing matters from him. This is what's happening now with attempts to plant malware in Russia's energy grid, in response to Russia's intrusion into America's energy grid. The New York Times recently reported that some aspects of this clandestine program were withheld from Trump lest he object. But the secret probably remains safe from Trump since the story ran on Sunday - golf day.
The normalization of the abnormal is now, yes, normal. This should not be surprising. Francoise Gilot, one of Picasso's longtime lovers, recounted in her memoir how she and Picasso first struck up a romance at a Parisian restaurant in 1943. The war was on, the Gestapo and the compliant French police were making arrests, Jews were being rounded up for transport to Auschwitz - and yet life went on as before.
Such is human nature, and I hesitate in cushy 21st-century America to make judgments about how Picasso managed to paint through the slaughter. But that was then and now is now, and I can't help but have maximum scorn for those people who have inhaled the dope of Washington power and confuse it with some sort of noble calling.
Outgoing press secretary Sarah Sanders leaves the White House having served Trump but not the truth. She succeeded the precedent-setting Sean Spicer who, at the birth of the new administration and in the deadpan manner of a North Korean tour guide, insisted Trump's inaugural crowd was the "largest" ever.
In Wolff's new book, an anonymous White House source says of the president, "I have never met anyone crazier than Donald Trump." So, it is understandable that a White House aide would simply avoid a confrontation with the president. Their pride has been taken from them. The morning's mirror is their first lie of the day. It cannot show how hollow they are.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The only certainty the family of Everett Palmer Jr. has -- after months of demanding answers -- is that he was alive when he was sent to York County Prison and that he was dead 48 hours later.
But what happened to Mr. Palmer during two days in solitary confinement at the Pennsylvania lockup remains a mystery.
When his body arrived at a funeral home, it showed troubling signs: Mr. Palmer's head had been badly damaged and a ring of black and purple bruises ran around his neck, according to the funeral director, who was the first to see the remains.
"I think he was murdered," Mr. Palmer's mother, Rose Palmer, said as she choked back tears last week at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Queens Village, near the family's home.
The Pennsylvania State Police and the York County district attorney will say only that the death, first reported by The York Daily Record, is still under investigation.
After 14 months, Mr. Palmer's family has not been given permission to see video footage of his detention. The York County Coroner's Office concluded in an autopsy report, obtained by The New York Times, that the manner of Mr. Palmer's death was "undetermined."
Adding to the Palmer family's grief and confusion, the former soldier's brain, heart and throat -- perhaps holding clues that could shed light on how he died -- still have not been returned after the autopsy.
On Monday, his mother and six siblings filed a motion in a Pennsylvania court seeking to compel testimony from the guards and others involved, as well as to gain access to evidence, including a video of Mr. Palmer's final moments.
"There has been no explanation of what happened to Everett Palmer," said Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing the family. "We believe that an in-custody death demands a certain level of transparency that has been lacking."
Mr. Palmer's case received nationwide attention recently over the family's claims that his organs had gone missing. (They had not; they are being retained in a lab for investigation, the York County Coroner's Office said.)
But how he died in custody and why the authorities seem reluctant to release their findings remain the bigger mystery.
Though the York County Coroner's Office has said it could not say for sure how Mr. Palmer died, an independent forensic expert hired by Mr. Palmer's family offered a different verdict: homicide, involving physical restraint under police custody.
One contributing factor in his death was methamphetamine intoxication, pathologists for the family and the coroner's office agree, raising questions about how he obtained drugs while confined alone and stripped of his belongings.
The official autopsy report's inconclusive findings help "law enforcement avoid the appropriate scrutiny of their actions," Mr. Merritt said.
David Sunday, the York County district attorney, said he could not provide information about "ongoing investigations." Ryan Tarkowski, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, also declined to comment, saying the investigation is open.
Mark Walters, a spokesman for York County, said that evidence in the case has not been made public because investigators have not completed their work.
"I don't understand why people don't take a step back," he said in an interview. "This is the way investigations work. You want to make sure that everything is right, and done with integrity. Do you want to have an investigation that lasts five minutes? It's going to take time."
Pamela Gay, who leads the York County Coroner's Office, said that Mr. Palmer's organs would be released to the family once the inquiry is over.
"Things aren't evident right away," she said. "We've done everything by the book. We want to do this with the utmost integrity and professionalism."
Mr. Palmer, a 41-year-old father of two, was a brawny paratrooper turned fitness trainer who most recently lived in Seaford, Del. He had been taking medication for post-traumatic stress disorder, his relatives said.
Mr. Palmer's family said he was on his way to New York on April 7, 2018, to see his mother, who was about to have an operation. He had been hoping to stop in Lancaster, Pa., to resolve an outstanding warrant. A year and a half earlier, he been arrested in rural York County on charges of drunken driving.
But instead of resolving the case and continuing with his trip, he was arrested by the Lancaster police and detained on $ 5,000 bail, the family said.
When Mr. Palmer arrived at the York County jail, he was agitated and "rambling," and talked about having suicidal thoughts, the autopsy report said. He was placed on suicide watch in a single-person cell and medical staff checked on him multiple times.
Two days later, at around 4 a.m., Mr. Palmer was seen striking his head on his cell room door, the autopsy report said, cutting and puncturing the back of his head and leaving bloody traces on the door, the report said.
An officer ordered him to lie down and put his arms behind his back, the report said. When Mr. Palmer failed to comply, an officer used a Taser on him -- twice. Five officers then entered his cell, and a 23-minute scuffle ensued. Mr. Palmer kicked and bit the officers who tried to pin him down.
"The officers secured the decedent by various physical control techniques including securing his midsection and lower extremities, securing his hand by applying handcuffs to his wrists," the report read.
A hood intended to stop him from biting was placed over his head. "The officers lifted him out of the cell and into the restraint chair and applied the lap belt, leg restraints and hand restraints," the report said.
The report confirmed the existence of security camera video of the incident. But the coroner wrote that the "video footage of events inside the decedent's cell did not give a clear picture" of everything the officers did to restrain Mr. Palmer.
Mr. Palmer was taken first to the jail infirmary, then to York Hospital, where he was pronounced dead before 6 a.m. on April 9, the report said.
The coroner's office concluded that Mr. Palmer died of "complications following an excited state, associated with methamphetamine toxicity, during physical restraint."
The doctor who performed the autopsy, Ramon Starling-Roney, noted in the report that Mr. Palmer had "multiple bruises along the head, extremities, left hip and left side of the torso" and said that sickle cell disease was a contributing factor to his death. (Mr. Palmer's family maintains he did not have that illness.)
Zhongxue Hua, the forensic pathologist hired by the family, came to a similar conclusion about the cause of death, but said Mr. Palmer would not have died had he not been violently restrained.
"It should be changed to 'homicide', instead of 'undetermined,"' he said in an interview. "I agree with the cause of death, but I have a real issue with the manner of death."
Ephraim George, a funeral director in New York City, was the first person to look at Mr. Palmer's body after the an autopsy. "You could definitely see the bruising around the neck," Mr. George said. "It went around his neck, on both sides. I told the family, 'You need to look further into it."'
Mrs. Palmer, the mother, said she had not slept well for over a year.
"All I do is think about my child. What happened, how it happened," she said. "And because I don't know, I have all kinds of scenarios going around in my brain."
She added, "It's torture."

India slaps back at U.S. with tariffs on 28 products, days before G-20 event

Texto completo: India lobbed a small but strategic strike in President Trump's trade war, imposing retaliatory tariffs on 28 products and layering in another economic stressor just days before leaders from both nations meet at the Group of 20 summit.
The penalties run as high as 70 percent, affecting agricultural goods such as apples and almonds, as well as chemical and finished metal products. India said the move was "in the public interest" following Trump's decision to revoke India's preferential trade privileges.
India was the biggest beneficiary last year of the Generalized System of Preferences, a program designed to help developing countries sell to U.S. consumers. But Trump ended India's favorable trade treatment June 5, motivated by the United States' hefty trade deficit - an estimated $21.3 billion, according to federal data - with New Delhi. India imported a little more than $33 billion in U.S. goods in 2018 and sold $54.4 billion to the United States.
Although India's action affects an estimated $241 million in imports - a pittance compared with the numbers involved in the White House's trade battles with China and Mexico - it's another pressure point in an increasingly tense and uncertain global economic outlook. The tariffs took hold Sunday, just ahead of next week's G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, where economists and business leaders are anticipating a meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping about the trade war.
"This is a big deal," tweeted Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank. "Not as much because of the value of the goods soon to be taxed . . . but more so because until now, Delhi's reaction to Washington's moves had been strikingly restrained."
What began as a tool to cut down on U.S. trade deficits has quickly morphed into a defining feature of trans-Pacific trade. Tariffs have become Trump's preferred means of exerting political pressure on other nations, even in matters not directly related to trade, such as his threat last month to impose tariffs on Mexico over migration. Although Trump repeatedly - and inaccurately - has said that other countries bear the burden of the tariffs, trade and business experts say the reality is that U.S. businesses pay the levies first and are usually forced to pass the costs on to consumers.
In a letter to the Trump administration last week, 661 companies warned that further tariffs on China would devastate the economy, predicting the loss of 2 million U.S. jobs and $2,000 a year in added costs for the average American family.
"We know firsthand that the additional tariffs will have a significant, negative and long-term impact on American businesses, farmers, families and the U.S. economy," the companies said. "Broadly applied tariffs are not an effective tool to change China's unfair trade practices. Tariffs are taxes paid directly by U.S. companies . . . not China."
The potential fallout from the U.S.-China conflict extends well beyond their respective borders, economists say. In a G-20 briefing note, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that the last round of proposed tariffs against China could erase $455 billion in global gross domestic product in 2020.
"There is strong evidence that the United States, China and the world economy are the losers from the current trade tensions," Lagarde wrote.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insists the trade war isn't dampening global growth or the domestic economy. "I don't think in any way that the slowdowns you're seeing in parts of the world are a result of trade tensions at the moment," he told reporters, according to the New York Times.
The Indian government had been mulling higher penalties on U.S. exports since last summer, after it was hit by Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel, but it reportedly held back, leaving room for de-escalation through trade talks. Discussions are expected to continue when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visits India this month.
"We remain open to dialogue, and we hope that our friends in India will drop their trade barriers and trust in the competitiveness" of their own companies, Pompeo said at a U.S.-India Business Council meeting last week, Reuters reported.

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday floated the possibility of staying in office longer than two terms, suggesting in a morning tweet that his supporters might "demand that I stay longer."
The president has previously joked about serving more than two terms as president, including at an event in April where he told a crowd that he might remain in the Oval Office "at least for 10 or 14 years."
The 22nd Amendment of the Constitution limits the presidency to two terms.
In tweets Sunday morning, Trump also voiced dissatisfaction with recent news coverage of his administration, calling both The Washington Post and The New York Times "the Enemy of the People."
He added: "The good news is that at the end of 6 years, after America has been made GREAT again and I leave the beautiful White House (do you think the people would demand that I stay longer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT), both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business & be forever gone!"
Last year, Trump also joked about doing away with term limits in a speech to Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago estate in which he praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for doing so in China.
"He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great," Trump said, according to CNN. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."
Washington Post
Trump campaign to purge pollsters after leak of results
President Trump's campaign has decided to purge some of its pollsters after a leak of dismal internal polls for the president that he denied existed.
Just two days before the president is set to kick off his bid for reelection, a top adviser said on Sunday that the campaign was cutting ties with three of its five pollsters to prevent further disclosure of survey data.
The polling showed Trump behind former vice president Joe Biden in several key battleground states, including by double digits in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The results were confirmed to The New York Times by advisers to Trump, but when they became public, he called them “fake polls."
For days, aides to Trump have tried to figure out whom to point the finger at over the leak of the data, which jolted and infuriated the president.
The resulting furor led to an effort by the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, to tighten control. The rupture of the team came even as the president and his advisers were preparing for a rally in Orlando Tuesday to formally open his campaign for a second term.

The Trump name is now the namesake of a tiny Israeli settlement in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet convened in this hamlet Sunday to inaugurate a new settlement named after President Trump in a gesture of appreciation for his recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the territory.
The settlement isn't exactly new. Currently known as Bruchim, it is more than 30 years old and has a population of 10 people.
Israel is hoping the rebranded "Ramat Trump," Hebrew for "Trump Heights," will encourage a wave of residents to vastly expand it.
"It's absolutely beautiful," said US Ambassador David Friedman, who attended Sunday's ceremony. Noting that Trump celebrated his birthday on Friday, he said: "I can't think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present."
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in 1981. Most of the international community considers the move illegal under international law.

Trump preparing to pitch a health care plan
As President Trump prepares to kick off his bid for a second term this week, he is anxiously searching for a way to counter Democrats on health care, one of their central issues, even though many of his wary Republican allies would prefer he let it go for now.
Trump is vowing to issue the plan within a month or two. If he follows through, it could help shape a presidential race that Democrats would like to focus largely on health care.
Trump is gambling that his plan will negate some of the advantage Democrats have on the issue. But nervous Republicans worry that putting out a concrete plan with no chance of passage would only give the Democrats a target to pick apart over the next year.
“Obamacare has been a disaster," Trump told ABC News in an interview aired Sunday evening. His own plan, he said, would lower costs. “We're going to have a plan. That's subject to winning the House, Senate, and presidency, which hopefully we'll win all three. We'll have phenomenal health care."
Democratic leaders have argued that they won control of the House in last year's midterm elections in large part on the health care issue. Over the weekend, 140 House Democrats held events or online town halls to talk about health care, their largest coordinated action in districts since winning the majority.

Former Maine governor has a new job — tending bar
Former Republican governor Paul LePage's wife won't be the only one in their family spending the summer working at a restaurant. LePage will be joining her as a bartender.
McSeagulls Restaurant owner Jeff Stoddard said he hasn't finalized the former governor's schedule but expects him to be tending bar for the entire summer in Boothbay Harbor. The governor's wife, Ann, will be working there again as a server.
The restaurant posted photos on social media showing the former governor and first lady wearing McSeagulls T-shirts that proclaimed, "Eat, Drink & Flounder, Just for the Halibut."
The LePages spent the winter at their home in Florida. It's unclear where they're staying this summer. They sold their Boothbay home last summer.

Texto completo: Matthew Levin, president of the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County since 2012, is proud of his organization’s recent accomplishments.
They include increased financial donations to the federation’s annual campaign, as well as the growth in the Jacobson Jewish Community Foundation’s endowment.
But as the federation marks its 40th anniversary, Levin has a new challenge: overcoming rising anti-Semitism.
Levin said he rarely experienced anti-Semitism growing up in South Florida, but the rise of hate and bigotry affecting all groups is being felt by the Jewish community, too, often in violent ways. Just two months ago, in April, a gunman opened fire at a San Diego synagogue, killing one person and injuring three others.
“Whether it’s a shooting at a Chabad or at the Tree of Life Synagogue (last year in Pennsylvania), or an attack in a black church in Charleston or a mosque in New Zealand,” Levin said, the incidents of hate, bigotry and racism are on the rise worldwide.
“I’m dismayed,” Levin said. “How does that happen in 2019? It’s one of the things I wrestle with. How do we create a climate in our community that makes it clear we won’t tolerate this, and instead reach out and use words of peace to make everyone understand we’re all going to be victims to this hate and bigotry? That’s not acceptable to the society we live in.”
Despite the fresh challenges Levin faces to bring the community together, he remains optimistic about Palm Beach County and its future as a welcoming place for the Jewish community.
A wide range of employers continue to move to or expand in the southern part of the county, and there are numerous schools for families seeking a Jewish education for their children. “People are willing to start a business here and put roots in the community,” Levin said.
As a result, the federation sees its constituency becoming a year-round community, not just a seasonal one filled mostly with retirees.
“We are a Jewish community that has matured and evolved into a multi-generational community where boards are populated by young and old, residents live east and west, and children who grew up here are raising their own families,” Levin said.
These older retirees, who remember a time when there was no Israel, are among the most generous of philanthropists. Levin said it’s important to keep younger generations “connected back to Israel,” while maintaining ties to the shared experience of the Jewish community.
Name: Matthew Levin
Title: President and CEO, Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County
Age: 54
Hometown: Hollywood, Florida.
Education: B.A., University of South Florida.
Family: Divorced; 3 sons: Jacob, 19; Cooper, 14; and Noah, 13.
About your company: At the hub of the Jewish community, the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County strategically engages donors, supporters and community partners in addressing and planning for current and future needs of the Jewish people locally, in Israel and around the world. The federation accomplishes these goals by building Jewish community and developing Jewish communal leadership; promoting Jewish identity, education and engagement; caring for the vulnerable; advocating for the well-being and security of the Jewish people; and standing with Israel, their spiritual homeland.
The Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County is celebrating 40 years since its incorporation in November 1979. Some of its funded organizations, which are also located on the federation’s 100-acre campus in west Boca, include Ruth & Norman Rales Jewish Family Services; JARC FL; Adolph & Rose Levis Jewish Community Center; Donna Klein Jewish Academy; Katz Hillel Day School; Katz Yeshiva High School; and HUD apartment buildings.
“We have built an organization and a campus for our youngest to our oldest,” said Levin. “We truly provide for anything and everything: from preschool to day school, to high school, to aging in place and social services, to special needs and mental health, etc. We touch upon every factor of Jewish life.” And in this time of rising anti-Semitism around the country and the world, the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County continues to prepare its own campus and develop safety and security strategies with nearby synagogue and agency community partners. “These are times that federations are built for,” says Levin.
First paying job and what you learned from it: Operating a forklift in the Leeds Warehouse in Fort Lauderdale at age 16. I learned the value of hard work and to recognize that every job is part of a system to achieve company goals.
First break in the business: I became one of two national field organizers for AIPAC, where I worked for 25 years before coming to the federation. I traveled the country to tell college students how to advocate for Israel, how to speak and build relationships with elected officials, to understand and deliver their narrative. It was a time of airplane hijackings and acts of terror, a boycott, and an anti-Israel movement among academics. I learned public speaking, advocacy, how to build coalitions, to be prepared because facts matter. I also learned that to work effectively for Israel’s safety and security, about which I was and continue to be so passionate, it took funding. And then I was drawn into and learned about philanthropy. It is a natural extension of doing what we need to do to help people.
How your business has changed: The Madoff fraud and the overall economic downturn 11-12 years ago are a data point that changed the field of philanthropy. Nonprofits have had to rebuild the trust of donors. They’ve had to go through governance changes to become more transparent and accountable. Those that have put in place good oversight and governance succeed.
Best business book: “The One Minute Manager” by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson.
Best piece of business advice you ever received: Never put anything in an email that you wouldn’t want on the front page of The New York Times.
What you tell young people about your business: There really are fulfilling nonprofit careers with competitive compensation that allow you to be engaged in social innovation and change your generation cares about.
What do you see ahead for Palm Beach County? Palm Beach County continues to move away from its image as a retirement community. It continues to become a multi-generational community. For our own Boca, Delray and Highland Beach area, this was clearly confirmed by the demographic study our federation commissioned with the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University last year. Among its findings: there has been a dramatic increase in the number of Jewish children in our community since 2005. Jewish children living in Jewish households has risen from 11,000 to 17,300; and the Jewish community in south Palm Beach County is undergoing a demographic transition. The community still has a significant population of retirees and senior citizens (44 percent of which are ages 65 and up) but is getting younger and includes more families than it did in 2005.

Hurricane Carter case is revisited

Texto completo: For years, the father's book manuscript sat in a file drawer.
Then a safety deposit box.
Then, finally, in the son's home office in Wyckoff.
The 400-page text told a story of the grisly triple murder that came to be known as the "Hurricane Carter Case." But the son wrestled with an uneasy dilemma.
James De Simone had long known that his father, Vincent, the former chief of detectives for the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office, had written a memoir of those murders and his role in the convictions in two trials and subsequent reversals of guilty verdicts of Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, then a prominent prize fighter, and John Artis, a Paterson high school track star.
Should James publish the book now?
Fifty-three years have passed since three tavern patrons were shot to death in Paterson's Lafayette Grill early in the morning of June 17, 1966. The Lafayette Grill closed years ago — it is now another bar that caters mainly to Paterson's Latino population. Carter died in 2014 of prostate cancer. And Vincent De Simone died in 1979 of pancreatic cancer.
But this year seemed right to publish the book, said James. Starting in January, the British Broadcasting Corporation produced a 13-part podcast about the case. The "Hurricane Tapes" series raised questions about Vincent De Simone's investigative techniques and whether Carter and Artis were wrongly convicted while the real killers got away.
In addition, a new Netflix documentary by Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese, titled "Rolling Thunder Revue," refocused attention on Bob Dylan's 1975 protest song about the case, "Hurricane," which described Carter as "the man the authorities came to blame for somethin' that he never done."
For years, Vincent De Simone was at the center of those protests.
He still is.
Trying to clear his father's name "It's about time we cleared Dad's name," James, now 70, said in a recent interview at his Wyckoff home. "He was terribly painted as a racist cop who was out to get Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."
The result now is a new book, titled "Media Meddlers: The Real Truth About the Murder Case Against Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."
Memoirs inevitably offer narrow and risky looks at history. By definition, a memoir offers just the author's all-too-personal point of view — these accounts are not deeply researched treatments that provide a variety of perspectives or even meticulous fact-checking.
"Media Meddlers" has problems with accuracy. But it nevertheless offers yet another glimpse into the bitterness of the Hurricane Carter murder case and the mysteries that still surround it.
In 1966, Paterson — and, indeed, America — was fractured by racial discord. It was not long before the murder case involving Carter, then 29, and Artis, 19, was viewed through a bitter prism. Three white tavern patrons had been shot to death, reportedly by two black gunmen.
It was Vincent De Simone's job to find the killers.
Even then, De Simone seemed larger than life — a World War II veteran who had undergone more than a dozen surgeries to repair a facial disfigurement from a Nazi sniper's bullet. He then went on to become a legendary homicide detective, first with the Paterson Police Department and then with the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office.
As a police officer, De Simone carved out a reputation for no-nonsense toughness. At home, that no-nonsense persona carried over into the advice he continually passed on to his son, James: to always look people in the eye, to speak honestly and to guard your integrity.
"He said to me many, many times in my life that his integrity and his reputation were the most important things," James said.
So imagine the emotional pain, he said, when his father was singled out by Bob Dylan, journalists, Hollywood filmmakers and a variety of celebrities including Muhammad Ali as being at the vortex of a conspiracy in which evidence was doctored to send Carter and Artis to prison.
"His reputation," James said, "was tarnished."
Plenty of others agreed — especially in the law enforcement community.
"Vince De Simone was a very honorable man," said Robert Mohl, a former deputy police chief in Paterson who worked closely with him.
Mohl, now 85 and living in a retirement community in Montville, added that he still feels that "Hollywood tried to make a villain out of" De Simone "just like the liberal press usually does."
For decades, faced with the sense that his father's reputation had been indelibly damaged, James wondered what to do. After Vincent died in 1979, James' mother, Nancy, handed him the manuscript.
But Nancy De Simone felt uneasy about trying to find a publisher for the book.
"She was afraid of any retaliation from Carter's people. So I always held off," James said. "I said I'm not going to do it against Mom's wishes."
There is no evidence that either Carter or his supporters ever threatened any sort of retaliation against any of the police officers or prosecutors in the case. But even after Nancy died in 2011, James did not feel any need to publish his father's account.
The case seemed to have faded.
But then came this year's BBC podcast.
After first rejecting several requests from the BBC, James finally agreed to be interviewed for the podcast and provide some of his father's files.
Then he thought about his father's book.
"I said maybe it's time," James recalled. "Maybe this is a sign that I should do something about this manuscript and possibly get it published."
James, an advertising executive, ended up spending more than $20,000 to hire Hybrid Global Publishing of New York City, which provided proofreading, publicity and distribution to bookstores and online booksellers.
This book, however, is rooted in pain — Vincent and James De Simone's.
'Accusations and innuendos' In its introduction, James writes about the "many accusations and innuendos that painted my dad as a 'crooked cop' who was allegedly racist at a time when racism was running rampant in our country and that he was 'out to get' Rubin Carter."
In the 1999 film "The Hurricane," starring Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington as Rubin Carter, there is no mention of Vincent De Simone by name. But the arrogant, aggressive detective, Sgt. Della Pesca, who is depicted as a racist who was continually harassing Carter long before the murders, is loosely based on De Simone, according to film notes.
The truth is that Vincent De Simone barely knew Carter and had never met Artis. James adds that his father even like Bob Dylan's music — just not the lyrics to "Hurricane."
But another truth can't be denied: De Simone made mistakes in his initial investigation that led the guilty verdicts against Carter and Artis to be reversed by the New Jersey Supreme Court. The book does not adequately address those mistakes.
Nearly a decade after the murders — and with Carter and Artis in prison — the state Supreme Court threw out the murder convictions after ruling that promises of leniency to two small-time criminals who emerged as key prosecution witnesses should have been disclosed to defense attorneys.
James Hirsch, a former New York Times and Wall Street Journal reporter whose 2000 biography, "Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter," is considered one of the most authoritative accounts of the case, said it was De Simone who made those promises of leniency.
"De Simone had his fingerprints all over the wrongful conduct that led to the overturning of that conviction," said Hirsch, who shared his book profits with Carter. "Now his son wants to publish this book to reclaim the reputation of his father. That does not erase the history of this case, which is written in stone."
In a second trial in 1976, Carter and Artis were convicted again and sent back to prison. But in 1985, De Simone's investigation again became a center of controversy when a federal judge overturned the convictions because they were "predicated upon an appeal to racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure."
After the second reversal, Passaic authorities opted not to re-try Carter and Artis. Both were set free. Carter moved to Canada. Artis settled in Virginia.
Artis could not be reached for comment. But among their supporters and opponents, even the mention of the two trials and two reversals — and De Simone's role in them — sparks deep bitterness.
"De Simone was the worst of the worst," said Lewis Steele, one of Carter's and Artis' defense attorneys in the 1976 trial. "De Simone's son is entitled to write what he wants. But the facts are what they are."
"It was De Simone's promises [to witnesses] that led to the overturning of the conviction" in the first trial, added Leon Friedman, another defense attorney.
In his memoir, De Simone took particular aim at journalists.
De Simone writes that Selwyn Raab, a veteran investigative reporter for The New York Times, profited from his dogged examination of the case by getting deals for books and magazine articles.
Raab, now 85 and living in lower Manhattan, said he "never made a penny" except for his New York Times salary from his coverage of the Carter-Artis case.
"I turned down offers to do a book about Carter," Raab said, adding: "It's easy to pick on the media. They've been doing it for 30 years."
De Simone also accused another Times reporter, Leslie Maitland, of favoring Carter and Artis so much in her coverage that she kissed both men after their second trial. De Simone also claimed that Maitland, who went on to cover the Abscam case and the U.S. Justice Department in Washington for the Times, made a point of describing his facial scar in her coverage.
But a review by NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey of Maitland's trial coverage in the Times archives does not reveal she ever made any reference to De Simone's facial scar.
"I don't even remember that he had any facial disfigurement," said Maitland, now 70, when reached by phone at her home outside Washington, D.C. "My coverage was straight down the line."
Maitland added that she never kissed Carter or Artis. Instead, she said both men embraced her after a post-trial press conference. She said the embrace was unwelcome and made her feel uncomfortable.
"It caught me off guard," Maitland said. "I was completely surprised by it. I was not reaching out to hug him."
James De Simone said he did not fact-check his father's memoir. Nonetheless, he feels that the book is "the true story of what really transpired and what really happened at these trials."
He said he wants his father and the two men and one woman who were murdered at the Lafayette Grill more than half a century ago to "rest in peace and finally get some some closure."

Texto completo: Plants and animals have some crazy lifestyles, particularly when it comes to pollination.
Pollination, as you may recall, is the transfer of pollen from one plant to another. This makes it possible for flowers to produce seeds, which, in turn, will produce more plants.
Insects need food, often in the form of plant sugars from nectar and protein from pollen. Put humans in the equation, and it’s a win-win-win situation. The plant gets to make more plants, the animal gets nutrition, and we get stuff we need — like soybeans, cotton, apples, tomatoes, and Tequila.
Pollination ranges from the straightforward to the intricate and complex. In the latter category is buzz pollination (or, to be fancy, "sonication"). Bumblebees seek nectar and pollen for food for their growing colonies in the summer.
Flowers in the tomato family have tons of nutritious pollen, but they don’t give it out for free. The flower won’t release its pollen unless it "hears" a certain vibration.
Bumblebees, it turns out, give off good vibes. In fact, just the right vibes.
Grasping onto the flower by the anthers, the bumblebee buzzes with a specific frequency. At this frequency, the flower explodes with pollen, giving the bumblebee its protein and coating it with pollen.
Thus doused, the bumblebee heads right to another flower, taking the pollen from Flower One to Flower Two, and on to many others.
Scientists have determined that the frequency of buzz pollination is equivalent to a C note on a tuning fork. (Or, the "Hey" in "Hey Jude," for those Paul McCartney fans out there.) And speaking of music, recent research has revealed an amazing new page in the pollination songbook.
Some flowers produce sweeter nectar when they hear pollinators approaching.
Yep, they "hear" or detect the vibrations of pollinators.
Michelle Z. Donahue reported in the January 2019 issue of National Geographic some exciting studies undertaken by Lilach Hadany of Tel Aviv University.
"Hadany’s team looked at evening primroses," wrote Donahue, "and found that within minutes of sensing vibrations from pollinators’ wings, the plants temporarily increased the concentration of sugar in their flowers’ nectar. In effect, the flowers themselves served as ears, picking up the specific frequencies of bees’ wings while tuning out irrelevant sounds like wind."
Sweet!
The Tel Aviv researchers also looked at flower shape and the ability to sense approaching pollinators. Plants with bowl-shaped flowers may be able to detect sound better than others.
"This makes them perfect for receiving and amplifying sound waves," explained Donahue, "much like a satellite dish."
This exciting research has launched a new field of study called phytoacoustics. It all goes to show that sometimes you do need to sing for your supper.
Another amazing plant-pollinator relationship has been recently discovered. Tilo Henning of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum in Berlin, and Maximilian Weigend of the University of Bonn in Germany have hypothesized that a group of plants native to the Peruvian Andes can move their pollen-bearing structures according to past visits from pollinators.
Henning and Weigend studied the plant Nasa poissoniana and determined that it can remember the schedule of pollinator visits, and repeat their movements accordingly.
"These plants can gymnastically wave around their stamens — the organs they use for fertilization — to maximize the distribution of their pollen," according to Cara Giaimo in The New York Times.
"More surprisingly, (Henning and Weigend) suggest that individual plants can adjust the timing of these movements based on their previous experiences with pollinators. In other words, they remember the past and try to repeat it."

A close-to-home example of unusual pollination is the skunk cabbage-carrion insect relationship.
Skunk cabbage, as the name implies, is a smelly plant that grows in wet woods. It’s one of the first plants to flower each year — often in February when the snow is still on the ground.
The flower is definitely not bouquet-worthy. It’s dark maroon, lacks petals, and is hidden by an overarching structure.
The color, as well as the stench of the flower, mimic dead, rotting things — hence attracting carrion beetles and flies.
The flower also produces its own heat, and can maintain a comfortable 60 to 70 degrees inside the floral covering. Perfect for those carcass-loving insects.
Other examples of strange pollination abound. With each new discovery, we find that the business of life is fascinating in its complexities.
What happens when one of the partners in the intricate dance of pollination disappears?
We are losing pollinators at an alarming rate, and plant extinction continues apace. Habitat loss and pesticide use are the big culprits.
Not to end on a buzz-kill, let me present some good news to counter the bad. Everyone can chip in to restore, preserve, and protect habitat for the myriad creatures around us.

recently discovered. Tilo Henning of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum in Berlin, and Maximilian Weigend of the University of Bonn in Germany have hypothesized that a group of plants native to the Peruvian Andes can move their pollen-bearing structures according to past visits from pollinators.
Henning and Weigend studied the plant Nasa poissoniana and determined that it can remember the schedule of pollinator visits, and repeat their movements accordingly.
"These plants can gymnastically wave around their stamens — the organs they use for fertilization — to maximize the distribution of their pollen," according to Cara Giaimo in The New York Times.
"More surprisingly, (Henning and Weigend) suggest that individual plants can adjust the timing of these movements based on their previous experiences with pollinators. In other words, they remember the past and try to repeat it."

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday floated the possibility of staying in office longer than two terms, suggesting in a morning tweet that his supporters might "demand that I stay longer."
The president has previously joked about serving more than two terms as president, including at an event in April where he told a crowd that he might remain in the Oval Office "at least for 10 or 14 years."
The 22nd Amendment of the Constitution limits the presidency to two terms.
In tweets Sunday morning, Trump also voiced dissatisfaction with recent news coverage of his administration, calling both The Washington Post and The New York Times "the Enemy of the People."
He added: "The good news is that at the end of 6 years, after America has been made GREAT again and I leave the beautiful White House (do you think the people would demand that I stay longer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT), both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business & be forever gone!"
Last year, Trump also joked about doing away with term limits in a speech to Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago estate in which he praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for doing so in China.
"He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great," Trump said, according to CNN. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."

Trump campaign to purge pollsters after leak of results
President Trump's campaign has decided to purge some of its pollsters after a leak of dismal internal polls for the president that he denied existed.
Just two days before the president is set to kick off his bid for reelection, a top adviser said on Sunday that the campaign was cutting ties with three of its five pollsters to prevent further disclosure of survey data.
The polling showed Trump behind former Vice President Joe Biden in several key battleground states, including by double digits in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The results were confirmed to The New York Times by advisers to Trump, but when they became public, he called them “fake polls."
For days, aides to Trump have tried to figure out whom to point the finger at over the leak of the data, which jolted and infuriated the president.
The resulting furor led to an effort by the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, to tighten control.
The rupture of the team came even as the president and his advisers were preparing for a large and elaborate rally in Orlando Tuesday night to formally open his campaign for a second term. Trump was hoping for a show of strength as Democrats had drawn increasing attention before their first debates on June 26 and 27.

Israel moves to name Golan settlement after Trump
The Trump name is now the namesake of a tiny Israeli settlement in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet convened in this hamlet Sunday to inaugurate a new settlement named after President Trump in a gesture of appreciation for his recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the territory.
The settlement isn't exactly new. Currently known as Bruchim, it is more than 30 years old and has a population of 10 people.
Israel is hoping the rebranded "Ramat Trump," Hebrew for "Trump Heights," will encourage a wave of residents to vastly expand it.
"It's absolutely beautiful," said US Ambassador David Friedman, who attended Sunday's ceremony. Noting that Trump celebrated his birthday on Friday, he said: "I can't think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present."
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in 1981. Most of the international community considers the move illegal under international law.

Trump has gone too far on immigration, poll reports
Half of American voters say the Trump administration has gone too far on immigration enforcement, and optimism about the US economy, while still high, has slipped over the past quarter as trade tensions ramp up, a Fox News poll shows.
The 50 percent who say enforcement of immigration laws has "gone too far" is more than double, 24 percent, those who say actions haven't gone far enough. About one in five say the measures are about right.
By a wide majority — 73 percent to 24 percent — Americans favor giving legal status to young people brought to the United States illegally as children, so-called Dreamers. Allocating more agents to the border was a more popular choice than imposing tariffs on Mexican imports or building a wall on the US-Mexican border.
On tariffs, nearly eight in 10 of those polled had concerns that things they buy will be more expensive. More voters say tariffs hurt rather than help the US economy, with 45 percent saying they hurt and 33 percent saying they help.
A majority, 57 percent, said they were optimistic about the US economy. While still positive, that's down from 63 percent in February and 66 percent in January 2017, around the time of President Trump's inauguration.
The poll was conducted June 9-12 of 1,001 registered voters nationwide by Beacon Research, a Democratic polling operation, and Republican pollsters Shaw & Co. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Former Maine governor has a new job — tending bar
Former Republican governor Paul LePage's wife won't be the only one in their family spending the summer working at a restaurant. LePage will be joining her as a bartender.
McSeagulls Restaurant owner Jeff Stoddard said he hasn't finalized the former governor's schedule but expects him to be tending bar for the entire summer in Boothbay Harbor. The governor's wife, Ann, will be working there again as a server.
The restaurant posted photos on social media showing the former governor and first lady wearing McSeagulls T-shirts that proclaimed, "Eat, Drink & Flounder, Just for the Halibut."
The LePages spent the winter at their home in Florida. It's unclear where they're staying this summer. They sold their Boothbay home last summer.

Texto completo: Local author and Newbery award winner Linda Sue Park has gone viral.
Park, a Brighton resident, tweeted on Tuesday;
"Dear makers of women's clothing, Pants pockets should be like poetry: DEEP ENOUGH TO BE MEANINGFUL."
Within 48 hours, her post received more than 53,000 likes and was retweeted nearly 15,000 times. In response to her son sharing the viral news via Twitter, Park replied " And I confess to bewilderment. THAT tweet goes viral? smh."
In 2002, Park's young adult novel A Single Shard was awarded the prestigious Newbery Medal, which recognizes excellence in children's literacy. More recently, her 2010 short nonfiction book, A Long Walk to Water, was a New York Times bestseller. It tells the story of Salva Dut, one of the Lost Boys of Sudan who fled Sudan and eventually found his way to Rochester.
Park's latest book, Gondra's Treasure, was published in April.

Texto completo: Artistic director Rodney Whitaker always approaches planning for the annual Summer Solstice Jazz Festival with a clear idea. He likes to mix local talent with young upcoming stars from New York, Chicago or elsewhere. ¶ Over its 23-year history that plan has resulted is a wide variety jazz and we have heard many great up and comers, like heard bassist and singer Esperanza Spaulding, trumpet player Bria Skonberg and saxophonist Grace Kelly before they were internationally known. ¶ This year, Whitaker is taking a different approach. ¶ "I thought that so many of our jazz faculty at Michigan State University play with musicians from all over the country, why don't we bring those folks in so they can all play together?" ¶ The Festival runs June 21 and June 22 in downtown East Lansing on Albert Street, between Bailey and Charles. ¶ One of the headliners will be an MSU trumpet prof, Etienne Charles, who has developed a huge international career in the eight years that he's been at Michigan State. For the release of a new album, "Carnival, The Music of a People" The New York Times sent a writer to East Lansing for a feature story.
Originally from Trinidad, Charles received his master's degree from Julliard and undergrad from Florida State before he came to Michigan State. "I was younger than many of most of the graduate students when I first came here."
Speaking with Charles on the telephone is a fun experience. His speech has the soft lilt rhythms of the Caribbean along with a youthful excitement of living the life of his dreams ("Shh. Don't tell anybody.") – teaching, traveling the world, and playing jazz with his cherished colleagues. He even claims to love living in East Lansing.
"Playing professionally outside of MSU to build a career, is part of my job. I have to maintain a significant profile as a performer."
And he's done that. He just became a member of the jazz's best all-star band, the SFJAZZ Collective, has recorded seven CDs and has toured through Europe, South America, California, Africa, Jakarta, and Aspen.
Charles said, "We sort of built a conga line all over the world. We groove a lot. But when Rodney asked me to put my group together for the festival, I realized that we haven 't played in East Lansing for a long time and that would great."
The jazz trumpeter loves to connect with people through his music. "I love music for what it does for me and what it does for people. I love to see people squirming in their chairs because they just can't stop moving to the music. They've got to dance."
Also appearing is Randy Gelispie, drummer, and his Organ Ensemble. Gelispie, 84, has had one of the most remarkable careers where he has toured the country with all of the jazz greats for 30 years, but then his wife became sick and he came to Lansing and worked at the General Motors plant.
On the road Gelispie played every kind of music you can imagine and now he teaches that to his students at MSU. "In those 30 years I had to play every kind of style. I just listened to the players like mad and whatever they wanted to do; I would go that way."
On a tour, Saxophonist Cannonball Adderley said, "Boy, you sure can swing." "And that's the secret of being a good drummer," says Gelispie. "You have to swing. I always tell my young students. 'You've got to make it swing.'"
Gelispie loves the electric organ, the Hammond B3, made famous in the '50s and '60s by Jimmy Smith. For the group he's assembling for the Festival, he is bringing in Bill Heid, a legendary keyboard man. With him will be MSU profs Michael Dease on trombone, Diego Rivera on saxophone and guitarist Fareed Haque from Chicago.
Although Gelispie loves natural acoustic music, he doesn't shy away from electric organ and guitar. "I listen to the line, the music and the feeling of the music. I just love it all." Has he slowed down at age 84? Gelispie says, "Man, I can play those tempos just as fast as I ever could. I'm still going strong."
To go Friday, June 21, 4-11 p.m.; Saturday, June 22, 2:30-11 p.m.
The Founders' Stage will be in the Bailey Parking Lot, 139 Bailey St.,; the Education Stage will be adjacent to the Albert-Division intersection.
Friday night headliner is Jane Bunnett & Maqueque, an all-female sextet known for their Afro-Cuban jazz.
Saturday night headliner is Straight Ahead, an all-female quartet of Grammy-nominated recording artists from Detroit.
Other 2019 Founders' Stage performers include the Randy Gelispie Organ Ensemble, Etienne Charles, Maureen Choi, Xavier Davis Quartet with Regina Carter and the Rodney Whitaker Sextet.
The 2019 Education Stage performers include the Stanley Ruvinov Quartet, Jordyn Davis, Tim Blackmon & Tissa Khosla, Jeff Shoup Quartet, 496 West, JAMM, Margherita Fava Quartet, Brandon Rose, The Becoming Quintet, Max Colley and Root Doctor.

Texto completo: The flier advertising a near-one-acre plot of land for sale in Elmhurst, Queens, looks like a typical real estate listing. The oddly-shaped parcel that abuts the Long Island Rail Road tracks is available for $ 13.8 million. According to the flier, the lot is a great opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for residential space in the neighborhood.
What is not mentioned is that the site is a historical African-American burial ground. As many as 300 men and women, many of whom were former slaves, could be buried there. By the 1830s, a church and a school stood on the lot, at the heart of one of the city's first African-American communities, formed around the time New York abolished slavery in 1827.
The empty lot has a murky future. For one thing, it comes with an archaeological restriction which requires the St. Mark African Methodist Episcopal Church, the organization associated with the human remains buried there, to be consulted before the lot can be further developed. Representatives of 90 Queens Inc., the firm which owns the land, has offered to build a 5,000-square-foot cultural space on the ground level of a five-story condominium at 47-11 90th Street, but the church has yet to give its blessing on that plan.
After years of negotiations without a resolution, the firm has now put the lot up for sale, leading church leaders and local preservationists to wonder if there is a buyer out there that can help preserve the site instead of build on it.
"It has been extremely hard for the church to find a partner that is willing to help us, to look at this piece of real estate from a historical perspective," said the Rev. Kimberly L. Detherage, who has been leading the negotiations on behalf of the church with the developer.
St. Mark was the last religious organization to own the lot. But in 1929, it decamped to East Elmhurst and then to nearby Jackson Heights, where it is currently located.
The site is steeped in the city's African-American history and should be preserved, Ms. Detherage said, so that locals, and especially schoolchildren, can learn how former and freed slaves lived in Elmhurst, which was then known as Newtown.
The year after state emancipation, a white farmer named William Hunter deeded some land to five black residents who were members of the United African Society, one of the first African-American organizations formed in Queens after slavery ended in the state. There was most likely an African-American cemetery there that predated the society's ownership, said Roger Sanjek, an anthropology professor emeritus at Queens College.
In 1833, the abolitionist James Pennington began teaching at the school in Newtown's African-American community. After several years, Mr. Pennington attended classes at Yale Divinity School, becoming the first black American to do so. Mr. Pennington then returned to the community in 1837. The following year, a Presbyterian church was erected and he served as its pastor. (The corner of Corona Avenue and 90th Street is called Reverend James Pennington Place.)
As the years went by the African-American residents of Newtown started to organize, while learning about their new racially-restrictive civic rights, Dr. Sanjek said. He has written about a meeting that took place in Newtown in 1862, when residents denounced President Abraham Lincoln's proposal of possibly resettling freed slaves in other countries by affirming their strong American identity.
At some point, the community converted its church from the Presbyterian denomination to an African Methodist Episcopal one. A map indicates that the A.M.E. church had been established on the lot by 1873.
In 1929, however, the church, under pressure to move, sold the property, as the land had become "very valuable for business and industry," according to The New York Times. Before relocating to East Elmhurst, the church -- now known as St. Mark, the one overseen by Ms. Detherage in Jackson Heights -- requested to transport all the bodies from the burial ground to Mount Olivet Cemetery in Maspeth. (The city denied the request, although 20 bodies were transferred.)
As the lot changed hands several times throughout the decades, the burial ground was largely forgotten until the current owner started excavating the land for a new building in 2011. Construction crews called the police when they found the well-preserved body of Martha Peterson, likely a descendant of one of the founders of the United African Society. The discovery became the subject of a "Secrets of the Dead" episode on PBS in 2018.

The discovery also put a stop to development plans. Since then, negotiations with the church have been very gradual, Ms. Detherage said. The last meeting, held two months ago, was cordial, she said, as representatives gave her renderings for a museum that would be on the ground floor of the condominium complex. She said the latest plan was a step in the right direction, but didn't quite fit the church's vision. (When asked, Ms. Detherage did not yet want to comment on what that vision entailed).
Bo Jin Zhu, who is listed as the president of 90 Queens Inc. on public records, said in a telephone interview that he was only a minority shareholder and had not been part of the negotiations with the church. He said his involvement was only with construction, and any questions about negotiations with the church or future development plans should be asked to the firm's other stakeholders, whom he declined to name.
Church leaders are also concerned about financing and maintaining a museum, should one be built on the lot.
Ms. Detherage suggested that maybe the city or another cultural institution could invest in and help run whatever was developed on the site. "This is our chance to educate, share our history and perhaps change what people think African Americans were like after slavery," but the church cannot do it alone, she said.
The preservation of African-American burial grounds is gaining momentum as a national movement. Sandra Arnold, a graduate fellow at Brown University's Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice, has started the Periwinkle Humanities Initiative, which is building a database of national burial sites of enslaved Americans. And a bill was recently introduced that would allow the National Park Service to provide assistance to those researching and preserving burial sites.
There are two landmark African-American burial grounds in the city; one in western Staten Island and another in Lower Manhattan near City Hall. There are others that are recognized and commemorated, including one in Harlem.
"It's sad to me that this place hasn't been properly commemorated," said James McMenamin, the vice president of the nonprofit Elmhurst History and Cemeteries Preservation Society, a local group that has asked the city to landmark the site. "It is worth preserving not just because it's a sacred cemetery, but because it's a big part of the city's history."

Texto completo: Do you wish you were an Iowa voter? Imagine how exciting life would be right now. Each morning when you left the house, you'd have no idea how many Democratic candidates for president would try to shake your hand before sunset.
Everybody wants to woo Iowans because they vote first. On Tuesday Joe Biden was in Ottumwa, calling Donald Trump "an existential threat to America." Existential means, well, about existence. Lately people have tended to use it a lot when they mean really, really serious. In 2020 there'll probably be TV ads: "Vote Tuesday. This time it's existential."
Trump himself was in Council Bluffs, trying to make sure nobody could forget about his existence for a single second, bragging about his devotion to farmers and calling Biden "Sleepy Joe." Nicknames have worked very well for Trump, but this one has some perils. Americans may start asking themselves whether they'd rather have a president who sleeps through the night or one who's up at 5 a.m. sending out tweets with a lot of misspelled words.
Biden, meanwhile, was assuring his crowd that Iowa was the existential state: "If you can't cross the line in Iowa, you don't win the marathon." He even apologized for having missed an Iowa Democratic dinner so he could attend his granddaughter's graduation.
It's OK, Joe. Really.
Last weekend, by my count, there were 40 different Democratic events in Iowa, from modest back-porch meet-and-greets to that political dinner, which attracted 19 presidential hopefuls.
Are you jealous, people? Perhaps your idea of fun does not include listening to 19 five-minute speeches after dessert. Or coming out of the grocery store and being forced to interact with Bill de Blasio. But you'd have to love the power. There was a huge buzz last week when a poll by Iowa's leading newspaper found Democratic voters seemed to be cooling on Biden, who was down to 24% while Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg were moving up.
The race at the bottom was so intense that Amy Klobuchar was able to happily announce her 2% showing was better than 16 of her competitors. The poll involved 600 active Democrats. Her 2% boils down to about 12 people. See what I mean?
There's already speculation about how many of the candidates will manage to visit all 99 Iowa counties as a show of devotion. Former Rep. John Delaney had already hit the mark in 2018. Given that he registered 1% in that Iowa poll, I'll hazard a guess that this is not a winning strategy. Nor is unknown-candidate Marianne Williamson's tactic of simply moving in. She's a spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey and new resident of a Des Moines condo. Chris Dodd tried the same thing in 2007. He even took his daughter out of kindergarten to enroll her in a Hawkeye State school. He still came in seventh, and he was a U.S. senator.
Most of us never get to know what this kind of voter clout feels like. Back in 1992 - the last year that the Iowa winner didn't grab the Democratic nomination - competition ran on for so long that New York's primary actually made a difference. I cannot tell you how exciting it was hearing presidential candidates vying to sound the most passionate about mass transportation.
Pandering is so cool when you're the one being pandered to.
In Iowa, ethanol is the primo pander topic. You probably know that the government allows gasoline to be mixed with some kind of biofuel like corn. That can cut down on prices, but it can have a significant downside when it comes to the environment, particularly air pollution in the summer.
Still, it does sell a lot of corn, and Trump was in Iowa to brag that he'd opened the door to still more ethanol at the pump.
Very hard to find many anti-ethanol politicians. Bernie Sanders discovered in the last primary season that a program he once disliked is actually "an economic lifeline to rural and farm communities." His Democratic opponents tend to keep their heads down, nodding and mumbling something about electric cars.
Corn obsessions aside, the people of Iowa are extremely conscientious about their being-first responsibilities. But don't you think other states should get a chance?
What about Nebraska? It's like Iowa in many ways, but at least there'd be a change of scene. Right now all the candidates are prepping to go to the Iowa State Fair, where they will marvel at exhibits - who can ever forget the Last Supper carved out of butter? But if the first vote shifted to Nebraska, we'd get to watch the pols trying to look excited at a festival called Kool-Aid Days, celebrating the invention of Kool-Aid, which happens to be the official state soft drink.
We would learn way more interesting facts like this if Nebraska got a turn.
Or Rhode Island. It'd be very easy for candidates to meet the voters in Rhode Island, since most of them are kind of squished together. And instead of ethanol, the contenders would have to pander to a product Rhode Islanders make. Such as - silverware! If Rhode Island was the first state to vote, I bet in no time at all we'd have a law abolishing plastic forks.
Gail Collins writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

MEXICO TO ADD 825 IMMIGRATION AGENTS ON ITS BORDERS TO CURB MIGRANT INFLUX

Texto completo: MEXICO CITY - Mexico will post 825 additional immigration agents on its borders as part of an agreement with the United States to reduce migration flows, Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard announced Friday.
A planned deployment of 6,000 troops on the Guatemalan border, meanwhile, will be completed Tuesday, the minister said at a joint news conference with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Thousands of migrants cross daily from Guatemala into Mexico on their way to the U.S., which threatened Mexico with import duties unless it stopped the influx.
Mexico has also agreed to receive migrants who have been sent back by the U.S. and to host them while its northern neighbor is handling their asylum requests.
However, Mexico wants to limit the numbers of such migrants, Mr. Ebrard said.
Meanwhile, the head of Mexico's migration authority, Tonatiuh Guillen, announced his resignation.
Mr. Guillen didn't give any reason for his decision, according to an announcement published by the National Institute of Migration.
He had been handling a plan of granting humanitarian visas to migrants, which was canceled because the possibility of obtaining such visas was drawing more migrants into the country.
More than 670,000 migrants reached the U.S. border from Mexico since January, according to U.S. data. Most are Central Americans fleeing poverty and violence, but they also include Haitians, Cubans, Africans and Asians.
President Donald Trump announced a deal with Mexico a week ago to avoid imposing tariffs on all Mexican imports. Mexico was given 45 days to significantly reduce the number of migrants reaching the U.S.-Mexican border, or face a renewed tariff threat.

King’s proof he’s not racist? Diamond and Silk.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- It has been five months since Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, lost his committee assignments over his support for white supremacy, and on Wednesday he took a step toward rehabilitation.
He gave a news conference on the Capitol grounds -- with two real, live, actual black people!
Not African Americans, mind you. “You ain’t gotta call me African American ‘cause I ain’t never been to Africa,” explained Lynnette Hardaway. “You can call me black.”
Hardaway and her sister, Rochelle Richardson, form the “Diamond and Silk” YouTube sensation, a duo whose conservative commentary has won them frequent airtime on Fox News and promotion from President Trump.
King had recruited Diamond and Silk ostensibly to help launch a new piece of legislation, the so-called Diamond and Silk Act -- designed to shift funds from sanctuary cities to homeless veterans -- but really King needed them to inoculate him from the whole racism thing.
“You’ve been stripped of your committee assignments. What makes you think Republican colleagues will even entertain this?” asked the first questioner.
Before King could speak, Diamond broke in. “Can I answer this?”
“Sure,” a delighted King replied.
She launched into an angry diatribe about members of Congress living in mansions, concluding: “So this ain’t about no Steve King. This is about our homeless, our veterans and Americans.”
King had nothing to add. “I think they’ve answered it adequately.”
So, if this isn’t about King, why is he giving a news conference?
Diamond’s answer included an extensive complaint about attempts to phase out plastic drinking straws.
When a third reporter asked Diamond and Silk what they thought of King retweeting white supremacists, the entertainers erupted:
“What is the definition of white supremacist?”
“You don’t know, do you?”
“Why would you talk that?”
“I’m tired of you all playing the race card.”
“Stop calling everybody a racist.”
King, a slight man, stood hidden behind the sisters, while they angrily quarreled with the notion that white supremacists are white supremacists.
It was perhaps the most brazen attempt by a white man to shield himself from racial criticism since Trump told a sea of white faces at a campaign rally to “look at my African American over here.” (Diamond vouched for Trump, too, saying he’s “not a racist -- he’s a realist.”)
The women, arguably the white nationalists’ favorite black people, are perhaps not the best character references on such matters. Fox News recently had to retract their on-air claim that Speaker Nancy Pelosi is “a nonfunctioning alcoholic and she slurs her words” (this was based on a doctored video). Diamond and Silk previously called Hillary Clinton a “slave master,” said she was responsible for Russia acquiring nuclear weapons (which happened 70 years ago) and falsely stated under oath that they hadn’t been paid by the Trump campaign.
But King is not in a position to be picky. The statement to The New York Times that cost him his committee assignments (“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?”) was just one of his many incendiary remarks over the years. So low is his standing that the White House wouldn’t let him fly on Air Force One this week to his home state of Iowa. (He attended Trump’s event anyway.) His website sidesteps his loss of committee assignments, saying he “has” served on three.
When reporters inevitably peppered him at Wednesday’s event about his white-nationalism flirtations, King protested that he was “misquoted” by the Times and in similar remarks in the Congressional Record.
“That’s my final word on the topic,” he proposed.
No dice.
A reporter invited him to explain what he actually meant about “Western civilization.”
“I said that’s my final word on that topic,” he repeated.
Would he ever get back on his committees?
“Let’s just stick on topic here today.”
Why was he barred from Air Force One?
“I can’t hear you,” he replied.
But everybody within a quarter mile could hear the shouts of Diamond and Silk. They attacked Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). They attacked Joe Biden for remarks in 1993 that “echo the sentiments of bigotry and racism.”
They went wherever their thoughts took them. They proffered their views on homeless encampments (“looks like a full toilet, you’ve got to be stepping across sugar honey iced tea”) and on sanctuary cities (“It isn’t legal to aid and [abet] illegal aliens”).
Of course, they also demanded that King be given back his committee assignments, asking, “You’re going to make this man act like he’s racist?”
He does that well enough without assistance.

US ramps up attacks on Russian power grid

Texto completo: The Pentagon is intensifying its attacks on Russia’s power grid in the latest sign of a growing cyber war between the U.S. and the Kremlin.
The U.S. has infiltrated Russia’s electric power grid among other unnamed targets, inserting American malware into the systems in response to heightened Russian cyber aggression and political meddling, including efforts to influence recent U.S. elections, according to the New York Times.
Although the Times provided few specific details on the attacks, officials said U.S. malware has the potential to cripple Russia’s electric infrastructure and is unprecedented in terms of its reach and aggressiveness.
The move is intended as a warning to Russia and would also allow the U.S. to retaliate quickly against Russian provocation.
The warning strike was authorized by U.S. Cyber Command, which was granted extended power to conduct cyber “clandestine military activity” in order to “deter, safeguard or defend against attacks or malicious cyberactivities against the United States” last year by President Trump and congress. That authorization followed concerns that the administration needed to respond more aggressively to Kremlin-ordered cyber attacks and hacking campaigns.

Texto completo: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is postponing the publication of Naomi Wolf's forthcoming book "Outrages" after questions have been raised about the accuracy of her research.
The book, which explores how 19th-century British laws gave the government new ways to punish and criminalize same-sex relationships, was expected to go on sale in the United States on June 18, with an announced first print run of 35,000 copies.
The publisher initially stood by Ms. Wolf last month after an embarrassing on-air correction to her interpretation of historical records occurred during an interview with the BBC. Now, the company is taking the extreme step of recalling copies from retailers.
"As we have been working with Naomi Wolf to make corrections to 'Outrages,' new questions have arisen that require more time to explore. We are postponing publication and requesting that all copies be returned from retail accounts while we work to resolve those questions," a spokeswoman for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt said in an email on Thursday evening.
[Read our critic's review of "Outrages." ]
Ms. Wolf said she opposed Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's decision to postpone the book and would do everything she could to make it available to United States readers.
"I stand by my work," she said in a statement. "The misinterpretations I made, I directly acknowledged and took immediate action to correct; but many of the other critiques are either subject to interpretation or are themselves in error. A rebuttal article was underway. More responsiveness and more transparency are the right answers to criticism, and not the complete withdrawal of a text."
The blowback against Ms. Wolf was swift after the BBC Radio host, Matthew Sweet, revealed a critical error in her book that undermined her thesis. During the interview, Wolf told him that she found "several dozen executions" of men accused of having sexual relations with other men.
"I don't think you're right about this," he said.
Mr. Sweet said that Ms. Wolf had misunderstood the legal term "death recorded" as an execution, when in fact it meant that a death sentence was not carried out.
"It was a category that was created in 1823 that allowed judges to abstain from pronouncing a sentence of death on any capital convict whom they considered to be a fit subject for pardon," Mr. Sweet said. "I don't think any of the executions you've identified here actually happened."
Ms. Wolf said she would look into the records in question and correct future editions, noting that the issue Mr. Sweet raised was "a really important thing to investigate."
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt initially called the mistaken number of executions an "unfortunate error" but said, "we believe the overall thesis of the book 'Outrages' still holds."
It wasn't the first time Ms. Wolf has been questioned over the accuracy of her research and analysis. Known for books such as "The Beauty Myth" and "Vagina: A New Biography," she has been called out in the past for vastly overstating the number of women who die from anorexia and for making dubious claims about female biology.
But the errors in "Outrages" appear to be more grave, given that Ms. Wolf's publisher is taking the costly step of recalling finished copies, a rare measure that is usually only undertaken for books that contain fatal factual flaws or other more serious transgressions. In 2012, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt recalled books by the journalist Jonah Lehrer after evidence surfaced that he had fabricated quotes and plagiarized.
It's unclear whether "Outrages" will also be recalled in Britain, where it was released in May by the publisher Virago.
The recent controversy over "Outrages" highlights the perils that publishers face in a competitive market where juicy nonfiction books that feature explosive claims can command the highest sales but are sometimes not vigorously fact-checked or vetted in advance of publication.
Publishers often rely on authors to verify material in their books, and if fact checkers are used, it is typically at the author's discretion and expense.
Recently, questions have arisen about the accuracy of books by other major nonfiction authors, including Jared Diamond and Michael Wolff, who was called out in an interview for errors in his new book about the Trump administration, "Siege: Trump Under Fire."

Texto completo: The reason why democratic socialism is growing in popularity is a pretty reason.
Because it is not capitalism.
Capitalism is, more and more people are realizing, evil. And its greatest crime is that its proponents and sycophants have convinced themselves, and many others, that capitalism is a term that is fully interchangeable with the idea of a free market.
That is false, tragically false. Though it should surprise no one, as the devil of capitalism is not in its details, but in its very name.
As Maya Angelou said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”
Capital is another word for money. Capitalism, thus, is a world view that values money. And. Nothing. Else.
That is not the free market. The free market values -- or, at least, can value -- many things. Innovation. Cooperation. The law of supply and demand. Fair deals. Respect for partners, workers and customers. Human progress, at least in a material sense.
The free market excels at creating stuff. Not justice, not fairness, not decency. But stuff, lots and lots of stuff, more stuff than we can keep up with. Stuff we love to have. Stuff that creates longer lives lived in relative comfort. And stuff that, frankly, we’d be better off without.
A truly free market values both market mechanisms and government regulations to hold everyone to standards of fairness, honesty, respect for physical and intellectual property and the kind of robust competition that is always short-lived without active efforts to prevent collusion, price-fixing and monopoly power.
Adam Smith, the 18th century philosopher labeled the “father of capitalism” warned repeatedly that it is the natural tendency of merchants to collude, fix prices and wages, drive out competition and create monopolies that are destructive of both a free market and society as a whole.
Never trust businessmen to write their own regulations, Smith urged, as, unchecked, the business class will always seek “to deceive and even to oppress the public.”
A truly free market depends on a commons, created privately or through government, that includes transportation, public safety, patent and copyright protection, banks and financial services that are sound and honest, protection of workers’ rights and the environment, universal education, a free press and, in truly First World nations, universal access to health care.
In recent weeks we have seen two of the brightest, if not the youngest, stars in the firmament of conservative punditry come to the very public conclusion that conservative thought, at least as it used to be honored and promoted by the Republican Party in the United States, is dead.
George F. Will of The Washington Post and David Brooks of The New York Times, have pronounced Republican conservatism a thing of the past, destroyed by the distaste it has engendered in a happily multi-cultural, yet financially insecure, generation that now sees the Republicans as, in Will’s words, “the dumb party.”
Conservatism has been blown out of the water, not by the success of socialism, but by the widely detested rise of Trumpism. That is a bare-knuckles and hideously crude form of capitalism that sees wealth is a measure of a person’s worth and holds that all of life is a dog-eat-dog, zero-sum game in which lifting all boats is both impossible and weak.
The rich have always sought to divert the righteous anger of the poor by pitting different segments of society against one another. This divide-and-conquer approach got our current president elected once, and could well get him elected again, as enough people in enough swing states, prodded by enough falsehoods posted by the Russian secret service on Facebook and promoted by Fox News, turn against the better angels of their nature to vote for the lummox who promises to protect them from the rising number of brown people.
The incumbent has done more than any capitalist in the last century to convince people that things like a free press, the rule of law, environmental protection and guards against corruption in both the public and private sectors are for sissies. That making America great again involves moving backward to a time when all political, social and economic power was held by white, nominally Christian males.
People who want a free society and a free market to really be intertwined are attracted to the arguments of Bernie Sanders, Alexandra Osasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren and like minds because they see that allocating society’s assets to build everyone up, to educate them, heal them, make them free of economic insecurity, is not theft from one class to aid another. It is an absolute necessity if even the well-off are to live in a culture that provides freedom of movement, expression and the opportunity for real human growth.
Some people, whether hopefully or derisively, will call it socialism. The proper term for it is civilization.

Where Gloria Steinem and conservatives can agree: Commercial surrogacy is harmful to women

Texto completo: Finally, feminists and conservatives can agree on something: Commercial surrogacy is harmful to women.
This week, the New York state Senate passed the “Child-Parent Security Act,” which would legalize commercial surrogacy in the state. The practice is already legal in 47 other states, but some progressives are not so supportive of it.
In a letter responding to the New York vote this week, Steinem wrote that it's not all surrogacy she's concerned about. It's the commercialization of the process.
"The danger here is not the use of altruistic surrogacy to create a loving family, which is legal in New York now, but the state legalizing the commercial and profit-driven reproductive surrogacy industry," she wrote. "The bill also allows for any woman, from anywhere in the world, to be brought to New York, by anyone, in order to carry a commercialized pregnancy. This carries the big risk of human trafficking for reproductive and other exploitation of both women and children."
The issue of surrogacy has been posed as a solution not only for infertile couples, but also for gay and lesbian couples who’d like to have their own kids. But Deborah Glick, a New York assemblywoman who is the first openly gay member of the state legislature, says it’s not that simple.
“It is pregnancy for a fee,” she told the New York Times, “and I find that commodification of women troubling.”
Likewise, in a letter to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has supported the bill, dozens of disparate activists — from religious leaders to Steinem and “The Vagina Monologues” author Eve Ensler — opposed the bill. The letter reads:
“Our opposition to this bill emerges from our conviction that the legalization of commercial surrogacy contracts in New York State will undermine women’s control over their bodies, thwart women’s reproductive rights, render women vulnerable to reproductive trafficking and exploitation, and further subordinate and harm women, especially those who are economically disadvantaged, in our State.”
Progressives such as Steinem are concerned about commercial surrogacy for a number of reasons, one being that such an arrangement could infringe on a woman’s choice to abort her baby. But that’s not the only reason it’s a complicated issue. Surrogacy opens up questions of custody rights, as surrogate mothers sometimes decide they’d like to keep the baby. It also turns a woman’s womb into a tool to be monetized.
As much as the complaint that America is turning into “The Handmaid’s Tale” rings false, the issue of surrogacy draws a much more accurate parallel. “Surrogacy degrades a pregnancy to a service and a baby to a product,” Jennifer Lahl wrote for Verily in 2017. “I wish the harms of surrogacy existed only in the confines of dystopian novels and TV series. Unfortunately, they exist in the real world.”
Lahl, who founded the Center for Bioethics and Culture, said she “became interested in helping women exploited by third-party reproduction when I saw it happening all around me throughout my 25-year career as a pediatric critical care nurse, a hospital administrator, and a senior-level nursing manager.”
Surrogacy, she explains, is not as benign as it seems. The process, which can cost from $20,000 to $200,000, is an option only for wealthy families, and it often hurts the financially needy women who offer it. Lahl wrote:
“Women in such countries as India, Thailand, and Cambodia have long experienced the exploitation of coercive surrogacy. In March 2015, HBO’s Vice showcased the coercive situations in India where surrogate mothers are in high demand because the prices are lower than, say, America. The investigative journalists found it was worse than they thought; the surrogacy agencies were so profit-seeking that they had a surplus of babies born even before parents had claimed them.”
The three countries have since outlawed commercial surrogacy, and states in the U.S. should be wary as well. As New York's bill continues to be discussed in the state legislature (it won't make it to Cuomo's desk unless the Assembly passes it), two disparate parties have the opportunity to come together. Commercial surrogacy carries with it the potential for trafficking and the commodification of women, a problem that both feminists and conservatives can agree is important to fight.

Counting sheep (and goats) Photographer captures Whidbey Island animals in new portrait book

What: "Goats and Sheep: A Portrait Farm" with Kevin Horan
When: Noon Saturday
Where: Art Spirit Gallery, 415 E. Sherman Ave., Coeur d'Alene
Cost: Free
Jake is looking straight into the camera, giving viewers his best "Blue Steel" impression, while Lizzie, Xantippe and Sherlock, covered in curls, look placidly to one side.
Stanwood stares straight ahead, two teeth protruding over his top lip, and Sydney gazes off camera, her curly-haired body taking up much of the frame.
These aren't your typical models, and these aren't your typical portraits.
Jake, Lizzie, Xantippe, Sherlock, Stanwood and Sydney are among the animals featured in photographer Kevin Horan's "Goats and Sheep: A Portrait Farm."
The book brings Horan to the Art Spirit Gallery on Saturday for a book launch, reading and art exhibit.
Horan, whose work has appeared in the New York Times Magazine, Smithsonian, LIFE, U.S. News & World Report and National Geographic, moved to Whidbey Island from Chicago in 2006 and was immediately taken with the goats and sheep that became his neighbors.
"They were, to my eye, an undifferentiated bunch but these voices clued me that they were individual," he said. "I don't know exactly where that concept came from, but I thought 'Oh boy, I ought to do portraits of them'... I'll be honest, I guess I thought it would be funny but it turned out to be a little bit more."
Horan's first subjects were going to be neighboring sheep herd, but they "scattered like flies" as soon as he approached.
So Horan contacted a woman who was starting a goat cheese dairy. He told her what he hoped to do and, to his surprise, she agreed to have him over.
The goats were milked twice a day and were therefore used to being led here and there. The dairy owner helped get each animal in front of the camera, and Horan began making portraits.
"Several of those pictures from that very first day are still in the collection because they just clicked," Horan said.
Horan also visits New Moon Farm Sanctuary in Arlington, Washington, once or twice a year to photograph the goats.
When considering which animals to photograph, Horan likens his process to people-watching. He looks for the most interesting look or face, which is why, he said, there aren't any photos of baby animals in his collection.
"Your reaction to that is pretty much pre-programmed," he said. "Everyone has an automatic 'Aww' reaction, so just as with humans, if someone's got a little history, then they've got a face that reports that."
"A recovering photojournalist," Horan said a few previous assignments prepared him to photograph goats and sheep.
Before the magazine become primarily celebrity-focused, Horan photographed animal stories for People.
And during a project called "Street Census" in Chicago, Horan and his team conducted neighborhood surveys by setting up in one of a dozen different neighborhoods and photographing the people who walked by.
"It was, in a way, similar," he said. "It was a way to see people by their exteriors and get a hint of their interiors ... But in a way, it was analogous. It was all about the fun of people watching."
Over the years, Horan has picked up a few tips for photographing animals, likening the experience to photographing children.
Trying to coerce them will only go sideways, he said, so it's best to bring treats and be patient and observant.
Horan shoots with strobes, so what might look like a pose is really a captured instant.
"We as the viewer, we take from that gesture and ascribe meaning to it," he said. "They have those looks. That's the three-way collaboration in any portrait between the subject, the portraitist and the viewer. We all agree on what gestures mean."
"Goats and Sheep: A Portrait Farm," which was released in March and features an essay by Elena Passarello ("Let Me Clear My Throat," "Animals Strike Curious Poses"), began to take shape after Horan received a call from Milan, Italy-based art book publisher 5 Continents Editions.
Horan was in the early stages of releasing a book through an American publisher, but 5 Continents Editions director Eric Ghysels was so passionate about the project, Horan decided to release "Goats and Sheep" with him.
Thus far, Horan has gotten positive reactions to the portraits, especially from those who are goat or sheep people, though others enjoy the work because of the portraiture.
Horan has since expanded his animal portraiture repertoire to include pigs (http://kevinhoran. com/chattel-pigs) and he would like to photograph primates too.
Horan isn't interested in photographing dogs and cats because they're "too familiar," and he tried horse portraiture but didn't feel like those portraits translated as well as his goat and sheep photos.
But no matter what animal he's photographing, Horan hopes his photos help to change viewers' perceptions of all animals.
"It was more trying to understand that the way you see the world is not the only way," he said. "That every creature has its own world view, and you'll never know what it's like to experience the world as a bat or your dog, as one of these goats. That's the underlying impulse is to expand our appreciation of all the other consciousnesses out there."

App Used by Protesters Comes Under Assault

Texto completo: SHANGHAI -- As protesters in Hong Kong retreated from police lines in the heart of the city's business district, a new assault quietly began.
It was not aimed at the protesters. It was aimed at their phones.
A network of computers in China bombarded Telegram, a secure messaging app used by many of the protesters, with a huge volume of traffic that disrupted service. The app's founder, Pavel Durov, said the attack coincided with the Hong Kong protests, a phenomenon that Telegram had seen before.
"This case was not an exception," he wrote.
The Hong Kong police made their own move to limit digital communications. On Tuesday night, as demonstrators gathered near Hong Kong's legislative building, the authorities arrested the administrator of a Telegram chat group with 20,000 members, even though he was at his home miles from the protest site.
"I never thought that just speaking on the internet, just sharing information, could be regarded as a speech crime," the chat leader, Ivan Ip, 22, said in an interview.
"I only slept four hours after I got out on bail," he said. "I'm scared that they will show up again and arrest me again. This feeling of terror has been planted in my heart. My parents and 70-year-old grandma who live with me are also scared."
Past the tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray, the Hong Kong protests are also unfolding on a largely invisible, digital front. Protesters and police officers alike have brought a new technological savvy to the standoff.
Demonstrators are using today's networking tools to muster their ranks, share safety tips and organize caches of food and water, even as they take steps to hide their identities.
The Hong Kong authorities are responding by tracking the protesters in the digital places where they plan their moves, suggesting they are taking cues from the ways China polices the internet.
In mainland China, security forces track chat messages, arrest dissidents before protests even occur, and are increasingly detaining people over posts critical of the government. The Hong Kong police have visited the mainland at times looking at ways of stopping terrorism.
"We know the government is using all kinds of data and trails to charge people later on," said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Protesters used some of the same tools to organize in 2014, when the Occupy Central demonstration shut down parts of the city for more than two months. But their caution shows a growing awareness that the new digital tools can be a liability as well as an asset.
The police during the Occupy protests used digital messages to justify the arrest of a 23-year-old man, saying he used an online forum to get others to join in. One message that then spread over the WhatsApp chat service included malware, disguised as an app, that appeared to be for eavesdropping on Occupy organizers. Researchers said the malware most likely came from China's government.
"People are minimizing their footprints as much as possible," Dr. Tsui said. "In that regard, it's very different from five years ago. People are much more conscious and savvy about it."
This week's protests were sparked by the Hong Kong government's plans to enact a new law that would allow people in the city to be extradited to mainland China, where the court system is closed from public scrutiny and tightly controlled by the Communist Party. On Thursday, city officials delayed plans to consider the legislation.
Telegram said on its Twitter account that it was able to stabilize its services shortly after the attack began. It described the heavy traffic as a DDoS attack, in which servers are overrun with requests from a coordinated network of computers. In his tweet, Mr. Durov said the attack's scale was consistent with a state actor.
Beijing has been blamed in the past for attacks that silence political speech outside mainland China's borders. In 2014, an informal online referendum about Hong Kong's political future drew what at that time was one of the largest such attacks in history. A separate cyberattack in 2015 hijacked traffic from Baidu, the Chinese search engine, to overload a website hosting copies of services blocked in China, like Google, the BBC, and The New York Times.
The Chinese government on Thursday denied it had played a role and said China was often a victim of hacking itself. "We have always advocated that the international community should jointly safeguard the security of cyberspace through dialogue and cooperation," Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said during a daily news briefing.
In Hong Kong, the authorities focused on Mr. Ip, the chat room organizer, whom they saw as a ringleader. He said that the police arrived at his door with a warrant around 8 p.m. More than 10 officers demanded he unlock his phone, explaining that they were searching for extremists in the chat groups he administered.
At first he refused, but when they threatened to use a device to break into his Xiaomi 6 smartphone, he relented and entered the password. They then downloaded his chat records.
The officers searched his apartment, where he lives with his parents, but backed down after the parents complained that they were searching through things that were not his, he said. The police officers implied that they had found him based on his phone number, which was linked to his identification.
While Telegram conversations can be encrypted, the service does not have end-to-end encryption for its group chats, said Dr. Tsui, the communications professor. After Mr. Ip was arrested, groups distributed warnings to use new pay-as-you-go SIM cards or register foreign numbers online to join groups.
In a statement, the Hong Kong police's Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau said he had been arrested because he was suspected of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. He was released on bail, but the police said an investigation was continuing. Mr. Ip said he had not attended any protests this week.
Many of the protesters are college-aged and digitally savvy. They took pains to keep from being photographed or digitally tracked. To go to and from the protests, many stood in lines to buy single-ride subway tickets instead of using their digital payment cards, which can be tracked. Some confronting the police covered their faces with hats and masks, giving them anonymity as well as some protection from tear gas.
On Wednesday, several protesters shouted at bystanders taking photos and selfies, asking those who were not wearing press passes to take pictures only of people wearing masks. Later, a scuffle broke out between protesters and bystanders who were taking photos on a bridge over the main protest area.
For some, the most flagrant symbol of defiance came from showing one's face.
On Wednesday, as demonstrators prepared for a potential charge by the police, a drone flew overhead. The protesters warned one another about photos from above, but Anson Chan, a 21-year-old recent college graduate, said she was unconcerned about leaving her face exposed, potentially revealing her identity.
Ms. Chan said she felt compelled to join the protests out of concern about the proposed law.
"Once people get taken to China, they can't speak for themselves," said Ms. Chan, who had traveled nearly two hours from Lok Ma Chau in northern Hong Kong to show support and hand out supplies after seeing scenes of violence on the news.
The mainland's restrictions were on the minds of many.
"The bottom line is whether to trust Beijing," said Dr. Tsui, the communications professor. "This is a government that routinely lies to its own citizens, that censors information, that doesn't trust its own citizens. You can't ask us to trust you if you don't trust us."
"These kids that are out there, all the young people, they're smart," he added. "They know not to trust Beijing."

House blocks move to end government fetal tissue research

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The House voted Thursday to block the Trump administration's move to end human fetal tissue research by government scientists, a direct challenge to the White House that will be tested in the Republican-led Senate.
Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, cochairman of the House Progressives Caucus, sponsored the amendment to a sweeping spending bill. The amendment targets President Trump's policy requiring federally funded research using fetal tissue from elective abortions to undergo separate screenings by an ethics advisory board. Pocan's measure restricted funding to set up such panels.
The amendment passed 225-193, largely along party lines with all Republicans and three antiabortion Democrats — Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, Ben McAdams of Utah, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota — voting against it.
The president reportedly had his political base in mind when he made the decision on June 5 to restrict federal funding for fetal tissue research, ignoring pushback from health and science aides in the administration who argued the importance of such research, The Washington Post reported.
"The administration's decision to forgo to develop treatments, cures for diseases, Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's — this is once again putting personal ideology ahead of public health," Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said on the House floor.
Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, challenged that even if some research "might benefit from fetal tissue" that doesn't mean the ethics shouldn't be considered.

Video shows Biden's 2006 views on abortion
In a newly unearthed video from 2006, Joe Biden said he supported Roe v. Wade but did not view abortion as “a choice and a right" — remarks that raise further questions about how he views abortion rights as he runs for the Democratic presidential nomination and faces pressure over his position on the issue.
“I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy," Biden said in a videotaped interview with Texas Monthly, reported Thursday by CNN. “I think it should be rare and safe," he added. “I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions."
Biden referred to himself as a “little bit of an odd man out in my party" because he wouldn't vote for federal financing of abortions and had voted to limit late-term abortions, but supported Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the legal right to the procedure.
Last Wednesday, Biden's staff said he maintained his longstanding position in support of the Hyde Amendment. The provision bans federal funding for abortion in most cases, meaning the procedure is available only to women with private insurance and those who can afford it.
The next day, faced with mounting backlash from the Democratic base and his primary opponents, Biden announced he had reversed that position.

Trump shows off color changes for Air Force One
President Trump shared mock-ups of an Air Force One with a new paint scheme — featuring colors remarkably similar to those on his private jet — on a television interview broadcast Thursday as Democratic lawmakers moved to impede such a change.
The mock-ups swap out the current sky blue and white for a color scheme that includes red, white, and navy, in nearly identical shades that appear on the jet that Trump used to fly around the country during his 2016 campaign.
The interview, conducted in the Oval Office, was broadcast a day after a House committee voted to require congressional approval for changes to the Air Force One paint scheme and interior design. It's unclear whether the provision will remain in the bill by the time it gets to Trump's desk.
Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee voiced concerns about the potential cost of any changes and said they were hesitant to abandon an iconic design that emerged during the tenure of President John F. Kennedy.
Republicans said Democrats were taking a partisan shot at Trump.

Trump Jr. to get involved in Michigan primary
WASHINGTON — President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., signaled Thursday that he plans to campaign for a primary challenger to Justin Amash of Michigan, the sole Republican congressman who has called for the president's impeachment.
"See you soon Justin," Trump Jr. said in a morning tweet. "I hear Michigan is beautiful during primary season."
Attached to his tweet were poll results showing Amash trailing Jim Lower, a state lawmaker who announced last month that he would mount a primary challenge to Amash in Michigan's Third Congressional District.
Trump Jr.'s tweet fueled speculation that the president would also become actively involved in trying to topple Amash.
Amash became a pariah among fellow House Republicans after declaring last month that President Trump had engaged in "impeachable conduct" that was detailed in the report of now-former special counsel Robert Mueller.
Roughly 60 Democrats have called for launching impeachment proceedings against Trump, with most pointing to episodes of possible obstruction of Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.
At a recent town hall meeting in Grand Rapids, Mich., Amash said Congress "has a duty to keep the president in check."
"I'd do it whether it was a Republican president or a Democratic president," he said. "It doesn't matter. You elected me to represent all of you."
Amash responded later Thursday to Trump Jr.'s vow to visit during primary season, writing on Twitter: "if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer."
That was a reference to Trump Jr.'s role in setting up a meeting in Trump Tower with Russians purportedly to receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Hawley cautions against actions of China

Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley believes the federal government has taken seriously the lessons of 2016 and the threats to election security next year.
Interference three years ago came from Russia, but the Missouri Republican thinks another nation has nefarious, and broader, plans of its own: China.
“I’m worried about how they might try to interfere with the workings of the country,” Hawley said in an interview with News-Press NOW.
Election security became a topic in Washington following the 2016 general elections, crystallized more recently by the release of the Mueller report on Russian interference.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the full chamber would have a briefing about the state of election security.
Hawley said he has been involved in such briefings as a member of the Armed Services and Homeland Security committees.
“I think the Department of Defense and other agencies are taking this really seriously,” the Missourian said. “We do need to protect the integrity of our elections as well as the integrity of our technology and our information and our data.”
He added then, “I’m most concerned about China, across the board, on these issues.”
China, the senator said, has stolen American jobs and technology, and it has built its military “on the backs of our middle class.” Hawley said the United States needs to stand up to these acts.
“I’m worried about what they’re doing with their military and worried about how they’re trying to steal our technology and trying to get our own personal information to find ways into that,” he said.
On the personal data front, Hawley detailed his recently introduced legislation aimed at preventing video-hosting websites from recommending content that features children.
His Protecting Children from Online Predators Act came in the aftermath of a report by The New York Times that indicated YouTube algorithms could direct videos of young people to pedophiles.
“That’s what this algorithm is doing. It tracks people who view videos of children, and it recommends more videos featuring children to those same people,” Hawley said. “YouTube says that it has the technology just to take those child videos out of its auto-recommendation process. ... The only reason they’re not doing it is they want to make money on it.”

FIFA must help developing programs

Texto completo: REIMS, France – The U.S. women's 13-0 rout of Thailand was a debacle.
FIFA, and the Thai federation, should be ashamed.
Never before has the women's game been so competitive, with six or seven teams able to make a legitimate claim at winning this World Cup title. Ten of the first 14 games were decided by two goals or fewer.
Yet the gap between the haves and the have-nots remains glaring, and there seems to be little incentive from the sport's power brokers to change that.
Oh, they'll talk a good game. Before the World Cup began last week, FIFA president Gianni Infantino crowed about the money FIFA is investing in the women's game:
$500 million!
When you read the fine print, however, you see that that money will be spread over four years. Between the senior level and youth programs. To support coaches, referees, leaderships and clubs. Do the math, and it's actually a pittance for an organization that had revenue of $6.4 billion from 2015 to 2018.
And if FIFA doesn't care, then why should the federations, particularly those in countries that don't exactly prize women's sports?
"I think expanding the last World Cup to 24 teams was great. Soon enough, I hope we expand to 32 and keep it at that number," Alex Morgan said Tuesday night, after tying Michelle Akers' World Cup record with five goals against Thailand.
"I hope that will incentivize federations to put more efforts into their women's programs," she added. "And I hope we continue to see the development of women's programs within their respective federations around the world."
This has to be more than wishful thinking, though.
While no one expected Thailand to beat the Americans -- the U.S. women are the No. 1-ranked team in the world and defending World Cup champions while Thailand is No. 34 -- it should not be too much to ask for, if not a competitive then at least a respectable game.
The 13-0 drubbing was as far from that as it gets.
Besides the lopsided score, the USA had a 75-25 edge in possession. The Americans took 39 shots compared with Thailand's two and had 10 corner kicks while Thailand had none.
"Playing the United States is not easy, and we know that we have to improve in every aspect and improve in our mentality. We know that all the players' experience cannot be compared with them," Thailand coach Nuengrutai Srathongvian said.
"We have limited resources in terms of the players and the selection," Srathongvian said. "We have a limited number of players available. And we are small in the build. We have to improve in this aspect."
But they cannot do it on their own.
Developing programs like Thailand will go nowhere without investment in training facilities, coaching and youth programs. They also need to play exhibitions against better competition, both to raise the level of their game and see up close what they're aspiring to become. In some countries, changing the public's perception is as important as increased funding.
When The New York Times asked players on each World Cup team what sacrifices they've had to make, some of the answers were heartbreaking.
"I would throw my shorts and (cleats) out of the window so that my mom musn't see that I was going to play," one woman wrote.
"Running away from home to another state just to pursue my dream by playing soccer," wrote another.
Public support from federation officials, and high-profile male players, can go a long way in changing the narrative for a women's team.
Lastly, there needs to be a lasting commitment to grow the women's game. It's not enough to invest and support a team in the months leading up to the World Cup, only to ignore it the moment the tournament ends. Building a program is a process, a long one, and fledgling teams will never go anywhere if they're always starting over.
Thailand qualified for the 2015 World Cup and missed making the knockout rounds only because of goal differential. Yet it played only 55 games between that tournament and this one, and once went nine months without a game.
The U.S. women, meanwhile, have played 80 games since winning the title in 2015.
"That's part of growing the pool and growing the game," Megan Rapinoe said of what, if anything, Thailand could take out of the lopsided game. "They'll improve from here on out."
It's on FIFA and the Thai federation to make sure it does.

Mindy Kaling won't talk about daughter's father, but opens up on finding her maternal instinct

Texto completo: Mindy Kaling welcomed her daughter, Katherine, over a year ago and there's still no word on who the father is — and that's how she's going to keep it for now.
In an interview with New York Times, the comedian explained her decision.
"My feeling is that until I speak to my daughter about that, I’m not going to talk to anyone else about it," Kaling told the publication.
The 39-year-old actress is also balancing being a mother and working just fine. Her love for her work will never change, she said, but now that she's a parent, the type of work she does has slightly adjusted.
"When I did the first season of “The Mindy Project” at Hulu, they were like, 'You could do as many episodes in a season as you want. ' And I was like, 'Can we do the maximum?' But waking up at 5 o’clock in the morning to do 26 episodes of TV is not something that I’m going to do again," she said. "Right now I’m surprised at how much I enjoy being a mom. "
Motherhood is different
Her surprise stems from what she thought was her lack of maternal instinct. She said she's a naturally impatient person and didn't know how that impatience would pan out with a child.
"But they don’t tell you that the thing will look so much like you, and do things that are so sweet and adorable, that you’ll naturally not have the same impatience that you would have with a stranger or someone who works for you," she said.
'I don't think anyone is ever ready'
Though Kaling has never revealed who her child’s father is, she did open up to USA TODAY about deciding to become a mom.
“I wasn’t ready. I don’t think anyone is ever ready. I definitely knew I wanted kids, but the decision, it was not something that I had, like, planned,” she said.
Mornings with Katherine start with a sweet dose of swing time in the backyard. “We have such a small family, it’s just the two of us, but I take her with me everywhere whenever I travel,” she said.
As someone who says she didn't see herself as maternal, "I have been really surprised by how much I crave time with her. Just that there was a side of me that could really enjoy being around the baby. "
And they're two peas in a pod. "It helps that she was, like, identical to me,” she smiles. “And is really funny. ”

Texto completo: U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are in bed with each other, and not just as husband and wife.
New revelations of official coziness are a huge problem for Chao, whose leadership of the infrastructure-building agency was already on a shaky foundation. Unless she can explain a slew of suspect decisions, and do it quick, she must step down.
Monday, Politico reported that Chao designated a dedicated liaison to help Kentucky and only Kentucky - the state represented by her powerful spouse - with infrastructure grants.
Not California, with more people and needs than anyplace else. Not New York, the economic capital, with aging tunnels and bridges. Just the Bluegrass State.
So just as McConnell was gearing up for reelection, Kentucky won nearly $80 million in approved grants, including a highway-improvement project that had been previously rejected twice. Convenient.
This obscene use of political power puts in sharp focus other curious episodes during Chao's tenure.
The New York Times reported that in a 2017 proposed trip to China, Chao - whose family runs an American shipping company with extensive business in China - attempted to have Beijing Embassy staff coordinate travel for at least one family member and have other relatives sit in on meetings with Chinese government officials.
Last month, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Chao made $40,000 profiting from sale of stock in the country's largest construction materials supplier - stock she had promised to divest from a year ago.
At this point, we're too exhausted to muster much surprise at the discovery of this type of behavior in the Trump Cabinet. But we're not tired enough to take it laying down.

Texto completo: The earnest improvers at the College Board, which administers the Scholastic Aptitude Test, should ponder Abraham Maslow's law of the instrument. In 1966, Maslow, a psychologist, said essentially this: If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The College Board wants to solve a complex social problem that it and its test are unsuited to solve.
The College Board has embraced a dubious idea that might have the beneficial effect of prompting college admissions officers to think of better ideas for broadening their pool of applicants. The idea is to add to the scores of some test-takers an "environmental context" bonus. Strangely, board president David Coleman told the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger that this is not, as the media has named it, an "adversity index." But it is: It purports to measure 15 factors (e.g., poverty or food-stamp eligibility, crime rates, disorderly schools, broken families, families with education deficits, etc.) where these test-takers are situated. Coleman more convincingly says to The New York Times: "This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they've been given."
Perhaps the board's evident discomfort with the label "adversity score" is because their more benign-sounding "environmental context" gives a social-science patina to the obverse of a category (and political accusation) currently in vogue, that of "privilege." By whatever name, however, the SAT's new metric is another step down the path of identity politics, assigning applicants to groups and categories, and another step away from evaluating individuals individually. But if the adversity metric becomes a substitute for schools emphasizing race, this will be an improvement on explicit racial categories that become implicit quotas.
The SAT was created partly to solve the problem of inequitable standards in college admissions. They too often rewarded nonacademic attributes (e.g., "legacies" -- the children of alumni). And they facilitated the intergenerational transmission of inherited privileges. Most importantly, they were used to disfavor certain groups, particularly Jews.
By making an objective -- meaning standardized -- test one component of schools' assessments of applicants, it advanced the American ideal of a meritocracy open to all talents. However, it has always been the schools' prerogative to decide the importance of the SAT component relative to others. And as "diversity" (understood in various ways) becomes an increasing preoccupation of schools, the SAT becomes decreasingly important.
Any adversity index derived from this or that social "context," however refined, will be an extremely crude instrument for measuring -- guessing, actually -- the academic prospects of individuals in those contexts. It might, however, be a good gauge of character. Physicists speak of the "escape velocity" of particles circling in an orbit. Perhaps the adversity index can indicate individuals who, by their resilience, have achieved velocity out of challenging social environments.
But the SAT is a flimsy tool for shaping the world of social inertia. Articulate, confident parents from the professions will transmit cultural advantages to their children, advantages that, as the SAT will record them, are apt to dwarf "adversity" bonuses. As Andrew Ferguson, author of the grimly hilarious "Crazy U: One Dad's Crash Course in Getting His Kid into College," says, America's least diverse classes are SAT prep classes.
The Chicago Tribune warns, plausibly, that the "secret-sauce" of the SAT's adversity score -- schools will know it, applicants will not -- will "breed more public mistrust" of colleges' admissions processes. But calling, as the Tribune does, for more "transparency" implies that the more admissions' criteria are made public, the better. However, private deliberations and criteria about applicants protect the applicants' privacy interests. Furthermore, asserting a public interest in maximum transparency encourages government supervision of -- and the inevitable shrinking of -- schools' discretion in shaping their student bodies, and ensuring that some cohorts are not largely excluded.
Unquestionably, such discretion often is employed in unsavory ways to serve academia's fluctuating "diversity" obsessions, some of which contravene common understandings of equity and perhaps civil rights laws and norms. Soon a Boston court will render a decision, probably destined for Supreme Court review, in the case concerning Harvard's "holistic" metrics, beyond "objective" ones (secondary school transcripts, standardized tests), for -- it is alleged -- the purpose of restricting the admission of Asian Americans. They, like the Jews whose academic proficiency was a "problem" eight decades ago, often come from family cultures that stress academic attainments.
Caution, however, is in order. Further breaking higher education to the saddle of the state is an imprudent (and, which is much the same thing, unconservative) objective.

Online higher education catching on in Africa

Texto completo: Everywhere is a classroom for Emily Kamizi, even the buses in Lusaka, Zambia's congested capital. It can take an hour or more to cross the city, so Kamizi puts on her headphones, turns up Taylor Swift and concentrates on her MBA studies.
Kamizi, 25, is a student at Unicaf University, an African institution founded in 2012 with programs in fields like business, education and health care management. Offering degrees largely online, with some blended learning options, Unicaf reaches 18,000 students across the continent, many of them working adults.
Unicaf offers the convenience of anytime, anywhere study - as long as the internet service is sufficient. The cost of a degree, about $4,000, is not cheap by African standards, but it is within reach of the region's growing middle class, and many students receive scholarships. Kamizi, a former safety worker in a mine, got a full ride after she won a Unicaf-sponsored business competition with an idea for manufacturing low-cost sanitary napkins.
As U.S. colleges rush to recruit in China or to build campuses in Singapore, Africa may have the most important higher education story. Of the continent's 1.2 billion people, 60% are under 25, and thanks to a broad campaign over the last several decades to improve elementary and secondary school participation rates, the number of high school graduates is higher than ever.
What's more, as the economy diversifies, there is increasing demand for a more highly skilled workforce.
The region's universities, however, are not keeping pace. Less than 10% of college-age students in sub-Saharan Africa are enrolled in higher education, according to the World Bank. By contrast, in the wealthy member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the share is closer to 80%.
Africa's longstanding public universities have wrestled with the pressure to expand capacity without sacrificing quality, and not always successfully, said Jamil Salmi, a higher education consultant and former World Bank official from Morocco. Such universities have grown up, but they vary in caliber and can be costly. Going abroad to study is an option for only a select few.
"All of these efforts on their own are not adequate," said Peter Okebukola, president of the Global University Network for Innovation in Lagos, Nigeria, who has been involved with several efforts to expand online, or distance, education across Africa. "To improve access in Africa will require a multiplicity of ways."
Could one of those be a pan-African, Cyprus-based, mostly online university? Nicos Nicolaou, Unicaf's founder, said he believes so, despite issues with internet access across Africa. The university gives every student a tablet, and course materials can be downloaded and accessed offline. Power failures, however, are common, and dependable internet is far from guaranteed.
But Nicolaou remains positive. He was born in northern Cyprus, and like many Cypriots, he studied overseas. Returning home, he wanted to play a part in rebuilding the country's education system, which had been disrupted by civil war. A private college he helped start became the University of Nicosia. It was working there that first took him to Africa in 1989.
Initially, Unicaf was essentially a distance-learning platform, taking courses offered by British and American universities, translating them to an online environment and marketing them to Africans. Partner institutions set admissions standards, approve hiring and determine whether students meet graduation requirements.
Ariane Schauer is provost of Marymount California University, a small Catholic college outside Los Angeles. "It was very aligned with our mission of serving the underserved," Schauer said of the decision to offer an MBA through Unicaf.
Under a new president, Marymount has ended the relationship to concentrate on the home campus, but Schauer said the university, which awarded 150 degrees to African students over six years, was pleased with the partnership.
For universities it pairs with, Unicaf - which takes a share of tuition revenues, typically 20% to 35% - provides an entrance into a new market with reduced risk. But its financial model, which rests on volume, is not always an easy fit for Western universities. A $60,000 MBA program, which is commonplace in the United States, costs four years' average salary in Nigeria, one of Africa's wealthiest countries.
For some students, however, the ability to get an international degree is central to Unicaf's appeal.
When Margaret Simbunji first saw an ad for Unicaf on Facebook, she was suspicious - "I Googled it for about two months to make sure it wasn't a hoax," said Simbunji, who goes by Maggie - but its connection with the University of South Wales, in Britain, allayed her concerns.
Getting an MBA helped her earn a promotion as a bank auditor in Zambia. Eventually, she would like to work for the United Nations, and she says she believes a foreign degree will give her more credibility.
While Nicolaou is in talks with several more potential British partners, Unicaf is moving toward offering more of its own degrees, accredited by African national regulatory bodies. It already is recognized to offer degrees in Malawi and Zambia and hopes to soon add Rwanda and Zimbabwe, says Jonathan Kydd, a former dean of international programs at the University of London who advises the Unicaf board.
Kydd, a development economist who spent much of his career in Africa, says it is important that a degree have practical value in the local labor market. "A student in Africa doesn't need a degree from the American Ivy League to get the kind of job he wants," he said.
After focusing on graduate programs, Unicaf also plans more undergraduate degrees. Bachelor's programs are now offered only in Malawi and Zambia, where Unicaf has bricks-and-mortar campuses. (It has an additional nine learning centers, where students can access support services.)
Kamizi, the Zambian student, says she can get most of the help she needs online. Tutors are available around the clock when she stumbles over course-work and for advice on time management or study skills. Unicaf says it closely monitors students' online behavior, noting if they are not logging in or completing course assignments on time and intervening.
Still, Kamizi travels across Lusaka at least weekly to the modern Unicaf campus, which has a library and an amphitheater for speakers at public events. But for her, its biggest attraction is its reliable Wi-Fi.
Skepticism about online education remains, says Okebukola, who is also chairman of the council at the Open University of Nigeria. If Unicaf degrees earn regulatory approval in more African countries that will help, but many Africans see distance learning as "second grade," he says. Online providers need to prove their value in the job market, he says. "The test of the pudding is in the eating."
By 2023, Nicolaou hopes Unicaf will enroll 100,000 students. That sort of increase in a few short years may sound crazy, he acknowledged to an outsider. "But when I talk with people I know in Africa," he said, "they think 100,000 is a pessimistic target. That's because the need is in the millions."

Texto completo: Mientras era trasladado a un hospital en Santo Domingo, República Dominicana , el expelotero de los Medias Rojas, David Ortiz, pidió que no lo dejaran morir.
“Por favor, no me dejen morir. Soy un buen hombre”, clamó el apodado “Big Papi” a personal médico en plena sala de emergencias luego de haber sido baleado por la espalda en el club Dial el domingo.
Uno de los doctores que atendió a la leyenda de las Grandes Ligas en la clínica ofreció el detalle, según citado por el New York Times.
El reporte del NYT también destaca que la noche del incidente, Ortiz no pensaba salir. Sin embargo, decidió acudir al lugar a raíz de una llamada de Jhoel López, un animador de televisión en Dominicana. López también resultó herido, pero se encuentra estable.
“Simplemente salimos y seguimos nuestro camino”, dijo, por su parte, Eloy, hermano de Ortiz. “Esto no hace sentido”, agregó.
El expelotero había viajado a RD para promover una marca de cigarillos y para realizar labores con una fundación para suministar equipo deportivo a niños.
Adicional, el dominicano aprovechó la visita para entrenar con su hijo D’Angelo, de 15 años, quien quiere seguir los pasos de su padre a las Grandes Ligas.
La esposa de Ortiz, Tiffany dijo, en un comunicado de prensa este martes, que su pareja salió bien de la segunda cirugía que se le realizó.
“David llegó al Hospital General de Massachusetts anoche y se sometió a una segunda cirugía exitosa. Está estable, despierto y descansando cómodamente en la UCI, donde se espera que permanezca durante los próximos días”, lee el parte de prensa.
El dominicano fue trasladado desde RD a Boston, hogar del equipo que representó, este lunes para continuar su tratamiento.
La mujer que procreó tres hijos con Ortiz, además, pidió privacidad hasta tanto Big Papi se recupere totalmente.
Reportes extraoficiales que circulan desde este lunes en medios locales e internacionales apuntan a que un narco habría mandado a matar al expelotero por mantener una relación extramarital con su esposa.
Las autoridades aún no han establecido el móvil del crimen.

Texto completo: The New York Times announced on Monday that it would no longer publish daily political cartoons in its international edition and ended its relationship with two contract cartoonists.
Two months earlier, The Times had stopped running syndicated political cartoons, after one with anti-Semitic imagery was printed in the Opinion section of the international edition.
In a statement, James Bennet, editorial page editor, said The Times was "very grateful for and proud of" the work that the cartoonists, Patrick Chappatte and Heng Kim Song, had done for the international edition over the years.
"However," Mr. Bennet added, "for well over a year we have been considering bringing that edition into line with the domestic paper by ending daily political cartoons and will do so beginning July 1."
Mr. Chappatte wrote on his website on Monday that after more than two decades of contributing a twice-weekly cartoon, "I'm putting down my pen, with a sigh: that's a lot of years of work undone by a single cartoon -- not even mine -- that should never have run in the best newspaper in the world."
The syndicated cartoon that prompted the most outrage was a caricature of Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald J. Trump.
The Times issued an apology, saying the cartoon was "clearly anti-Semitic and indefensible." One of The Times's Op-Ed columnists, Bret Stephens, denounced the cartoon and wrote that The Times should "reflect deeply on how it came to publish anti-Semitic propaganda."
In his statement, Mr. Bennet said The Times would "continue investing in forms of opinion journalism, including visual journalism, that express nuance, complexity and strong voice from a diversity of viewpoints."
He noted that last year, for the first time in its history, The Times won a Pulitzer Prize for political cartooning -- a series that told the story of a Syrian refugee family.

Who is a journalist? Don't let the government decide

Texto completo: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's indictment under the Espionage Act is so controversial that at least two of his prosecutors argued against the decision to indict. Significantly, we know this because it was leaked to news media.
Leaks to the media are as much of a Washington routine as the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival. So are internal debates between members of the same prosecution team.
But the Assange dispute is a higher-stakes argument than most. He is the first publisher in any medium to face criminal prosecution under the 1917 Espionage Act for publishing classified information, even though newspapers have routinely published government secrets that have been leaked to them, including some by WikiLeaks.
In this case, an enormous trove of classified documents was provided to WikiLeaks in 2010 by Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst who later went to prison for the leaks.
Until now, the Espionage Act has been used to prosecute spies and employees with classified clearances who violated their oath by leaking to the press. But federal prosecutors have avoided using it to prosecute journalists for receiving or publishing those leaks.
Contrary to popular belief, they were not doing this simply to be nice to the media. Although judges have sent to jail for contempt some reporters who refused to reveal their sources, prosecution under the Espionage Act raises the ante by treating journalists the same as spies. In other words, prosecutors could be stepping over the line into the criminalization of journalism, a direct violation of what most of us consider to be a First Amendment right.
I say "most of us" because this argument has never been fully tested in the courts. As one legal scholar, Steve Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor and specialist in national security law, said in a 2017 interview with Just Security, "the statute is old and ambiguous," produced in the political heat of World War I Washington "and not drafted with the kind of specificity that usually characterizes speech-restricting statutes that survive constitutional challenge."
In his 2010 testimony about WikiLeaks before the House Judiciary Committee, Vladeck suggested that the law should be fine-tuned, for example, to limit prosecutions to those who specifically intend their disclosure to harm national security or benefit a foreign power.
But under existing law, President Donald Trump's Justice Department has gone where President Barack Obama and Eric Holder, his attorney general, decided after long consideration and internal debate to avoid.
And Obama and Holder, let us not forget, were no softies in pursuing leaks. Obama's Justice Department subpoenaed the phone records of AP journalists. They went after Fox News reporter James Rosen, naming him as a "co-conspirator" in a leak about North Korea's nuclear program. They picked up where the George W. Bush administration left off in pursuing The New York Times' James Risen's source in the espionage case of former CIA employee Jeffrey Sterling.
But the Obama administration pulled back in his second term after Holder held meetings with press freedom organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, of which I'm a board member.
Holder assured us at the time that he had no intention to lock up journalists. The Trump administration appears to be leaning in the other direction in the Assange case. "The department takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy," John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, told reporters when he announced the indictment May 23. "But Julian Assange is no journalist. This is made plain by the totality of his conduct as alleged in the indictment."
But who is to decide these days who's a journalist and who isn't? Demers, like many others, judges Assange's "conduct" to be unbecoming of a good journalist. It might not be his intention, but do we want government officials to tell us who is and isn't a journalist, as they do in countries that license journalists?
Having participated in numerous discussions on this topic since the rise of the internet age in the 1990s, I hear the question of who's a journalist in the same way that a Supreme Court justice defined obscenity: I know it when I see it. I see Assange as a journalist, although an often disturbingly and even dangerously freewheeling example of the breed.
If the Trump administration continues its pursuit of the Australia-born Assange under a law intended to capture and punish spies, it could ultimately set a dangerous precedent to be settled by the Supreme Court, where the outcome would be unpredictable. And prosecutors similarly should be concerned about pitting press freedom against government accountability in a bruising constitutional battle.
Assange might fall way short of being a model journalist, but pursuing him as a spy only makes bad matters worse.

In our opinion: A border security deal with Mexico is good, but confusion is not

Texto completo: Time will be the ultimate judge of whether President Donald Trump succeeded in crafting an effective new deal with Mexico over border security, or whether a confusing set of claims and counterclaims over the weekend were more bluster than substance.
If, in a few months, the crush of immigrants and asylum-seekers eases, the details of who did what, and when, won’t matter as much. If the crush continues, border politics is likely to continue in Washington, just as nasty as ever, and threats of tariffs likely will return.
But in the meantime, confusion seems to abound.
What exactly did the president extract from Mexico that caused him to back away, at seemingly the last possible moment, from imposing tariffs? Trump, using Twitter, referred to a “fully signed and documented” deal with Mexico that gives the U.S. things for which it has been asking for years. This, he said, would “be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico’s legislative body.”
But The New York Times reported over the weekend that the deal provides little more than terms to which Mexico already had agreed, or which had been under discussion long before the threat of tariffs. Then on Monday, Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, held a news conference to say there is no secret or soon-to-be revealed agreement. Both sides had agreed to monitor the border to see whether the flow of migrants is reduced. If improvement doesn’t come within a specified time limit, they will discuss more aggressive measures, including a regional approach to asylum.
This agreement to revisit the situation may have been what the president was referring to, officials told the Times. Or perhaps not — no one seems certain. We hope further details come soon.
The danger in this nebulous and uncertain narrative is that the president is claiming victory for the weaponization of tariffs. By threatening to impose 5 percent tariffs on Mexico that would rise monthly unless a border agreement is reached, then pulling back after declaring victory, he has signaled a desire to use similar threats to resolve other international problems.
We have reluctantly supported the president’s trade dispute with China, realizing that, despite how much trade has helped businesses here prosper, the Chinese are demanding too much from American concerns in exchange for the right to access their markets.
Mexico, however, is another matter. Tariffs are unrelated to immigration and asylum issues. In addition, the threat of tariffs seemed to violate the newly crafted U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. If it didn’t violate this, it certainly did inject an element of uncertainty. Mexican officials may be wondering about the validity of the terms of that agreement, or whether they will face further trade-threatening broadsides from the president as other problems manifest themselves.
That agreement still requires congressional action. The tariff threat appeared to be a bigger problem among Republicans than Democrats in that regard, but perhaps only because Democrats were skeptical from the beginning.
Amid all this confusion, one thing may be said with certainty. Mexico is an important trade partner with the United States. Many American companies have supply chain agreements with companies south of the border or operate their own plants in Mexico.
Disrupting this partnership would hurt both sides. With that in mind, it’s a good thing the threat of tariffs disappeared over the weekend, regardless of the details. It’s a bad thing, however, if it means tariffs now are locked, loaded and ready to use in other disputes.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back Monday against criticism of the Trump administration's immigration deal with Mexico, calling it a "significant win" for the U. S. He disputed reports that Mexico had already agreed to most of the provisions months ago, before last week's frenzied negotiations.
Pompeo also repeated President Donald Trump's claim that there are other undisclosed elements of the agreement, but he declined to provide any specifics.
"There were a number of commitments made. I can’t go into them in detail here," Pompeo told reporters in a hastily announced news conference Monday.
Mexico's foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said on Monday that there were no additional elements of the agreement.
Asked specifically about Trump's assertion that Mexico had agreed to buy more U. S. agricultural products, Ebrard responded: “There is no agreement of any kind that hasn’t been made known. Everything I am saying was made known Friday. "
In that 468-word deal announced Friday, Mexico agreed to increase security along its southern border with Guatemala, where many Central Americans are crossing into Mexico on their way to the U. S. Pompeo said Mexican officials promised to send 6,000 National Guard troops to stop those crossings, the largest such deployment.
Mexico also agreed to expand a U. S. policy in which migrants seeking asylum in the U. S. will be sent back to Mexico to wait for their claims to be adjudicated, a process that can take months.
"I’ve seen some reporting that says that these countless hours were nothing, that they amounted to a waste of time," Pompeo said in remarks at the State Department.
The New York Times reported Saturday that Mexico had already agreed to most of the provisions outlined in Friday's deal during previous rounds of negotiations. The news organization said, for example, that Mexico promised in December to let the U. S. deport more asylum-seekers back to Mexico until their asylum claims were adjudicated.
Pompeo sharply rejected that report.
"The scale, the effort, the commitment here is very different from what we were able to achieve back in December," he said. Friday's deal "wouldn’t have happened" if Trump hadn't threatened to impose an escalating series of tariffs on all Mexican imports, he said.
Trump said on May 30 that he would impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods, starting June 10, unless the Mexican government stopped the flow of migrants to the U. S. border. Trump said he would increase those levies 5 percentage points each month, until they hit 25%.
"It’s what prompted this series of conversations," Pompeo said of Trump's tariff threat.
Critics have said Trump created a crisis with the threatened tariffs and then "solved" it by signing off on a relatively modest agreement.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York called the deal “nothing more than warmed up leftovers. ”
“The president claims a bogus agreement with Mexico, which contains policies that Mexico volunteered to do months ago,” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Monday.
But Pompeo said Friday's deal was "diplomacy at its finest. "
He said the U. S. had been sending about 200 asylum-seeks a day back to Mexico and under the new deal, the U. S. could send back "thousands" every day.
"We now have the capacity to do this full throttle … in a way that will make a fundamental difference in the calculus" for migrants hoping to come to the U. S. , he said.
The Trump administration had initially demanded that Mexico agree to be designated as a safe third-party country, which would have meant accepting asylum applications from thousands of Central American migrants.
Ebrard said Mexico rejected that. He did say the U. S. would re-evaluate the migration situation after 45 days, and they might hold broader talks with other countries to negotiate asylum policies across the region.

Texto completo: Executives in cosmetic, technology and media industries are standing up for reproductive health care as a mounting list of states moves to ban abortion.
Nearly 200 CEOs signed a letter opposing laws that restrict access to abortion saying they are "bad for business. "
The letter appeared Monday as a full-page ad in the New York Times with the title "Don't Ban Equality. "
Among the companies represented in the letter were Yelp, H &M, M∙A∙C Cosmetics, Ben & Jerry’s Homemade, Inc, and Bloomberg L. P.
"Restricting access to comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion, threatens the health, independence and goes against our values and is bad for business," the letter says. "It impairs our ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent across the states and protect the well-being of all the people who keep our businesses thriving day in and out. "
The executives said together that they represented more than 108,000 workers.
The letter was spearheaded by abortion-rights advocates Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights. The groups say they are welcoming more CEOs and business leaders to sign the letter online.
The support from executives comes after dozens of Hollywood celebrities vowed to boycott Georgia after it passed a six-week ban on abortion. Netflix, Disney and WarnerMedia have also said they would stop filming in Georgia if the law goes into effect next year.
In recent months, several states have passed some of the most restrictive abortion bans the nation has seen since the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.
Louisiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Mississippi joined Georgia in enacting laws that ban abortion after six weeks, or when a fetal heartbeat is detected.
Alabama enacted a near total-ban on abortions this year; there are no exceptions for rape or incest.
Last month, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill that outlaws abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy without exceptions for cases of rape or incest.
State officials there have also refused to renew the license for Missouri's only abortion clinic, Planned Parenthood in St. Louis. A judge issued a temporary stay to keep the clinic open as the issue is battled in court.

Texto completo: With celebrity journalism, negotiating access can be akin to playing tug of war. The profile might be pegged to a celebrity's new project, whether a film, album or some sort of charitable undertaking. In such a case, his or her team might grant access on the basis of that project being the article's central focus. The journalist, however, might prefer to use the project as a jumping-off point to examine the celebrity's contributions to society. As when writing about any subject wielding a great deal of power - social influence, in this case - the journalist's ultimate goal is to paint a fair and accurate portrait.
Sometimes that means including details the celebrity might consider unflattering or too personal, but which the journalist deems vital to a truthful and meaningful story. That last bit is where there can be a disconnect between the two points of view, most recently highlighted by one of the most influential pop stars in American history.
In a lengthy Instagram post Thursday morning, Madonna expressed how upset she was by a New York Times Magazine cover story titled "Madonna at Sixty," published days before the release of her upcoming album, "Madame X." She wrote that the piece, which centers on how she has navigated the pop-music world she helped shape years ago, fixates on her age and "makes me feel raped." (She also uses this analogy in the story, after which writer Vanessa Grigoriadis wonders whether to tell her that "women these days were trying not to use that word metaphorically." On Instagram, Madonna stated that, as a rape survivor, she is "allowed to use that analogy.")
"The journalist who wrote this article spent days and hours and months with me and was invited into a world which many people dont get to see, but chose to focus on trivial and superficial matters such as the ethnicity of my stand in or the fabric of my curtains and never ending comments about my age which would never have been mentioned had I been a MAN!" Madonna wrote. She then proclaimed "DEATH TO THE PATRIARCHY" and vowed to "never stop fighting to eradicate it."
Grigoriadis does remark quite a bit upon Madonna's age, such as in a portion of the piece about how the singer has handled getting older: "I admired her for shaking off prejudice about what an older woman could be, for being creative, provocative and sexual over 60 - 'It's almost like a crime,' was the way she characterized it," Grigoriadis wrote. "She might have been doing all this for the younger generation, so that when Miley Cyrus was 60, no one would bat an eyelash if she twerked on stage."
Most readers would expect such musings after coming across the headline "Madonna at Sixty," which, of course, Madonna had no way of anticipating. Even after facing that line of questioning, it seems as though she had expected the profile to focus more on the music - which it still does - than on how aging has shaped that music and her attitude toward it.
Madonna is far from the first celebrity to publicly express disapproval of how an interview turned out. While some have done so during the conversation - the Times last year published "Bradley Cooper Is Not Really Into This Profile," in which he declines to discuss his personal life in favor of focusing on his seemingly personal directorial debut, "A Star Is Born" - others have increasingly taken the Madonna route of airing out their grievances on social media.
Last fall, Selena Gomez, then the most-followed person on Instagram, posted several photos of herself in clothing from her collaboration with Coach. In the caption, she acknowledged that interviews are "a part of my work within an industry that's been around longer than all of us have been" but went on to say that she was "a bit bummed" by how she was portrayed in a Elle magazine profile written by Mickey Rapkin and titled "Selena Breaks Her Silence."
"Speaking from my heart for over an hour to someone who puts those thoughts into paid words can be hard for me," Gomez wrote. She had intended for the piece to focus on her work with the nonprofit A21, her Coach collection and some new music, she continued, implying that she hadn't anticipated Rapkin discussing her romantic history and relationship to the Hillsong Church.
Stars of this caliber might shy away from press in an effort to control their public narrative. Some have even just started to interview each other (which close friends Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone did the previous month in a piece published, interestingly enough, by Elle magazine). Such instances have led many to reevaluate the relationship between journalists and celebrities. In September, New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica declared the death of the celebrity profile.
Radhika Jones, editor of Vanity Fair, reflected on this subject in an October episode of the podcast "Recode Media." She acknowledged that the magazine, which is known for its glamorous photo shoots and profiles, helped create the celebrity-industrial complex. But, she said, journalists also have a responsibility to "hold that world to account. There are just all of these truisms about Hollywood that I don't think are actually true anymore, or at the very least, they bear interrogation."
"At a certain point, when certain kinds of stories in our current moment, one has to ask oneself whether the access is helpful to the story or hurts the story," Jones continued, adding that "access isn't the be-all and end-all of journalism about Hollywood anymore."
Going along with a celebrity's vision might ensure a look "into a world which many people dont get to see," as Madonna put it. But there's always the question of how authentic that world might be.

Texto completo: Whenever Edward Albee was asked what a play of his was about, he would unfailingly answer, "about two hours." Who knew that the Grand Man of American Drama was fond of "Dad jokes"?
Despite Albee's mischievous reply, though, it is a really good question for young directors to ask themselves: What is this play about?
If you cannot describe it in 10 words or less, you may not have a handle on the material.
Albee's quip came to mind during the opening night performance of Laura Alcantara's production of "The Taming of the Shrew" at the Station Theatre in Urbana. The Celebration Company signals that the production will be different from your grandparents' "Shrew" on its poster, which reads "by William Shakespeare . . . (kind of)."
In this era of #MeToo and #TimesUp, staging Shakespeare's famous play about the "war between the sexes" can be artistically risky. "Shrew" has been a challenge in recent decades as theater people tend to be more progressive and avoid retrograde attitudes about gender dynamics.
For many observers, the relationship between Kate and the world at large, never mind her incipient struggle with Petruchio, is an abusive one in which an intelligent, spirited woman is treated as chattel to be transferred from the home of one man to another. Why is it so important that Kate be moved from her father's house? So that her more pliable younger sister, object of the affection of lechers and swains alike, might be available for a similar bargain.
From the earliest moments of the current production, it is clear that a pastiche approach has been taken in design and execution of the director's ideas about "Shrew." Everything is fodder for a quick laugh, many of which, especially in the early moments, are visual.
An odd, clashing design aesthetic keeps the audience at arm's length as we struggle to locate the play's place and time. The program, you may note, sets the play "then, or maybe now." What would someone who has no experience of "Shrew" or its Broadway musical version, "Kiss Me, Kate," understand about the play from this production?
Shakespeare's play has been reshaped, eliminating text that does not get right to the intergender battles, making the Station's production appear as a "greatest hits" version. "Shrew" often runs two and a half to three hours, depending on whether the induction scenes at the beginning are included. Alcantara's production clocks in at an hour and 45 minutes, which includes a 15-minute intermission. (And if transitions between scenes were more smoothly handled, the production could easily shave another five minutes.)
The result is an impressionistic production that gives short shrift to the complex journeys of the characters. Mindy Smith and Mathew Green are well matched as Kate and Petruchio, circling each other like flirtatious predators as they engage in witty banter. But the textual elisions throughout the performance seem to make choppy their development as human beings.
Lincoln Machula gives a reliably humorous portrait of Baptista, the rich father who wants his daughters out of the house. Matt Hester's Gremio, who looks like a gilded refugee from "The Sopranos," amuses with his lecherous antics.
"The Taming of the Shrew" has firmly moved into the "problem play" category for Shakespeare, given its troubling gender politics. Director Alcantara and company have focused on the humor and fun embedded in the play. It will be interesting to see what she does next.
Theatergoers can enjoy dessert and champagne along with "The Taming of the Shrew." This benefit performance supports The Celebration Company at Station Theatre. Tickets are $50 for the 7:30 pm performance June 15. Reservations may be made at 800-838-3006 or online via stationtheatre.com.

Texto completo: The right has no plan for health care
The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty is a right-wing think tank, but in its guest column last Sunday, "How to improve health care now," Will Flanders and Cori Peterson pretended to support neither major party.
The position they advocated for is consistent with the right wing's approach of doing nothing to improve health care access for everyone. They did nothing during eight years with President George W. Bush in charge, and nothing for two years with President Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress. The state did nothing with total control for eight years under Gov. Scott Walker.
They dance to the tune of the health care industry, not the average person. This is also consistent with their position on workers rights. Other than the "right" to not be part of a union, they oppose any worker rights at the workplace. The result is stagnation of wages and benefits for workers over time, while the corporations and major shareholders amass the wealth created by the workers.
Take what they say with a grain of salt because that is all they have to offer.
James Billings, Black Earth
Gas tax costs less than car repairs
Apparently Republican legislators are having a problem with arithmetic when it comes to vehicle maintenance costs.
A report from the American Society of Civil Engineers says Wisconsin's poor roads are costing drivers $637 each year. Yet I heard a report on the radio claiming an 8-cent-per-gallon tax increase would cost an average of about $40 per year per driver.
Huh.
I know it is blasphemy in some corners of this state to suggest a tax hike might be a good thing. But if we can fix the roads and save money doing it, that sounds good to me.
I could use that extra $597. I need some new tires on my car.
Stan Howald, Madison
Be mindful of sex assault victims
It's the season for weddings and bachelor and bachelorette parties. I was reminded of this when I saw an intoxicated young man holding a blow-up doll while at a restaurant recently. Everyone, except the party of young men, was embarrassed or looking away. And rightfully so. In the age of #MeToo, safe spaces and consent, watching a man haul around a plastic woman's body should not be tolerated.
Imagine how victims of sexual assault feel (and many silent ones are out there) who are in pain when they see a body dragged around in a mockingly sexual manner. Since this is still happening in 2019, though, I encourage anyone viewing this to speak up. (Or to poke a hole in said doll when the owner isn't looking.) People cannot simply look away from this. It's not intolerant to be mindful of sexual assault victims. If you own a restaurant or bar, please speak up.
Monica Simpson, Madison
Republicans are scared of science
It was very disturbing to read that the state Legislature did not approve most of the governor's plan for more science positions at the Department of Natural Resources.
It was even more disturbing to learn that Sen. Tom Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, thinks science and climate change are "red flags." At the moment, many Wisconsinites have unsafe drinking water contaminated with PFAS or bacteria. How does he expect to address these problems with divining rods?
Sen. Tiffany does not want to accept the reality of climate change, even though the basic chemistry and physics have been discussed in the scientific literature for decades. Meanwhile, many Wisconsin farmers are behind schedule in planting due to excessive rain.
It probably isn't possible to get Sen. Tiffany out of the Dark Ages. But his colleagues in the Senate should join the rest of us in the 21st century.
Darin Burleigh, Madison
Flying objects should interest us all
It is stunning that the U.S. military now acknowledges that unidentified flying objects exist.
The U.S. Navy now accepts reports on UFOs from naval aviators for analysis and investigations. This is a huge change from the past of not publicly addressing the phenomena.
The Navy isn't speculating on what the objects are or saying they are extraterrestrial. But some of the objects defy our understanding of aerial flight.
This is now being publicly reported by the military, and a U.S. Senate committee is interested. The New York Times, Washington Post, Politico and even Fox News are running reports.
Yet the general public seems to be a sleep at the wheel. Whether these objects are secret craft from the United States, Russia, China or extraterrestrial, that they exist should be of major concern and interest to everyone.

Podcast format suits 'Serial' host Sarah Koenig

Texto completo: After making three seasons of the popular "Serial" podcast, host Sarah Koenig is taking a break from the project while her company, Serial Productions, develops other podcasts.
"We're working on a possible fictionalized thing, and that's very exciting — something I haven't done before," Koenig said during a phone interview in advance of her June 10 appearance at Clowes Hall.
Koenig's investigative reporting made "Serial" a cultural sensation when it debuted in 2014 with a 12-episode look into the murder of Baltimore high school student Hae Min Lee.
The initial series collected a Peabody Award (a first for a podcast), and a second season that focused on the desertion of U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl earned a national Edward R. Murrow Award.
For long-form journalism, Koenig is the leading voice in podcasting. She said her life isn't drastically different than when she worked as a producer on public-radio series "This American Life" — the show that introduced "Serial" to radio listeners.
"At 'This American Life,' it was, 'Oh, you want to try this thing? Give it a whirl. We'll pay for it, and we'll give you as much time as you need,' " Koenig said. "It's not like I felt stifled before and now I have all this freedom. But it is a different level of being your own boss that's exciting."
There's also a level of celebrity that's arrived for Koenig, who was portrayed by Cecily Strong on an episode of "Saturday Night Live."
It's "surreal," Koenig said, to be approached for fan photos.
"Most of the time, I'm invisible," she said. "I'm only getting recognized if I go to a place for that purpose, where people are arriving because they are interested in 'Serial.' "
At Clowes Hall, Koenig will talk about her career as part of the "Listen Up" speaker series presented by WFYI Public Media.
Koenig shared behind-the-scenes details of "Serial" with IndyStar, and she talked about the public-radio legacy she upholds:
Taking risks in Cleveland Koenig said "Serial's" third season, devoted to day-to-day cases at the Justice Center Complex in Cleveland, was somewhat nerve-wracking in its execution.
"You're like, 'I know there are stories in here somewhere. It's my job to find them,' " Koenig said of the season, which debuted last September. "In one sense, it's very freeing and exciting. 'I could do anything!' It's up to me, and nothing is predetermined. On the other hand, it's totally scary. 'I have no idea if this is going to work. And I don't know how long it's going to take me to figure out if it's going to work.' There's no obvious moment of, 'A-ha, I got it.' "
How 'Serial' is made Although Koenig is known for expressing personal thoughts in the context of her reporting, the New York native said "Serial" is built upon recorded interviews that dictate what she says.
"Writing should service the tape, and not the other way around," she said. "I think of it as my writing servicing and making the most of the tape I have."
Koenig said an episode's structure relies on interviews and field recordings.
"The last thing I'm doing is writing," she said. "We're going straight to the tape first. I read the logs of all my tape, then I go in and pull the tape I want. Then cut down those bits to the length and size I want. I'm messing with the tape like that all the way to the last minute."
Finding her voice Koenig credits "This American Life" for providing a "massive leg up" for her podcasting career. "I started with the biggest advantage anyone could have: I had all of 'This American Life' behind me," she said.
Serial Productions is co-owned by Koenig, former "This American Life" senior producer Julie Snyder and "This American Life" host Ira Glass.
Speaking to IndyStar from the Chicago offices of "This American Life," Koenig said her on-air cadence and tone — a semi-informal, first-person narration labeled as "NPR Voice" by The New York Times — is influenced by Glass.
"Everyone here has learned to do radio from Ira Glass," Koenig said. "He sounds a certain way, and he makes stories a certain way. It's undeniable that the product that comes from all of us owes a debt, for good or evil, to that source."

Going Backstage on Broadway

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The idea for "Behind the Curtain," an ambitious special section of The New York Times that chronicles the dressing rooms of Broadway actors from the early 1920s to today, stemmed from a deep dive in the "morgue," the paper's archive.
"It looks eerie, but it's actually the life of The New York Times," said Betsy Horan, a photo and video editor at T: The New York Times Style Magazine, as she wove her way through a subterranean room near The Times's headquarters lined with hundreds of filing cabinets stuffed with photographs and clippings.
When Ms. Horan wrapped up work about famous actors who got their start on Broadway in the early 1980s for T's Fall 2018 issue, she realized how many great stage actors, like Zoe Caldwell and Joel Grey, were photographed in their dressing rooms over the years by The Times. These images captured stars putting on their own makeup, entertaining guests and relaxing during quiet moments before they took the stage.
"I immersed myself in the history of theater, Broadway, and its leading actors and actresses," Ms. Horan said. She spent months sifting through the archives and "getting lost" during the process. "That's the beauty of having some time," she said. "You can come back and do a little more, continue and see where it takes you."
Ms. Horan's research process yielded more than 40 pages of rare backstage images that show actors in intimate and carefree moments, from the plain to the lavish. In today's special section, they're accompanied by reflections from performers and essays by The Times's co-chief theater critic Jesse Green and the actor Harvey Fierstein.
The focus on the dressing room was crucial because the space is where stars spend hours "scraping off their public personas," Mr. Green wrote. "Before they can become someone, they have to become no one."
We see Raul Julia lounging on his couch in his "Nine" dressing room at the 46th Street Theater in 1983, Idina Menzel of "Wicked" covered in green paint and applying mascara at the Gershwin Theater in 2004, and Lin-Manuel Miranda in his dormlike dressing room for "In the Heights" at the Richard Rodgers Theater in 2008.
The cover features a 21-year-old Barbra Streisand putting on eye makeup in the mirror. Her vanity is decorated with a bouquet of flowers and a tray of cosmetics. "Rushing to do my makeup for 'Funny Girl.' I was always a bit late," Ms. Streisand said in an interview.
"I love seeing the people who grew up in the theater, like Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, seeing how young they were and realizing what extraordinary careers they have," said Veronica Chambers, the editor of Past Tense, the archival storytelling unit that contributed to the project.
Ms. Horan collaborated with a team of culture editors and Sara Krulwich, the veteran theater photographer and a 2018 Tony Honors award recipient. Ms. Krulwich photographed six of this season's stars, who were matched with past stars who performed in the same theaters.
A focused Audra McDonald was captured backstage at the Broadhurst Theater for "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," a revival of a 1987 Terrence McNally play. The photograph of Ms. McDonald putting on a wig cap was paired with a picture of Chita Rivera looking overjoyed, clutching her face with her hands as she prepared for "Kiss of the Spider Woman," a 1993 musical.
"It was kismet that they happened to be paired together," Ms. Horan said of the two powerhouse actresses.
Her favorite pairing? Jeff Daniels, of "To Kill a Mockingbird," and Jerry Orbach of the 1968 musical "Promises, Promises."
Mr. Orbach is sandwiched in between the actors Ben Gazzara and George Segal in his dressing room at the Shubert Theater. The photograph is reminiscent of the "Rat Pack," Ms. Horan said, with the three actors smoking cigars and sporting coifed hair.
"It's three great guys about to head to the El Morocco nightclub after the opening of a Broadway play," Ms. Horan said. "They look like they're about to have a lot of fun."
The 1968 photograph is a stark contrast to the image of Mr. Daniels, strumming his guitar in solitude on a worn leather couch, a coffee maker and Emergen-C stashed on the counter above his mini-fridge in the background.
For another pairing, Ms. Krulwich showed Alex Brightman, star of "Beetlejuice" at the Winter Garden Theater, a photograph of Zero Mostel in his dressing room during "Fiddler on the Roof." Mr. Brightman mimicked the pose of Mr. Mostel, whose arms are spread wide with a cigarette in hand. (No cigarette for Mr. Brightman, but plants and liquor line his windowsills.)
Ms. Krulwich was one of the first female photographers to be hired at The Times when she joined the paper in 1979. She has photographed countless performers backstage and noticed that the actors practice rituals that have been passed down for generations.
"All the actors I photographed were excited to see the historical pictures Betsy had found," Ms. Krulwich said. "Maybe they felt some energy from the ghosts of the people who have been in their dressing rooms before them."
Broadway theater is more popular than ever. Last season, attendance at Broadway shows was up nearly 10 percent, shows grossed $ 1.8 billion, and tourists made up 63 percent of audiences.
"Broadway has become such a big part of American culture," Ms. Chambers said, referencing phenomena like "Hamilton" and "Be More Chill."
But for nearly a century, the spaces where stars are themselves before taking the stage have remained the same, Ms. Chambers added: "In a city where so much has changed, Broadway is a stalwart and the dressing rooms are so unchanged."

Texto completo: The party isn’t over for the Warriors but the fun is.
You know this thing has gone off the tracks if you’re the wife of the owner, sitting courtside next to the ultimate rapper power couple, when you lean across Beyoncé to ask Jay-Z if you can get him a lime in his vodka and soda … and are vilified globally.
That’s what happened to Nicole Curran, the wife of Warriors owner Joe Lacob, in Game 3 of the Finals when fans of Beyoncé – known as the Beyhive – decided the video showed their idol’s space being invaded, setting off a viral maelstrom, which, a tearful Curran said, included death threats.
In fact, nothing bad had happened, as confirmed by Beyoncé’s spokesperson who asked fans to “spread love, not hate.”
Unfortunately, all that was spreading that night for the Warriors was pain. Minority owner Mark Stevens, also sitting courtside, pushed away Toronto’s Kyle Lowry, who was chasing a loose ball, then, when Lowry protested, cursed at him.
The NBA barred Stevens for a year, fined him $500,000 and may force him to sell his 7% of the team.
Nor did Game 3 go so hot for the team. The injury-plagued Warriors were totally outclassed by the Raptors, a heretofore little-known crew that had avoided overtime in Game 7 of the second round with the stumbling 76ers on Kawhi Leonard’s shot that bounced four times on the rim … then was thought to be toast after trailing the Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals.
The Raptors led Game 3 for 46:35 of 48 minutes, winning 123-109 as Warriors Coach Steve Kerr took out his starters with 1:37 left, a surrender rarely seen in the Finals.
Remember when the Warriors were the adorable dynasty with cute Steph Curry and his band of merry marksmen?
Remember when they seemed invincible … like last week?
Then, out of nowhere, came this unexpected death struggle, capping a four-year glory run in which the Warriors once posted a record 73-9 finish and then landed Kevin Durant … won three titles, blowing a fourth in 2016 after leading 3-1 … then for the maraschino cherry atop the sundae of their magnificence, got DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5.3 million deal.
Unfortunately for them, or fortunately for fans who tired of their domination and self-inflation, it seemed as if the gods had also had enough of the Warriors, whose starters began disappearing even as they went 12-4 in the West draw.
April 15: Cousins goes out in Game 2 in the opening round against the Clippers.
May 8: Durant is lost in Game 5 in the second round against the Rockets.
June 2: Klay Thompson and Kevin Looney go down in Game 2 of the Finals.
June 5: Raptors go up 2-1 as Curran offers Jay-Z a lime and Stevens reaches out and touches someone. Warriors haters just wish it had involved Lacob, the majority owner, who tipped off his self-importance after winning his first title, telling the New York Times his team was “light years” ahead of the others.
Not that a merely 2-1 deficit discouraged the Warriors. With Thompson returning for Game 4, they expected to lock this up in six games … with them as champions, of course.
“We just gotta continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6, and celebrate,” said Draymond Green, team braggart. “Fun times ahead.”
Oops.
June 7: Klay goes for 28 points in Game 4 but they fall again. Once again, it isn’t close, with the Raptors winning 105-92.
With KD hoping to make it back for Game 5, the Warriors now expect to pull this one out in seven.
Win or lose, they’re going into a new arena in San Francisco next season, in which their fans, known for enthusiastically backing the team in the bad times, will have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in personal seat licenses as well as the standard exorbitant ticket prices.
So they may have already played their last game in friendly little Oracle Arena … which their loyal fans commemorated by fleeing up the aisles before it was over.
To give them their due, the Warriors really have been special.
They haven’t just been good but entertaining, sparking a revolution in offense. Curry is surely the greatest shooter in NBA history. Steph and Klay are surely the best shooting backcourt. The Steph-Klay-KD combination is one of the NBA’s greatest.
They’re also nice people. Kerr is a great quote and a super-nice man. Curry is said to be as wonderful a person as he is a player. For all KD’s whining, he’s considered a nice guy. For all Green’s braggadocio, he’s an unfailing stand-up guy who never uses the dodge of blaming his latest outrage on the press.
Lacob deserves his share of credit. It was his idea to hire Jerry West as a consultant, making the Warriors the first team to pay over $1 million for a part-timer … which turned out to be a bargain. If Jeanie Buss had been as savvy as Lacob when West was looking to rejoin her team, the Lakers might be in far better shape.
In the biggest “unfortunately” for the Warriors, more is at stake than one title.
The season has been played under the shadow of Durant’s ambition after he turned down a $150 million extension for a one-year deal to become a free agent this summer.
Insiders have paired Durant and Boston’s Kyrie Irving all season. Now with reports that Kyrie is leaning toward signing with the Nets … and Brooklyn trading salary to get a second maximum slot … the KD Leaves scenario looks ever more real.
It’s not over yet for the Warriors, but we’re about to see how many light years ahead they are now.

Did NSA's hacking tool assist costly computer virus?; February 2018 destructive malware cost city more than $1.2 million

Texto completo: In February 2018, the city of Allentown's computer systems fell prey to destructive malware called Emotet. Repairing the damage caused by the cyber attack cost the city more than $1.2 million.
Ten months earlier, a still-unidentified group known as the Shadow Brokers leaked a software penetration tool created by and then apparently stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. Known as EternalBlue, it takes advantage of a flaw in a Microsoft file sharing port, enabling hackers to spread malware across a computer network with frightening speed and efficiency.
According to a May 25 story in The New York Times, EternalBlue amplified the havoc wreaked on Allentown, Baltimore and other cities. The Baltimore ransomware attack, which occurred just a month ago, could cost that city an estimated $18 million, officials have said.
The NSA has not acknowledged the EternalBlue leak and has not commented on the newspaper's story. But U.S. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat whose district includes the NSA headquarters, said last week the agency's top officials told him the hacking tool was not involved in the Baltimore attack.
Matthew Leibert, Allentown's chief information officer, said he does not know if EternalBlue was involved in the attack against Allentown.
What is known: EternalBlue facilitated two of the costliest global cyber attacks ever in the summer of 2017. The NotPetya attack affected FedEx, Maersk, Merck, the western Pennsylvania health system Heritage Valley Health and other companies, doing $10 billion in damage, according to a White House assessment first reported by Wired. The better-known WannaCry ransomware attack cost an estimated $4 billion, according to the cybersecurity firm Cyence.
Hundreds of thousands of EternalBlue attack attempts are detected (and blocked) every day, according to the security firm ESET, and have increased in frequency considerably in recent months.
Thomas Rid, a cybersecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, said regardless of whether EternalBlue was used in the Baltimore or Allentown incidents, the bigger story stands: The most costly cyber attack in history was made possible because the NSA lost control of a "big, bad box of tools."
"And they still haven't explained how the leak happened," Rid said. "It's a stain on the NSA's reputation."
More than two years after EternalBlue leaked, its victims continue to reach out to Cybereason, a Boston-based firm that offers endpoint detection and response, on "an almost daily basis," said Amit Serper, the firm's head of security research.
What exasperates Serper is that the attacks were avoidable. Microsoft issued a security patch, or fix, for the software vulnerability in March 2017 - a month before the leak. But it's up to a computer network's information technology managers to install the patch, and many click the proverbial snooze button out of complacency, cost and convenience, Serper said.
"Even after everything that has happened, people still don't patch," he said. "It blows me away."
The Emotet malware that infiltrated Allentown is considered a Trojan horse virus. It's usually hidden in corrupted Microsoft Word documents, which are sent as email attachments made to look like, say, a payment voucher. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Emotet's "worm-like features result in rapidly spreading network-wide infection, which are difficult to combat."
Emotet evades virus protection and firewalls because its code can change as it moves from one computer to the next. This "polymorphic" ability also allows it to spread more swiftly across a system. The Emotet variant that attacked Allentown was at the time just three weeks old, Leibert said, shielding it further from anti-virus software.
Allentown hired Microsoft representatives in the immediate aftermath to contain the virus, which was stealing credential information from city employees such as passwords. Since then, the city's information technology department has taken additional steps to bolster email security, Leibert said. It also rebuilt its patch delivery mechanism to be more reliable and consistent.
Leibert said the city patches on a monthly basis. It was patching regularly before the Emotet attack, he said, but there were more frequent issues installing the patches because of its variations among its computer operating systems. Patches that fix one vulnerability can sometimes hinder the performance of other computer applications.
"We've tried to simplify things so patching is not so much of a burden," Leibert said. "Now when we do apply patches, we're addressing the same environment instead of a variety of environments."
Patch management isn't easy, especially if a given company or city network has outdated operating systems, which triples the risk of a data breach, according to a report by Bitsight, a cybersecurity ratings company.
As new hacking tools and malwares proliferate, Microsoft, Apple and others push out patches more frequently. Understaffed IT departments are often overwhelmed.
For cities and companies operating around the clock, patching can be inconvenient. As Leibert pointed out, "No shift wants to get the reboot message," especially when public safety is on the line.
While it's unclear whether EternalBlue was involved in Allentown, the hacking tool's particularly dangerous because of how quickly it can help malware spread from the initial vulnerability to essentially taking over IP addresses across a given network.
"It's a nation-state weapon," Serper said. "You squeeze the trigger, and within seconds you can control machines in every corner of the world."

Texto completo: You too can live like a TV icon right in North Jersey.
The home of Tony Soprano recently went on the market with a starting price of $3.4 million, The New York Times reported. Scenes from the first season of "The Sopranos" were filmed at the Aspen Drive house in North Caldwell.
The luxurious home with its long driveway and lush landscaping is reminiscent of Tony Soprano in his bathrobe, feeding ducks by the pool at the beginning of the series.
Victor Recchia and his wife Patricia have lived at the house for years. Now that their son has moved out they don't need as much space they're ready to sell, but will stay in New Jersey, The Times reported.
"For 10 years, it's been a wonderful experience," Patricia Recchia previously said about living there. She enjoyed when people would go by and think, "This looks like the Soprano house."
The Recchias could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.
"The Sopranos" pilot was filmed inside and outside of the North Caldwell house, but a replica was built for later seasons.
When James Gandolfini died in 2013, a memorial was set up outside the North Caldwell home. It included a bag of pasta, flowers, candles and cigar placed on the curb.
The house was built in 1987, according to its Zillow listing. It's about 5,600 square feet.
The Recchias are handling the sale themselves. Anyone interested in bidding on the house can email sopranoshouseforsale@gmail.com.

SJ 'Jeopardy' player met Holzhauer at studio

Texto completo: MOUNT LAUREL – Teacher and trivia whiz Jonathan Greenstein was in Burbank, California, to tape a "Jeopardy!" appearance when he introduced himself to a fellow contestant named James Holzhauer.
This was in March, before Holzhauer became a media sensation during his historic, record-threatening run on the show.
But Greenstein could tell by the way a producer addressed Holzhauer that he was the show's returning champion.
"Dare I ask?" Greenstein posed, and Holzhauer responded "32."
"I was thinking '$32,000?' and then he said, 'Games,' and gave that sort of toothy smile, looking straight forward."
Greenstein, who teaches social studies at Camden High School, tried to absorb the news, thinking he waited 11 years to qualify for "Jeopardy!" only to face a mega-champ.
As it turned out, Greenstein's episode would closely follow the one with Holzhauer's loss, which aired June 3. But since a week of shows is taped within one day, Greenstein was in the studio as Chester County, Pa., native Emma Boettcher dramatically dethroned the pro gambler from Las Vegas.
"We're sitting there and we all know the answer to Final Jeopardy," Greenstein told the Courier-Post. "We're thinking, 'She's a librarian and she got a Shakespeare question.'"
But Holzhauer, of course, didn't wager enough to win, ending his incredible streak at 32 games and $2.4 million.
Greenstein called it a "great reckoning in a little room."
The contestants-in-waiting stood and applauded — for Holzhauer and themselves.
"I think it was initially relief. We forgot that someone would then have to play her," Greenstein said of Boettcher. "We were relieved not to have to play him."
Greenstein's episode was taped on the first day back in the studio after Alex Trebek had announced his prostate cancer diagnosis.
"It was sad. I definitely had a lot of mixed emotions," recalled Greenstein, 35. "I felt so bad for Alex. I also selfishly felt bad for me because it sort of tainted my experience on the show. My co-worker said to me, 'You're allowed to feel two emotions at once.'"
But the vibe was pure positivity on June 5, the day Greenstein's episode aired.
He held a watch party for friends and family at The Pour House in Westmont.
Greenstein, a graduate of Cherry Hill High School West, has been offering insight into his entire "Jeopardy!" adventure with episodic-style posts on his Facebook page, including what he did when a producer announced that Holzhauer — still the defending champion at that time — had won $2.4 million.
"When no one was looking I weaseled a post-it note out of my pocket and worked out what I had already done in my head. 2.4 million divided by 32 is 75,000," Greenstein posted. "James was averaging 75,000 per game."
In a nod to the "Jeopardy!" format, here are some questions — and answers — about Greenstein's experience.
How'd he do? If you didn't see the June 5 episode, you missed your chance to see Greenstein on the show. He came in third behind Boettcher and education policy analyst Erin Garratt after winning an early Daily Double and taking big risks.
He did have a strategy going into the show.
"I figured if there was wordplay in the clues, I was going to buzz in and grab them and try to figure it out."
After all, Greenstein figured he had aced a lot of "Jeopardy!" questions over the years.
"I killed it at home. I forgot I would be playing live people and they'd be buzzing in against me," he said. "It happens very, very fast."
When he was $2,600 in the red, and there was just $2,400 left to win on the board, his fate was sealed.
He got the final question right, but he couldn't beat Boettcher's total.
"A producer gave me a big hug and said, 'You played really hard.'"
Greenstein also had the support of his entourage: His mom, Sharon Greenstein; sister, Amy Beth Wright; girlfriend, Gina Yanuzzi; and friends Aaron Berger and Ryan Wilkens.
Greenstein had asked for the producer to let Yanuzzi to listen in when he got the call to be on the show — both so she could share in the experience and take notes while he was driving.
"The producer said, 'We've never done this before,'" when he made his request. "That surprised me."
What was Alex Trebek like? As part of the interview process, Greenstein had to prove he could be "TV ready" by making jokes and holding conversations.
When he taped his episode, he lived up to his promise.
"I made Alex Trebek laugh so hard, he had trouble segueing to the next contestant."
Greenstein's girlfriend, Gina Yanuzzi, also had the chance to interact with Trebek. During one of the host's Q&A sessions at commercials, she asked whether he does vocal warm-ups (for the record, Trebek said he doesn't).
All-time "Jeopardy!" champion Ken Jennings wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Trebek has a "looser, even goofy presence" when the cameras are off.
"If he doesn't have a funny response for a question, he kind of just ignores it," Greenstein observed.
The contestant also got a different perspective on the studio itself.
"The studio is not as big as it looks," Greenstein said.
It holds a total of 150 people, with areas for contestants, their families and an audience from the general public, he said.
"It's very quiet. You don't look at your family and friends. You can't make eye contact with them during the game," Greenstein said.
How about James Holzhauer? Holzhauer's "Jeopardy!" streak captivated millions, but when he talked about it with Greenstein, he simply said, "I know. It's pretty crazy."
"For the record, James is kind and humble and, in a way, as awed as we were," Greenstein posted on his Facebook page.
Was 'Jeopardy!' trying to end streak? Once Greenstein successfully auditioned for the show, he thought he'd appear in the show's Teachers Tournament. But a producer told him "things kind of changed."
"They said because we were very high scoring on our tests, we were brought on specifically to give James a challenge," said Greenstein, who believed the motivation was not necessarily to end the streak, but to make sure the shows were entertaining.
What about the conspiracy theories? Some of those who followed Holzhauer's dominant run questioned why he only wagered $1,399 in the Final Jeopardy question that spelled his downfall. Social media exploded with wild conspiracy theories, including one that a Vegas sports book offered Holzhauer great odds to throw the game.
"For people to make comments about it, it's uninformed," Greenstein said. "He bet exactly textbook as you're supposed to, based on the numbers.
"If they both got it wrong, he was going to win ... he bet to win."
And Boettcher's victory was deserved, Greenstein added: "She beat him."
What was the coolest thing? Greenstein headed home after taping his episode, offering friends spoiler-free recaps of his experience.
"I was very nervous to see my students," Greenstein said, imagining the first question he would get was "Did you win?" or "How much did you win?"
But the first student he encountered asked something entirely different.
"He said, 'Did you have fun?' I got up, shook his hand and said, 'I had a blast.' I thought that was an amazing thing for him to say."
Greenstein was impressed with what he considered a rare moment of teenage perspective, and said he'll always remember it.
"It really blew me away. He got it."
What's next after 'Jeopardy'? Staying busy shouldn't be a problem for Greenstein. In addition to teaching, he also works at a Mount Laurel Starbucks and an escape room in Cherry Hill.
He has set a new trivia-related goal: "By the end of 2020, I want to get a crossword puzzle published."
He's eyeing the New York Times, which pays $500 for those who contribute a weekday crossword.
Greenstein might also leverage his "Jeopardy!" cred into a podcast for veterans of the game show. He can connect with other contestants easily now that he's been invited to join a secret Facebook group of "Jeopardy!" alumni.
While his TV experience centered around a 30-minute episode, Greenstein said the thrill will last longer.
"It was the adventure of a lifetime."

Texto completo: Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
Pop & Rock
FRANKIE COSMOS at Industry City (June 8, 8 p.m.). In a conversation with The New York Times last year, this bedroom-pop kingpin described her creative mantra as "Isn't it crazy that I have feelings and exist?" A wildly prolific 25-year-old songwriter, the New York native, born Greta Kline, has spent a decade turning those feelings -- which often include both wonderment and existential misery -- into hushed, guitar-driven songs at an impressive clip. Kline's most recent work is a series of short EPs titled "Haunted Items," which feature concise, vignettelike songs performed alone at the piano. Expect her to play selections from those releases at this performance in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

INDIA.ARIE at the Beacon Theater (June 9, 8 p.m.). "With all of my albums, I've tried to make not just protest music, but message music," this Grammy-winning soul singer said in a recent interview with Billboard. On some of her best-known songs, like "Video," from 2001, and "I Am Light," from 2013, that message has been one of radical self-love. The same theme crops up on a new record released in February -- as suggested by its affirming title, "Worthy." Highlights include "That Magic," an openhearted tribute to a deserving partner, and the tender, stripped-down ballad "Sacred Space."

LOCAL NATIVES at Brooklyn Steel (June 6-7, 9 p.m.). While the heyday of indie-rock bands may have given way to an upcropping of solo performers, this West Coast group continues to invest in a more communal approach. They describe their latest album, "Violet Street" -- named for the location of the Los Angeles warehouse where it was recorded -- as some of their most collaborative work, with all five band members forgoing preproduction preparation in order to make the whole thing from scratch, together. The results, strongest on highlights like "When Am I Gonna Lose You" and "Megaton Mile," refresh their rock roots with strains of synth-pop flair.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
TIM MCGRAW at the Beacon Theater (June 10, 8 p.m.). Author is not the most prominent line on this country music heavyweight's résumé, but in the past two decades he has penned a handful of books for both children and adults. Next week, he'll release another alongside his co-writer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham. Titled "Songs of America: Patriotism, Protest and the Music That Made a Nation," it examines songs that have shaped American politics and culture. On a brief tour supporting the book, which kicks off on Monday at the Beacon, the two will discuss the process of writing it, and McGraw will perform a selection of songs featured within its pages.
212-465-6000, msg.com
MARISSA NADLER AND STEPHEN BRODSKY at Saint Vitus Bar (June 13, 7 p.m.). Nadler, one half of this experimental duo, first made a name for herself in the early 2000s as a folk singer-songwriter specializing in understated instrumentation and gloomy, gothic imagery. With Brodsky, the singer and guitarist of metalcore groups like Cave In and Mutoid Man, she reaches beyond her signature acoustic palette and dabbles in droning soundscapes and trudging electric guitar. The pair released a collaborative album, "Droneflower," in April; on Thursday, they will perform at this metal bar in Greenpoint, Brooklyn -- the site of their first meeting, back in 2014.

TOKIMONSTA at Elsewhere (June 7, 5 p.m.). This Los Angeles-based producer's story is one of perseverance: After undergoing treatment for moyamoya, a rare brain disease, in early 2016, she temporarily lost her ability to produce language and comprehend music. Her most recent full-length, 2017's "Lune Rouge," celebrates her triumphant recovery. More recently, Tokimonsta has used her recuperated gift to champion new artists, releasing a compilation of work by up-and-comers on her own label, Young Art Records. In Bushwick, Brooklyn, she will share a rooftop stage with Rosehardt and Bad Tuner, two artists featured on that compilation; tickets are no longer available online, but a limited number will be sold at the door.

Jazz
CHEICK HAMALA DIABATE at Nublu 151 (June 13, 8 p.m.). In Diabate's hands, the ngoni -- a small West African instrument, between a lute and a guitar -- becomes a precision blade. He plays in lickety-split, skittering bursts, but his stroke is tough and strong; it has joyful energy and a spirit of stern, right-minded guidance. Which makes sense, given that Diabate is a griot in the African tradition, responsible for communicating messages of historical awareness and wisdom. He moved to Washington from Mali years ago, but he continues to serve the griot's role in his adopted home, where he plays weekly and has become one of the city's most beloved performers. Here he makes a rare New York appearance, joined by a small ensemble.

ROY HAYNES at the Blue Note (June 10-12, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Few living drummers know the plush interior of a solid swing feel better -- or are more adept at the wheel of a bebop combo -- than the 94-year-old Haynes, a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master and an unimpeachable authority on classic jazz drumming. His energetic, dashing style has showed up on hundreds of albums, including many from Sarah Vaughan and Sonny Rollins. In recent decades he has led his own group, the Fountain of Youth Band, and from the looks of things, they have been living up to their name.
212-475-8592, bluenote.net
CHRISTIAN MCBRIDE BIG BAND at Dizzy's Club (June 11-16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Rather than harking back to the classic swing era or the progressive large-ensemble composers of the late 20th century, this 17-piece group picks up on a lesser-touted aspect of the jazz tradition: the bebop big bands led by Jimmy Heath and Dizzy Gillespie in the 1940s and '50s. A lot of activity often happens at once in McBride's ensemble: spitfire soloing from the saxophones and brass; calisthenic bowed-bass workouts from the bandleader; sprightly, charging momentum from the rhythm section. But McBride makes sure everything coheres, thanks to hip-huggingly tight swing rhythms and generous coats of grease on the harmonies.
212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys
MYRA MELFORD at the Stone (June 11-15, 8:30 p.m.). As a bandleader, Melford finds a happy balance between assiduous precision and flagrant risk, and her quintet Snowy Egret's recent album was a highlight of 2018. The group's scrabbling interplay can feel so physical that it makes you reach for synesthetic comparisons: Sometimes it resembles a work of experimental choreography; elsewhere you might think of an abstract film, moving steadily from bleak darkness to cool light. Snowy Egret will play the closing night of this run at the Stone; on the four preceding dates, Melford will play in a different trio or quartet each night.

DAVID SÁNCHEZ'S CARIB at Jazz Standard (June 6-9, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A member of the prestigious SFJAZZ Collective, Sánchez uses his titanic gifts on the tenor saxophone to draw bold connecting lines between Afro-Caribbean tradition and the sound of contemporary New York jazz. On Friday he will release "Carib," an album integrating traditional West African rhythms -- often by way of Haiti and Sánchez's native Puerto Rico -- into sinuous original compositions. At Jazz Standard he will play selections from the album with Lage Lund on guitar, Ed Simon on piano, Ricky Rodriguez on bass, Obed Calvaire on drums, and Jhan Lee Aponte and Markus Schwartz doubling on percussion.

VISION FESTIVAL at Roulette (June 11-16). Now in its 24th year, this festival has become a tradition unto itself, and a steadying force for New York's community of free-jazz musicians and radically minded improvisers. The 2019 edition kicks off with a night of music of Andrew Cyrille, a fabled drummer and this year's lifetime achievement honoree. Other highlights include a performance on Wednesday by the tenor saxophonist Kidd Jordan, dedicated to his longtime collaborator Alvin Fielder (who died in January), and a trio set on June 14 from the pianist Kris Davis, the bassist William Parker and the drummer Jeff Watts. This year for the first time, the festival also features a three-day FreeJazz Convention, held on the afternoons of June 14 to 16.

Texto completo: An eight-way tie! This year's National Spelling Bee crowned more champions than ever before, with auslaut, erysipelas and bougainvillea among the words they spelled correctly on Thursday.
The nerve-racking competition has been chronicled in novels, nonfiction, documentaries and feature films. Here's a sampling of what's out there.
Watch the Bee
"Akeelah and the Bee"
Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old girl played by a young Keke Palmer, has a knack for spelling and dreams of going to the National Spelling Bee in this 2006 movie "that manages to inspire without being sappy," wrote our critic. "The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is in essence a formulaic sports picture into something more satisfying."
[We made a Spelling Bee quiz for you. Try your luck.]
"Bad Words"
In this expletive-laden 2014 comedy, Jason Bateman plays Guy Trilby, a 40-year-old misanthrope who crashes kids' spelling bees. "The performances are funny, appealing and, in the case of Allison Janney, as a spelling bee official, wonderful," wrote the Times critic Manohla Dargis.
[Video: Spellbound - Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
"Spellbound"
This documentary, a 2003 Oscar nominee, follows the 1999 National Spelling Bee, offering "enough drama, humor and unfiltered nail-biting suspense to put all the thrill-mongering screenwriters in Hollywood to shame," wrote the Times critic A.O. Scott.
Read the Bee
BEE SEASON by Myla Goldberg
Goldberg's first novel "is a dispassionate, fervidly intelligent book -- she explores class, linguistics and religious extremism with the confidence of a born essayist -- that comes by its emotion honestly," wrote our reviewer. It follows the fifth grader Eliza Naumann and her family after she unexpectedly wins her school's spelling bee.
BEELINE: What Spelling Bees Reveal About Generation Z's New Path to Success by Shalini Shankar
Shankar, who teaches anthropology at Northwestern, spent hundreds of hours getting to know contestants at major bees and their families for this book, published this year. She argues that the Bee teaches Gen Zers life skills that prepare them for the job market, and according to our reviewer, "is most convincing when writing about the kids and their parents in the culture of the Bee, and how many Indian-Americans have come to call it their own."
TWO ACROSS by Jeff Bartsch
Vera and Stanley meet as teenagers when they tie for first place in the National Spelling Bee, and their lives are intertwined when Stanley hatches a scheme to marry Vera and cash in their gifts to help him escape the path his mother has planned for him. "Crossword enthusiasts will appreciate the many insider winks, but everyone will be eager to solve the book's biggest puzzle: whether Stanley and Vera will succeed in their search for happiness," wrote our reviewer.

Texto completo: What's on TV
XY CHELSEA (2019) 9 p.m. on Showtime. In mid-2017, months after her prison sentence for leaking classified government documents was commuted by former President Barack Obama, Chelsea Manning summed up her motivation in an interview with The New York Times Magazine: "I wanted people to see what I was seeing." Tim Travers Hawkins digs into the life of Manning, an Army analyst at the time she released the documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. This new documentary focuses on the period after her sentence is commuted. "Manning's turbulent, remarkable story -- including a troubled Oklahoma childhood with heavy-drinking parents, two suicide attempts and seven years in an all-male prison while transitioning to a woman -- is a nonfiction filmmaker's dream," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. "Hawkins, however, seems content to hover on its surface, a decision that, depending on your viewpoint, feels either cowardly or humane."
THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS (1942) 10 p.m. on TCM. You've just directed your first feature film. Congratulations! It's "Citizen Kane." How will you possibly follow it up? Orson Welles's answer to that question was this period drama, which chronicles the fall of a wealthy Indianapolis family at the turn of the 20th century. The cast includes Joseph Cotten, Anne Baxter and Tim Holt; Welles narrates. While the studio's abundant cutting of the film was a subject of Welles's chagrin ("Everybody they could find was cutting it," he once said), it's still considered a classic.
What's Streaming
ALLES IST GUT (ALL GOOD) (2019) Stream on Netflix. The German director Eva Trobisch's debut feature is an exploration of the effect of a sexual assault on one woman, as she tries to avoid letting it change her. Janne (Aenne Schwarz) attempts to carry on as usual after she's raped by her boss's brother-in-law -- but the trauma seeps into both her personal and professional life. The movie won the award for best first feature at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland last year.
XXX: RETURN OF XANDER CAGE (2017) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. The third installment in the "XXX" action movie franchise is busy running and gunning; it could care less about adding a time-wasting "the" before the "return" in its title, thank you very much. The first 15 minutes contain a satellite crashing to earth, an armed robbery, martial arts, a shootout, a ski ride down a snowless mountain, longboarding and the line: "We need someone who can walk into a tornado and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze." That someone turns out to be Xander Cage, the government operative played by Vin Diesel, who is back in this movie a decade and a half after the "XXX" blockbuster.

Texto completo: The Philadelphia Orchestra, known in recent years as much for the fiscal woes that drove it into bankruptcy in 2011 as for its vibrant performances, announced Thursday that it had received a major ship-righting gift of $ 55 million.
The donation, which the ensemble said had been made by "individuals who have chosen to remain anonymous," will help it recover from a difficult period -- and allow it to capitalize on its artistic success under its music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who also took on the same role at the Metropolitan Opera this season.
"This enables us to author the orchestra's next chapter with greater confidence and with greater ambitions," Matías Tarnopolsky, who became the orchestra's president and chief executive officer in August, said in a telephone interview.
It is a rare bright spot at a gloomy fiscal moment for many orchestras. Just last week, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra abruptly canceled its summer season as its management tries to cut the number of weeks it employs its musicians. Earlier this year, the players of the storied Chicago Symphony Orchestra went on strike for 47 days, eventually accepting pension changes they were resisting. In the fall, Lyric Opera of Chicago's orchestra struck briefly before accepting a contract that guaranteed fewer weeks of work.
The Philadelphia story is in a different key. The orchestra will devote $ 50 million of the new gift to beef up its endowment, and use the other $ 5 million for operating expenses.
Robust endowments are crucial for orchestras these days. With ticket sales covering a smaller and smaller portion of the costs of putting on concerts, ensembles are more reliant than ever on philanthropy and investment income from their endowment funds. The new gift will bring the value of Philadelphia's endowment to roughly $ 212 million -- more than the New York Philharmonic's, which is around $ 200 million.
This will translate into more money to run the orchestra. Philadelphia draws a set percentage each year from its endowment, and the $ 50 million infusion will allow the orchestra to draw $ 10.8 million next year, up from $ 7.9 million this year. The orchestra's annual budget is around $ 50 million.
Philadelphia is still rebuilding after fiscal challenges led it into bankruptcy in 2011. The ensemble, which historically had 105 musicians, fell to 95 after it imposed a hiring freeze during the bankruptcy; it now has 97. The players held a brief strike in 2016 over concerns about pay, but this March the players and Mr. Tarnopolsky agreed early to a new four-year contract that guarantees labor peace, offers modest raises, allows for more Sunday concerts, and promises to add two more players in coming seasons.
And artistically the orchestra has been on a roll. David Allen wrote in The New York Times in 2015 that "it might be that no American orchestra sounds more alive," and Mr. Nézet-Séguin's contract keeps him in the music director position until at least 2026.
The orchestra said only that the new gift came from a donor-advised fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation supported by unnamed people who said that the donation represented "an expression of confidence in the artistic and organizational leadership of the orchestra."
The gift is among the largest in classical music -- especially when it comes to money that can be used for endowment funds and operations, as opposed to capital expenses; the lure of shiny new buildings and the offer of naming rights is often enticing to donors. Other major donations in recent years include a $ 100 million gift to the San Diego Symphony in 2002, an $ 85 million gift to support classical music in Cincinnati in 2009, and a $ 50 million gift to the Philadelphia Orchestra's endowment from the Annenberg Foundation in 2003.
Officials said that the gift would be announced to the Philadelphia players on Thursday morning by Richard B. Worley, the chairman of the orchestra's board of directors, Mr. Nézet-Séguin, and Mr. Tarnopolsky. Then, on Friday, the orchestra will travel to New York to perform works by Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev at Carnegie Hall.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: El sistema de recomendaciones de videos de YouTube facilita que los pedófilos hallen videos de niños , denunció un equipo de investigadores que analizó el algoritmo.
Los investigadores afirman que YouTube escoge videos de todos sus archivos, a veces incluso de películas caseras inocuas de familias que no son conscientes de ello . En muchos casos, el algoritmo refería a los usuarios a los videos después de ver contenido de temática sexual .
El algoritmo de Youtube usa inteligencia artificial y es el responsable del 70% de las reproducciones de videos en la plataforma.
“Es el algoritmo de YouTube que conecta estos canales”, dijo a The New York Times Jonas Kaiser, uno de los tres investigadores del Centro Berkman Klein para Internet y la Sociedad de Harvard que examinó los videos mientras investigaba el impacto de YouTube en Brasil . “Eso es lo que da miedo”.
Así le sucedió a Christiane, una mujer brasileña. El video de su hija y una amiguita jugando en una piscina en el patio de la casa llegó a acumular unas 400 mil vistas.
En febrero YouTube deshabilitó los comentarios en los videos con niños , luego de que varios medios reportaron que eran usados como guía por los pedófilos.
Sin embargo, el sistema de recomendaciones -que usa el mismo algoritmo agrupa- decenas de dichos videos en un nuevo depósito, de fácil acceso, a disposición de una amplia audiencia.
Los pedófilos no necesitan buscar directamente videos de niños, sino que el sistema los va dirigiendo a ellos mediante una cadena de recomendaciones .
Por ejemplo, un pedófilo puede buscar videos de mujeres jóvenes y a partir de allí terminar viendo videos de niñas .
The New York Times alertó a YouTube de que su sistema hacía circular videos familiares entre personas con inclinaciones al parecer pedófilas y la compañía retiró varios de ellos, pero dejó otros , incluso algunos subidos por cuentas aparentemente falsas.
Pese a las críticas, YouTube mantiene su sistema de recomendaciones en videos de niños, a pesar de los pedidos de que lo desactive para disuadir a los pedófilos de buscar materiales sobre menores en la plataforma.

Dancing on iTunes' grave

Texto completo: These days, I don't get much satisfaction from reading the headlines.
But “Apple Is Finally Killing iTunes"? Oh yes. That one can stay. 
In fact, when I heard the news (oh boy!) that future Apple operating systems would arrive sans iTunes, I stood from my seat, put in my earbuds, fancied myself in silhouette, and danced. Oh how I danced. If it's not clear, I hated iTunes.
And I wasn't alone, apparently. The app that introduced millions of users to digital music (and billions of compact discs into the landfill) was reaching its 18th birthday firmly in the shadow of its younger, streamier sister, Apple Music (the subscription service launched in 2015), as the music economy at large continues its precarious shift away from ownership and toward the far more nebulous notion of access — that is, as streaming continues to eclipse downloads (which now garner less revenue than sales of physical formats).
But its legacy of soured users goes back years, as the app struggled to accommodate a more media-rich Internet under one poorly-engineered roof (“Won't Someone Take iTunes Out Back And Shoot It?" asked a Slate headline back in 2012). 
To be clear, the death of iTunes is really more of a symbolic death — literally symbolic, in that the only thing really going away is the icon.
The functionality (if you could ever really call it that) of iTunes will instead be divided into four separate apps: Apple Music, Apple TV, Podcasts, and Apple Books. Existing music collections will be made available in the new Apple Music app (according to a panic-soothing statement from Apple), and  “iTunes" will live on in name as a music store integrated into Apple Music, but not as a standalone app. 
That's fine. Whatever, it's dead, I'll take it. 
Despite wistful and weirdly nostalgic appreciations/obituaries for this “revolutionary," “groundbreaking" nightmare of an app appearing in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the far more important anecdotal consensus I've gathered over hours of celebrating its demise with others and nearly two decades of my own reluctant experience is that iTunes single-handedly turned the simple joys of blithely browsing through and adding to one's music collection into something more like an unceasing and steadily worsening sequence of tiny tortures. 
In his reminiscence for the Times, Kevin Roose writes that iTunes was emblematic of the “Middle Internet," or “the period between the Wild West days of Napster and the hyper-centralized era of Facebook and YouTube." And it remained so until the end. Like many did when it first arrived on Mac desktops in 2001, Roose credits the sleek (for 2011) design of iTunes and its field-leveling 99-cent song model as contributing to a cleaner Internet via its “magical, one-click emporium."
And indeed, iTunes did have a tidying effect, not just on the Internet's untended pastures of pirated music (with their overgrown filenames and nefarious worms), but in our newly digitized relationship to music. Jobs famous described the experience of using iTunes on a Windows machine as akin to “giving somebody a glass of ice water in hell."
But while iTunes may have been a massive development in our enjoyment of computers, I can't say it did much to enhance our enjoyment of music — stupid stoner screen savers be damned. If anything, iTunes came between me and my music more aggressively than my first ex.
To me, iTunes is what dismembered the once-sacred body of the album (it even had me sipping some anti-album Kool-Aid for a while, just to see how it tasted), and reduced the aesthetic heft of album art to fuzzy thumbnails or nothing at all.
It subjected music collectors to hours of data entry to fill in metadata, or correct it. It lost songs completely, or imported them poorly. It was buggy, bloated, and slow, and a reliably increasing drag on your machine's resources.
Oh, and back in 2014, it forced me to own (and manually delete) a latter-day U2 album. Unforgivable. #neverforget.
And with each new iteration (i.e. attempt to rescue itself) and with every added feature, menu, portal, and product, iTunes grew less and less appealing, endearing, useful, and user-friendly. What ground it had broken had softened into a deep muddy bog, with all of my favorite songs somewhere at the bottom. 
Like a loathed relation we all must pitch in to bury, iTunes will always seem sweeter in hindsight than it ever was in person. Yes, it helped make the Internet a more musical place, and sure, it was, in its own clunky little way, the beating heart at the core of the smartphone revolution.
But iTunes also kickstarted what feels like a grand devaluation of music — turning tracks into 99-cent snacks, and ultimately paving the way for today's streaming services to turn our music from honored art form to something more like a basic utility — something we pay for that flows through our houses, but that we never quite possess. The birth of iTunes signaled the start of a revolution, but its death just feels like the end of an error.

George Will: The College Board tries to solve a social problem that it's unsuited to solve

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The earnest improvers at the College Board, which administers the , should ponder Abraham Maslow's law of the instrument. In 1966, Maslow, a psychologist, said essentially this: If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The College Board wants to solve a complex social problem that it and its test are unsuited to solve.
The College Board has embraced a dubious idea that might have the beneficial effect of prompting college admissions officers to think of better ideas for broadening their pool of applicants. The idea is to add to the scores of some test-takers an "environmental context" bonus. Strangely, board president David Coleman told the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger that this is not, as the media has named it, an "adversity index." But it is: It purports to measure 15 factors (e.g., poverty or food-stamp eligibility, crime rates, disorderly schools, broken families, families with education deficits, etc.) where these test-takers are situated. Coleman more convincingly says to The New York Times: "This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they've been given."
Perhaps the board's evident discomfort with the label "adversity score" is because their more benign-sounding "environmental context" gives a social-science patina to the obverse of a category (and political accusation) currently in vogue, that of "privilege." By whatever name, however, the SAT's new metric is another step down the path of identity politics, assigning applicants to groups and categories, and another step away from evaluating individuals individually. But if the adversity metric becomes a substitute for schools emphasizing race, this will be an improvement on explicit racial categories that become implicit quotas.
The SAT was created partly to solve the problem of inequitable standards in college admissions. They too often rewarded nonacademic attributes (e.g., "legacies" — the children of alumni). And they facilitated the intergenerational transmission of inherited privileges. Most importantly, they were used to disfavor certain groups, particularly Jews.
By making an objective — meaning standardized — test one component of schools' assessments of applicants, it advanced the American ideal of a meritocracy open to all talents. However, it has always been the schools' prerogative to decide the importance of the SAT component relative to others. And as "diversity" (understood in various ways) becomes an increasing preoccupation of schools, the SAT becomes decreasingly important.
Any adversity index derived from this or that social "context," however refined, will be an extremely crude instrument for measuring — guessing, actually — the academic prospects of individuals in those contexts. It might, however, be a good gauge of character. Physicists speak of the "escape velocity" of particles circling in an orbit. Perhaps the adversity index can indicate individuals who, by their resilience, have achieved velocity out of challenging social environments.
But the SAT is a flimsy tool for shaping the world of social inertia. Articulate, confident parents from the professions will transmit cultural advantages to their children, advantages that, as the SAT will record them, are apt to dwarf "adversity" bonuses. As Andrew Ferguson, author of the grimly hilarious "Crazy U: One Dad's Crash Course in Getting His Kid into College," says, America's least diverse classes are SAT prep classes.
The Chicago Tribune warns, plausibly, that the "secret-sauce" of the SAT's adversity score — schools will know it, applicants will not — will "breed more public mistrust" of colleges' admissions processes. But calling, as the Tribune does, for more "transparency" implies that the more admissions' criteria are made public, the better. However, private deliberations and criteria about applicants protect the applicants' privacy interests. Furthermore, asserting a public interest in maximum transparency encourages government supervision of — and the inevitable shrinking of — schools' discretion in shaping their student bodies, and ensuring that some cohorts are not largely excluded.
Unquestionably, such discretion often is employed in unsavory ways to serve academia's fluctuating "diversity" obsessions, some of which contravene common understandings of equity and perhaps civil rights laws and norms. Soon a Boston court will render a decision, probably destined for Supreme Court review, in the case concerning Harvard's "holistic" metrics, beyond "objective" ones (secondary school transcripts, standardized tests), for — it is alleged — the purpose of restricting the admission of Asian Americans. They, like the Jews whose academic proficiency was a "problem" eight decades ago, often come from family cultures that stress academic attainments.
Caution, however, is in order. Further breaking higher education to the saddle of the state is an imprudent (and, which is much the same thing, unconservative) objective.

Family Dollar to add alcoholic beverages to 1,000 select stores

Texto completo: In the first quarter, budget store Family Dollar quietly added alcoholic beverages to the shelves at 45 stores. Now, it's planning on expanding that to 1,000 select stores nationwide, the company reports.
In a news release, Dollar Tree - the parent company - announced it was executing a "store optimization program" for its Family Dollar stores to improve performance.
"We are simply providing customers with a convenient option to purchase adult beverage product while shopping for everyday needs at their neighborhood store," Dollar Tree's media relations manager Kayleigh Painter told The New York Times.
Painter didn't say which stores would be getting alcohol, nor how much it would cost. The Lehigh Valley is home to about a dozen Family Dollar stores.
The move is part of a planned expansion of freezers and coolers in about 400 Family Dollar stores this year. The company also announced it would close up to 390 underperforming Family Dollar stores, and rebanner about 200 Family Dollar stores to the Dollar Tree in 2019.
"Adding alcohol will be helpful inasmuch as it will drive some additional footfall into the stores and those customers will likely go on to purchase other products, such as snacks," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, to the Times. "However, adding alcohol is not a silver bullet for Family Dollar."
Family Dollar serves low- and middle-income areas with more than 8,000 stores in the United States.

Texto completo: Remember when "Grease" was the word for high school musicals? It was a show that hit at the heart of nostalgia for the days when the cool kids wore leather, had a cigarette tucked behind one ear and drove fast cars.
With "Grease" set to open Pittsburgh CLO's 72nd summer season, here's a look at the show's place in the evolution of high school musicals - from "Grease's" 1950s nostalgia-fest to today's Broadway teen revolution.
It was 1971 when "greased lightning" hit Broadway and stayed for six years, then four more from 1984-88 and again for five months in 2007.
The 1978 movie only boosted the popularity and added a few songs that have since been adapted to some onstage versions of the musical - "Grease," written by Barry Gibb and sung by Jersey boy Frankie Valli; and two John Farrar songs, the Oscar-nominated "Hopelessly Devoted to You" and "You're the One That I Want," sung by stars Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. The latter became one of the best-selling singles ever, with more than 15 million purchased worldwide.
"Grease" isn't just about the good ol' days. It deals with peer pressure, boys pressuring girls for sex, promiscuity, teen pregnancy . although they all generally take a back seat to a coming-of-age story about the loves and friendships made in high school.
Today, the things that made these kids cool are not so cool anymore. Travolta and Newton-John don't sing "You're the One That I Want" until she makes a complete transformation to suit his ideal. In the movie, he tries to meet her halfway until he sees how far she'll go for him, and then all bets are off.
It would be cringeworthy if not for the fact that it represents a moment in time that holds great nostalgia for some baby boomers.
Without "Grease," it is possible there would be no "High School Musical" movie series. Made for a more diverse audience and squeaky clean, it introduced Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens and Corbin Bleu, among others. The first, in 2006, was the Disney Channel's most commercially successful original movie, and it spawned four sequels.
For many millennials, it was their introduction to non-animated musicals.
Also in 2006, Broadway was introduced to the coming-of-age musical "Spring Awakening," based on a banned German play, circa 1906, but with modern music and lyrics. Teen sex, incest, abortion, suicide . all were explicit topics, and "Spring Awakening" went on to win the best musical Tony Award.
Today on Broadway, high school musicals are all the rage and deal with topics from same-sex dating ("The Prom") to girl power ("Wicked" and "Frozen"). Led by Tony winner "Dear Evan Hansen," there's also "Mean Girls," "Be More Chill," "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" and more that introduce or include characters in their teen years, often played by teenagers.
All are hits and attract young and older audiences at high Broadway prices.
Initially, it didn't look so good for "Grease."
The musical earned seven Tony nominations, winning none. Legendary critic Clive Barnes was not impressed. He wrote for The New York Times, circa 1972, that he recalled 1959 as a very good year for Burgundy, and probably for Coca-Cola, too.
The musical, he said, was "perhaps most successful in its suggestion of attitude and period, and there are times when 'Grease' catches the flavor to its time [and] the shy emergence of the new morality that made the summer of '59 different for teenagers from the summer of '42. The story is about the guy who should have been Elvis Presley getting his girl after a certain degree of misunderstanding. Not even Elvis Presley himself could ever have thought it interesting."
Audiences begged to differ, with their wallets. "Grease" went on to what was then Broadway history - in 1979, its 3,243rd performance displaced "Fiddler on the Roof" as the longest-running show to grace the Great White Way.
Now it's back in Pittsburgh, with a Broadway-caliber cast that includes Clay Aiken as Teen Angel, whose dated advice to "Beauty School Dropout" is: "If you go for your diploma you could join the steno pool / Turn in your teasin' comb and go back to high school!"
Ah, the bad ol' days that once looked so good, when the best a girl could hope for was romance with the most popular guy in school, or the steno pool, or both.
Makes you wonder what they will be saying about today's high school musicals in 50 years.

Texto completo: The eighth Women's World Cup, which begins Friday in France, comes at a pivotal time for the women's game. For years, players around the world have demanded better pay and more support from their federations. In some countries, serious progress has been made; in many others, the fight continues.
We wanted to know what it's like to be an elite women's soccer player in this moment.
To get inside that bubble, The New York Times sent a survey to every national team participating in this year's World Cup and heard back from more than 100 players from 17 of the 24 countries competing in France.
And through a partnership with Goal Click, we gave dozens of players disposable cameras and asked them to capture their lives as they see them. Through their photographs and answers to our questions, the players took us places fans and the news media rarely go.
Here are their stories, in their own words and images.
What does your family think of your job as a professional soccer player?
'They think that it is still a
complicated dream for a girl
to have, and that it is still
important to have good
knowledge and skills, to have more than one string to your bow.'
Emelyne Laurent, 20,
France forward 'They love that I get to do
what I love.'
Kelley O'Hara, 30,

or married by now.'
Francisca Ordega, 25,
Nigeria forward 'My family is happy. But we're still not professional in Italy.'
Sara Gama, 30, Italy defender 'That it doesn't last a lifetime.'
Mariana Larroquette, 26,
Argentina forward
Did you ever have to play on boys' teams, or against boys, growing up?
'I played with boys from the beginning (age of 4) till 16. Also in my age now, I play against boys and men in the preseason of my club.'
Johanna Elsig, 26,
Germany defender 'I started playing on the boys' team in grade school because
I didn't know there were any girls' teams around me.'
Moon Mira, 27,
South Korea midfielder 'I have played on boys' teams until the age of 18, by choice.'
Loes Geurts, 33,
Netherlands goalkeeper 'Yes, every day.'
Natalia Campos, 27, Chile goalkeeper 'Used to play on boys' teams up until 15 years old. I still have practice games against boys' teams.'
Saki Kumagai, 28, Japan defender
How many jobs do you have in addition to playing soccer?
'I have a small business where
I can do lectures, coach and so on, to add some income.'
Hedvig Lindahl, 36,
Sweden goalkeeper 'Today I am a professional
soccer player, but not that long ago I was studying to get a
caseworker diploma, which I did.'
Julie Debever, 30, France defender 'Only soccer.'
Saki Kumagai, 28, Japan defender 'Aside from studying, two.'
Daniela Pardo, 31, Chile midfielder 'At the moment,
I'm out of work.'
Virginia Gómez, 28,
Argentina defender

'Not much. I don't get a salary, only travel expenses for the national team on FIFA dates.'
Natalia Campos, 27, Chile goalkeeper 'So little that I can't make
the end of the month.'
María Belén Potassa, 30,
Argentina forward 'A few hundred thousand.
Between $ 300,000 and $ 400,000.'

is like.'

France forward 'Bow before entering a field.'

cycle.'
Rasheedat Ajibade, 19,

Miranda Nild
(Suchawadee Nildhamrong), 22,

What's the best part of being a female soccer player?

Which player do you hope to play against this World Cup? Why?

South Africa goalkeeper
'Alex Morgan. The opportunity to test myself against one of the best forwards in the game? Big yes.'

Persian kebabs and stews — spiked with nuts, herbs and spices — are a delight at Sumac Cafe in Cottonwood Heights

Texto completo: Cottonwood Heights • The lemonade is bright green from all the blended mint and it pops with real ginger. The olive appetizer, marinated in pomegranate syrup, zings. And the chicken stew is tart, sweet and silky.
The authentic Persian cuisine served at Sumac Café provides a lovely medley of flavors and textures, with dishes spiked with pistachios, flavored with saffron and sumac, stuffed with herbs, rubbed with spices.
Elham Sadegh moved from Iran six years ago. She opened the restaurant last December in a spot where she was running a coffee shop. She had been catering meals with her Persian dishes on the side, and “everybody told me, ‘We need this delicious food. … You have to change the coffee shop to a restaurant.’”
So she did, with the help of another owner and cook, and now she’s serving recipes she learned from her mother and grandmother in Tehran. She named the restaurant for the reddish-purple, citrusy spice she uses in the kabobs because of its antioxidant power.
The space, on Bengal Boulevard next to another restaurant, is small with elegant touches like fresh flowers and black table cloths. It serves stews, kabobs, salads, several appetizers and a small selection of wine and beer. There’s also Persian and saffron teas ($1.99-$2.99), the ginger lemonade ($4.99) and something called doogh ($2.99), described as a bubbly yogurt, water and mint.
We tried four appetizers and all were excellent. The kashk bademjoon ($7.99) is pesto-like, made with walnuts, sautéed eggplant and garlic and a skim of whey (the kashk part of the name) floating on top. It’s served with thin triangles of warmed pita. That bowl of tangy olives is called zeitoon parvardeh ($5.99). The mast o’kheeyar ($4.99) is yogurt mixed with herbs and cucumbers and cools the palate, while mirza ghasemee ($6.99) is a warm eggplant dip, made with tomatoes, garlic and a runny egg served on top.
All were good on their own but they go really well with the kabobs and stews.
The kabobs are juicy and tender and spiced with saffron, sumac, turmeric and black pepper, says Sadegh. The portions are plenty for two people, especially with the large amount of saffron-tinged rice that accompanies them. Beef comes either ground and molded into a skewer (called koobideh, $12.99), or as thinly sliced cuts of filet mignon (called barg, $17.99). Chicken is available as a kabob ($12.99) or comes on a platter as a whole Cornish hen ($17.99). All of them are served with whole roasted tomatoes and raw onion slices. Diners can combine the two beef kabobs, or the chicken with beef.
Four stews round out the menu, also served with heaping rice. The fessenjan ($14.99) with large chunks of chicken was so good — sweet, tangy with pomegranate sauce and rich from the pureed walnuts. Sadegh cooks it for several hours.
I can see why Samin Nosrat, probably the most famous Persian-American chef, recently named fessenjan as one of her top 10 essential Persian dishes. The author of “Salt Fat Acid Heat” (who also stars in the same-named Netflix docuseries) recently explained in The New York Times that the stew, practically considered the national dish, comes from northern Iran where the main ingredients grow.
Two other dishes she mentioned also are on Sumac Café’s menu: The shirazi salad ($4.99), made of cucumbers, tomatoes, mint and onions served with lime juice and olive oil. It was something we didn’t try, but will next time. The cucumber yogurt dish was another essential bite, since it’s also a staple.
Don’t forget dessert. We skipped the baklava ($2.99) and tiramisu ($4.99) for the more unusual saffron rice pudding made with rose water and almond (sholeh zard, $3.99) and saffron ice cream (bastani zafferani, $5.99). They aren’t as sweet as Western versions but have an intriguing flavor and are dusted with chopped pistachios.
Sadegh says she opened the restaurant in part to satisfy Persians living in Utah who miss a taste of home. Her food is also making those of us who are new to the delights of Persian dishes crave those flavors, too.

Texto completo: Uber just filed its first quarterly report as a publicly traded
company. Although the company lost $1 billion, investors may still do well because the losses appear to be declining Uber drivers, on the other hand, aren't doing well. According to a recent study, about half of New York's Uber drivers are supporting families with children, yet 40% qualify for Medicaid and another 18% qualify for food stamps.
It's similar elsewhere in the new American economy. Last week, the New York Times reported that fewer than half of Google workers are full-time employees. Most are temps and contractors receiving a fraction of the wages and benefits of full-time Googlers, with no job security.
Across America, the fastest-growing category of new jobs is gig work - contract, part-time, temp, self-employed and freelance. And a growing number of people work for staffing firms that find them gig jobs.
Estimates vary, but it's safe to say that almost a quarter of American workers are now gig workers. Which helps explain why the standard economic measures - unemployment rate and income - look better than Americans feel.
The jobs problem today isn't just stagnant wages. It's also uncertain incomes. A downturn in demand, a change in consumer preferences, or a personal injury or sickness can cause future paychecks to disappear. Yet nearly 80% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
According to polls, about a quarter of American workers worry they won't be earning enough in the future. That's up from 15% a decade ago. Such fears are fueling working-class grievances in America.
At the rate gig work is growing, future generations won't have a minimum wage, unemployment insurance, worker's compensation for injuries, employer-provided social security, overtime, family and medical leave, disability insurance, or the right to form unions.
Why is this happening? Because it's so profitable for corporations to use gig workers instead of full-time employees.
Gig workers are about 30% cheaper because companies pay them only when they need them.
Increasingly, businesses need only a small pool of "talent" anchored in the enterprise.
Other workers are becoming fungible, sought only for reliability and low cost. So, in effect, economic risks are shifting to them.
It's a great deal for companies such as Uber and Google. They set workers' rates, terms and working conditions, while treating them like arm's-length contractors.
But for many workers it amounts to wage theft.
If America still had a Department of Labor, it would be setting national standards to stop this. Yet Donald Trump's Anti-Labor Department is heading in the opposite direction. It recently proposed a rule making it easier for big corporations to outsource work to temp and staffing firms, and to escape liability if those contracting firms violate the law.
On the other hand, California is countering Trump on this, as on other issues.
Last week, the California Assembly passed legislation codifying an important California Supreme Court decision: In order for companies to treat workers as independent contractors, the workers must be free from company control, doing work that's not central to the company's business, and have an independent business in that trade. (The bill is not yet law. It still has to pass the California Senate and be signed by the governor. And businesses are seeking a long list of exemptions, including ride-share drivers and many high-tech contract workers.)
Whatever national rule eventually emerges for defining gig workers, they'll need a different system of social insurance than was the case when steady full-time employment was the norm.

Texto completo: Volkswagen is sorry. But it's not exactly saying so in a new ad campaign.
The world's largest automaker has been on something of an apology tour since 2015, when it was publicly accused of using illegal software in its diesel cars to dupe pollution tests. The company was slammed with criminal charges, lawsuits and billions of dollars in government fines.
Volkswagen Group was sorry again in March when its chief executive officer, Herbert Diess, posted an apology on LinkedIn after making remarks that echoed the Nazi-era slogan "Arbeit macht frei." The expression, which means "Work sets you free," appeared on the gates of Auschwitz and other concentration camps.
With the new marketing push, the company wants to move on from its self-inflicted wounds.
"We've offered thousands of apologies," said Scott Keogh, who became chief executive of Volkswagen's American unit in November. "For us, this wasn't about the apology -- we've been doing that. This is the reassessment of the brand, of the company, and how we want to move forward."
In the print and video ads, released in the United States starting on Wednesday, Volkswagen nods to the scandal before shifting focus to its coming line of electric vehicles and other projects. Communication experts said the company might have a hard time bringing skeptics on board as it tries to pull off this U-turn.
"It is difficult for Volkswagen to run advertising on the environmental front, because that's exactly where they got into trouble," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University.
In one of the new commercials, snippets of news broadcasts about the scandal are followed by the strains of Simon and Garfunkel's "The Sounds of Silence" and the appearance of a Volkswagen employee, swathed in shadow, who is meant to represent the company's "soul-searching," Mr. Keogh said. Eventually, a glowing Volkswagen I.D. Buzz, an electric minivan planned for production in 2022, cuts through the gloom. The video ends with these words: "In the darkness, we found the light."
The "Rebirth" campaign was designed by the agency Johannes Leonardo, which counts Adidas and Google among its clients. The commercials will run a few weeks before giving way to a series of ads meant to hammer home the notion that a company recently caught cheating is now embracing environmentalism and setting aside what it calls "self-interest."
"We wouldn't be capable of telling that story without first having this moment to clear the air, to make the pivot," Mr. Keogh said. "We couldn't pretend it didn't happen."
Clever marketing has helped Volkswagen as far back as 1959, when its "Think Small" campaign -- a contrast with the hard-sell tactics of the day from Julian Koenig of the Doyle Dane Bernbach agency -- was as minimalist as the Beetle it was promoting.
That pitch helped reposition Volkswagen, dogged by its wartime association with Adolf Hitler, as "something that was warm and friendly and the antithesis of Nazi Germany," said Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University.
"It absolutely wiped the slate for many people," he said. "It was really revolutionary."
Later campaigns, including "Lemon" and "Drivers Wanted," kept Volkswagen fresh. But at the start of the decade, the brand seemed "out of step with America," Mr. Keogh said, and it was ill equipped to react to the coverage of the emissions scandal.
Public outrage mounted in the weeks before Volkswagen came through with apology ads in some 30 American newspapers, including The New York Times. The campaign was seen as less contrite than other corporate confessionals, like the one Toyota aired during the 2010 Winter Olympics after recalling millions of vehicles. Instead, it was likened to a poorly received mea culpa from BP that showed its unpopular chief executive pledging to clean up an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico over a soundtrack of squawking sea gulls.
The new Volkswagen campaign does not go into the internal cultural deficiencies that enabled the cheating, such as a hierarchal structure that discouraged whistle-blowing. But Mr. Keogh said the company's willingness to refer to the scandal at all in its marketing was a sign that Volkswagen's culture was changing.
"We really needed a reason for people to root for us again," the executive added.
Volkswagen's sales started to rebound last year, thanks in part to the introduction of new sport utility vehicles, but have yet to catch up to pre-crisis levels. And even as the company has sought to regain the trust of car buyers, it has had to deal with accusations that it illegally sold prototype vehicles, as well as revelations that it financed tests of the effects of diesel exhaust on monkeys.
The company is planning a $ 50 billion escalation of its electric fleet, with 22 million battery-powered vehicles scheduled for production through 2028. Before the emissions uproar, Volkswagen had been lagging behind its competitors in developing zero-emissions vehicles. As part of a 2016 settlement with the United States government (overseen by Robert S. Mueller III), the company agreed to spend $ 2 billion on electric vehicle infrastructure.
"We would have gotten there," Mr. Keogh said, "but this got us there a little sooner."

Nixon-era figure will testify before House inquiry

Texto completo: House Democrats, grasping for ways to bring the special counsel's report to life, said Monday they would convene a series of hearings focused on Robert Mueller's findings, even if the special counsel would not be on the witness stand for now.
The first star witness, in fact, will come from another era and another presidential scandal: John W. Dean, White House counsel for the late former president Richard Nixon who told the Senate in June 1973 that the president had been directly involved in the Watergate cover-up.
The hearing, scheduled for June 10 with the House Judiciary Committee, will allow lawmakers to fully air Mueller's findings for the first time.
So far, Democrats' requests for testimony from key witnesses in the Mueller investigation have been blocked by the Trump administration, and Mueller has yet to agree to appear on Capitol Hill despite delivering a rare public statement last week.
The Judiciary Committee is not the only panel trying to fight back against a refusal by the executive branch to comply with oversight demands. The chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said Monday he would schedule a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas for documents related to the administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and the Judiciary committee chairman, said his committee's first hearing would zero in on “the most overt acts of obstruction" documented by Mueller. The special counsel's report detailed at least 10 cases of possible obstruction by President Trump as he sought to thwart investigators studying his campaign's ties to Russia and its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Republicans mocked the announcement. Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, a member of the Judiciary Committee, accused Democrats of seeking to stage “make believe" reasons to impeach Trump.
The committee already has outstanding subpoenas for testimony from two more key witnesses this month. But neither witness — Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director; or Annie Donaldson, chief of staff to the former White House counsel — is likely to show.
New York Times
Trump, in tussle with CNN, suggests boycott of parent AT&T
President Trump took to Twitter on Monday to reiterate his complaints about CNN and suggest a boycott of its parent company, AT&T.
Soon after his arrival in London for a pomp-filled state visit to Britain, Trump tweeted that CNN is his chief source of US news but that "after watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S."
Trump asked why doesn't AT&T "do something" and said that if people stopped using or subscribing to AT&T, it would be forced to make "big changes" at CNN. CNN is owned by Turner Broadcasting System, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia.
It's not clear how much of an impact Trump's remarks will have. Invested shrugged off the news, as AT&T's stock price increased 1.7 percent on Monday. AT&T and CNN declined to comment.
Associated Press
Why Donald Trump can't watch Fox News in Britain
Trump is known to be an avid viewer of Fox News.
The president regularly tweets about news he has seen on the right-leaning network, and he is an active participant on the network. According to data compiled by The Washington Post earlier this year, roughly one-third of all interview time that Trump has given to members of the media since taking office were granted to Fox News or its sister network, Fox Business Network.
Why can't the American president watch a "Fox News International" in Britain, as he could with CNN? The problem appears to be relatively simple: British viewers have rejected it.
Just two years ago, it was possible to watch Fox News in Britain. However, in August 2017, the network was abruptly pulled off the air. A statement released by its parent company at the time pinned the blame on low ratings.
"It averages only a few thousand viewers across the day," 21st Century Fox said in a statement. The company noted that this was largely because the network's programming was aimed at American audiences.

'Facts first'? Don Lemon repeats the ‘no scandals’ myth about Obama's administration

Texto completo: There were “no scandals" during the Barack Obama presidency, says Don Lemon, the man who likes to say he hosts a show on the "facts first" network.
“Someone said, ‘My gosh, did you guys talk about Barack Obama this much?'” Lemon, who is himself no stranger to delusion and falsehoods, recalled Monday evening, referring to CNN's nonstop, wall-to-wall coverage of President Trump’s every utterance and action.
He continued, saying, “We did [cover Obama] a lot in the beginning because he was the first black president, but there was no — there were no scandals.”
Nearly as embarrassing as Lemon’s assertion that there were "no scandals," and that their early coverage was friendly and excited, is the fact that his remarks came as he bragged that Obama's approval numbers are better than President Trump's.DLIt is possible Lemon meant specifically that there were no scandals in the early days of the Obama presidency (debatable). But that the Obama era was scandal-free is just not true. Nor is it a one-off for the CNN anchor. He has repeated the nonsense claim before that the worst scandal of the Obama era was a tan suit. In fact, Lemon mentioned the damned tan suit specifically Monday evening as he praised the former president. The scandal-free Obama presidency line is clearly something Lemon believes in.
It takes either an extreme act of ignorance or willful delusion to believe this.
For the record, the Obama years were indeed plagued by several high-level scandals. Sorry to repeat myself, but I am going to keep reminding everyone of this, so long as short-sighted idiots keep claiming the mantle of sainthood for the previous administration. To deny the Obama scandals is to fundamentally misunderstand the rise of Trump.
During Obama’s two terms in office, for example, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ran a “gunwalking” operation in which it lost track of 1,290 firearms from a total of 2,000 that it allowed to be purchased illegally. One such firearm was used later in the killing of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Several were used in other killings. In the subsequent congressional investigation, Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt by Congress.
Between 2008 and 2016, at least seven American citizens were killed by drone strikes. Of those seven, only one was targeted intentionally by the U.S. government for an extrajudicial killing.
During the Obama administration, the Internal Revenue Service was weaponized against conservative groups.
Obama's Office of Personnel Management was hacked because of appointees' negligence.
Obama’s secretary of state maintained a homebrew server in her bathroom so as to evade record-keeping laws and department procedures, placing classified information at risk and on the hard drive of a very active online pervert who could have been especially susceptible to hacking. (CNN even covered this, Don!)
The Justice Department spied on journalists’ phone activity, including their home phone activity, without notifying their editors. And Obama's secretary of Veterans Affairs resigned in disgrace after it was revealed that an estimated 307,000 veterans died awaiting medical attention.
But other than all that, the Obama administration was basically scandal-free.
Last week, Vanity Fair reported the New York Times is instructing its reporters to avoid appearing on certain partisan news programs. Lemon’s show is reportedly included in the Times’ newsroom-wide crackdown. Good call.

BILL MOVES TO END NIH MONKEY BUSINESS: House legislators are looking to require the National Institutes of Health to write a plan for using fewer monkeys and other primates in medical research labs and moving them to sanctuaries once they're retired.
The provision, included in funding legislation that is moving through the lower chamber, is a response to the fears of some scientists and animal rights activists who worry about the primates' well-being and who question the usefulness of animal testing in developing medicines for people.
Monkeys are the closest animals to humans, and for that reason many scientists see them as helpful in brain and other research. But animal rights groups say the government shouldn’t infect them with diseases, expose them to chemicals, or subject them to surgery — or kill them.
NIH laboratories housed 3,309 primates in 2018, and one of its divisions owns 2,625 primates on Morgan Island, S.C., though the facility is managed by Charles River Laboratories.
The NIH would not be required to implement the plan it comes up with, and it wouldn't extend to primates at outside research facilities that get grants from the agency.
Other agencies may take similar steps. On Monday, lawmakers released the spending draft for the Food and Drug Administration, which had similar language applying to that agency. The FDA spending bill is being marked up Tuesday.
Read more about the considerations at play when scientists place monkeys at sanctuaries in our latest magazine issue.

CVS PREPARES TO DEFEND ITS AETNA MERGER IN COURT: Three days of oral arguments kick off Tuesday as Judge Richard Leon will decide whether the Department of Justice adequately considered anti-competitive implications before approving the $70 billion merger between pharmaceutical and retail giant CVS Health and health insurer Aetna. Leon scheduled the hearings and has expressed concern that the merger will result in higher healthcare prices.
U.S. PIRG, Consumer Action, the American Medical Association, and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed briefs arguing that the court should hold the hearing, saying that the merger doesn’t serve the public’s interest and warning that the healthcare industry already has become far too consolidated. Witnesses are testifying in federal court on behalf of those groups.
SCOTUS SIDES WITH HOSPITALS, STRIKING DOWN OBAMA-ERA PAYMENTS RULE: The Supreme Court determined Monday that the Department of Health and Human Services violated the Medicare Act when it changed the reimbursement formula for disproportionate share hospital payments, which help offset the cost of uncompensated care. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the hospitals 7-1, saying the agency neglected to provide notice and allow outside comments that help evaluate what the impact of policies will be. The rule was written under the Obama administration and defended by the Trump administration.
MITCH MCCONNELL TAKES VICTORY LAP OVER JUDICIARY WINS AT ANTI-ABORTION GALA: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell boasted at the 12th annual Campaign for Life gala Monday night that he had helped confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh despite Democratic and outside opposition, a move he viewed as one of many victories he secured for advocates who had gathered. The fundraiser is held by Susan B. Anthony List, an organization that advocates for anti-abortion legislation and helps to elect politicians that support their causes.
NIKKI HALEY: BEING PRO-ABORTION ‘IS NOT REAL FEMINISM’: Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said at the SBA List gala that abortion right activists who want conformity are not real feminists. "Unfortunately, many on the left use the abortion debate to divide women and demand conformity. They do this in the name of feminism. But that is not real feminism,” Haley said. The former governor added that being anti-abortion was not anti-woman but rather being for the “baby’s right to live.”
DEMOCRATIC 2020 HOPEFUL JOHN DELANEY ESCALATES FIGHT WITH AOC OVER ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’: John Delaney's presidential campaign escalated a fight with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., over "Medicare for all," blaming the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party for helping elect President Trump and challenging her to a debate on healthcare. "What we need as Democrats is to build an economy that works, but it's got to be with smart policies. 'Medicare for all' may sound good, but it's actually not good policy nor is it good politics," Delaney said.
CONFIRMED MEASLES CASES RISE TO 981, MOST IN 27 YEARS: The number of confirmed measles cases has risen to 981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday, a new high since last week’s 971 confirmed cases. The number of cases, based on data from 26 states through May 31, is the most since the 2,200 in 1992. The virus was declared eliminated in 2000.
QUEST DIAGNOSTICS ANNOUNCES POSSIBLE DATA BREACH AFFECTING ALMOST 12 MILLION PATIENTS: Quest Diagnostics said the personal and medical information of nearly 12 million people, including their Social Security numbers, has potentially been breached. Quest, a company that specializes in blood testing, said in a Monday press release that an “unauthorized person” gained access to a system used by the American Medical Collection Agency, a billing collection vendor for one of the company’s contractors.
FDA WILL ALLOW ONCOLOGISTS TO USE NEW CANCER TREATMENTS: The FDA will open a call center with FDA cancer experts to help oncologists submit Expanded Access requests to use otherwise unapproved cancer treatments after approved treatments have failed. Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Ned Sharpless said, “We support Expanded Access and are exploring ways to make it easier for patients, their families and health care professionals to understand the process and how to access investigational therapies.”
TWO MIGRANTS DIED IN ICE CUSTODY IN TWO DAYS: A transgender woman and Salvadoran man died in Border Patrol custody Saturday and Sunday respectively. Deaths of those in CBP custody have received national attention since December because they represent an uptick compared to previous years when a few people died each year, according to the Southern Border Communities Coalition. In response to outcry from immigrant advocacy groups, ICE said its Health Services Corps oversees medical care of all detainees, including a $250 million annual budget for migrants’ healthcare needs. Those transferred to ICE from CBP receive medical, dental, and mental health intake screenings within 12 hours of arriving at a facility and a full health assessment within 14 days, the agency said.

Apple backs up privacy chest-beating with critical new feature

Texto completo: No tech company has been louder lately about claiming to care more for your online privacy than Apple. And at the company’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference Monday in San Jose, California, executives continued to beat the privacy drum loudly.
“At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, told WWDC attendees, pulling out the go-to mantra CEO Tim Cook and other Apple execs have been reciting for years.
Of course, Apple isn’t the only online company to hop on the privacy bandwagon. Indeed, if there was a theme to this spring’s developer conference season, it was that:
“Privacy is a human right,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, once again told attendees at the cloud company’s annual Build conference May 6.
“Privacy must be equally available to everyone in the world,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote a day later in a New York Times op-ed piece to help kick off the company’s I/O conference.
“The future is private,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the crowd at Facebook’s F8 developer gathering in late April, which seemed to be a tacit acknowledgment that, for now at least on Facebook, the present is not.
You’d have good cause to challenge whether Apple is deserving of the privacy crown it’s bestowed upon itself. Just last month, for example, a Washington Post investigation revealed that while Apple may take pains not to track you, the apps you download from their App Store don’t hesitate – relaying location, IP address and personal identifiers like name and email address at an astounding rate of 1. 5 GB per month.
What happened at WWDC: iTunes is yesterday; today's all about swifter new iOS features
iOS13: Apple's new Photos app may just be the tool you've been waiting for
But know this: Apple showed at an otherwise mundane, incremental WWDC that it’s practicing what it’s been preaching, with strong new privacy features woven into the portfolio, everywhere from the Mac to the Apple Watch. Consider:
Apple Watch. An aural health monitor that listens for dangerously high noise levels – without recording anything,
Maps. A long-overdue update, which will share data, if you choose – but the default is to keep your locations, searches and destinations private,
iOS 13. Anti-tracking protection that keeps snoops from monitoring your location, shopping preferences and other information from your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals, and
HomeKit Secure Video. It analyzes security camera data locally, sending much less private information to the cloud.
One new feature in particular really starts to set Apple’s privacy protections apart from the pack. It’s called Sign in with Apple.
At first blush, Sign in With Apple sounds much the same as Sign in With Google or Sign in With Facebook: a convenience that takes the drudgery out of setting up yet another new login, in return for the increasingly unpalatable trade-off of opening yet another window into your online soul.
But it’s not. For starters, Apple pledges to not track you with Sign in With Apple. More than that, though, the feature will generate a random email address for each login. You’ll receive emails from the sites you sign up for, of course. But the sites don’t know your real address.
That’s huge because it eases myriad privacy and security problems. See, your email address serves as a critical link between what different databases know about you. Without a common email address, aggregators may not be able to connect, for example, your internet searches from one database to your credit card purchases from another.
It also neutralizes a powerful hacker tool. Hackers assume that some of us – and you know who you are – use the same email address and password for many of the sites we frequent. That’s dangerous because once they snag your information from one, they start poking around on other sites to see if they can break into accounts with more valuable personal assets, like utilities, banking and cellular carrier websites.
With unique email addresses for every account, inevitable security breaches won’t give cyberthieves much ammunition to help them break into other parts of your life. So hackers wouldn’t get very far, for example, if they made their way into Facebook’s store of hundreds of millions of unencrypted logins, because you use the address they snagged, 4795659@privaterelay. appleid. com, to log into Facebook – and nothing else.
Setting up unique email addresses is something I’ve done – and have advocated – for years. For Apple to save the time and effort by doing it for you breaks new ground.
Because while privacy may, in fact, be a fundamental human right, as Apple execs are wont to say, having a company like Apple do the dirty work to help secure that right for you is truly a privilege.

Texto completo: Raptors star Kawhi Leonard has filed a federal lawsuit against Nike, first reported by Portland Business Journal's Matthew Kish. The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in Southern California on Monday.
Leonard, 27, has claimed Nike filed a copyright application for his "Klaw" logo without his consent. The suit detailed the logo was an extension of drawings Leonard started making during his college years.
"Leonard traced his notably large hand, and, inside the hand, drew stylized versions of his initials "KL" and the number that he had worn for much of his career, '2,' " the suit read. "Unbeknownst to Leonard and without his consent, Nike filed an application for copyright registration of his logo and falsely represented in the application that Nike had authored the logo."
"Leonard intends to use the logo on clothing lines, footwear and on other products and, among other things, in connection with sports camps and charity functions, but Nike explicitly has objected to such uses," the lawsuit read.
Leonard initially gave Nike permission to use the logo with restrictions when he had an endorsement deal with the company's subsidiary, Jordan Brand. His deal with the brand ended Sept. 30, 2018 and he signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar deal with New Balance in November.
Leonard was traded from the Spurs to the Raptors in July 2018 amid reports he was unhappy in San Antonio. He has helped lead Toronto to its first NBA Finals, but could leave the team during the free agency period.
The New York Times' Marc Stein reported in May the Clippers had attempted to buy the portion of the rights to the 'Klaw' logo Nike still owned, with plans to give them back to Leonard, as part of their potential free agency pitch.

Meghan Markle isn't Trump's victim and the media are lying

Texto completo: Whenever the national media put forth a new victim to rally behind in the name of the #Resistance, you should suspect you’re being lied to.
The latest is Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. President Trump said in a recent interview that he was unaware Meghan had spoken negatively about him during the 2016 campaign.
A journalist for the British Sun tabloid asked Trump on Sunday ahead of his trip to the U.K., “Are you sorry not to see her? Because she wasn’t so nice during the campaign, I don’t know if you saw that.”
Trump, informed Meghan, originally of Los Angeles, would be on maternity leave, replied, “I didn’t know that. No, I hope she’s OK. I did not know that.”
The journalist goaded Trump, telling him, “She said she’d move to Canada if you got elected; turned out she moved to Britain.”
“That will be good,” Trump said. “A lot of people moving here, so what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty.”
This was boiled down to: Trump calls princess 'nasty'!
Trump had actually added in the interview that “it’s nice” that the United Kingdom now has a princess of American descent and that “she’ll be very good.”
The term “nasty” was used by Trump as a stand-in for the reporter’s original characterization of “wasn’t so nice.”
But you wouldn't know the real story by glancing at the news coverage. Washington Post blogger Eugene Scott said Trump’s “attacks” on Meghan were “familiar and unsurprising,” because his use of the word “nasty” reinforced the belief that Trump “is sexist and misogynistic.” (For the record, here's Trump using the word "nasty" to describe Donny Deutsch, David Gregory, Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Charles Krauthammer, to name a few men.)
See, if you just put forth a claim, whether merited or not, and assert, like Scott, that it’s “rooted” in some belief — any belief! — it becomes true!

Charles Blow, always good for a laugh, acknowledged Sunday in his New York Times column that the question by the Sun journalist was a “set up” for Trump. But Blow knew in his heart that it was a "set up" that "both parties wanted.”
Blow lectured that, “A better journalist, if he or she wanted to have Trump weigh in on [Meghan’s 2016] comments, would simply read Meghan’s response and ask for the president’s response." These are lessons in journalism coming from Blow, who proudly skipped a face-to-face meeting with Trump in 2017.
And outside of journalism, it’s stupidity not limited to Blow.
ABC analyst Matthew Dowd tweeted that Trump “used the word nasty … in reference to her.”
CBS News correspondent Bill Rehkopf tweeted, “He called her ‘nasty.’”
Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty tweeted, “He actually calls her ‘nasty’ in this audio. That is the exact word he uses.”
Ben White of Politico tweeted, “This is literally exactly what he says. ‘I didn’t know that she was nasty.’”
Well, yes. This is “literally exactly” what Trump said the same way this morning I “literally exactly” said “I’ll kill you.” It turns out I didn’t mean I’d literally kill my editor. I only meant that I didn’t agree with his decision to remove my use of the word “teats” from a piece about Michael Avenatti.
The media do this type of thing freely whenever they need a new victim to post up against Trump. They’ll lie about Trump calling immigrants “animals” (he was explicitly referring to MS-13 gang members). They’ll lie about Trump calling European allies “foes” (It was CBS’s Jeff Glor who used the word). And they’ll lie about him mocking a reporter who happens to be disabled.
Meghan isn’t a victim and she wasn’t attacked. She’s a critic of the White House and just like all of them, the media are helping her play dead when she gets a response.

Resumen: We'll take 'Jeopardy!' history for 500, Alex. Who is Emma Boettcher, the contestant who just unseated record-breaking champion James Holzhauer?

Texto completo: All three "Jeopardy!" contestants Monday night answered the final round question correctly. But it was Emma Boettcher who walked away not only with a win and $46,801, but a unique role in show history: the challenger who finally brought down superstar James Holzhauer.
“I lost to a really top-level competitor,” Holzhauer said in an interview with The New York Times. “She played a perfect game. And that was what it took to beat me. ”
Holzhauer came up just $56,484 shy of besting the all-time record set by Ken Jennings for non-tournament play. He made waves on the show by strategically making large bets, and his downfall came partially after placing an uncharacteristically low one in the final round.
The final clue, per the Times: "The line, 'A great reckoning in a little room' in 'As You Like It' is usually taken to refer to this author's premature death. (For those non-English majors, "Who is Kit Marlowe?" was the correct response. )
Boettcher went into the final question $3,200 ahead of Holzhauer. He bet only $1,399, bringing his total for the day to $24,799. She bet $20,201. Her scoreboard flashed a total of $46,801 as Holzhauer walked over to high five his successor.
As a viewer, Boettcher said she kept track of her scores in a notebook, calculating her percentage of right answers.
“I knew going in that Daily Double hunting was something that I could do and feel confident doing,” she told The Times. “I don’t need to be cautious around that. ”
Currently a user-experience librarian at the University of Chicago, Boettcher earned an undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 2014 and a master's two years later from the University of North Carolina.
In the host chat, she told host Alex Trebek she wrote a master's paper on "Jeopardy!" "I ran a series of text-mining experiments to see if a computer could predict how difficult a clue was," based on factors including its length, syntax and audio or visual elements. What did she predict? Trebek wondered. "That it's very hard to do. "
But she knows what goes into building good questions: Her resume cites experience writing "pub quiz-style trivia questions" for the Museum of the American Revolution's History After Hours events.
Musical theater and history buffs alike would love this one: " 'What's Your Name, Man?' was (a category) about the pseudonyms used by Alexander Hamilton," Boettcher shared.

Texto completo: Alan Dershowitz said the use of a special counsel to investigate President Trump was an abuse of our constitutional system.
Special counsel Robert Mueller "knew he could not indict a sitting president under Justice Department regulations. And so, really, the question comes up, ‘Why did we have a special counsel at all?’” Dershowitz said Sunday on Fox News. “Why didn’t we have a nonpartisan independent expert commission looking into Russian efforts to influence our election, which are continuing in the 2020 election? That would have been the way to go, especially in light of the fact that we now know the Justice Department and Mueller concluded the result of this special counsel could not be the indictment of the president.”
The lawyer and professor emeritus said his frustration with the special counsel came in part after Mueller’s press conference last week. Dershowitz believed Mueller’s statement — “if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so” — was inappropriate. He added that he believed the country will not use a special counsel again after the Mueller investigation.
“I suspect we have seen the last special counsel,” Dershowitz said. “I think we have seen the death knell of special prosecutors, special counsel. I think and I hope the Mueller report is the last special counsel report we ever have. It’s inconsistent with the role of prosecutors. It’s inconsistent with the presumption of innocence. And it’s inconsistent with the constitutional system of separation of powers.”
Dershowitz also said Sunday, in a radio interview with John Catsimatidis on AM 970 in New York, that the U.S. had gone too far in trying to extradite Julian Assange.
”I think the Trump administration has overplayed its hand,” Dershowitz said. “They had a very strong case for extradition when they initially accused him … of breaking into a password [protected system] and stealing materials. That’s a crime."
"But publishing materials? That's the New York Times and the Washington Post, and I think Great Britain is going to have a lot of difficulty extraditing Assange to the U.S. to face trial for merely publishing information stolen not by him but by others," he said.
The administration, which is seeking to extradite Assange to the U.S., is planning on charging the WikiLeaks founder under the Espionage Act rather than for leaking CIA spying tools.

Texto completo: A peculiar thing about The New York Times's photo archive is how many acres of it are devoted to nothing. The Great Flood, the Moon Landing, I Have a Dream, Honey Boo Boo -- absolutely. But also: rainy streets, forlorn bus stops, beefy pipe fitters, decaying wall posters, imprudent beach attire. A lost shoe that tells you everything you need to know about Bloomberg-era New York.
Drawer after drawer after terabyte of them. Did any photo editor from The Times ever say, "Get me pictures of balloons on a subway platform?" Not likely. Staff photographers, when not shooting the things that make people move to the city, record the stuff that defines life once you arrive.
That manhole cover when you're leaving the club at 4 a.m.? That dinner party where people seem to have gotten different messages about the dress code? That dog owner who thinks her pet is hot stuff, when, whatever? We've all been there, and the chances are that a photographer was there with a camera.
If you have ever pumped a quarter into a flying elephant outside a Chinatown drugstore and watched your child have the time of her life, we've got a photo for you.
Hearts break, batteries fail, rain happens, animals appear, machines grind and people find the darnedest ways to amuse themselves. Photographers from The Times capture all of it. Sometimes it involves signs in foreign languages. Also, dogs and/or food. The volume of images is staggering.
It's what happens when you turn a bunch of talented staff photographers loose in a city as visually cacophonous as New York. They take liberties. They don't listen to reason. You send them to shoot a City Council news conference in Woodside, Queens, and they come back with three teenagers on a crumbly stoop, drinking Cokes out of long-necked bottles, or a plastic bag stranded in a tree. Who asked for that?
Yet that's New York, isn't it? It's the stuff you're too busy to notice, or you can't get to because you can't be everywhere. It's what idle hands do when they happen to belong to Pulitzer Prize-winning photographers and there's a camera on them and nothing else to do. Did you see the reflection of that neon sign in the flooded pothole? Click. Click click click.
If you licked these pictures they would taste like New York. Which is why you don't lick them.
Five hundred of these photos, including the ones seen here, are gathered in a new book called "Only in New York." They cover more than a century in the city, in sickness and in health. Mostly, they're glimpses of the ordinary in a city that is anything but. Sometimes the moment is more than that.
If you've ever wondered whether Maya Angelou and Amiri Baraka could cut a rug, you'll find the answer to that and other mysteries within.
Though, really: Shame on you for doubting.

Texto completo: Por un precio inicial de $3.4 millones de dólares, los fanáticos de la exitosa serie de HBO “The Sopranos” (1999-2007) pueden soñar con comprar la casa del mafioso principal, Tony (James Gandolfini).
Según The New York Times, la propiedad de aproximadamente 5,600 pies cuadrados, ubicada en 14 Aspen Drive en North Caldwell (NJ), ha sido colocada en el mercado.
La casa aparecía en los créditos de apertura del programa, cuando Tony se detiene en el camino curvo. Otras partes, como la cocina y un patio al aire libre, también aparecieron en el programa piloto. Más tarde se reprodujo para filmar escenas de interiores en un estudio en Queens.
Durante las seis temporadas del programa, la casa original se usó entre 30 y 50 veces. Las diversas escenas están bien documentadas en una guía en línea de los lugares de rodaje de “Los Sopranos”.
Muchos fanáticos se acercan para hacer fotos. Los propietarios son Victor y Patti Recchia, quienes se negaron a comentar cuánto les pagó HBO por usar su casa.
Victor, quien dirige Fourth Generation Construction, construyó en 1987 la casa de cuatro habitaciones y 4 baños y medio (con más de 20 en las cercanías).
La pareja le dijo al Times que ya no necesitan tanto espacio desde que su hijo adulto se mudó. Piensan quedarse en Nueva Jersey después de la venta.
Debido a que no están utilizando un corredor inmobiliario, la pareja les pide a los compradores calificados que envíen ofertas y comprobantes de fondos antes del 21 de junio al correo electrónico sopranoshouseforsale@gmail.com
