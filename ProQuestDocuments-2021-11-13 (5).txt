During her second day ever on a film set, Jo Ellen Pellman came face to face with an irate Meryl Streep.
“You owe me a house!” Streep, a three-time Oscar winner snarled, eyes flashing, as she ripped off her blazer and lunged at the 24-year-old ingénue.
Pellman’s eyes widened. “I’m so sorry!” she said, holding up a hand in apology.
“And … cut!”
Pellman was playing Emma Nolan, a high school student in a close-minded Indiana town who wants to take her girlfriend to the prom in the Netflix adaptation of the musical “The Prom.” Like Emma, Pellman is a Midwesterner who identifies as queer. But unlike her character, the young actress grew up in a supportive environment that has affected how she views the film’s potential.
“For young people who identify as LGBTQ, I hope it can be a two-hour break from all that’s happening in the world,” she said. “Like, ‘It’s going to be OK. My people are out there.’”
Still, this is her first film role, it happens to be the lead, and her co-stars — including Streep, James Corden and Nicole Kidman as narcissistic Broadway actors who parachute in to help her character — are names she has long looked up to.
Pellman projected complete confidence in the presence of the stars, Ryan Murphy, the film’s director, said.
“She had no fear,” even though her experience until then had consisted of roles like Girl No. 2 in an episode of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”
Murphy, on the other hand, whose credits include “American Horror Story” and “Pose,” said, “I was so nervous the first time I directed Meryl Streep — I think I did four takes. I was trembling.”
Pellman said she was hardly immune to Streep’s star power.
“I love that that’s the way it came across,” she said, grinning during a Zoom interview last month from home in Cincinnati, where she has been living with her mom since March. “Inside, I was like ‘OMG, that’s Meryl Streep!’”
It took Murphy all of one meeting to decide Pellman was his Emma.
“I watched her tape, and I knew,” he said. “She had that mixture of soul and spunk and spirit — and that amazing smile.”
Pellman, a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, was working three jobs while going to open calls in New York City when she heard about the nationwide search to cast the role.
“It felt like a long shot,” she said. But Pellman, as a queer woman herself, connected with Emma’s optimism and determination when she saw the play on Broadway with Caitlin Kinnunen in the part.
She didn’t know until shortly before her meeting with Murphy that Ariana DeBose, who plays Emma’s girlfriend, Alyssa Green, would be the only other actress there. “I saw Ariana’s name on the call sheet, and I freaked out because she’s someone I’ve looked up to my whole career,” she said.
But Murphy said that if Pellman was nervous, she didn’t let on.
“As soon as Jo Ellen talked about her life, she didn’t even have to read,” he said. “She spoke very movingly about being a queer woman and having a gay single mom who raised her. I remember she walked out and I was just like, ‘Thank God that’s over. We’ve found our girl.’”
Pellman was less sure. But she did get one hint at her interview. “He hugged us at the end of the audition,” she said. “When does that ever happen? A Ryan Murphy hug? That’s huge!”
When Murphy called the next day to tell Pellman she’d landed her dream role, she was perusing the coats at a thrift shop. The first person she called was her mother. Or, rather, tried to.
Monica Pellman didn’t pick up.
It was a rare absence for the woman Pellman credits with raising her in a supportive, LGBTQ-affirming household — an experience that she’s grateful diverges from Emma’s.
“When I came out my senior year of high school, it was no big deal,” she said. “I just blurted out one night while watching TV, 'Mom, I think I’m queer.' And she was like, ‘That’s completely fine.’ She just wanted me to be happy.”
Pellman’s mother, whom she calls “pretty much the coolest person ever,” declined to be interviewed for this article. But she was an unseen presence during our November conversation, laughing at her daughter’s confession that she can speak fluent Ubbi Dubbi, the gibberish language popularized by the PBS program “Zoom,” and handing Pellman tissues when she choked up talking about an emotional moment in the film when Emma declares she has never felt so alone in her life.
Unlike Emma, Pellman was not an outcast growing up in Cincinnati, which is a far cry from Edgewater, Indiana, the film’s fictional setting. She characterizes her high school as “pretty progressive.” Most of her close friends were gay, she said, adding, “I’m lucky because I was never bullied.”
It was that affirmation that she drew from in her portrayal of Emma as a forceful — if reluctant — leader who comes into her own over the course of the film.
“It’s the best feeling in the world, knowing I can bring my authentic self to the role,” Pellman said. “And not just be accepted, but celebrated.”
“When she called to tell me she got the role, there was a certain rightness in the world,” Brent Wagner, who recently retired as chair of the University of Michigan’s musical theater department, said. “Because if she hadn’t gotten it, she’d be out there fighting for the Emmas of the world.”
She and DeBose, 29, a fellow queer woman whom Pellman calls “the one person who always knows exactly what I’m going through,” co-founded the Unruly Hearts Initiative to connect young LGBTQ people with organizations that help provide housing, mental health services and mentorship.
That isn’t the only time she has shared her talents. In 2017, she traveled to India, conducting theater workshops in Mumbai with incarcerated women and victims of human trafficking.
Pellman proudly points out that this is not her first appearance in The New York Times: She was featured in a 2019 article about a fight to get a refund of the $1,200 she and her roommate had paid in dubious apartment application fees.
“And I won!” she said.
Despite the praise heaped on her recently — Kidman, in an email, referred to her “1940s movie star face”— Pellman has Selina Meyer’s mouth. “During the scene when I have all these dodgeballs thrown at me by members of the crew, I got hit in the face really hard,” she said, and reflexively screamed an epithet back. “It was very funny. Everyone laughed.”
DeBose said Pellman was the person on set who brought people together — and that they talk on FaceTime regularly. “She’s Emma 2.0,” she said. “She’s great at cultivating community and is the person who rallied the troops.”
Pellman said she hopes the film speaks directly to young people who identify as LGBTQ. “I hope they’re like, ‘I’m worthy of a happy ending,’” she said.

WASHINGTON — The Senate on Friday approved a one-week stopgap bill to fund the government, buying additional time for negotiators to reach agreement on both a catchall government spending package and a coronavirus aid plan to address the economic toll of the pandemic.
President Donald Trump has to sign the bill or funding runs out at midnight, and the government would shut down.
While lawmakers and staff on Capitol Hill continue to haggle over an aid plan, the two policy divides that have long impaired a coronavirus relief deal — a Republican insistence on sweeping coronavirus liability protections and Democratic demands for state and local funding — remain sticking points. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, has suggested jettisoning both provisions to get a swift agreement on a narrower package, but many lawmakers are reluctant to resort to that.
Democratic leaders have said the starting point for talks should be a $908 billion bipartisan compromise being drafted by a group of moderates. It would include limited liability protections, $160 billion in state and local funding, $288 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program that extends loans to small businesses, and $300-a-week supplemental federal jobless payments until the spring. The proposal, for now, does not include direct payments from stimulus checks.
“These problems don’t go away,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is part of the group that is working on the bipartisan plan. “If anything, they just get bigger. So if we can just stick to it, get a proposal that we can advance that resolves not only goals like unemployment, PPP, food security, but also the state and local and tribal and the liability issue — this is what we’ve been working on. This is what we need to keep doing.”

It’s Not Just You: Picking a Health Insurance Plan Is Really Hard

Anya Samek, an economist, has found that consumers make better choices among health plans when presented with a few simple calculations. So when she switched jobs last year and had to choose a plan herself, she tried entering the various plan features into a spreadsheet to replicate her tool. She gave up, determining the task too complicated.
“I picked a plan because in my research I tend to show that high-deductible plans do better for people,” said Samek, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. “But it’s just a guess.”
When Paul Krugman, the Nobel-winning economist and a New York Times columnist, started a teaching job at the City University of New York, he had a choice between one union health plan at The Times and an array of university options, “which I found incomprehensible,” he said in an email.
“I asked HR at CUNY if they could explain the differences; they said no. So I went with The Times, precisely because it didn’t require that I make a choice!”
For most Americans, with or without a doctorate in economics, right now is the time to pick your health insurance. Medicare beneficiaries can choose a Medicare Advantage plan or a Part D prescription drug plan. People with coverage at work can choose from the options their employers offer. People who buy their own insurance can make a choice on the Affordable Care Act marketplace in their state. In Seminole County, Florida, right now, Obamacare customers can choose among 174 different health plans.
The range of choice is generally heralded as a good thing: Not everyone wants the same plan, the thinking goes, so offering multiple options helps people shop for the one that is best for them. That logic drove the creation of Medicare Advantage, with legislation passed by Republicans, and drove the design of "Obamacare," with legislation passed by Democrats.
But it turns out in real life most people are terrible at picking the health plan that is right for them. Health insurance is a complicated financial product, and study after study has shown that people routinely pick bad plans, even choosing options that leave them worse off financially in every possible scenario. And, because people are so bad at choosing good plans, the market often sends weird signals to insurance companies, encouraging them to offer more of the wrong plans instead of the right ones.
People struggle to make good choices when it comes to all kinds of financial products, but health insurance is especially confusing, with its mix of technical benefits and fees. Many Americans don’t understand terms like “deductible” or “coinsurance” very well. And few are good at predicting what sort of health care needs they will have in the coming year. Picking an ideal health plan requires combining all of these features — knowing what you might use, what it might cost you, and how those expenses combine with the plan’s monthly premium.
Online brokerages have found that recommending certain plans has a huge effect on what people pick, a sign that few people are doing this complex math themselves. Noah Lang, the CEO of Stride Health, which helps people shop for health plans, including "Obamacare" plans, said so many people would pick the first plan presented to them that the company changed its website to offer a handful of recommended “green” plans. Last year, more than 70% of customers bought one of those plans.
“People want advice, they want guidance,” Lang said. “And it’s pretty hard.”
The people most likely to make bad choices appear to be those least able to afford it. A recent study in the Netherlands, which offers insurance to everyone through an "Obamacare"-like marketplace, found that only 5% of Dutch customers did a better job at choosing an ideal plan than they would have by choosing a plan at random. And the people in that top 5% tended to be have college degrees and jobs in technical fields. People with less education and income, who tend to be in worse health, were very likely to choose a plan that cost them more to cover their health care — a situation that might leave them skimping on needed medicine or procedures.
But even highly educated Dutch professionals struggled. People who worked in the insurance industry and had advanced degrees made a good choice about 30% of the time. And only about 40% of trained statisticians — the group with the best performance — chose good plans for their needs.
In the United States, a working paper has found that many professionals who help people select health insurance are also bad at picking plans, performing substantially worse than a computer algorithm.
“These people who are supposed to make the market work can’t do it at all,” said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who was a co-author on both studies. Kolstad said the work had made him reconsider why we value markets for health insurance so highly when they are so hard to use.
Picking a plan is hard, but some simple guidelines can help a little. It’s helpful to know whether a given plan covers the doctors and hospitals you use, for example. And if you’re willing to take more financial risk, you may prefer a higher-deductible plan with lower premiums, while if you value more predictable expenses, a lower-deductible plan may work better. But people’s actual health care needs and insurance fine print vary enough that those guides can lead you astray. The literature shows that it’s not uncommon for people to choose a plan that costs them $1,000 more than the best plan, over the course of the year.
Most of the research on plan choice looks at the financial design of the plan. Researchers can look at the options, then see which health services people end up using, and can tally total costs for various choices. That approach leaves out some other elements of health plans, like the choice of doctors, or whether the company offers good customer service. The study on brokers found that people whose plan selection was aided by the computer program were less likely to switch plans the next year than those who took the unassisted advice of the broker, a sign that they were happier with the overall package.
But what is the alternative to choice? Amanda Starc, an associate professor of management at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, said there was evidence that people really did want different things from health insurance. About a third of people 65 and older are currently enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans, a share that is large enough to suggest that many would be less happy with only the choice of government Medicare.
“I don’t think the answer is obvious, and yet I think there is real value in choice,” said Starc, whose recent work shows that some Medicare Advantage plans may leave patients better off than others in terms of health, not just finances. She, like Kolstad, thought tools like the broker algorithm could steer people into better options.
But she acknowledged the difficulty. Colleagues and family friends frequently ask her for advice about the best health plan. She tends to steer her higher-earning professor colleagues to a high-deductible plan that covers the university’s hospitals, figuring they can afford it. Finding the best choice for other people, she said, requires more work.
“Whenever anybody asks me about this, I say my dad is the only Medicare beneficiary who could figure this out, because he could call me,” she said.
Other economists use the same rules of thumb that cause many Americans to choose bad plans: They pick a plan based on simple features, select a preferred brand, or ask their friends.
Brigitte Madrian, the dean of the Marriott School of Business at Brigham Young University, has also studied health insurance, but she said picking a plan for her family when she arrived in Utah was a heavy lift. She set aside an entire Saturday for the task, scouring websites and constructing spreadsheets. Ultimately, she asked her fellow health economists what they had chosen.
“If I’m having a hard time, what is the rest of the population doing?” she said she wondered. “They must be throwing darts.”

Andrew Yang, the former tech executive who gained a national following as a Democratic presidential candidate, has been privately telling New York City leaders that he intends to run for mayor next year.
Yang is not expected to announce his bid until next month, but with the Democratic primary less than seven months away, he has begun to make overtures to several of the city’s political power brokers.
He met with Corey Johnson, speaker of the City Council, in a video call Tuesday to seek his advice about running for mayor.
He plans to visit the Rev. Al Sharpton, the Harlem kingmaker — a rite of passage for any serious candidate — in person next week when he returns to the city from Georgia, where he has been trying to help Democrats win the U.S. Senate.
He has enlisted Bradley Tusk and Chris Coffey, prominent political strategists who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as advisers.
Yang, whose presidential campaign was centered around offering every American a universal basic income, could shake up a race that has a large field of candidates and no clear front-runner.
He would be only the second Asian American candidate to run for mayor and appear on the ballot, following a bid in 2013 by John Liu, a state senator from Queens who was then the city’s comptroller. Arthur Chang, a J.P. Morgan executive who led NYC Votes, the Campaign Finance Board’s voter outreach program, is also planning to run.
Yang, who has temporarily relocated to Georgia to campaign for the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — both facing runoffs next month for U.S. Senate seats — declined to say Thursday if he was running for mayor.
“I’m thrilled that people seem excited about my doing what I can to help, but no, right now I’m focused on these Senate races in Georgia,” he said in an interview.
While his name recognition and fundraising potential could easily put him in the top tier of mayoral candidates, Yang has never run for office in New York City. He will have to learn quickly about the thorny issues that can animate voters, from rezoning proposals for the SoHo and Flushing, Queens, neighborhoods to the debate over the admissions exam for the city’s elite high schools that has pitted some Asian American families against Black and Hispanic students.
At the same time, celebrity status and Twitter buzz do not always translate into votes in New York — Cynthia Nixon gained a lot of attention but not enough voters in her failed run for governor in 2018.
Yang will also be jockeying for endorsements along with more than a dozen candidates, some of whom have been courting elected officials and unions for years in anticipation of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s exit next year because of term limits.
Two candidates have been mainstays in New York politics: Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president; and Scott Stringer, the city comptroller. Others are positioning themselves as outsiders, including Raymond J. McGuire, a business executive; and Maya Wiley, a lawyer and former MSNBC analyst.
And Thursday, Rep. Max Rose, who lost his reelection bid last month and was said to be interested in joining the mayor’s race, registered a mayoral campaign committee with the city’s Campaign Finance Board.
The pandemic has reshaped the mayor’s race, and the candidates are all trying to argue that they are the best qualified to help the city recover. The field is also perhaps the most diverse ever, including several Black and Latino candidates.
Yang, who was born in upstate New York, has spent most of his adult life living in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. He gained attention on the campaign trail with his MATH slogan — “Make America Think Harder” — and amassed 1.8 million followers on Twitter and nearly $40 million in campaign contributions.
His campaign to give every American adult $1,000 a month as part of a universal basic income mandate could be even more popular after many people relied on the federal stimulus to help survive the economic losses of the pandemic, said Susan Kang, a political-science professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.
“His brand is very zeitgeisty in many ways,” she said. “He’s made a name for himself by promoting universal programs at a time when everyone needs universal programs.”
Earlier this year, Yang did not rule out a run in an interview with The New York Times.
“Certainly the mayor of New York City can do a lot of good,” he said. “So that is something that I have to take a long look at.”
Not long after, Yang publicly flirted with the idea of running for mayor, but his deliberations have recently grown more serious. He spoke with Johnson, who dropped out of the mayor’s race in September after struggling with depression.
He also called Rep. Grace Meng from Queens, the first Asian American member of the state’s congressional delegation and a top official for the Democratic National Committee. The conversations were confirmed by two people who were familiar with the, but who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
A spokeswoman for Sharpton, Rachel Noerdlinger, confirmed his plans to meet with Yang next week.
Tusk was a campaign manager for Bloomberg in 2009 and has been a prominent critic of de Blasio. In 2016, a year before de Blasio won reelection, Tusk led a public search for a Democratic candidate to unseat him.
After leaving the presidential race, Yang, who led a test-prep company and a nonprofit organization, created Humanity Forward, a New York-based nonprofit that is distributing money to needy families in the Bronx.
Yang performed well in a recent poll, receiving 20% of support as the top choice among 1,000 likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 14% for Adams and 11% for Stringer. The poll was conducted by Slingshot Strategies, a political firm that has worked for candidates like Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate. Yang did not hire the firm; a private client did, according to the firm.
“It’s always encouraging when people are excited about you,” Yang said of the poll results.
The race for an executive job like mayor often comes down to personality, rather than policies, and Yang, like all the candidates, will have to establish an emotional relationship with voters, Kang said.
“To what extent can he project warmth, humor and competence?” she asked.

More than 6,600 college athletes, coaches and staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus this year, a dispiriting measure of the pathogen’s reach across the United States and its spread among some of the country’s most closely monitored people.
At least 6,629 people who play and work in athletic departments that compete in college football’s premier leagues have contracted the virus, according to a New York Times analysis. The vast majority of those infections have been reported since Aug. 15, as players, coaches and the staff members around them prepared for and navigated the fall semester, including football season.
The actual tally of cases is assuredly far larger than what is shown by The Times’ count, the most comprehensive public measure of the virus in college sports. The Times was able to gather complete data for just 78 of the 130 universities in the NCAA’s Football Bowl Subdivision, the top level of college football. Some of those schools released the pandemic statistics only in response to requests filed under public records laws.
The remaining schools, many of them public institutions, released no statistics or limited information about their athletic departments, or they stopped providing data just before football season. This had the effect of drawing a curtain of secrecy around college sports during the gravest public health crisis in the United States in a century. No athletic department that shared data reported any deaths associated with the virus, the spread of which the NCAA did not track at its member schools.
“We felt there was nothing to hide,” said Barry Alvarez, the athletic director at Wisconsin, which recorded at least 112 cases in athletics, missed back-to-back football games during an outbreak and had a third game — against Minnesota — canceled because of cases within its program. “We felt that it was in our best interest and everyone else’s best interest to put out accurate information, particularly if we had to cancel a game, so you wouldn’t have rumors or misinformation,” Alvarez said.
The cases in athletic departments are only a fraction of those in a country that has recorded more than 15 million infections — the most of any nation. Still, they collectively demonstrate how the virus can intrude on programs even when they have stringent safety protocols, including widespread testing. Indeed, the Big Ten Conference, which required its athletes and coaches to submit to daily testing, had the most known cases of any top league and saw some of the worst outbreaks in college sports.
Raw numerical figures like the ones universities have provided cannot reveal the origins of any single infection or cluster of cases. An athlete could have easily contracted the virus from a friend or relative rather than a teammate. And experts believe that virtually none of the infections in college sports are linked to the games themselves. Rather, they are far more often traceable to meetings, meals, travel or nonathletic activities that then seed cases.
But it is also true the college sports industry, partly hampered by a disjointed system of governance that is particularly acute in football, has developed only so much of a shared strategy to combat the pandemic’s risks.
Testing standards vary from one conference to the next. So do league policies on matters like whether spectators can attend games, how to reinstate players who are sidelined by the virus, and when teams can postpone or cancel games. The NCAA has health guidelines, but many of them are only recommendations.
A survey the National Athletic Trainers’ Association released in September found that not even half believed that coaches and staff members across college sports were “fully compliant” with safety protocols related to the virus. And university leaders have routinely hidden their deliberations and debates from public view.
The NCAA, whose oftentimes limited power over its leagues and schools has been conspicuous throughout the pandemic, said in a statement to The Times that “medical data is governed by a variety of federal and state regulations and, for that reason, access and use are determined at the institutional level.” It added that more than a dozen of its members had shared information with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “for the purpose of better understanding resocialization as it pertains to quarantine and testing.”
The data gathered by The Times, though, shows at least some of the consequences and risks of a porous, multibillion-dollar athletic network centered on college campuses. Although five members withheld complete data, schools in the Big Ten, which includes 14 universities, collectively acknowledged at least 1,850 infections, the most of any league.
Minnesota reported 336 cases in its athletic department, more than any other school in the FBS, including 176 in November alone. Iowa, also a Big Ten member, has disclosed 330 positive tests.
Although the Big Ten struggled with the virus, especially as the pandemic raged through its Midwest-centric footprint, the data shows at least the partial extent of the struggles in other leagues’ athletic departments.
Athletic departments in the Big 12 Conference, which has 10 schools, for instance, reported at least 1,357 cases. And although most members of the Southeastern Conference, the college football league that many people fear, respect and revile in equal measure, refused to provide complete data, The Times found at least 587 cases in its athletic departments.
Members of the Pac-12 Conference — last of the Power Five conferences to start its football season — reported 357 cases within athletics, and Atlantic Coast Conference schools disclosed 809.
A handful of athletic departments reported only the number of positive tests, not unique cases, meaning it is possible that some individuals were counted multiple times. Other schools did not specify whether they were counting tests or cases. The Times excluded all numbers from those schools — nearly 1,400 positive tests — from its national total.
The ranks of the infected have included some of the most prominent figures in college athletics. In football, coaches Nick Saban of Alabama and Ryan Day of Ohio State tested positive and spent days in isolation. Tom Izzo, the men’s basketball coach at Michigan State, tested positive, as did Jim Boeheim of Syracuse and Scott Drew of Baylor. At least three of the Southeastern Conference’s athletic directors tested positive. Universities have only rarely identified players who contracted the virus, as Clemson did when it announced that Trevor Lawrence, a quarterback who could be one of the most coveted players in next year’s NFL draft, had tested positive.
Clemson is among the schools that have proactively released regular tallies of cases within its athletic programs.
“We understand there is public interest in our department’s results, and felt that in this matter of public health, transparency was the best way to operate,” Jeff Kallin, a spokesperson for the athletic department, said in an email.
Clemson’s opponent in the Dec. 19 ACC championship game, Notre Dame, also issued regular updates about cases among its ranks.
“We have nothing to hide,” Brian Kelly, the football coach at Notre Dame, said in October. “We’re fighting through this coronavirus like everybody else.”
He added: “We felt like if we were going to hide numbers, there would be a sense of distrust, and we didn’t want to start with that. We wanted to start with transparency and get the numbers out there and let everybody know that we would.”
Dozens of other schools did not.
By late July, The Times had found at least 630 cases in athletic departments on 68 campuses. The University of North Carolina had reported 37 infections, for instance, and Western Kentucky University said it had just six.
But those schools were among the 13 that stopped releasing statistics about cases within their athletic programs. Indeed, some schools changed their approaches as the start of football season neared, abruptly citing privacy laws to justify withholding the very data they had provided for weeks or months. A handful offered no explanation at all.
Others, like North Carolina, said they had ultimately opted to disclose cases only through campuswide counts. Those tallies could not be used to assess the reach of the virus exclusively within athletic departments.
The University of Central Florida also merged its athletics data with broader campus counts, a change it made after players worried that infected students would be easily identified on game day, Danny White, the university’s athletic director, said this fall.
“We’re trying to listen to our student-athletes,” White said in an interview with The Orlando Sentinel.
Nineteen universities, including Coastal Carolina, Louisiana State and Northwestern, consistently declined or ignored requests for information, and The Times could not locate any case data released by those schools. Many of the schools that explicitly rejected requests offered no explanations for their decisions.
Alvarez was unsurprised that some schools had held back. As a former football coach, he said he understood. But he also said he and others at Wisconsin had concluded that ordinary hesitations should not always apply in 2020.
“I think coaches are reluctant sometimes to give out a scouting report, et cetera,” Alvarez said. “That’s old school. A lot of coaches are paranoid — that comes with the business — but we felt this was more serious.”

German Cultural Leaders Warn Against Ban on Israel Sanctions Movement

BERLIN — For months, the leaders of dozens of Germany’s most prominent cultural institutions met in secret, swapping stories of self-censorship, of hours spent worrying about the social media histories of artists or scholars they wanted to invite to their programs, and fears for their futures, if they slipped up.
Their concern? That they or their institutions could face charges of anti-Semitism over links — real or perceived — to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, widely known as BDS. That’s what happened earlier this year to a prominent Cameroonian philosopher, who was disinvited from addressing a high-profile arts festival in Germany for drawing parallels between the situation of Palestinians and apartheid in South Africa in his writing.
The striking of Achille Mbembe from the program of the Ruhrtreinniale, in May, led to a monthslong public debate here, in which the relationship of genocide and colonialism to the Holocaust, and Germany’s special relationship to Israel, all came into question. It also sparked the cultural leaders’ decision to go public with their fears that the discussion was taking an unwelcome turn.
At a news conference in Berlin on Thursday, the directors of 32 institutions released an open letter in which they rejected the sanctions movement. “At the same time,” the letter added, “we consider the logic of a counter-boycott, triggered by the parliamentary anti-BDS resolution, to be dangerous.”
They were referring to a resolution passed by the German parliament in May 2019 that designated the sanctions campaign as anti-Semitic. The advisory declaration called on all Germany’s states and municipalities to deny public funding to any institution that “actively supports” the movement or questions the right of the state of Israel to exist.
But instead of curbing anti-Semitism, the resolution has stifled the open exchange of ideas in the public sphere and freedom of expression in the arts, both of which are guaranteed by Germany’s constitution, the open letter’s signatories said.
“Cultural exchange does not work by deciding who we are allowed to talk about and who we aren’t,” said one of the signatories, Johannes Ebert, secretary-general of the Goethe Institute, an organization that promotes German culture abroad. “Especially in international cultural exchange, you have to listen closely; you have to be willing to speak to people whose positions you don’t share.”
The directors of the Berliner Festspiele, the Humboldt Forum and the Federal Cultural Foundation, along with the leaders of theaters, museums and institutes for Jewish cultural studies from across the country, are among those who signed the appeal.
Monika Grütters, Germany’s minister for culture, said in response to the letter that cultural institutions always walk a tightrope between artistic freedoms and the limits of what is acceptable in society. But red lines exist, she said, and one of them is anti-Semitism.
The German government’s view was that there are “rules applying to contentious and controversial debates. With regard to Israel, these include unequivocal recognition of Israel’s right to exist,” Grütters said through a spokesperson. Germany “rejects anti-Semitism and the denial or trivialization of the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,” the spokesperson added.
Germany is not alone at finding its political discourse upended by the debate over the Israel sanctions movement. But whereas in the United States and Britain the focus is on college campuses, in Germany, it is in the cultural sphere, which depends heavily on government funding, that the dispute comes into sharpest relief.
Months after the 2019 resolution was passed, the director of Berlin’s Jewish Museum, Peter Schäfer, quit his post amid criticism that he had become too politically involved in the battle over the sanctions movement. The previous year, Scottish rappers Young Fathers were removed from the lineup of the Ruhrtriennale over their public support for it.
Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger, director of the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study, an interdisciplinary research institute, said the resolution limited the mandates of organizations like hers, which encourage the free exchange of ideas among scholars.
“If we were to take this resolution literally, then we could not invite many Jewish and Palestinian Israeli intellectuals who oppose the human rights violations of their own government,” said Stollberg-Rilinger, another signatory of Thursday’s open letter.
Felix Klein, Germany’s government-appointed commissioner for fighting anti-Semitism, defended the resolution as an important symbol of the country’s unequivocal rejection of anti-Jewish sentiment in all its forms and its unwavering support for Israel’s right to exist.
“Our democracy is a militant democracy,” said Klein, whose pronouncement of Mbembe as anti-Semitic fueled the debate over the Cameroonian philosopher’s dismissal earlier this year. “It is deliberately against such displays of intolerance.”
He said that he was surprised the cultural leaders decided to make a public pronouncement about their difficulties with the resolution, without ever discussing them with him first.
Yehudit Yinhar, a Jewish Israeli student at the Weissensee Art Academy, learned firsthand how the resolution could be interpreted when she found herself, along with the other members of a project she jointly organized called “School for Unlearning Zionism,” facing accusations of anti-Semitism.
“We want to do our own homework, teaching ourselves about power and privilege,” she said of the events, which consisted of 12 online lectures and public discussions, with titles such as “Zionism as Settler Colonialism.” Participants were encouraged to explore what Yinhar described as “perspectives outside of the language of power” that were learned growing up in Israel.
Instead, the group found its website, which was hosted by the academy, taken offline after accusations of links to the sanctions movement among some of its members surfaced, first in the Israeli and then in the German news media. “No taxpayer money should be used to delegitimize Israel,” the American Jewish Committee Berlin said in a statement on Twitter, pointing out that the Weissensee Art Academy is publicly funded.
A description of the project is now listed on the site of the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, which documents anti-Semitic attacks in Germany. There, it joins reports of police officers circulating Nazi symbols in a chat group and a violent attack on a Jewish student wearing a skullcap in Hamburg.
“The claim of anti-Semitism toward us and our project is violent,” Yinhar said. She declined to comment on the sanctions movement.
“It feels like a group of Jewish Israelis doing research on their own collective story are being told by the white German institutions they can’t do that,” she said. “As if they have the right to set the conditions on which we are allowed to define our own history and participate in public discourse.”
Harassment of individuals, often starting on social media, has become widespread as a result of the parliamentary resolution, said Bernd Scherer, director of the House of World Cultures, a Berlin exhibition space.
“Although the resolution mentions nothing about individuals, what we have seen is that it usually how it is carried out,” Scherer said.
In addition to denying financial support, the resolution calls on states and municipalities to make public spaces off limits for events involving supporters of the sanctions movement. The Bavarian capital of Munich implemented such a ban already in 2017.
The following year, when a citizen sought to organize a public debate on the local ban in Munich’s City Museum, local authorities refused to allow it to proceed, on grounds that the movement would be discussed.
Last month, a higher Bavarian court ruled that this decision violated the constitutional right to freedom of expression, adding that an event could not be banned in anticipation of what might be said at it.
The city has said it will appeal the ruling, but the rebuke was welcomed by the 32 cultural leaders, who said it gave credence to their argument.
“We want to show that we have a problem with carrying out this resolution,” said Hortensia Völckers, artistic director of the Federal Cultural Foundation, who signed the open letter. “We need to have a discussion with political leaders to make it clear.”

Just after Valentine’s Day in 2019, musician FKA twigs was in a car speeding toward Los Angeles. At the wheel was her boyfriend, actor Shia LaBeouf. He was driving recklessly, she said in a lawsuit filed Friday, removing his seat belt and threatening to crash unless she professed her love for him.
They were returning from the desert, where LaBeouf, star of “Transformers,” had raged at her throughout the trip, FKA twigs said in the lawsuit, once waking her up in the middle of the night, choking her. After she begged to be let out of the car, she said he pulled over at a gas station, and she took her bags from the trunk. But LaBeouf followed and assaulted her, throwing her against the car while screaming in her face, according to the suit. He then forced her back in the car.
The gas station incident is at the heart of the lawsuit that says LaBeouf, 34, abused FKA twigs physically, emotionally and mentally many times in a relationship that lasted just short of a year. Her aim in coming forward, she said in an interview, was to explain how even a critically acclaimed artist with money, a home and a strong network of supporters could be caught in such a cycle.
“I’d like to be able to raise awareness on the tactics that abusers use to control you and take away your agency,” FKA twigs, 32, born Tahliah Debrett Barnett, said.
LaBeouf responded Thursday to the concerns raised by Barnett, and a second former girlfriend who has accused him of abusive behavior, in an email that broadly addressed his conduct.
“I’m not in any position to tell anyone how my behavior made them feel,” he said in an email to The New York Times. “I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalizations. I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. I’m ashamed of that history and am sorry to those I hurt. There is nothing else I can really say.”
The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, says that LaBeouf knowingly gave Barnett a sexually transmitted disease. It accuses him of “relentless abuse,” including sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress.
LaBeouf and his representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.
Karolyn Pho, a stylist who is another of LaBeouf’s former girlfriends, described similarly tumultuous experiences to The Times, some of which are also outlined in the lawsuit. Once, the suit says, he drunkenly pinned her to a bed and head-butted her, enough that she bled. Afterward, she began to grapple with the idea that he was abusing her. “So much goes into breaking down a man or woman to make them OK with a certain kind of treatment,” she said in an interview.
Presented with a detailed account of the claims that the women made against him, in interviews and subsequently in the lawsuit, LaBeouf, responding in a separate email, wrote that “many of these allegations are not true.” But, he continued, he owed the women “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and accept accountability for those things I have done.”
He added that he was “a sober member of a 12-step program” and in therapy. “I am not cured of my PTSD and alcoholism," he wrote, “but I am committed to doing what I need to do to recover, and I will forever be sorry to the people that I may have harmed along the way.”
LaBeouf has a long history of turbulent behavior. He has been arrested several times on charges that have been dismissed, including assault and disorderly conduct, according to newspaper reports and public records. In 2015, strangers recorded video of him arguing with his girlfriend at the time, actress Mia Goth, telling her, “This is the kind of thing that makes a person abusive.” After the men recording LaBeouf gave him a ride, he told them that “if I’d have stayed there, I would’ve killed her,” according to the video.
Barnett said LaBeouf would squeeze or grab her to the point of bruising. But she did not go to the police, she said, first out of a misguided concern about harming his career, and later because she thought her account would not be taken seriously, and it would be futile.
Though many states have laws that treat gender-based, sexual or domestic violence as a civil rights violation, tort suits of the kind Barnett is pursuing, with a daunting account of painful moments, are relatively uncommon; most often, allegations arise amid divorce or custody proceedings, or while seeking orders of protection. But there has been a slight uptick in civil claims since the #MeToo movement, amid more attention on the complex nature of abuse, said Julie Goldscheid, a law professor at CUNY Law School who studies gender violence and civil rights.
Three women die each day at the hands of their abusers, according to the National Organization for Women. The pandemic has exacerbated dangerous situations by forcing partners to stay without interruption in close quarters, law enforcement officials said, and hotlines around the world have reported an increase in calls for help.
In the lawsuit, Barnett describes how she met LaBeouf in 2018, when she was cast in “Honey Boy,” a mostly autobiographical film he wrote, and they started dating after the movie wrapped. The early days of their relationship were marked by his “over-the-top displays of affection,” she says in the lawsuit, which helped earn her trust.
In an abusive relationship, there’s often a “honeymoon phase,” as some experts call it, that builds intimacy and sets a benchmark for how happy the romance could be. It serves as a powerful lure; though flashes of bliss may remain, they are meted out through increasingly controlling demands and impossible standards of behavior.
In the lawsuit, Barnett and Pho said that LaBeouf did not like it if they spoke to or looked at male waiters; in an interview, Barnett said she learned to keep her eyes down when men spoke to her. She also stated in the suit that LaBeouf had rules about how many times a day she had to kiss and touch him, which he enforced with constant haranguing and criticism.
LaBeouf persuaded Barnett to stay with him in Los Angeles, she said, rather than move back to London where she and her professional circle lived. It was a step toward her isolation, she said. And he would often say that her creative team used her, a message that eventually led her to doubt them.
But living with him became frightening, she said. The lawsuit says that he kept a loaded firearm by the bed and that she was scared to use the bathroom at night lest he mistake her for an intruder and shoot her. He didn’t let her wear clothing to bed, and would spin a trifling disagreement — over an artist she liked and he didn’t, for example — into an all-night fight, depriving her of sleep, the suit says.
The situation came just as she was completing what became her most critically lauded album, “Magdalene.” Barnett said she found herself in stasis, struggling to fulfill her professional duties and confounding her friends and colleagues. “Twigs is always the driving force behind her career — always a step ahead of everyone else,” said her longtime manager, Michael Stirton. “This was an extreme change in her personality and character.” The album’s release was delayed multiple times, and a tour was rescheduled at great cost, Stirton said, as Barnett receded. “I could speak to her,” he said. “But I couldn’t reach her.”
As Barnett grew more isolated, she said she felt as if her safety nets were unraveling. The gas station incident had happened in public, she said, and no one stepped to her aid; an early attempt she made to tell a colleague was brushed off. “I just thought to myself, no one is ever going to believe me,” she said in an interview. “I’m unconventional. And I’m a person of color who is a female.”
Slowly, with the help of a therapist, she began to strategize her exit. While she was packing to leave in spring 2019, LaBeouf turned up unannounced and terrorized her, according to a sworn statement from a witness, her housekeeper, in the lawsuit. When Barnett wouldn’t leave with him, the statement says, he “violently grabbed” her, picked her up and locked her in another room, where he yelled at her.
Escaping him began to seem “both difficult and dangerous,” the lawsuit says. And even as she grew in resolve, she felt overwhelmed, she told her therapist, in an email The Times has reviewed. Though she had the means, it took several attempts for Barnett to extricate herself, she said in an interview. And it was only afterward that she realized how broken down she had become.
“The whole time I was with him, I could have bought myself a business-flight plane ticket back to my four-story town house in Hackney,” in London, she said. And yet she didn’t. “He brought me so low, below myself, that the idea of leaving him and having to work myself back up just seemed impossible,” she said.
In her lawsuit, Barnett said she plans to donate a significant portion of any monetary damages to domestic-violence charities. “It was actually very expensive, and a massive undertaking of time and resources, to get out,” she said in an interview.
Her status makes her situation unusual, she said. But she wanted to share her story because it was otherwise so common.
“What I went through with Shia was the worst thing I’ve ever been through in the whole of my life,” she said. “I don’t think people would ever think that it would happen to me. But I think that’s the thing. It can happen to anybody.”

The airy studio where Bryn Terfel practices is set a good few yards from the house in Penarth, Wales, that he shares with his wife and two young children. Given his thunderous bass-baritone voice, which has roared through the great roles of Mozart, Puccini, Verdi and Wagner at opera houses around the world over the past 30 years, this is probably essential to family sanity.
A few days before a holiday recital that will be streamed live by the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday from Brecon Cathedral, about 40 miles north of Penarth, Terfel, 55, was seated at his piano in the room for a video call. Behind him was an antique poster advertising a Paris-Wales train route, and another for a production of Verdi’s “Falstaff” in Milan, in which he played the jovial title role.
But the opposite wall, he indicated as he turned the camera, is dominated by his achievements in America: posters for “Sweeney Todd” opposite Emma Thompson at the New York Philharmonic; his 1996 Carnegie Hall recital debut; and, signed by its cast, Wagner’s “Ring” at the Met.
This wall of New Yorkiana was particularly poignant to see, since Terfel has not appeared in the city since that “Sweeney” in 2014. In a review in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood wrote that Terfel “may be the most richly gifted singer ever to undertake the title role.”
His recent Met history has been a dark comedy of errors. Shortly after arriving to start rehearsals for a much-anticipated new production of Puccini’s “Tosca” in 2017, he knew something was wrong with his singing, and dropped out to have a polyp removed from his vocal cords. Then, earlier this year, he fractured his ankle and couldn’t appear in another new staging, this time Wagner’s “Der Fliegende Holländer.”
“These are things that you never expect to stop you in your tracks,” Terfel said.
The takeaway: He has not appeared at the Met since 2012, so this holiday recital is a return — even if it’s from some 3,000 miles away. He remains well-loved by the company’s audience for his rich, warm voice, his imposing characterizations — and commanding height — and his relish for the words he sings. Memories are still strong of his barreling through the title role in “The Marriage of Figaro,” sneering as Scarpia in “Tosca” and appearing as both the lecherous Don Giovanni and his manservant, Leporello, in Mozart’s opera. If his star turn as Wotan in Wagner’s “Ring” in 2010-12 felt stunted by the physical limitations on the performers in Robert Lepage’s staging, he still exerted a magnetic presence.
He spoke in the interview about his pandemic year and his plans for the Met recital. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q. Do you currently have Met engagements beyond this recital?
A. In New York, I’ve performed nearly all the operas I do on a new scale, a new production. Of course, it’s such a tremendous strain on your family life to be away that long. That’s something that is always difficult in this career, about signing a contract in New York. So I don’t currently have any contracts, not really. I’m just booking two years in advance, maybe.
I have certain interesting things with the Royal Opera House in London. And Welsh National Opera, too. I like Vienna and Munich, where you can rehearse two days and do three performances; a week and a half, and you’re home. And in a run of “Tosca,” you sing opposite maybe three different Toscas, each exceptional.
Q. How did this holiday concert, which is part of the Met’s series of livestreamed recitals, come about?
A. In the summer, Peter Gelb [the Met’s general manager] rang me at home and offered me a chance to be a part of this series, which I’m incredibly grateful for. It’s a wonderful way to finish off your year, knowing a vaccine is being rolled out as we speak. He immediately said I should be doing a kind of Christmas program, so I’ve had plenty of time to think about it. I wanted something of the birth of Jesus, which comes in “El Nacimiento,” a Spanish carol I’m singing. There are a couple of songs by Robat Arwyn, a friend I was in school with. There’s “Silent Night,” “O Come, All Ye Faithful,” “In the Bleak Midwinter” and the Welsh song “Ar Hyd y Nos” (“All Through the Night”).
A bard here in Wales, Mererid Hopwood, has written these short texts for me to read between the pieces. The arts is all about teams and collaboration, and I’ve tried to assemble a very strong team. My wife, Hannah Stone, will be accompanying me on the harp. It’s a perfect instrument anywhere, but in the cathedral it really feels like it’s come home. I’m so happy to be able to include some young singers, the soprano Natalya Romaniw and the tenor Trystan Llyr Griffiths. And the pianist Jeff Howard, and the folk group Calan. And everyone comes together at the end to start the Christmas spirit.
Silence, serenity and peace — that is what I’m going to try and convey. But what will be on my mind will be the front-line workers, and the losses we have all encountered in every country.
Q. What was the process of picking Brecon Cathedral?
A. The Met people had this vision they wanted a castle. But in Wales, the castles are either in ruins or the rooms inside are too small. There was the idea of Cardiff Castle, but there’s a wedding there this weekend.
Q. Have you been able to perform this year?
A. There have been some terrific moments. I did a new “Fidelio” in Graz; I did a “Tosca” in Munich. The arts in Germany is a whole different kettle of fish. It’s not just the federal government; it’s the city, it’s the state of Bavaria. It was important for the opera house in Munich that they brought back audiences very quickly, even if it was just 500 people. It was still bringing the arts to the people who needed nourishment in some musical form.
I’ve just recorded “Chestnuts Roasting” for a music festival here close to me. (And maybe in a couple of weeks Santa might bring something that might resemble a microphone.) I did a concert in the Barbican [in London], a 50-minute online concert that had to be devised around a set amount of musicians. I did Bach cantatas and English songs.
And I did a little concert to thank the vaccine team in Oxford, with a new carol by John Rutter. The three words at the end: “The angels sing.” And that’s the hope, I think. For our profession now, to bring people back, everyone has to have that confidence. And hopefully by next summer we should have some sense of normality.
Q. What are some of your future plans?
A. I had been supposed to do my first Bluebeard in Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle” in June, and I hadn’t even begun with a coach or language coach. In lockdown, I’ve been looking at one-act operas a little bit, with a thought what might help opera houses: Puccini’s “Gianni Schicchi” and “Il Tabarro”; “The Bear” by William Walton; Donizetti has many wonderful one-act operas; “Bluebeard,” of course.
And my constant friend, here on the piano, is Schubert’s “Winterreise,” which I hope to be recording for Deutsche Grammophon. I’ve never performed it; the first time I opened the score was during COVID. I was invited many times to hear Jonas Kaufmann sing it, Simon Keenlyside sing it, but I didn’t want to hear it until I did it myself.

Manhattan DA Intensifies Investigation of Trump

State prosecutors in Manhattan have interviewed several employees of President Donald Trump’s bank and insurance broker in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter, significantly escalating an investigation into the president that he is powerless to stop.
The interviews with people who work for the lender, Deutsche Bank, and the insurance brokerage, Aon, are the latest indication that once Trump leaves office, he still faces the potential threat of criminal charges that would be beyond the reach of federal pardons.
It remains unclear whether the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., will ultimately bring charges. The prosecutors have been fighting in court for more than a year to obtain Trump’s personal and corporate tax returns, which they have called central to their investigation. The issue now rests with the Supreme Court.
But lately, Vance’s office has stepped up its efforts, issuing new subpoenas and questioning witnesses, including some before a grand jury, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.
The grand jury appears to be serving an investigative function, allowing prosecutors to authenticate documents and pursue other leads, rather than considering any charges.
When Trump returns to private life in January, he will lose the protection from criminal prosecution that his office has afforded him. While The New York Times has reported that he discussed granting preemptive pardons to his eldest children before leaving office — and has claimed that he has the power to pardon himself — that authority applies only to federal crimes, and not to state or local investigations like the one being conducted by Vance’s office.
Trump, who has maintained he did nothing improper, has railed against the inquiry, calling it a politically motivated “witch hunt.”
The investigation by Vance, a Democrat, has focused on Trump’s conduct as a private business owner and whether he or employees at his family business, the Trump Organization, committed financial crimes. It is the only known criminal inquiry into the president.
Employees of Deutsche Bank and Aon, two corporate giants, could be important witnesses. As two of Trump’s oldest allies — and some of the only mainstream companies willing to do regular business with him — they might offer investigators a rich vein of information about the Trump Organization.
There is no indication that either company is suspected of wrongdoing.
Because grand jury rules require secrecy, prosecutors have disclosed little about the focus of the inquiry and nothing about what investigative steps they have taken. But earlier this year, they suggested in court papers that they were examining possible insurance, tax and bank-related fraud in the president’s corporate dealings.
In recent weeks, Vance’s prosecutors questioned two Deutsche Bank employees about the bank’s procedures for making lending decisions, according to a person familiar with the interviews. The employees were experts in the bank’s underwriting process, not bankers who worked with the Trump Organization, the person said.
While the focus of those interviews was not on the relationship with Trump, bank officials expect Vance’s office to summon them for additional rounds of more specific questions in the near future, the person said.
Glimpses into the investigation have come in court records during the bitter and protracted legal battle over a subpoena for eight years of Trump’s personal and corporate tax returns and other financial records.
A month after Vance’s office demanded the documents from the president’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, in August 2019, Trump sued to block compliance with the subpoena. The case has twisted its way through the federal courts, with the president losing at every turn, and is now in front of the Supreme Court for the second time.
Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, declined to comment on recent moves in the investigation. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, declined to comment, but recently said that the company’s practices complied with the law and called the investigation a “fishing expedition.”
Aon confirmed that the company had received a subpoena for documents from the district attorney’s office but declined to comment on the interviews with prosecutors. “As is our policy, we intend to cooperate with all regulatory bodies, including providing copies of all documents requested by those bodies,” a company spokeswoman said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank, Trump’s primary lender since the late 1990s, received a subpoena last year from the district attorney and has said it is cooperating with the inquiry.
In court papers, the prosecutors have cited public reports of Trump’s business dealings as legal justification for their inquiry, including a newspaper report that concluded the president may have inflated his net worth and the value of his properties to lenders and insurers.
Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and fixer who turned on him after pleading guilty to federal charges, also told Congress in February 2019 that Trump and his employees manipulated his net worth to suit his interests.
“It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,” he said in testimony before the House Oversight Committee.
Trump’s supporters have noted that Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to lying to Congress and accused him of lying again to earn a reduced prison sentence.
The Trump Organization’s lawyers are also likely to argue to prosecutors that Trump could not have duped Deutsche Bank because the bank did its own analysis of Trump’s net worth.
Over the years, employees and executives inside the bank thought that Trump was overvaluing some of his assets by as much as 70%, according to current and former bank officials. Deutsche Bank still decided to lend Trump’s company hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade, concluding that he was a safe lending risk in part because he had more than enough money and other assets to personally guarantee the debt.
The prosecutors’ interviews with the employees was not the only recent activity in the investigation. Last month, The Times reported that Vance’s office had subpoenaed the Trump Organization for records related to tax write-offs on millions of dollars in consulting fees, some of which appear to have gone to the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump.
According to people with knowledge of the matter, the subpoena sought information about fees paid to TTT Consulting LLC, an apparent reference to Ivanka Trump and other members of her family. Ivanka Trump was an executive officer of the Trump companies that made the payments, meaning she appears to have been paid as a consultant while also working for the Trump Organization.
Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, argued in a statement at the time that the subpoena was part of an “ongoing attempt to harass the company.” He added that “everything was done in strict compliance with applicable law and under the advice of counsel and tax experts.”
Vance’s investigation has spanned more than two years and shifted focus over time. When the investigation began, it examined the Trump Organization’s role in hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. Prosecutors were examining how the company recorded a reimbursement to Cohen for one of the payments. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations for his role in the scheme.
A state grand jury convened by Vance’s office heard testimony from at least one witness about that issue last year, according to a person with knowledge of that testimony, but the payments have receded as a central focus of the inquiry.

WASHINGTON — The chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee urged the incoming administration to renew trade negotiations with the European Union, countering a pledge by President-elect Joe Biden to postpone any new trade talks until after the United States has made significant domestic investments.
The statement Friday, from Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., raises the question of whether congressional pressure could persuade the Biden administration to take a more aggressive approach to trade negotiations with close allies.
Biden has downplayed expectations for new trade negotiations early in his term, saying he wants to first wrest control of the pandemic and make substantial investments in U.S. industries like energy, biotech and artificial intelligence.
“I’m not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers,” Biden said in a New York Times interview last week.
But since congressional opposition would be one of the main obstacles to any new trade agreement, the support of key Democrats could be strong motivation for initiating talks.
In an interview, Neal suggested that reaching a trade agreement with the European Union would help deal with the rising economic threat from China, which has used hefty subsidies, state-owned companies and other practices to dominate industries and challenge the trade rules long embraced in the West.
Neal called Biden’s approach “fine and fair” but argued that pursuing EU trade negotiations “is part of a foreign policy challenge as it relates to China’s expansionist activities.”
“I think that we should, right now, be preparing to match the aggressive nature of what China’s doing in the world,” he added.
Biden would need the support of Neal and others to cement such a deal. So-called trade promotion authority, a statute that sets out guidelines for the executive branch as it negotiates trade deals and streamlines the approval process, is set to expire in July; any deals submitted to Congress after that could face a more difficult path to ratification. It’s not yet clear whether the Biden administration will petition Congress to renew the authority.
Despite deep historic ties, the United States and Europe have not always had an easy trading relationship. The governments have argued for decades over tariffs, farm subsidies and food safety standards, and efforts to reach a comprehensive trade pact under both the Obama and Trump administrations were ultimately scrapped.
But Biden has often spoken of the importance of strengthening U.S. alliances, and he and his advisers have been eager to remedy ties with Europe that have been strained by President Donald Trump’s confrontational trade approach. They also see much common ground with the European Union on issues like climate change, labor standards and consumer protections, as well as countering China’s growing geopolitical power and trade practices.
Both governments appear eager to make progress on trade issues that have festered under the Trump administration, including spats over subsidies to the aircraft industry and plans by European countries to tax U.S. technology giants.
Those discussions would be led by Biden’s trade representative, Katherine Tai, whom the president-elect introduced Friday as his nominee for the post. Tai is on Neal’s staff as the Ways and Means Committee’s chief trade lawyer.
Neal declined to elaborate on conversations he’d had with Tai about pursuing trade deals with the European Union but said, “I think we’re in broad agreement on the nature of the challenge.”
Neal pointed to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement as a “blueprint” for new trade pacts. The accord, the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, was negotiated by Trump and revised by congressional Democrats, including Neal and Tai, before going into force this year.
“What we were able to do with USMCA in terms of environment, labor standards, enforcement — I think we have some momentum,” Neal said.
He said he was continuing to work to drum up support for using a European trade deal to counter China’s influence around the globe.
In his statement Friday, Neal said pursuing a trade deal with the Europe Union would be a “strategically sound choice” as the United States tried to compete economically with China and rebuild its economy from the pandemic recession.
He urged the Biden administration to engage with allies in Europe and elsewhere to “formulate a strategic, far-reaching, forward-looking, robust package of programs and investments to defend against anti-competitive, anti-democratic influences of China’s policies.”

Media Mogul Is Charged Under Hong Kong’s National Security Law

HONG KONG — In two strokes unveiled Friday, the Chinese Communist Party laid out in stark relief the rapidly shrinking space for speech and independent journalism in China.
In Hong Kong, police said Friday that Jimmy Lai, the outspoken founder of an ardently anti-government newspaper, had been charged under the city’s new national security law with colluding with foreign forces. Hours later, Bloomberg News disclosed that plainclothes security officials had earlier that week detained Haze Fan, a Chinese staffer in Beijing, also on potential national security violations.
Both announcements were shrouded in secrecy. The police in Hong Kong did not specify how Lai was said to have colluded with foreign countries. Chinese officials said only that Fan, who had been taken four days earlier from her apartment, was accused of “criminal activities that jeopardize national security,” according to Bloomberg’s report.
But both cases made clear how potent the party’s aggressive use of national security concerns has been in spreading fear, both among its own people and in foreign organizations.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong said the indictment of Lai was a clear warning that Beijing intended to use the security law, which was just enacted in June, to silence dissent and erode free speech. Lai had been one of the most internationally recognized faces of last year’s massive pro-democracy protests, pouring his fortune and his platform into supporting them.
In the mainland, the news of Fan’s detention sent ripples of disquiet among foreign news outlets, which have already been beleaguered by expulsions of journalists and tightening reporting restrictions.
Many supporters of democracy in once-freewheeling Hong Kong have long feared that the Communist Party is seeking to turn the semi-autonomous territory into just another mainland city. Friday’s dual revelations showed some of them just how much the differences between the two places had collapsed.
“I have always questioned why the national security of the Chinese regime is so fragile,” Lo Kin-hei, the chairman of Hong Kong’s opposition Democratic Party, said of the twin allegations. “They just keep on using these kinds of laws or these kinds of allegations to try to silence people.”
The move against Lai, the most high-profile person to be charged under Hong Kong’s new law, was not a surprise. State-run news outlets have railed against him as a “black hand” behind last year’s protests, pointing to his U.S. trip last year to lobby Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for action against China. Chinese officials have openly thirsted for him to be punished.
That call was answered in August, when Lai was arrested on suspicion of violating the security law, and police officers raided the headquarters of Apple Daily, his newspaper. The indictment Friday stems from that arrest.
If convicted, Lai could face up to life in prison. Under the national security law, court proceedings can be held behind closed doors, and defendants can even be removed to mainland China to stand trial.
The police did not specify what Lai was accused of having done to violate the security law. As written, the law is not supposed to be retroactive, and since it was imposed, Lai has said that he would be more careful about his words, shying away for example from explicit requests to American lawmakers.
But Claudia Mo, a former pro-democracy lawmaker, said many believed that authorities were merely looking for a premise on which to shut down Apple Daily, which has continued to needle the government even after the security law was enacted.
“This seems likely a key part of their ideological control over Hong Kong,” Mo said. “They hate Lai’s high political profile and find his media influence more than bothersome.”
Lai was already in jail after being denied bail on unrelated fraud charges, a decision he is appealing. But because of the charge under the national security law, which grants authorities sweeping powers to hold defendants without bail, it is unlikely that he will win release.
The indictment followed a string of punishments for other high-profile figures in recent weeks. The young activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow were sentenced to jail last week, and several pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from the city’s legislature last month, leading the rest of the opposition, including Mo, to resign en masse.
In targeting Lai, the Chinese government may also have been sending a message to other countries that have been harshly critical of its crackdown on Hong Kong. The Trump administration this week imposed travel bans and financial sanctions on 14 senior Chinese officials it said were responsible for the repression. President-elect Joe Biden has also promised to take a tough stance on China.
Few details were available Friday about the accusations against Fan, the Bloomberg staffer. In the mainland, the sweeping set of potential national security charges includes illegally obtaining or sharing confidential government information, or engaging in political subversion.
According to Bloomberg’s news report, Fan disappeared into the hands of investigators Monday, soon after she was last in contact with a Bloomberg editor. Bloomberg said it published its report after receiving confirmation from Chinese authorities that Fan had been detained.
John Micklethwait, Bloomberg’s editor-in-chief, told employees on a call Friday that the company was doing everything it could to secure Fan’s release, according to a person aware of the remarks but who requested anonymity because the comments were not public.
Micklethwait urged the staff to keep covering China and finance and business in the world as they always had and said the company was proud of its coverage, the person said. He said the company did not know why Fan had been detained.
The news organization tried to obtain information about Fan’s whereabouts from the Chinese government and Chinese embassy in Washington, the report said. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond immediately to a fax and phone calls about the case.
The Chinese government bans Chinese citizens from doing independent reporting for foreign news organizations, allowing them to work only as researchers and assistants. Bloomberg News, whose lifeblood is financial and business reporting, employs many Chinese in its large Beijing operation.
Foreign journalists in China have become a growing point of tension in recent years. The Chinese foreign ministry has often complained of what it sees as biased coverage from Western news outlets, and this year it expelled a dozen or so American journalists after the United States expelled a number of Chinese reporters.
The list of recent articles that Fan helped on features mostly reports about Chinese businesses. But she also worked on reports about the coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan, trade tensions between China and the United States, and other broader topics.
In her profile on LinkedIn, Fan described herself as a senior producer in China for Bloomberg, where she has worked since 2017. Previously, she worked for CNBC, Al-Jazeera and other news outlets.
In August, authorities in Beijing detained Cheng Lei, an Australian of Chinese descent who was working as a journalist for CGTN, a Chinese state-run broadcaster. Officials later said Cheng was suspected of violating national security laws, but no details have been disclosed.
In 2004, Zhao Yan, a Chinese researcher for The New York Times’ Beijing bureau, was detained by state security officers. Zhao was initially accused of disclosing state secrets to The Times, linked to reporting on Communist Party leaders. He was later convicted on a lighter charge of fraud and served three years in prison.
Lai’s indictment and Fan’s detention come at a potentially sensitive time for China geopolitically. China has come under heavy fire from Western countries, especially the United States, Britain and Australia, for its new constrictions on Hong Kong.
The Communist Party has aggressively rejected those criticisms. But some officials and state newspapers have also indicated that they would seek a reset with the United States under Biden — a reset that these moves could endanger.
But Willy Lam, a professor of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said China’s leader, Xi Jinping, was determined to broadcast strength against “the so-called bullying and intimidation from the U.S. and the Western world.”
“This is a show of defiance,” Lam said of the charge against Lai, “telling the world that in spite of the sanctions and so forth, there is no possibility that they would relax this tight regime.”

Is Andrew Yang Running for Mayor? All Signs Point to Yes

Andrew Yang, the former tech executive who gained a national following as a Democratic presidential candidate, has been privately telling New York City leaders that he intends to run for mayor next year.
Yang is not expected to announce his bid until next month, but with the Democratic primary less than seven months away, he has begun to make overtures to several of the city’s political power brokers.
He met with Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, in a video call on Tuesday to seek his advice about running for mayor.
He plans to visit the Rev. Al Sharpton, the Harlem kingmaker — a rite of passage for any serious candidate — in person next week when he returns to the city from Georgia, where he has been trying to help Democrats win the U.S. Senate.
He has enlisted Bradley Tusk and Chris Coffey, prominent political strategists who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as advisers.
Yang, whose presidential campaign was centered around offering every American a universal basic income, could shake up a race that has a large field of candidates and no clear front-runner. He would be only the second Asian American candidate to run for mayor, following a bid in 2013 by John Liu, a state senator from Queens who was then the city’s comptroller.
Yang, who has temporarily relocated to Georgia to campaign for the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — both facing runoffs next month for U.S. Senate seats — declined to say on Thursday if he was running for mayor.
“I’m thrilled that people seem excited about my doing what I can to help, but no, right now I’m focused on these Senate races in Georgia,” he said in an interview.
While his name recognition and fundraising potential could easily put him in the top tier of mayoral candidates, Yang has never run for office in New York City. He will have to learn quickly about the thorny issues that can animate voters, from rezoning proposals for the SoHo and Flushing, Queens, neighborhoods to the debate over the admissions exam for the city’s elite high schools that has pitted some Asian American families against Black and Hispanic students.
At the same time, celebrity status and Twitter buzz do not always translate into votes in New York — Cynthia Nixon gained a lot of attention but not enough voters in her failed run for governor in 2018.
Yang will also be jockeying for endorsements along with more than a dozen candidates, some of whom have been courting elected officials and unions for years in anticipation of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s exit next year because of term limits.
Two candidates have been mainstays in New York politics: Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Scott Stringer, the city comptroller. Others are positioning themselves as outsiders, including Raymond J. McGuire, a business executive, and Maya Wiley, a lawyer and former MSNBC analyst.
And on Thursday, Rep. Max Rose, who lost his reelection bid last month and was said to be interested in joining the mayor’s race, registered a mayoral campaign committee with the city’s Campaign Finance Board.
The pandemic has reshaped the mayor’s race, and the candidates are all trying to argue that they are the best qualified to help the city recover. The field is also perhaps the most diverse ever, including several Black and Latino candidates.
Yang, who was born in upstate New York, has spent most of his adult life living in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. He gained attention on the campaign trail with his MATH slogan — “Make America Think Harder” — and amassed 1.8 million followers on Twitter and nearly $40 million in campaign contributions.
His campaign to give every American adult $1,000 a month as part of a universal basic income mandate could be even more popular after many people relied on the federal stimulus to help survive the economic losses of the pandemic, said Susan Kang, a political-science professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.
“His brand is very zeitgeisty in many ways,” she said. “He’s made a name for himself by promoting universal programs at a time when everyone needs universal programs.”
Earlier this year, Yang did not rule out a run in an interview with The New York Times.
“Certainly the mayor of New York City can do a lot of good,” he said. “So that is something that I have to take a long look at.”
Not long after, Yang publicly flirted with the idea of running for mayor, but his deliberations have recently grown more serious. He spoke with Johnson, who dropped out of the mayor’s race in September after struggling with depression.
He also called Rep. Grace Meng from Queens, the first Asian American member of the state’s congressional delegation and a top official for the Democratic National Committee. The conversations were confirmed by two people who were familiar with them, but who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
A spokeswoman for Sharpton, Rachel Noerdlinger, confirmed his plans to meet with Yang next week.
Tusk was a campaign manager for Bloomberg in 2009 and has been a prominent critic of de Blasio. In 2016, a year before de Blasio won reelection, Tusk led a public search for a Democratic candidate to unseat him.
After leaving the presidential race, Yang, who led a test-prep company and a nonprofit organization, created Humanity Forward, a New York-based nonprofit that is distributing money to needy families in the Bronx.
Yang performed well in a recent poll, receiving 20% of support as the top choice among 1,000 likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 14% for Adams and 11% for Stringer. The poll was conducted by Slingshot Strategies, a political firm that has worked for candidates like Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate. Yang did not hire the firm; a private client did, according to the firm.
“It’s always encouraging when people are excited about you,” Yang said of the poll results.
The race for an executive job like mayor often comes down to personality, rather than policies, and Yang, like all the candidates, will have to establish an emotional relationship with voters, Kang said.
“To what extent can he project warmth, humor and competence?” she asked.

Texto completo: There's nothing like a Broadway musical to lift your spirits, especially in these pandemic-altered times. But under the circumstances, it's unlikely that you'd have the opportunity to see one onstage.
Which brings us to "The Prom," making its streaming debut Dec. 11 on Netflix. The story of Broadway performers who invade an Indiana town on a crusade against homophobia, the film boasts a starry cast including Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and James Corden. And the end credits feature the names of two St. Louisans who were producers of the stage version.
Jack Lane and Andrew Kuhlman both hold down day jobs at Stages St. Louis -- Lane as executive producer and Kuhlman as associate producer. Although neither was directly involved in the acclaimed musical's transition to the screen, they're happy that the show they had so much faith in has been embraced by Netflix -- and now has the potential to reach a much wider audience.
"As a Broadway producer, I often get invited to see shows when they're out of town," Lane says. In that spirit, he caught an early performance of "The Prom" at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta in 2016.
"I have a vivid memory of going, with a co-producer friend of mine," he says. "And about 20 minutes into the show, I whispered to my friend, 'Is this as good as I think it is?' And he said: 'Shut up! Yes, it is.' And it was."
Kuhlman says he became a co-producer on "The Prom" at Lane's suggestion. At first, the idea struck him as "too big of a dream." But Lane persuaded him otherwise.
"A series of things happened so that it fell into place, and the show was sitting right there in front of me," Kuhlman says. "It was all thanks to Jack and the working relationship we've had all these years."
"The Prom" began Broadway previews in October 2018 at the Longacre Theatre, opening in November and running through August 2019. The cast included Muny favorite Beth Leavel as Dee Dee Allen and Brooks Ashmanskas as Barry Glickman. The show was directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, with a book by Bob Martin and Chad Beguelin, lyrics by Beguelin and music by Matthew Sklar.
A national tour of "The Prom" had been scheduled for the Fox Theatre's 2020-21 Broadway Series, announced in March, shortly before the pandemic shut down venues.  
The musical's plot shifts into gear when a musical starring Dee Dee and Barry receives a devastating review on opening night. With nothing to do and eager to regain their dignity, they decide to champion the cause of a teenage girl who has been denied the right to bring her girlfriend to the prom.
The New York Times hailed "The Prom" as "a joyous hoot. With its kinetic dancing, broad mugging, and belty anthems, it makes you believe in musical comedy again."  
The film adaptation is directed by Ryan Murphy ("Glee"), who worked from a screenplay by Martin and Beguelin.
"We were treated really respectively by Netflix and by Ryan in particular," Martin says. "The actual screenplay is very close to the original Broadway show, and we worked closely with Ryan to create some additional material."
Beguelin says that Dee Dee, Barry and their fellow thespians "were characters that we could base on people we knew. We didn't cast them as villains, but they weren't saviors either. It's always fun to make fun of the business you work in."
Murphy had come to the Longacre to see the show and "loved it so much," Lane says. "And literally, on the spot, said he wanted to do it as a movie. Which is kind of a fantasy in so many ways."
According to Lane, Murphy "wanted to make a big, old-fashioned musical -- with great dancing and a huge heart and a huge message. He knew that Netflix would want to do it. And they wanted to do it in a very big way."
In its jump to the screen, "The Prom" was completely recast. The ubiquitous Streep plays Dee Dee, "Late Late Show" host (and Tony winner) Corden is Barry, and film and TV stalwarts Kidman and Andrew Rannells portray theater pals who accompany them to the heartland. Also in the cast are Kerry Washington ("Scandal") and Keegan-Michael Key (of Key and Peele fame).
Although "The Prom" runs the risk of portraying the Midwest as culturally backward, Kuhlman says that ultimately the show delivers an inspiring message.
"I thought it was beautiful how the Midwestern characters were open to learning and open to listening," he says. "And we see these characters evolve."
Lane says that his experience with "The Prom" has been among his best as a producer.
"This is the only Broadway show I was the lead producer on," he says. "When I pick shows, I pick them with my gut, and I pick them with my heart. I have to be moved by them. When I saw 'The Prom' in Atlanta, I was really blown away by it."

ST. LOUISANS MAKE THEATER HAPPEN ON BROADWAY
Broadway may be far from St. Louis, but it's not beyond the reach of producers who have enjoyed success on that street of glittering lights.
"Between Mike Isaacson (artistic director and executive producer of the Muny), Terry Schnuck and me, we have collectively won 13 Tony Awards," says Jack Lane, a producer on "The Prom" and other shows.
"The three of us all won for 'Fun Home,' and Mike and I both won for 'The Humans.'"
Following is a selected list of Broadway productions with local connections.
"Beautiful: The Carole King Musical" (2014-19) - The life and music of singer-songwriter King inspired this hit show. Its lead producer was Paul Blake, former executive producer of the Muny. Schnuck was also a producer. The New York Times described the show as a "friendly, formulaic bio-musical" but noted that its star, Jessie Mueller, "steps confidently into the V.I.P. room of musical headliners."
"David Byrne's American Utopia" (2019) - Isaacson is among the producers of this musical showcase headlined by singer-songwriter Byrne, who leads an ensemble of barefoot performers through songs from his solo career and his time with the band Talking Heads -- including "Once in a Lifetime" and "Burning Down the House." Spike Lee directed an acclaimed film version. The show is scheduled to return to Broadway next year.
"Fun Home" (2015) - Cartoonist Alison Bechdel's graphic memoir about embracing her sexuality and learning the truth about her father was the basis for this groundbreaking musical with music by Jeanine Tesori ("Caroline, or Change") and book and lyrics by Lisa Kron. The show won Tony Awards for best musical, book, score, leading actor (Michael Cerveris) and direction (Sam Gold). Producers included Isaacson, Lane and Schnuck.
"High" (2011) - Kathleen Turner ("Body Heat") starred in this drama by Matthew Lombardo, which was produced at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis before its Broadway run. The Rep remained involved as an above-the-title producer. The New York Times dismissed the play as "essentially a high-toned version of one of those addictive series about addiction that have become a subgenre of the reality television boom."
"The Humans" (2016) - Stephen Karam's drama about coping with uncertain times and facing an unpromising future was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize (losing to "Hamilton") and winner of the Tony Award for best play. Fox Theatricals was a producer. The Pulitzer committee described the play as "a profoundly affecting drama that sketches the psychological and emotional contours of an average American family."
"Peter and the Starcatcher" (2012) - Based on a book by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson (of St. Louis), this play serves as a prequel to the story of Peter Pan. Lane was a producer. The New York Times praised the show as "an enchanted anatomy of the primal human urge to defy gravity" that "reminds us that we always have the tools within us to achieve that objective."

Texto completo: TAIPEI—Chinese authorities have detained a local staff member working in the Beijing bureau of Bloomberg News on suspicion of endangering national security, the news organization said.
Haze Fan, a Chinese national, was seen being escorted from her apartment building by plainclothes security officials shortly after being in touch with a Bloomberg editor on Monday, Bloomberg News reported Friday evening Beijing time.
After several days spent seeking information about Ms. Fan's whereabouts, Bloomberg News' parent company, Bloomberg LP, received confirmation on Thursday that she was being held on national security grounds, the news organization reported.
"We are very concerned for her and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation," a Bloomberg spokeswoman said in an email.
Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait, senior executive editor Madeleine Lim, and Greater China executive editor John Liu told China-based staff on a conference call that Chinese authorities told Bloomberg Ms. Fan's detention wasn't related to her work, according to people familiar with the matter. Staff were told they could continue with their work since the company believed Ms. Fan's detention wasn't work related, and that the company is trying its best to support Ms. Fan and her family, the people said.
Bloomberg's spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment on the conference call.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment sent after business hours on Friday. Calls to the ministry rang unanswered.
According to Ms. Fan's LinkedIn profile, she is currently a global business reporter and senior producer for Bloomberg in China. In her capacity as a producer, the profile says, she is responsible for breaking market news and planning other content for Bloomberg TV. She joined Bloomberg in 2017, after stints in the Beijing operations of CNBC, Al Jazeera Media Network, CBS News and Thomson Reuters, according to the profile.
Her recent contributions on Bloomberg's news website include articles on the canceled IPO of Ant Group Co. and other business stories.
The Chinese government has significantly tightened its grip on the media industry during the past year, detaining local journalists for reporting on sensitive topics and expelling a large number of foreign journalists .
Chinese nationals are prohibited from working as credentialed reporters for foreign news organizations in China but are allowed to aid foreign correspondents as producers and research assistants.
It is rare for Chinese research assistants working for foreign news organizations to be formally detained on national security grounds.
Zhao Yan, a Chinese research assistant at the Beijing bureau of the New York Times, spent three years in prison between 2004 and 2007 on charges of disclosing state secrets to his employer. The Times denied that he ever did .
This year, Chinese authorities detained several local grass-roots journalists covering the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in the central city of Wuhan. Beijing also expelled more than a dozen journalists from The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and the Washington Post in February and March as part of an escalating tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington spanning a range of domains, including media.
In August, China detained Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist working for a state-run English television news channel , amid souring relations with Australia. Neither Ms. Cheng's status nor the reason for her detention is known.
Ms. Cheng and Ms. Fan were friends, according to people who knew them.
The Bloomberg spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Ms. Fan's detention was related to any previous journalist detentions.

Mnuchin grilled over relief money

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was rebuked by a congressional oversight panel over his management of the economic relief effort Thursday, with members questioning whether he politicized the handling of hundreds of billions of dollars in stimulus funds.
Mnuchin, at times defiant and defensive of his efforts, insisted that he was simply following the law and congressional intent in his decision-making. But the scrutiny could further complicate his role in trying to secure another pandemic-relief package with lawmakers, who have criticized the secretary's stewardship of virus funds.
Republicans and Democrats on the oversight panel raised questions about whether Mnuchin awarded a $700 million loan to YRC Worldwide, a struggling trucking company, because of its ties to White House officials. And Democrats continued to press Mnuchin about whether he ended several of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs to limit the incoming Biden administration.
"This was a political decision — one intended to hamstring the incoming administration even as COVID deaths are spiking and the economic recovery is slowing," Bharat Ramamurti, an appointed member of the Congressional Oversight Commission, said at Thursday's hearing. "Let me put it this way: Does anyone think the Treasury would have ended these programs if Donald Trump were reelected?"
The central focus of the hearing was supposed to be the $17 billion that Treasury was allotted to support companies that are deemed critical to national security. The loan to YRC, which was struggling financially before the pandemic, has been a subject of concern for the commission since the Treasury Department approved it in June. Republicans on the commission, Sen. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rep. French Hill of Arkansas, both raised questions about why the company was worthy of loan that was justified on the grounds that the company was critical to national security.
"It's been hanging on by a thread since the global financial crisis," Hill said.
Toomey said that YRC, which had been contracted by the Defense Department to provide meal kits, protective equipment and other supplies to military bases, appeared to be nearly insolvent and asked whether giving it money was a prudent use of taxpayer funds.
Mnuchin, a former banker, agreed that he would not have underwritten the loan if he was still in private industry but said the law gave the department the ability to help prevent financial problems and job losses at companies deemed critical to national security. He defended the loan, saying that it was granted to help prevent job losses and that, because the economy is recovering, the government would eventually turn a profit from the deal.
"There was a tremendous risk to the Department of Defense and a tremendous risk to the number of jobs," Mnuchin said.
But Mnuchin was pressed about whether political favoritism was at play and if YRC got such a large loan so quickly because its largest financial backer is Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm with ties to the White House. Apollo, which spent nearly $1 million lobbying lawmakers this year about coronavirus relief funds, lent $184 million in 2017 to the Kushner Cos., a real estate firm run by the family of Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser. The loan went to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper.
Mnuchin said that Kushner had no input on the loan but said that lawmakers from both parties had urged him to find a way to help YRC, which he believed would have declared bankruptcy and laid off thousands of workers if not for the government support.
A new report from the Government Accountability Office said that the YRC loan was the only one of the 11 national security loans that the Treasury Department granted that was "fast-tracked" even though other businesses faced similar financial circumstances.
Officials from the Defense Department, which certified that YRC was critical to national security, declined to attend the hearing, drawing criticism from Toomey. The Defense Department, which stalled for weeks in providing the commission with a written response to its questions about the loan, will hold a separate teleconference with the commission about the loan program, but Toomey said the agency is resisting making the transcript of that teleconference public.
Mnuchin also parried more criticism of his decision to end five Fed lending programs. He insisted again Thursday that he was following the intent of the law in ending the programs at year-end and in clawing back billions from the Fed. That position is at odds with what many legal experts and Democrats in Congress say was actually required.
On Nov. 19, Mnuchin declared that he believed all along that the programs could not continue past year-end and asked the Federal Reserve to give back the unused investments.
Toomey had floated the legal justification Mnuchin ultimately cited in ending the programs — the idea that Congress had meant for them to shut at the end of the year — before Mnuchin publicly embraced it. He did so at a time when a senior Treasury official told The New York Times that the department was still mulling extending some of the programs.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prepares to testify at a congressional oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Thursday.

COVID-19 deaths rival Pearl Harbor toll in early December

Texto completo: As Americans continue to die from COVID-19, some have sought to compare its impact to deadly attacks on U.S. soil.
An Instagram post by Now This News, a progressive-leaning news outlet, narrows in on Pearl Harbor, noting that the surprise strike on a U.S. naval base in 1941 killed over 2,400 service members and civilians. A U.S. census report confirms that 2,403 people were killed in the attack.
The caption goes on to report that the United States saw more than 2,400 coronavirus deaths each of the first five days of December, citing the COVID Tracking Project as its source.
"Whereas the day after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt said December 7 'is a date which will live in infamy,' Pres. Trump won't speak publicly about the pandemic that is now killing thousands of Americans daily," Now This News wrote in the post's caption.
Now This News did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
COVID Tracking Project numbers make claim true, other sources vary
It's true that more Americans died each of the first five days of last week than in the Pearl Harbor attack based on the source Now This News cites. The COVID Tracking Project, a well-respected volunteer organization launched by The Atlantic and cited by Now This News, determined that the number of deaths for the first five days of the month were as follows:
Dec. 1 - 2,473
Dec. 2 - 2,733
Dec 3 - 2,706
Dec. 4 - 2,563
Dec. 5 - 2,461
But the toll for Dec. 5 varies in other sources. The New York Times generally found higher death counts than the COVID Tracking Project for the first four days of the month, but its tally of Dec. 5 deaths is lower than the number of casualties at Pearl Harbor.
The New York Times' count of coronavirus deaths between Dec. 1-5:
Dec. 1 - 2,610
Dec. 2 - 2, 885
Dec. 3 - 2,857
Dec. 4 - 2,637
Dec. 5 - 2,190
Johns Hopkins University's COVID tracker shows the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. as being closer to The New York Times' estimates. Its tally of Dec. 5 coronavirus deaths also falls short of Pearl Harbor's casualty count.
Johns Hopkins' count of coronavirus deaths between Dec. 1-5:
Dec. 1 - 2,597
Dec. 2 - 2,804
Dec. 3 - 2,879
Dec. 4 - 2,607
Dec. 5 - 2,254
The discrepancies between the data sources highlight the challenges in accurately tracking the number of deaths from the coronavirus. Experts cite the lack of a coordinated response, unfamiliarity with the virus and the discussions surrounding it being clouded by conspiracy theories and political motivations as reasons it's hard to keep track.
Despite both The New York Times' and Johns Hopkins' trackers showing Dec. 5 as having fewer deaths than Pearl Harbor, the average number of deaths per day for the first five days of December, is above the number of casualties seen back in 1941 on all three trackers.
Our rating: True
We rate the claim that more Americans died from COVID-19 in each of the first five days of December than in the Pearl Harbor attack as TRUE, as the source cited in the post affirms the claim. Other sources show a lower death toll on Dec. 5 but higher tolls on Dec. 1-4, highlighting the difficulty to accurately track COVID-19 deaths.

Gov. Bill Lee: We can vaccinate 100,000 people in two days

Texto completo: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that Tennessee is ready to administer about 100,000 COVID-19 vaccinations in a matter of 48 hours, though the state will receive only about half that many doses in its first shipment.
Lee's statement, given at a White House vaccine summit, highlights the vast gap between states' appetite for the desperately needed vaccine and the United States' severely limited supply.
The initial shipment of vaccine to Tennessee, expected as early as this weekend, will include about 56,000 doses of Pfizer's two-dose vaccine. This shipment will be large enough to give one dose to about 12% of the highest priority population in the state. The state's distribution plan prioritizes front-line health care workers, first responders and residents and staff of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.
Lee traveled to the White House on Tuesday for a roundtable discussion at a "vaccine summit" touting the vaccine as a triumph of government efficiency and scientific research. Lee praised the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" program while flanked by his counterparts from Texas, Florida and Louisiana.
"You've done an unimaginable job of bringing this to the states," Lee said. "Now it's our turn to do what needs to be done to get out to, in our case, millions of Tennesseans who will have the choice to take this."
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who led one of the summit's roundtable discussions, at one point asked each governor in attendance how long it would take to vaccinate 100,000 people in their state.
Lee answered first. He mentioned that Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey was in the audience – and she likely knew the answer for certain – then he gave his estimate.
"I'm going to say, Dr. Piercey, that we could do it in 24 to 48 hours," Lee said.
Governors in Texas and Louisiana also said 48 hours or less. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state could administer the vaccine "pretty expeditiously" but gave no specific answer.
Trump signs unclear vaccine executive order
The White House vaccine summit began with President Donald Trump signing an executive order intended to prioritize Americans in the government rollout of the vaccine. The order came a day after a bombshell report that raised questions about whether Trump missed an opportunity this summer to secure more vaccine for Americans.
The New York Times reported Monday the Trump administration passed on a chance to lock in the purchase of additional doses of Pfizer's prospective vaccine in July, allowing competing nations to jump ahead in line for a limited supply. The Pfizer vaccine is set to be approved for use in United States on Thursday but will remain in short supply into and throughout next year. The White House denied The New York Times report.
The executive order Trump signed Tuesday will have an uncertain impact, if any. The order states it is the policy of the United States that Americans should be prioritized to receive any vaccine "developed in the United States or procured by the United States Government." It is unclear how the order will impact drug companies, many of which are international corporations, that signed contracts to produce vaccine for other nations.
Moncef Slaoui, Trump's chief vaccine official, said in a Tuesday morning interview on "Good Morning America" that he did not know the impact of the executive order.

Texto completo: The Warriors dynasty allowed a reporter to spend some unexpected, and extremely welcome, time with his dad.
Marc Stein is away this week.
I'm not ready to say goodbye to the Golden State Warriors.
I find myself pining for the splendor of Steph Curry, the snarl of Draymond Green, the beautiful basketball, the sheer dominance. I fear we may never see it again -- at least, not at the level we once did.
Klay Thompson's shredded Achilles' tendon probably means a second straight lost season, and possibly a fatal blow to the Warriors' hopes for a revival. And that's where I truly become wistful.
I don't miss the Warriors as a fan would (my San Jose roots notwithstanding). It's not just that I'll miss writing about their roundball artistry (though that's certainly true, too). It's more personal than that.
To their fans, the Warriors provided endless basketball bliss -- a montage of deep 3s and shimmies and raucous parades. To others, they provided a standard of selfless play and joyful domination. They defined an era, and redefined the formula for building a superteam.
But they gave me something far more precious: a final few hours with my father. I just didn't know it at the time.
From 2015 to 2019, the Warriors were a fixture in the N.B.A. finals. So for five straight Junes, I got a bonus trip to see my parents, who reside outside Sacramento, about two hours from the Bay Area. The detour became a cherished annual tradition.
We don't root for teams in this business. But we do (quietly) root for results out of self-interest. We root for great stories and historic performances -- and against games going to overtime on deadline.
And so I'll admit I smiled a bit each spring, as the Warriors finished off Houston or Oklahoma City or San Antonio, because it meant another trip home.
In 2019, I squeezed in the visit on June 3, as the N.B.A. finals shifted from Toronto to Oakland, the series tied at one game each. Curry was humming. Thompson was still healthy. Kevin Durant was on the mend, and looming. The dynasty was still intact.
I arrived at Mom and Dad's in time for dinner, then settled in for "Jeopardy!," my father's favorite show. James Holzhauer, a dynasty in his own right, was primed for his 33rd straight game.
The next morning, I said my goodbyes and headed back to Oakland. I planned to see them again in August, for my dad's 84th birthday.
My dad was neither a journalist nor a serious sports fan, but he loved newspapers, enjoyed watching the occasional 49ers game with me and was one of my greatest cheerleaders from the moment I chose the sportswriting path.
If I'm tracing my career to a single moment, it's "The Catch" -- Joe Montana to Dwight Clark, in the N.F.C. championship game in 1982 -- which sent a mighty dopamine jolt through my preteen brain and ignited my fandom. (The Warriors were an afterthought back then, although I did once serve as ball boy for a day, at age 9, after winning a drawing at a children's shoe store.)
I spent my mornings immersed in the San Jose Mercury News sports section. And for that I can thank my dad, a voracious reader who religiously subscribed to The Merc and The Wall Street Journal, and instilled in his three sons the same curiosity about the world.
Sy Beck, of Pelham Parkway, was a proud Bronx native who grew up at a time when New York had a dozen daily newspapers -- and by his telling, he read them all. He would boast, in that New York way of his, that none of our local papers could measure up to his favorite, The New York Times.
So it was surely a bittersweet moment when I broke the news in 2004: I was moving to New York to cover the Knicks for The Times.
I know there was sadness about the distance, but I also know Dad was thrilled and proud. Fifty years earlier, he'd taken a school field trip to the old Times building on West 43rd Street, marveling over the printing presses and Linotype machines. Now here I was, walking into that same newsroom for the biggest opportunity of my career.
Dad didn't watch a lot of basketball, but I knew he was following my work from the periodic emails he'd send to comment on a particular lede or turn of phrase.
"Just read your game 5 story or should i say poetry," he wrote after a finals game in 2013. "I hope your bosses appreciate it much as mom and i do. I am sure most of your readers do."
From April 2017, when I wrote about Michael Jordan's enduring shadow as the so-called greatest of all time: "Your GOAT story was sent out as a 'Pocket' favorite in todays email from them."
I once wrote about the simmering Knicks-Nets rivalry, and the tensions between the Knicks owner James L. Dolan and the Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, eliciting this email quip from Dad: "Dolan can get you sent to Staten Island, but Prokhorov might be able to send you to the Gulag."
The N.B.A. season will be underway again soon, although largely without fans in attendance, or in-person access for reporters, or any sense of normalcy.
But I think I'll miss the travel more than anything, even after two million miles and 2,000 hotel nights over the last 23 years. The beat has surely cost me many nights at home, but it has also kept me connected with far-flung friends and family.
Trips to Portland meant getting drinks with an old high school friend. Going to Milwaukee meant dinner with a college newspaper buddy who is now a doctor. In Denver, it was an old newsroom pal who went on to cover the Afghanistan war and the 2008 Democratic primaries. Once I moved East, the beat got me frequent trips back to California.
Sometimes, the beat has placed me in exactly the right place at the right time.
In April 2011, I got to spend a morning with my Grandma Ruth, at a nursing home outside Sacramento -- a trip I took to report on the Kings' (seemingly) imminent move to Anaheim. She died a week later, at 94.
In December 2016, after a trip to Milwaukee for a feature on the Bucks rookie Thon Maker, I detoured to Chicago, to visit my Aunt Judy, who had been battling a rare form of cancer for three years. She was gone three weeks later.
Without the N.B.A., I never get those final moments.
Call it synchronicity or fate or bashert. Maybe it was just the basketball gods looking out for me. I don't know.
But I know this: The Warriors got me a trip home in June 2019, at a time I never would have been there otherwise. We watched Holzhauer lose that night, and I think Dad was disappointed to see the streak end. In the days that followed, the Warriors would lose Durant to a torn Achilles', Thompson to a ruptured A.C.L. and the title to the Raptors.
The next week, Dad had a bad fall at home, breaking two bones in his neck. He spent the next few weeks recovering, rehabilitating and making plans to go home again. We had no reason to think he wouldn't. But the fall set off a cascade of other problems, and one day I got a call that he'd been taken, unconscious, from the board-and-care facility to the hospital. Multiple organs were failing.
By the time I arrived back in California, he was effectively in a coma. Two nights later, he was gone.
At the time, I felt robbed of the chance to say goodbye or any of the things you imagine you might say when you know the end is coming. I guess I still sort of feel that way. But I am grateful for those final moments I got at his hospital bedside, and for one otherwise-ordinary evening in June, when the Warriors still reigned supreme, Holzhauer was undefeated and Dad could match wits with Alex Trebek from his recliner.
I don't know if the Warriors can regain the magic that made them great. I don't know if we'll ever see them dominating the N.B.A. again, or owning the finals spotlight. But I'm thankful they did for those five years, and although I never-ever-ever root for teams, I'm quietly hoping they do it again.

Texto completo: The claim: The first vaccine recipients in the UK are crisis actors
This week, Margaret Keenan — a grandmother who turns 91 next week — became the first recipient of the coronavirus vaccine in the United Kingdom.
She received the shot, produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, on Dec. 8 at University Hospital Coventry and said it was "the best early birthday present," per USA TODAY.
But some skeptics have taken to the internet with allegations that Keenan is not who she claims — and is actually a crisis actor.
An analysis by USA TODAY showed that in just 24 hours, over 475,000 Twitter users were potentially exposed to a single tweet that levied the allegation.
'We are talking about people’s lives': Dire warnings of public health crisis as COVID-19 vaccine misinformation rages
The proof they cite ranges from photos of similar-looking women to the variant dates on news articles that feature photos of vaccine recipients like Keenan.
Joe Ward, for example, posted a photo of Keenan receiving the vaccine, a photo of another woman falling to the ground, and a screenshot of a profile on the casting website StarNow.
"Liz Scott AKA Margaret Keenan. Crisis Actor. Whoops...," he wrote on Facebook.
Mindy Robinson, meanwhile, posted screenshots of two news articles featuring photos of Keenan. The first — a story about Keenan from BBC — was dated Dec. 8. The second was a story about the coronavirus death tally, dated Oct. 22.
"Excuse me, but how is the exact same person who’s the 'first to get vaccinated' today...also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October?" she wrote on Twitter.
Erin Marie Olszewski also posted screenshots of articles with different dates. Rather than Keenan, the articles include photos of William Shakespeare, 81, the second recipient of the shot.
The first — a story about Shakespeare, from BBC — was dated Dec. 8. The second was the same story on CNN about the coronavirus death tally, dated Oct. 22.
"Crisis actors," she wrote on Facebook. She also posted a meme that compared photos of Shakespeare and Keenan as they received the shot, administered by the same nurse.
"Busy nurse today working in Coventry and Stratford-upon-Avon at the same time," the meme reads, along with a sarcastic emoji.
Ward and Robinson have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.
Olszewski told USA TODAY that her post "didn't claim that it was for sure."
Rather, she posted it as an example of what she sees to be a pattern of media that "fakes the news" on COVID-19.
"Even if this particular one isn't true, it has happened in the past, and that cannot be disputed," Olszewski said.
Fact check: COVID-19 tests are not compiling people’s DNA
No credible evidence that vaccine recipients were crisis actors
There is no credible evidence to suggest that Keenan is a crisis actor.
In reality, the now-retired grandmother is a former jewelry shop assistant, per a press release from the National Health Service.
She is clearly depicted in photos and videos from Reuters and the NHS England — and looks different from both of the women in the other photos posted by Ward.
Take the photo of a woman falling to the ground.
The image — snapped by Justin Tallis, a staff photographer for the AFP — came from an anti-lockdown, anti-vaccination demonstration in London on Sept. 26.
The woman in the photo hardly resembles Keenan, apart from her red hair. She appears to be much younger and less frail.
The same is true of Liz Scott, the woman in the profile on the casting website Star Now.
On her profile, Scott lists her hair and eye color as brown. In contrast, Keenan has red hair and blue eyes. Scott also lists no acting experience, including crisis acting.
Asked about the crisis-actors conspiracy theory, a journalist at The Sun told Lead Stories that Keenan is "100 percent a real person."
"She and her family have spoken to various media outlets and there are loads of pics of her out there if you Google," he wrote in an email. "Journalists have also been to her home. The whole theory is ... crazy."
What about the articles that feature photos of Keenan and Shakespeare, but are dated prior to Dec. 8?
The story in question, published on CNN.com on Oct. 22, covered a report on the coronavirus death tally. The article doesn't actually include any images of Keenan or Shakespeare.
But directly below the headline, the webpage displays a video reel with a recent handful of videos, including a video on the recent vaccinations that shows footage of Keenan and Shakespeare.
Mindy Robinson herself later noted this, and tweeted: "So, benefit of the doubt they just use new stories in their banners on old articles?"
The meme about the nurse who administered the shots is also wrong.
It claims that the nurse who administered the shots was working in "Coventry and Stratford-upon-Avon at the same time." She wasn't — but she didn't have to be.
Shakespeare received the shot at University Hospital Coventry, just like Keenan. Both received the vaccine from nurse May Parsons, per the New York Times.
(It was a different William Shakespeare, the 16th-century playwright, who hailed from the town of Stratford-upon-Avon.)
Fact checkers from Reuters and Politifact have also debunked claims that Keenan is a crisis actor.
A few other claims about Keenan have appeared online, too.
Some have claimed that Keenan is actually dead based on an obituary from 2008. But the subject of the online memorial is "clearly a completely different person," according to Vice News.
Others have baselessly asserted that a gesture she made links her to the Freemasons or the Illuminati. There's no proof of a connection to either.
Our rating: False
Based on our research, the claim that the first vaccine recipients in the U.K. are crisis actors is FALSE. There is no evidence that Margaret Keenan, a grandmother who will turn 91 next week, is a crisis actor. Photos used as proof depict different-looking women. A story on CNN in October does not actually show Keenan or William Shakespeare, who also received the vaccine; it just includes a video of them in a reel above the story. And they both received their shots in Coventry.

Gov. Lee: We can vaccinate 100,000 in two days

Texto completo: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that Tennessee is ready to administer about 100,000 COVID-19 vaccinations in a matter of 48 hours, though the state will receive only about half that many doses in its first shipment.
Lee's statement, given at a White House vaccine summit, highlights the vast gap between states' appetite for the desperately needed vaccine and the United States' severely limited supply.
The initial shipment of vaccine to Tennessee, expected as early as this weekend, will include about 56,000 doses of Pfizer's two-dose vaccine. This shipment will be large enough to give one dose to about 12% of the highest priority population in the state. The state's distribution plan prioritizes front-line health care workers, first responders and residents and staff of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.
Lee traveled to the White House on Tuesday for a roundtable discussion at a "vaccine summit" touting the vaccine as a triumph of government efficiency and scientific research. Lee praised the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" program while flanked by his counterparts from Texas, Florida and Louisiana.
"You've done an unimaginable job of bringing this to the states," Lee said. "Now it's our turn to do what needs to be done to get out to, in our case, millions of Tennesseans who will have the choice to take this."
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who led one of the summit's roundtable discussions, at one point asked each governor in attendance how long it would take to vaccinate 100,000 people in their state.
Lee answered first. He mentioned that Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey was in the audience – and she likely knew the answer for certain – then he gave his estimate.
"I'm going to say, Dr. Piercey, that we could do it in 24 to 48 hours," Lee said.
Governors in Texas and Louisiana also said 48 hours or less. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state could administer the vaccine "pretty expeditiously" but gave no specific answer.

Texto completo: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that Tennessee is ready to administer about 100,000 COVID-19 vaccinations in a matter of 48 hours, though the state will receive only about half that many doses in its first shipment.
Lee's statement, given at a White House vaccine summit, highlights the vast gap between states' appetite for the desperately needed vaccine and the United States' severely limited supply.
The initial shipment of vaccine to Tennessee, expected as early as this weekend, will include about 56,000 doses of Pfizer's two-dose vaccine. This shipment will be large enough to give one dose to about 12% of the highest priority population in the state. The state's distribution plan prioritizes front-line health care workers, first responders and residents and staff of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.
Lee traveled to the White House on Tuesday for a roundtable discussion at a "vaccine summit" touting the vaccine as a triumph of government efficiency and scientific research. Lee praised the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" program while flanked by his counterparts from Texas, Florida and Louisiana.
"You've done an unimaginable job of bringing this to the states," Lee said. "Now it's our turn to do what needs to be done to get out to, in our case, millions of Tennesseans who will have the choice to take this."
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who led one of the summit's roundtable discussions, at one point asked each governor in attendance how long it would take to vaccinate 100,000 people in their state.
Lee answered first. He mentioned that Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey was in the audience – and she likely knew the answer for certain – then he gave his estimate.
"I'm going to say, Dr. Piercey, that we could do it in 24 to 48 hours," Lee said.
Governors in Texas and Louisiana also said 48 hours or less. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state could administer the vaccine "pretty expeditiously" but gave no specific answer.
Trump signs unclear vaccine executive order
The White House vaccine summit began with President Donald Trump signing an executive order intended to prioritize Americans in the government rollout of the vaccine. The order came a day after a bombshell report that raised questions about whether Trump missed an opportunity this summer to secure more vaccine for Americans.
The New York Times reported Monday the Trump administration passed on a chance to lock in the purchase of additional doses of Pfizer's prospective vaccine in July, allowing competing nations to jump ahead in line for a limited supply. The Pfizer vaccine is set to be approved for use in United States on Thursday but will remain in short supply into and throughout next year. The White House denied The New York Times report.
The executive order Trump signed Tuesday will have an uncertain impact, if any. The order states it is the policy of the United States that Americans should be prioritized to receive any vaccine "developed in the United States or procured by the United States Government." It is unclear how the order will impact drug companies, many of which are international corporations, that signed contracts to produce vaccine for other nations.
Moncef Slaoui, Trump's chief vaccine official, said in a Tuesday morning interview on "Good Morning America" that he did not know the impact of the executive order.

Texto completo: A car explodes, bullets riddle their target. It’s unclear which happens first, but the end result is the death of the godfather of Iran’s nuclear weapons program in a convoy east of Tehran in late November. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a senior officer in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, was a wanted man. So was Abu Muhammad al Masri, al Qaeda’s No. 2. Two weeks before Fakhrizadeh’s death, Masri’s rumored killing in Tehran in August, on the anniversary of deadly U.S. Embassy attacks in Africa that he masterminded, was confirmed. A consensus has formed around Israeli involvement in both events, and American involvement at least in Masri’s death. The Trump administration earlier this year also ordered the successful strike against famed Revolutionary Guard commander and floor leader of Iran’s regional war-making Gen. Qassem Suleimani.
These events punctuated the Trump administration's successful campaign to remake global hot spots and build alliances, culminating in once-unthinkable peace agreements. Just days before Fakhrizadeh’s killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were in northern Saudi Arabia for a historic meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. That meeting followed the Abraham Accords, peace-and-normalization deals President Trump brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Sunni Gulf kingdoms whose very public accommodation with Jerusalem could not have come without Riyadh’s approval. The administration negotiated a similar deal between Serbia and Kosovo, achieving a tensions-defusing trade deal after the European Union had failed for a decade to bring the two sides to common ground. And a breakthrough in Latin America showed a degree of patience and behind-the-scenes organization that had the United States enabling a unity of voice and purpose among the Organization of American States that will surely outlast the administration.
That was a recurring theme during the four-year run of nontraditional diplomacy: Critics constantly warned of impending war, but it was the peace agreements that materialized.
“If the primary purpose of the killing of Mr. Fakhrizadeh was to make it harder to restart the Iran nuclear agreement, then this assassination does not make America, Israel or the world safer,” tweeted Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who is no stranger to such fits of illogic. The world is unquestionably safer with fewer nuclear terrorists and more reconciliation between old foes.
“The killing could complicate Biden’s handling of the Iran nuclear deal,” suggested the New York Times. The “sense of humiliation and apprehension in Tehran may complicate Biden’s efforts to calm tensions,” according to the Washington Post. Fakhrizadeh’s death “will also complicate any effort by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to revive the detente of Barack Obama’s presidency,” said Reuters. The BBC opined it could “complicate an already challenging course for a new US team to re-engage with the Islamic Republic.”
Peace, in other words, is precisely the problem, according to the dominant left-of-center narrative on foreign affairs, because it “complicates” America’s ability to jettison its regional alliances in favor of empowering a rogue terrorist state on the basis of the sunk-cost fallacy: Democratic foreign policy hands have already invested so much in an Iran-centered Gulf and Mediterranean order that it has concretized into partisan dogma.
In truth, that’s only half of it. The rest of the investment is in ridiculing the idea that President Art of the Deal actually knows how to negotiate. But the fact is that while Trump and his team’s approach to negotiations are admittedly a wild mismatch for certain types of strategic diplomacy, they are a surprisingly good fit for others. He got nowhere with North Korea, Russia, and Turkey, but Trump’s bottom-line, year-zero, unsentimental approach to mutual-interest deal-making blew expectations, and most of his predecessors, out of the water in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Latin America.
That less-experienced diplomats were the ones thinking outside the box should not surprise, but it has made it harder for the bureaucratized establishment to swallow its pride and acknowledge the progress. Two of Trump’s ambassadors in particular, Richard Grenell in Berlin and David Friedman in Jerusalem, faced aggressive opposition from predecessors but turned out to be among the more effective envoys in recent years. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and Pompeo joined them in that category, and their efforts were boosted by veteran foreign-policy hands such as John Bolton and Elliott Abrams, especially in Latin America.
But it’s important to understand why they succeeded where they did — not from back-patting or score-settling but because they added valuable tools to America’s diplomatic abilities and revealed a crucial piece of information about entrenched conflicts around the world. If the Biden team is prepared to turn the clock back to 2016, it will rebury a diplomatic Rosetta Stone and stop an America-led march of progress in its tracks.
This is no idle worry. Biden and his incoming national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, have already said they’ll seek to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, and in 2017, Sullivan criticized Trump’s approach to the Israeli-Arab conflict as not conducive to bringing peace. John Kerry, who was secretary of state during the Iran deal talks, will also join the Biden administration. He has come in for his own (deserved) round of mockery for his 2016 comments: “There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world. I want to make that very clear to all of you. I’ve heard several prominent politicians in Israel sometimes saying, well, the Arab world’s in a different place now, and we just have to reach out to them, and we can work some things with the Arab world, and we’ll deal with the Palestinians. No. No, no, and no.”
We now know that Kerry, Sullivan, and the foreign-policy establishment were wrong about this. I don’t use the term “establishment” as a bogeyman; it is not a criticism to acknowledge years of experience in one’s industry. But conventional wisdom is not the same thing as accrued wisdom, and those in Washington must remember the difference.
So, what was it the conventional thinkers were so wrong about? In a word: ghosts. “The past is a foreign country,” goes the famous adage. The Trump team took this to its logical conclusion and all but excluded the past from negotiations.
Serbian business leaders “credited the Trump administration and US Special Envoy for Serbia-Kosovo negotiations Richard Grenell for focusing on ‘economic normalization’ between the sides, something that past US administrations had not done,” reported the Jerusalem Post's Lahav Harkov, quoting Serbia’s Chamber of Commerce president as saying: “‘It’s good for talks. They’re more relaxed’ than when negotiations are focused on matters of principle and history.”
Indeed, Theodore Geshkoff wrote in a 1940 treatise for Columbia University, “The Balkans are usually reported to the outside world only in time of terror and trouble; the rest of the time they are scornfully ignored.” Events were heading that way again before Grenell achieved a breakthrough.
Much of Kosovo is ethnically Albanian, but there is a Serbian enclave within Kosovo along its border with the Serbian republic, a legacy of the bloody collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. In January 2018, a Kosovo Serb leader was shot and killed outside his party’s offices in that enclave, bringing EU-sponsored talks to a halt. Soon after that, Germany reminded Serbia of its insistence that it recognize Kosovo’s independence as a condition of entry to the EU. From there, a Serbia-Kosovo power supply agreement broke down. It was an early hint that “economic ties” were more important to regional peace than they are traditionally given credit for. That fall, another reminder: Kosovo tagged Bosnia with tariffs after the latter blocked Kosovo’s accession to Interpol. The tax fights would intensify, and by the end of the year, Kosovo’s legislature had voted to create a standing army.
Things would continue to fray into 2019, until Trump sent Grenell, who was ambassador to Germany, to the Balkans. “Before long, Mr. Grenell offended and alienated European diplomats who had worked hard on Kosovo for years,” the New York Times reported, embracing the EU side of the turf war. “They accused him of ignoring their own, more evolved peace initiatives, of undermining democracy in Kosovo and of turning a blind eye to budding authoritarianism in Serbia, a Russian ally.” Yet by June, Grenell had announced a breakthrough. Grenell had shaken up talks by no longer reflexively taking Kosovo’s side and pressuring Kosovo to drop its tariffs on Serbia. This past September, the two sides inked an economic normalization agreement at the White House.
Exorcising demons was also a key element of the administration’s intervention in Latin America in 2018-2019. But this time, it was America’s own demons.
The culminating event of that intervention was in early 2019 at the Organization of American States’s building in Washington. There, the U.S. and 15 other countries signed a statement saying they recognize and express “full support to the President of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, who has assumed the role of Interim President of the Republic of Venezuela, in accordance with Venezuelan constitutional norms and due to the illegitimacy of the Nicolas Maduro regime.”
Maduro is the dictator-successor to Hugo Chavez, and the statement was the body’s decision, with American backing, to acknowledge that according to the proper Venezuelan constitutional process, Guaido was the rightful acting president. The announcement was delivered not by the U.S. but by Argentina, and the process led by the organization and a former foreign minister of Uruguay, Luis Almagro. American support was crucial but only promised once it was clear what Latin American leaders were willing to put on the line so it didn’t reprise the heavy-handed history of U.S. involvement in Latin American affairs. Senior OAS officials told the Washington Examiner at the time that this was structured deliberately so as to avoid reviving “all the historical demons.” At the same time, Colombian Ambassador Francisco Santos told the Washington Examiner, it enabled the greatest act of Latin American consensus “probably since the Cuban missile crisis.”
Pompeo, Bolton, and Abrams brought a mix of hands-on experience and new thinking and may have solved one riddle of U.S.-Latin American relations by striking the perfect balance between restraint and power politics. Most of all, they weren’t afraid to act out of the fear of ghosts. Instead, they banished them.
Nowhere was this ghost-busting more significant or surprising than in the Middle East. Neither was there any theater more in need of fresh thinking.
To say Kushner’s assigned role as Middle East peace coordinator was met with skepticism would be a gross understatement. His expanding portfolio in the White House became a running punchline on social media. The Washington Post's Alexandra Petri wrote a satirical column titled “I have just read 25 books and am here to perform your open-heart surgery.”
Petri’s entry in the mocking-Jared industry is especially notable because she laid out statements by Kushner at the beginning of the piece that she considered particularly humorous. One was: “What I would encourage people to do is try to divorce yourself from all of the history that’s happened over the years and read this plan.” This statement was widely derided as ignorant, but, in fact, Kushner was right and would soon prove himself so in a Middle East already adjusting to changes in U.S. policy brought about by Trump and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman.
In July 2009, President Barack Obama met with Jewish leaders at the White House. America, he told them, had been mistaken in trying to adhere to its goal of “no daylight” with Israel. During the previous eight years of the George W. Bush administration, Obama told Jewish leaders, “There was no space between us and Israel, and what did we get from that? When there is no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility with the Arab states.” Obama wanted to put some space between the U.S. and Israel, and proceeded to do exactly that. His experiment was a flop: He was the least successful president regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict since the end of the Cold War.
Trump sought to correct this. He recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there. Trump also had the U.S. recognize Israeli sovereignty over its Golan Heights in the north. When Friedman was announced as the pick for ambassador to Israel, liberal figures insisted he was too pro-Israel and too supportive of what they viewed as the Israeli Right. But success followed.
Kushner, thus, began his push for peace with the wind at his back: Pundits and so-called “experts” had all promised there would be bloodshed from Trump’s Jerusalem moves, but none had materialized because they fundamentally misunderstood the region’s politics. The Palestinians rejected Kushner’s “economic peace” model out of hand, just as they have rejected every peace plan before it. But it turned out he had some surprising takers.
The Palestinians’ legitimate drive for statehood and self-determination had taken on an outsize role in the region’s affairs. Ramallah effectively was given a veto over Arab normalization with Israel. But when Trump called their bluff over Jerusalem, it shattered the myth that you had to go through the Palestinians if you wanted public cooperation and reconciliation with Israel. Trump’s decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal also showed America’s Sunni Gulf allies that he could be trusted to restore the bonds broken by Obama’s attempts to favor Iran over traditional allies.
Much like the ancient ghosts of ethnic conflict that haunt the Balkans, the Middle East was a place where the Palestinians didn’t hold the only veto; history had one too. But the Trump administration approached it with an unsentimental proposal: Don’t be ruled by inherited rivalries and the trauma of the past; if you have the chance to make your lives better right now, take it. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain did, striking recognition deals that include trade and civil aviation plus joint efforts to combat anti-Semitism. Sudan joined the party, agreeing to normalize relations with Israel and having the U.S. remove it from a list of terror-sponsoring states. On Dec. 10, Morocco entered the normalization-with-Israel parade in return for the U.S.’s recognition of its sovereignty over Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony.
None of this is to say this tack will always work — it won’t. But in several fraught regions weighed down by the bloodshed of history, it offered a path out of the desert. Future administrations, very much including the incoming Biden White House, should study these lessons carefully, adding one more tool to America’s diplomatic arsenal.

Reminder: Media deliberately suppressed the Hunter Biden investigation story

Texto completo: The big but wrong lesson establishment newsrooms thought they learned following the 2016 presidential election was not that they’re trapped in an ideological echo chamber, but that they did not “resist” Donald Trump hard enough.
They have spent the past four years applying that lesson — and resist they have, going so far as to bury potentially explosive and legitimately newsworthy reports suggesting President-elect Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, may have leveraged his father’s political clout to line the family’s pockets.
The Justice Department revealed this week that it is investigating Hunter Biden's business activities, particularly his dealings in China. A joint force made up of federal prosecutors in Delaware, the IRS Criminal Investigation agency, and the FBI has already begun issuing subpoenas and interview requests.
"I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Biden the lesser said this week in a statement. “I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.”
The federal investigation, which began in 2018, is focused specifically on possible counterintelligence concerns, including that Hunter Biden's business dealings with Chinese executives may have included tax and money laundering violations.
What is especially notable about the Justice Department’s announcement this week is that details of its investigation first came to light this fall, back when the New York Post scooped the entire news industry with a report detailing the existence of a laptop, which reportedly belonged to Hunter Biden, and possibly incriminating emails pertaining to his business activities.
Neither Joe Biden nor his presidential campaign disputed the authenticity of the emails, which came into the New York Post’s possession via President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Included among the laptop materials published by the New York Post is an FBI document that includes a case number with “the code associated with an ongoing federal money-laundering investigation in Delaware,” according to the Daily Beast.

“Another document—one with a grand jury subpoena number—appeared to show the initials of two assistant U.S. attorneys linked to the Wilmington, Delaware, office,” the report adds.

At the same time that the New York Post was reporting about the emails, focusing mostly on Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine, the computer repairman who turned the laptop over to the FBI in 2019 showed reporters a copy of a subpoena. It was a subpoena that, as it turns out, is very much real.

And you know what happened after the New York Post reported on the existence of the laptop and the emails and published the corresponding documents? Twitter locked the New York Post out of its account for allegedly spreading disinformation while establishment media assured everyone that the story was flimsy, that it was false, and that it was most likely the work of Kremlin operatives.
National Public Radio News Managing Editor Terence Samuel, for instance, stated publicly in October that his newsroom would not “waste our time on stories that are not really stories.
“We don't want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions,” he said.
“There are many, many red flags in that New York Post investigation,” NPR Public Editor Kelly McBride said elsewhere in her daily newsletter. “Intelligence officials warn that Russia has been working overtime to keep the story of Hunter Biden in the spotlight.”
CNN published an entire “anatomy” of the New York Post's “dubious Hunter Biden story.”

Politico meanwhile published a report on Oct. 19 titled, “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.”
Infuriatingly enough, after doing its part to dismiss the story as a Kremlin operation, Politico published a follow-up report after Election Day titled, “How 'Obamagate' and Hunter’s 'laptop from hell' fizzled.”
Yeah, funny how that works.
“Trump embraces reported Russian anti-Biden disinfo campaign,” MSNBC reported.
The New York Times reported, “Trump said to be warned that Giuliani was conveying Russian disinformation.”

New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman added some meat to the disinformation angle, reporting, “Confirming the WaPo reporting that Trump was given a warning about Giuliani and Russian misinformation late last year."
The Washington Post, which tells us that “democracy dies in darkness,” even published a report with the totally unintelligible headline, “Biden relies on pattern of activity to blame Russia for release of data from what is said to be his son’s laptop.”
Reminder: Evidence of the Justice Department's investigation of Hunter Biden was out in the open following the New York Post's publication of the laptop’s reported contents. It was right there for establishment journalists with the full backing of their newsrooms to authenticate and investigate. But they didn’t. Instead, they alleged a Kremlin conspiracy. They alleged it without a single shred of actual evidence to that effect. Not one.
“U.S. intelligence agencies believed that Rudy Giuliani was being worked over by Russian intelligence assets as a conduit to feed misinformation to the president of the United States,” said the Washington Post’s Philip Rucker.

NBC News’s Ken Dilanian claimed elsewhere, “The picture here is that Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, seems to have been in the crosshairs of Russian intelligence who were trying to peddle disinformation and discredit Joe Biden.”

NBC’s crackerjack “disinformation” expert Ben Collins claimed that reporters simply could not cover the Biden allegations because the press is not in physical possession of said laptop.

“Reminder for your uncle,” he explained, “the press can’t cover ‘Hunter’s hard drive’ because … we don’t have access to it.”
For the record, this is a completely made up editorial standard.

“Trump is reading from the teleprompter about the NY Post story,” said HuffPost White House correspondent S.V. Date. “So he is now actively pushing Russian disinformation as part of his scripted campaign message. Just like 2016.”

What a ride.
We know now that not only is there a federal investigation into possibly illegal overseas business activities by Hunter Biden, but that the Justice Department has been investigating said activities since 2018. And we know about all of this mostly because the Justice Department announced it this week, not because some enterprising journalist got the scoop.

So, congratulations to the Justice Department for plugging all those Trump-era leaks. Not a single whisper in the press about this two-year-old investigation. Excellent work, everyone.
Better luck next time, establishment journalists. After four years of Russian collusion duds and dead-end impeachment stories, you all not only took a pass on reporting on a genuine federal investigation that first came to light with the New York Post’s reporting, but you actively worked to bury the story, mendaciously dismissing it all as Kremlin disinformation.
So much for what Vanity Fair called the “golden age for journalism.”

PARIS — Where can you find elaborate costumes, choreographed flourishes and live music in France right now? Not in theaters. Since the country eased its second lockdown in late November, the show has resumed in only one setting: churches.
Catholicism is the predominant faith in France, and on paper, a Roman Catholic Mass and a stage performance aren’t all that different: Both events involve a cast of professionals addressing a seated, and now socially distanced, audience.
The connections don’t stop there. At several sung Masses over the course of a week this month, I had a feeling of déjà vu, even though I had attended only a handful of religious services in my life. The ritualistic nature of the event, the dramatic buildup from scene to scene — even the slightly labored monologues — are all part and parcel of regular theater attendance.
If anything, I understood how a first-time theatergoer must feel, because it was clear everyone else knew things I didn’t: when to stand, when to sit and when to join in singing.
Yet it isn’t frowned upon to attend just for the aesthetics or the experience, in part because all churches built before 1905 are public buildings in France. And Mass, as a staging, isn’t nearly as fixed or staid as I imagined. On the contrary, it owes a lot to the decisions of each parish — artistic and otherwise.
Theater and religion have crossed paths for centuries in France. The country was once known as “the eldest daughter of the Church” for its early adoption of Catholicism as state religion, and faith colors the work of many French playwrights. The 17th-century tragedian Jean Racine, for instance, drew on his austere beliefs to write two plays based on the Old Testament. In the early 20th century, the playwright Paul Claudel led a revival of Christian theater.
Yet nowadays, when only 37% of French people have a religious affiliation, according to government statistics, the church and the theater mostly operate in parallel universes. But there are exceptions: Olivier Py, for example, the director of the Avignon Festival, is a fervent Catholic who often returns to religious themes in provocative ways.
Heading to St.-Sulpice, Paris’s second-largest church, for a 7 a.m. Rorate Mass certainly felt a lot like waking up for an early-morning experimental performance in Avignon. Based on recent services at St.-Sulpice, St.-Roch and St.-Pierre de Chaillot, there are as many Masses as there are directing styles in theater. Some were short and intimate, like the Rorate, held by candlelight during the season of Advent; others leaned into old-school pomp, with full processions and choreographed genuflections.
The Rorate Mass, celebrated in the small Lady Chapel at the back of St.-Sulpice, was affecting in its simplicity. Hundreds of candles were arranged along the path to the chapel and around it, along with red lamps hung over the congregation. And the elegant marble statue of Mary (sculpted by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle) overlooking the altar was kept mysteriously, theatrically dark.
During the service, which drew a surprisingly young crowd, the atmosphere was peaceful and meditative. The young priest, Raphaël Cournault, wove the theme of light into his sermon and raised the bread and the wine chalice with dramatic pauses. Along the way, the mixture of quiet reflection and togetherness felt eerily similar to those often found in the auditorium of a show.
In an interview after the Mass, Cournault said that the staff at St.-Sulpice made concerted efforts to set the scene through music and lighting. As part of a planned upgrade of the church, they will soon work with lighting designers to fine-tune the atmosphere, he said. But, he added, “Art has to serve the liturgy. The goal isn’t to do theater, because we carry the words of another.”
That push and pull between performance and solemnity, flamboyance and restraint, was clear at the other Masses, too.
While Catholic priests are orators, all seemed reticent to lean into a little acting to amplify their message. For a nonbeliever like me, most of the homilies were as dull as paint. The Catholic charismatic movement, which favors more demonstrative practices, has aimed to inject more passion into the proceedings for decades, but few French Masses have embraced its theatrical drive.
The music was a form of compensation. While not all Masses are sung, some churches have their own choirs and organists. Since churches are state property in France, their instruments are well maintained using public funds, and are often used for concerts alongside services.
At St.-Sulpice, which boasts a superb organ, the 11 a.m. Sunday Mass is followed by a 30-minute concert. On a recent weekend, the organist Sophie-Véronique Cauchefer-Choplin filled the church’s vast space with a vivid rendering of Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in C minor (BWV 546), prompting applause from the few churchgoers who had stayed.
Musicians also have significant leeway to select or arrange music for services. Some organists are known for their improvisation abilities. Among them is Samuel Liégeon, who works at St.-Pierre de Chaillot — a little-known church, rebuilt in the 1930s, with striking Byzantine details — and he came up with a brooding fantasia to accompany Communion on a recent Sunday. That same Mass also offered Gregorian chant, a sacred, virtuosic form dating from the Middle Ages, sung without accompaniment. In the hands of Pascal Bézard, the church’s choir master, it was a solo performance of unshowy beauty.
While the Gregorian repertoire is fixed, with variations throughout the year but no additions, many churches approach the sung portions of Mass more freely. According to Marie-Charbel Dupoyet, a singer who started a new choir at St.-Sulpice, liturgical music has seen lively innovation in recent years, in part to allow younger churchgoers to connect.
Yet not everyone aims to keep up with the times. Every Sunday, St.-Roch, known as the “church of artists,” celebrates a Tridentine Mass, the traditional Latin Mass that was standard until the introduction of services in vernacular languages in the late 1960s. The Tridentine Mass isn’t exactly audience friendly: For starters, the priests perform most of it while turned toward the altar, with their backs to the congregation.
Still, it has its aficionados. The crowd on the first Sunday of December was among the largest I’ve seen indoors since the start of the pandemic. At least 400 people filled St.-Roch, with limited social distancing and no enforcement of mask rules. The priests, their attendants and the chorus did not cover their faces throughout the ceremony, with the exception of one cleric, who wore a plastic visor to give out Communion.
The laxity on display at St.-Roch was in stark contrast with the careful application of restrictions at every theater I went to between June and October, when performances were allowed. Theaters may yet be prevented from reopening on Dec. 15 as planned, as the government’s target for the next easing of restrictions — fewer than 5,000 new coronavirus cases a day — isn’t even in sight.
I was moved, at Mass, by the love and devotion I recognized in many attendees, because that’s how I feel at the theater. The decision to allow religious services while theaters and museums remain closed has been met with scorn by many in the arts here, but there is no reason to begrudge believers their worship.
Fairness demands, however, that the show go on everywhere, when it can.

Are we really less concerned with Hunter Biden than Trump's children?

Texto completo: Given how bothered the media were by President Trump's adult children, I wonder how they feel about his successor's absolute embarrassment of a son.
It's not the fairest of comparisons because Ivanka and Jared Kushner, the current president's daughter and son-in-law, held official positions in the Trump administration. And Trump's son, Don Jr., has been a major public defender of his father through and through. It doesn't look like Joe Biden's son Hunter will serve in his White House, and he's rarely seen in the media attesting to his father's strength or brilliance.
On the other hand, there's an awful lot of evidence that Hunter has used his father's stature in political Washington for lucrative, shady business dealings abroad and that Joe Biden himself knew about it. In that regard, there's no reason Hunter doesn't deserve the same amount of scrutiny, even if it's not exactly the same kind.
But the way that the media characterized Trump's children, as though they were cynical bottom feeders who deserved to be shunned by polite society, was personal. Like, personal to an uncomfortable, creepy degree.
To take just one example, Frank Bruni of the New York Times wrote last month that "just five short years ago Jared and Ivanka were dinner-party royalty here in Manhattan. ... They had money, they had youth, they had celebrity. They were thin." Following their stints in the White House, though, Bruni said that Jared and Ivanka "are about to be held accountable."
It's almost perverse. ("They were thin"?!)
The Trump children never ignited any feelings in me one way or the other, though I always thought it would be fun to talk smack with Tiffany Trump at a White House party. I can't say Joe Biden's son Hunter stirs any of my feelings either. But if I had to spend time at all thinking about any of them, I'd be most scandalized by Hunter and how humiliating he is to his own family.
News broke this week that Hunter, 50, is the subject of a federal investigation related to his taxes. And by "news broke," I mean that Biden's transition team preemptively released a statement from Hunter in an apparent attempt to control the first cycle of the story before any journalist could do it first. It's apparently about more than taxes, though. The New York Times subsequently reported that the investigation began in 2018 and "has included inquiries into potential criminal violations of tax and money laundering laws."
It's not the most explosive story of the year, at least not now. Anyone might have guessed this would come up if they happened to read the reporting from before the election about Hunter Biden's laptop and the strange emails on it that quite clearly showed him engaged in curious dealings with foreign entities.
And about that laptop — it also contained a photograph of Hunter apparently passed out with what looked like a crack pipe and a video of him perhaps doing drugs while a woman performed oral sex on him.
None of it has been proven 100% authentic, but Hunter has never denied its legitimacy. Moreover, he was, in fact, thrown out of the U.S. Navy after failing a drug test that found cocaine in his system.
I don't know if Hunter was ever "dinner-party royalty" in Manhattan. But between Trump and Biden, I do know which president's child I find more cringeworthy.

A vaccine was supposed to be the end, but the goalpost has shifted far away once again

Texto completo: We're on the cusp of distributing vaccines to suppress the coronavirus pandemic, which, the Democrats and "the experts" had assured us, was the finish line. But wait. Yes, once again, they're telling us, "Not so fast. Don't even think about lowering your mask!"
A report in the New York Times this week began by noting that two vaccines created by Pfizer and Moderna purport to have an astonishingly high success rate of preventing illness. "But," the report continued, "it’s unclear how well they will curb the spread of the coronavirus."
Sorry, what? If the vaccine prevents people from becoming severely sick, why would we continue fretting over how to "curb the spread?"
The point of the article wasn't so much to ponder over the efficacy of the vaccines. It was to promote widespread mask-wearing even after people have been vaccinated. Don we now our gay apparel!
"The Pfizer and Moderna trials tracked only how many vaccinated people became sick with COVID-19," the New York Times said. "That leaves open the possibility that some vaccinated people get infected without developing symptoms, and could then silently transmit the virus — especially if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks."
In other words, mask-wearing and "social distancing" will be needed long after the vaccines start rolling out.
For how long, you say? Well, at this point, one cannot get a straight answer from scientists on how effective masks are at preventing infection. Likewise, "the experts" won't offer a straight answer to that one, either.
In a recent interview, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's foremost expert on infectious disease, was asked when we could eliminate masks altogether. He wouldn't say. His answer is frustrating to the point of angry tears.
"I think that we’re going to have some degree of public health measures together with the vaccine for a considerable period of time," he said. "But we’ll start approaching normal, if the overwhelming majority of people take the vaccine, as we get into the third or fourth quarter [of 2021]."
Approaching normal.
That means, as of right now, it could be at least another year before there are any recommendations in changes to "social distancing" and mask-wearing. And even then, it will be in the direction of "approaching normal."
When will we actually get to normal? No answer.
This is not unlike Fauci saying just days ago, with regard to the pandemic, that he sees "light at the end of the tunnel." You know how long he's been saying that? Since at least the middle of April, nearly eight months ago.
Here's a more pressing question that no one seems to be asking and that no one will likely want to answer: How many infections of a virus that's largely harmless to the overwhelming majority of the population are acceptable for us to return to normal life? How many deaths are acceptable?
I haven't heard any of "the experts" say that there's an acceptable number for either infections or deaths. I also haven't heard any of them say that it's possible to push the virus down to zero infections and zero deaths.
We've gone from "15 days to slow the spread" to "stay home a few weeks" to "there's light at the end of the tunnel." Nine months from the start, Fauci is saying there may yet be another full year of this, and only then do we begin "approaching normal."
How long are we going to tolerate this lack of answers from the people who are supposed to have them?

Surfer Dies After Shark Attack in Hawaii

A 56-year-old surfer died in Maui, Hawaii, on Wednesday night, one day after a shark had attacked him.
The victim, who lived in the Lahaina section of Maui, was taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center after being treated at the scene. Authorities would not give his name or release details about his injuries. He was reported to be in critical, but stable, condition after an initial round of surgery Tuesday.
It was unclear what kind of shark had been involved and if other people had been in the water at the time of the attack.
The attack occurred before the day’s contests at the World Surf League’s Women’s Professional Surfing Competition, also known as Maui Pro. The competition was put on hold after the attack. The organization will hold it in a different location.
“We are working on options to complete the Maui Pro presented by ROXY event at an alternate location in Hawaii and will update everyone soon,” the company said on its website.
Local authorities responded to a similar episode last month, when a woman was bitten by what might have been a shark on Thanksgiving Day. CNN reported that the unnamed woman had been visiting from California, and the Maui County Fire Department said she had suffered “severe trauma” from the bite.
State officials erected shark warning signs at Honolua Bay after the 56-year-old man was attacked Tuesday.
“The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources extends its deepest condolences to the family and friends of the man killed in the shark attack on Maui this week,” the department, which set up the warning signs, said in a statement. The department manages public lands like state parks and beaches.

When Culture Really Began to Reckon With White Privilege

“Dear White American Theater.” So opened the scathing statement released June 8 and signed by some of our most influential playwrights and directors who are Black, Indigenous and people of color. “We see you. We have always seen you,” the letter read a few lines later. “We have watched you pretend not to see us.”
Landing in inboxes and on Instagram soon after Black Lives Matter activists took to the streets all over the country to protest the police killing of George Floyd, this open letter — like so many others in literature, arts and journalism — set out to expose how white gatekeepers and predominantly white-led cultural institutions systematically oppress artists and audiences of color that they claim to support.
Shortly after, it seemed as if almost every Black artist in America — from the fashion industry, Hollywood and the music world to performing arts venues and museums — began organizing with one another and decrying the specific ways that racism harmed Black creatives in their various industries (as a writer, even I signed an open letter). These examples ranged from hiring discrimination in fashion to unequal pay for African American musicians and executives to improper compensation and credit for the Black staff members in theaters and museums. While the sheer volume of the statements recognized the devastating toll that white privilege exacts on Black professional life, these open letters took it one step further. They demanded that organizations, many of which have long congratulated themselves for their open-mindedness and liberalism, reckon with their own racist practices from inside out.
Six months later, we now know that some groups rose to the occasion; others resisted. And while it is too soon to know if this moment, like the pandemic, will be consigned to the history books or if true change is on the horizon, there are some promising signs.
White actors — like Jenny Slate, who played a biracial character on the popular Netflix animated comedy “Big Mouth” — stepped away from voice roles to make space for Black actors to play Black characters. Country music groups like Lady Antebellum and the Dixie Chicks chose new names in an effort to distance themselves from glorifying the Confederate South.
Some organizations made swift changes in leadership. The president and board chairman of the Poetry Foundation stepped down immediately after an open letter signed by over 1,800 poets condemned the organization’s “non-substantive” four-sentence statement in support of Black Lives Matter. Gary Garrels, senior curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, resigned after his statements warning of “reverse discrimination” against white artists in a Zoom staff meeting came to light.
And in New York City, William Carden announced his plans to step down as artistic director of Ensemble Studio Theater, where the entirety of its four-person artistic staff is white. “The key to anti-racism is sharing power,” Carden told The New York Times in August. “It takes a lot of work and a lot of humility, and it requires that white people step aside.”
While these new measures range from the cosmetic to the substantive, they begin to chip away at a truth that Black artists have always known: that the only way to achieve equity is to expose how white privilege exists from top to bottom in many of these cultural institutions, making it nearly impossible for artists of color to tell their stories on their own terms.
Fortunately, Black artists are not waiting around for change to happen, slowly or suddenly. Radha Blank’s comedy “The 40-Year-Old Version,” which debuted on Netflix in August, portrays Blank (playing herself) as a playwright and aspiring rapper who has to wrestle with whether to compromise her aesthetic vision when a white producer, Josh Whitman (Reed Birney), agrees to stage her play, “Harlem Ave,” if she agrees to add a main white character. While Radha, the character, initially agrees to his terms, even allowing her Black female lead to appear as a caricature of African American womanhood, the film itself pokes fun at white gatekeepers and an American theater world that can only appreciate Black art when white people remain front and center.
Much like the cascade of open letters that were posted this summer, her movie provides a model to cultural institutions on how to integrate the lessons learned from our current racial reckoning. Whiteness, like any other source of power and site of privilege, must be challenged and moved out of the way as our dominant gaze so we can all finally see each other and ourselves.

A standoff between the police and protesters over a mixed-race family’s eviction in Portland, Oregon, is stirring up old ghosts of segregation and redlining from the 20th century, when Black families moved in for jobs and found that there were only certain places they could live.
But the barricades erected by demonstrators, and what the police said were caches of weapons surrounding the property, are also evoking modern-day concerns about urban safety, homelessness, gentrification and the coronavirus pandemic that have rattled the city.
William Kinney III, a spokesman for the Kinney family, which has lived in the 124-year-old house since the mid-1950s, said the family was the victim of predatory lenders in what they believed had been a deliberate attempt to extract them from a corner of Portland, northeast of downtown, where chic coffee shops and new condominium projects have risen.
The property known by supporters of the family as “The Red House” sits in a busy shopping district near a pub and a food cart pod — a symbol of gentrified Portland — and right next to the Roux, a condo building that last sold in 2016 for $6.35 million, according to property records.
On Thursday, barricades constructed with orange traffic cones, plywood, overturned dumpsters and wooden doors blocked vehicle access to the area around the house in all directions. Protesters dressed in black sat at the barricades, some warming themselves at makeshift fires.
Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, said that the court-ordered eviction of the Kinneys was legal and that he would not tolerate any attempt by protesters to create a no man’s land around the property where laws could not be enforced.
“I am authorizing the Portland Police to use all lawful means to end the illegal occupation,” he said in a tweet, adding, “There will be no autonomous zone in Portland.”
Multnomah County Sheriff’s deputies, assisted by the Portland police, arrived at the property at about 5 a.m. on Tuesday, and were met with protesters who were seen in social media posts banging on police vehicles and shouting. The officers entered the property briefly and made six arrests but did not break up the protest, and on Thursday they were not visibly present in the vicinity.
The pandemic is also filtering into the standoff. Oregon has imposed a moratorium on housing evictions, but before it did, the ownership of the house had already been transferred to a housing development company.
The bleak history of exclusion and racism that carved out Portland’s neighborhoods, dating back to World War II when Black workers were drawn to the shipyards north of downtown but often left with nowhere to live, still hangs over everything. The Albina neighborhood where the Kinney house sits became a Black enclave only after a devastating flood of the Columbia River in 1948 destroyed a housing project built for Black military workers.
Most of Kinney’s family is Black; his mother, Julie Metcalf Kinney, is from the Upper Skagit Tribe of Washington state.
The family, unable to get a mortgage as a result of redlining policies in the 1950s, paid cash for the house in 1955, according to a website set up by supporters of the family. Kinney said his parents took out a mortgage to pay legal fees when he was arrested and sent to prison following a fatal car crash in 2002.
It became clear as early as 2016 that Albina, with its older homes, had become a desirable place for reinvestment, Kinney said, when the family got an offer to buy them out. They refused, and shortly after that, the troubles began.
According to the website, a second mortgage the family had taken out on the house was transferred to another investment company in December 2016, and both companies began sending mortgage bills every month.
The family stopped paying and put the money into an escrow account, Kinney said, until the confusion could be sorted out. But instead, a default process began, leading to the eviction order.
Kinney said he and his parents believed that the mortgage lender and investment company wanted them out of the house in order to redevelop the property — part of a general move, protesters said, to edge out the neighborhood’s older Black families.
City officials have rejected such claims. “There was a lengthy, thorough judicial proceeding resulting in a lawful judge’s order to evict people illegally occupying a home,” Wheeler said on Twitter.
Calls to the current owner of the home, Urban Housing Development LLC, according to court records, were not returned.
The Kinneys were evicted in early September, after which supporters converged in the yard and on adjacent properties. The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that the protesters had created “significant livability, public safety and public health concerns” in the neighborhood.
From September through November, the sheriff’s office said, there were at least 81 calls for service to the property for fights, disturbances, shots fired, burglary, thefts, vandalism, noise violations, trespassing and threats, “including by armed individuals.”
Protesters said their aim was not to declare an autonomous zone within the city but to prevent the authorities from evicting another family from a historically Black neighborhood.
Dustin Brandon, standing inside the barricade on Thursday, said that what happened at the house would set a precedent for future attempts at eviction. “We’re in the perfect circle of everything right now,” he said. “We’re fighting for Black lives and Indigenous lives on so many levels.”
Kinney said that family members — his parents are in their 60s — have been staying in hotels or with friends, but that he has occasionally stayed at the house itself since September. After deputies revisited the house this week, in what police authorities called an effort to “re-secure” the property, Kinney said that he found plumbing broken inside and that the kitchen set up in the backyard to feed protesters was damaged.
“It’s been a peaceful eviction blockade,” he said. “The only thing that’s been violent is the brute force used by Portland Police and Multnomah County sheriffs.”

Mnuchin Grilled Over Whether Relief Money Was Politicized

WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was rebuked by a congressional oversight panel over his management of the economic relief effort Thursday, with members questioning whether he politicized the handling of hundreds of billions of dollars in stimulus funds.
Mnuchin, at times defiant and defensive of his efforts, insisted that he was simply following the law and congressional intent in his decision-making. But the scrutiny could further complicate his role in trying to secure another pandemic-relief package with lawmakers, who have criticized the secretary’s stewardship of virus funds.
Republicans and Democrats on the oversight panel raised questions about whether Mnuchin awarded a $700 million loan to YRC Worldwide, a struggling trucking company, because of its ties to White House officials. And Democrats continued to press Mnuchin about whether he ended several of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending programs to limit the incoming Biden administration.
“This was a political decision — one intended to hamstring the incoming administration even as COVID deaths are spiking and the economic recovery is slowing,” Bharat Ramamurti, an appointed member of the Congressional Oversight Commission, said at Thursday’s hearing. “Let me put it this way: Does anyone think the Treasury would have ended these programs if Donald Trump were reelected?”
The central focus of the hearing was supposed to be the $17 billion that Treasury was allotted to support companies that are deemed critical to national security. The loan to YRC, which was struggling financially before the pandemic, has been a subject of concern for the commission since the Treasury Department approved it in June. Republicans on the commission, Sen. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rep. French Hill of Arkansas, both raised questions about why the company was worthy of loan that was justified on the grounds that the company was critical to national security.
“It’s been hanging on by a thread since the global financial crisis,” Hill said.
Toomey said that YRC, which had been contracted by the Defense Department to provide meal kits, protective equipment and other supplies to military bases, appeared to be nearly insolvent and asked whether giving it money was a prudent use of taxpayer funds.
Mnuchin, a former banker, agreed that he would not have underwritten the loan if he was still in private industry but said the law gave the department the ability to help prevent financial problems and job losses at companies deemed critical to national security. He defended the loan, saying that it was granted to help prevent job losses and that, because the economy is recovering, the government would eventually turn a profit from the deal.
“There was a tremendous risk to the Department of Defense and a tremendous risk to the number of jobs,” Mnuchin said.
But Mnuchin was pressed about whether political favoritism was at play and if YRC got such a large loan so quickly because its largest financial backer is Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm with ties to the White House. Apollo, which spent nearly $1 million lobbying lawmakers this year about coronavirus relief funds, lent $184 million in 2017 to the Kushner Cos., a real estate firm run by the family of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. The loan went to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper.
Mnuchin said that Kushner had no input on the loan but said that lawmakers from both parties had urged him to find a way to help YRC, which he believed would have declared bankruptcy and laid off thousands of workers if not for the government support.
A new report from the Government Accountability Office said that the YRC loan was the only one of the 11 national security loans that the Treasury Department granted that was “fast-tracked” even though other businesses faced similar financial circumstances.
Officials from the Defense Department, which certified that YRC was critical to national security, declined to attend the hearing, drawing criticism from Toomey. The Defense Department, which stalled for weeks in providing the commission with a written response to its questions about the loan, will hold a separate teleconference with the commission about the loan program, but Toomey said the agency is resisting making the transcript of that teleconference public.
Mnuchin also parried more criticism of his decision to end five Fed lending programs. He insisted again Thursday that he was following the intent of the law in ending the programs at year-end and in clawing back billions from the Fed. That position is at odds with what many legal experts and Democrats in Congress say was actually required.
On Nov. 19, Mnuchin declared that he believed all along that the programs could not continue past year-end and asked the Federal Reserve to give back the unused investments.
Toomey had floated the legal justification Mnuchin ultimately cited in ending the programs — the idea that Congress had meant for them to shut at the end of the year — before Mnuchin publicly embraced it. He did so at a time when a senior Treasury official told The New York Times that the department was still mulling extending some of the programs.
Toomey’s recollection of congressional intent contrasts with that of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who was also involved in writing the law. Schumer takes the view that it was absolutely not the intent of Congress for the facilities to end in December, his spokesperson said, adding that they were intended to exist through the crisis, which is clearly not over.
“We have some folks who think that these facilities should be used as a way to subsidize preferred borrowers — maybe municipalities who have been irresponsible,” Toomey said Thursday. “That is absolutely not what these programs were for — they were for restoring a functioning market, and that’s why the statute called for them to come to an end. And that’s why the secretary did exactly the right thing by ending them.”
Toomey added that it “would be outrageous” for a future Treasury secretary to restart them — something Democratic senators have suggested that Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Treasury secretary, ought to do if and when she is confirmed. He suggested that a legal battle would ensue if Yellen seeks to restart the programs without congressional approval.
“We would be mired in litigation for who knows how long if someone were to go down that road,” Toomey said.

Stimulus Deal Falters as McConnell Signals Republican Resistance

WASHINGTON — Efforts to reach a year-end agreement on a stimulus package to prop up the shuddering economy faltered on Thursday as aides to Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, signaled privately that most Republicans were unlikely to endorse an emerging bipartisan compromise without changes.
In discussions with other congressional leaders, McConnell’s advisers expressed concern that Republicans could not accept liability protections for businesses that they consider too limited or funding for state and local governments that they have long resisted. Both are central elements of a $908 billion outline drafted by moderate in both parties.
The divisions on those two issues have muddied the prospects for an agreement on both a stimulus measure that lawmakers in both parties have agreed is necessary before Congress adjourns and a catchall government funding bill that must pass to avert a shutdown. And some lawmakers have begun aggressively pushing for legislation that would send $1,200 direct payments to most Americans in any package.
The warning from McConnell’s staff aides reflected the significant hurdles for the unfinished $908 billion outline, and for the stimulus talks overall. Republicans have long resisted providing billions of dollars for states, and Democrats have deemed McConnell’s proposal for a sweeping coronavirus liability shield for companies as a nonstarter that would harm workers.
McConnell’s concerns about the moderates’ compromise was earlier reported by Politico, and was relayed on the condition of anonymity by a senior Democrat familiar with the conversation between the senator’s aides and other congressional leaders. McConnell’s office declined to comment, though he has made it clear that he was cool to the compromise, instead urging his colleagues to drop both the liability shield and the state and local aid in favor of a much narrower package.
“I think the question I have is, will we say, ‘Hey, look, we were successful in getting $908 billion, getting people together to that number,’” said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, one of the lawmakers involved in the current bipartisan discussions. “We’ve solved a whole series of elements — maybe on state and local, the liability, we wait, given the time frame, until next year.”
But top Democrats have rejected the suggestion from McConnell and other Republicans that Congress put aside those two issues. They have also panned a $916 billion alternative that the White House presented on Tuesday. That proposal, outlined by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, failed to revive lapsed federal supplemental jobless payments in favor of a round of $600 stimulus checks, half the amount approved this year.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California noted on Thursday that Congress had previously stayed through Christmas to haggle over unfinished spending legislation. “We have to have a bill,” she told reporters at her weekly news conference, “and we cannot go home without it.”
The prospects for a one-week stopgap government funding bill intended to avert a shutdown on Friday and buy additional time for negotiations were unclear in the Senate on Thursday, as lawmakers struggled to secure consensus on a sweeping military policy bill and the spending measure.
As time ran short for a deal, members of both parties formed an unlikely alliance to agitate for another round of $1,200 direct payments. Sens. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent of Vermont, and Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, introduced an amendment on Thursday to include them in the must-pass spending legislation.
Sanders argued that leaving without such action would be “would be immoral, would be unconscionable, and cannot be allowed to happen.”
“I want to vote on this before we leave town,” Hawley told reporters. “We have consensus on this issue. Let’s start with this, and if nothing else, we should pass this.”

"The Rise: Black
Cooks and the Soul of
American Food," by
Marcus Samuelsson
Although it has
been 17 years(!) since he closed
Aquavit, his downtown Minneapolis restaurant, it still feels
as if Minnesotans can claim
the gifted Samuelsson as one of
our own. And we should, with
pride, because Samuelsson's
seventh cookbook (if you don't
own "The Soul of a New Cuisine"
and "The Red Rooster Cookbook," you should), written with
Osayi Endolyn,is a fascinating,
deeply researched journey into
the primary role that Black foodways plays in American cooking.
Readers are introduced to a rich
talent pool of contemporary
Black chefs, and their diverse
work comes alive in nearly 150
recipes. It's the kind of cookbook that's equally at home on
the nightstand and in the kitchen.
(Voracious, $38)
"Open Kitchen:
Inspired Food for
Casual Gatherings"
by Susan Spungen
The time will come
when friends and family will
once again gather around the
table, and when that happens,
this thoughtful beauty will be
an inspiring resource. Spungen
once ran the test kitchens at
Martha Stewart Living, and she
channels that magazine's clean,
contemporary ethos into a bevy of
shareable starters, entrees and desserts. Spungen's approach is, well,
approachable; no well-rehearsed
photo stylist techniques, fancy equipment or deeply stocked pantries are
required to turn out Instagram-worthy
dishes that will quickly become dinner
party centerpieces. (Avery, $35)
"How to Dress an Egg:
Surprising and Simple
Ways to Cook Dinner,"
by Ned Baldwin and
Peter Kaminsky
All of this practical cooking knowhow could serve as an informal syllabus for a culinary school curriculum,
but it never comes across as Educational with a capital "E." After years
as an avid home cook, Baldwin's avocation became his profession, culminating in New York City's Houseman
Restaurant, and that trajectory makes
him an ideal translator of commercial
kitchen shorthand into the language
of the home cook. Collaborating with
Kaminsky, the longtime cookbook
guru, Baldwin focuses on 20 dinner
basics -- shrimp, eggplant, cod, pork
roast and, yes, hard-cooked eggs --
followed by a handful of can't-miss
recipes that place those ingredients in
the spotlight. (Rux Martin/Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt, $30)
"Dinner in French:
My Recipes by Way of
France," by Melissa Clark
Legions of New York
Times readers have
become better cooks due to the
insight, enthusiasm and support that
Clark folds into her weekly "A Good
Appetite" column. When she opens
this invaluable book with the words,
"I can't really speak French, but I cook
in French," she's speaking for countless American Francophiles. Along
with offering foolproof formulas for
tarte flambe,brandade, brandied
chestnut soup, cheese souffls, salade Ni§oise and other classics, Clark
doesn't shy away from playfully twisting tradition (witness croque monsieur casserole and ratatouille sheetpan chicken), and her straightforward
approach to recipe writing works for
both novice and experienced cooks.
(Clarkson Potter, $37.50)
"East: 120 Vegan and
Vegetarian Recipes From
Bangalore to Beijing," by
Meera Sodha
"Vegan constraints are
a catalyst for creativity," writes Sodha
in this user-friendly collection of recipes from her vegan cooking column
in the Guardian newspaper, and then
she spends the next 300 pages proving her point. Sodha introduces her
audience to faraway places but she
never loses sight of what's available,
ingredients-wise, in everyday supermarkets. Anyone looking to discover
the possibilities lurking inside the
wonderful world of vegetables will
find Sodha to be an encouraging
and knowledgeable guide. (Flatiron
Books, $35)

"In Bibi's Kitchen: The Recipes and Stories of Grandmothers From the Eight African Countries That Touch the Indian Ocean," by Hawa Hassan and Julia Turshen
Matriarchs get their due in this gorgeous primer on East African cuisine and the culinary wisdom that grandmothers from that region hold. Chapters focus on eight countries, each with a border on the Indian Ocean. Somalia is one of them; that's where chef and author Hassan was born. To share the flavors of her childhood, she turns to the bibis who maintained recipes across time, colonialism, war and emigration. Each chapter begins with interviews with grandmothers, including one Somali woman who lives in Minneapolis. Make the fragrant Somali spice blend xawaash and throw it on everything. (Ten Speed Press, $35)
"Drinking French: The Iconic Cocktails, Aperitifs, and Caf Traditions of France," by David Lebovitz
Surely the most popular cookbooks these days must be the ones that transport you to another place. This one will send you right to a Parisian sidewalk cafe. Lebovitz, an American chef living in Paris, is a go-to resource
on modern-day French food culture for English-speaking audiences. In "Drinking French," he helps home mixologists re-create almost anything one could get at a Saint-Germain-des-Prs corner cafe, from the dense and deeply warming chocolat chaud to the bright and fruity rhum arrang. Even more satisfying than the recipes are his writings on cafe culture, including the hilarious admission that even a fluent French speaker struggles with anxiety when trying to order a glass of wine. (Ten Speed Press, $28)
"Snacking Cakes: Simple Treats for Anytime Cravings," by Yossy Arefi
Who knew there was a term for the slow nibbling one does every time they amble past a cake on the kitchen counter, slicing small slivers like it never happened, until the cake gradually disappears? Not that we needed Arefi's permission, but it helps to have a book that approves of the way we slyly peck away at baked goods. "Snacking Cakes" not only acknowledges it, but gives us the tools to do it. It's stuffed with easy, one-bowl recipes for cakes, with lots of flavor variations and tips on using whatever size pans one has on hand. Just try not trimming off another tiny piece of powdered doughnut cake, we dare you. (Clarkson Potter, $24)
"Eat Something: A Wise Sons Cookbook for Jews Who Like Food and Food Lovers Who Like Jews," by Evan Bloom and Rachel Levin
This cookbook with a splash of irony offers the culinary secrets of a San Francisco deli, but in the style of "Bar Mitzvah Disco" -- the seminal, nostalgia-fueled ode to 1970s Jewish coming-of-age parties. Open it for the classics from Wise Sons Jewish Delicatessen, such as brisket and babka. Stay for modern updates to bubbe's food, fun illustrations and comedic essays on all kinds of Jewish rites of passage. There's even a chapter on cooking for non-Jewish in-laws, and a tribute to the Chinese food many Jewish families order on Christmas -- cold sesame noodles with everything bagel chili oil for the win. (Chronicle, $30)
"The Book on Pie: Everything You Need to Know to Bake Perfect Pies," by Erin Jeanne McDowell
This is not a cookbook. This is a master's degree in pie. McDowell, a New York Times and Food52 contributor, spells out every possible path one could take in the kitchen to end up in the same place: fabulous pie. While one recipe will send you on a choose-your-own-adventure journey through the book to get the instructions for filling, dough ingredients, mixing options, fancy edges and more, you'll come out the other side a much smarter baker. Her blueberry swamp pie is an instant hit, but don't skip over the savories -- Reuben pie on pumpernickel crust is next on our list. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $35)
BOOKS FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES
"Kid in the Kitchen: 100 Recipes and Tips for Young Home Cooks," by Melissa Clark and Daniel Gercke
If getting your kid (or spouse) to put their phone down during dinner is a challenge, just embrace it. Clark, a food writer for the New York Times, leans in to the must-document-everything impulse in this cookbook for advanced young cooks, with tips and tricks on how to get Instagram-worthy shots of their creations. (Hint: Use natural light and clean your lens.) The book also has a nice selection of recipes, giving it the dual purpose of increasing culinary literacy by demystifying terms like beat, toss, whip, scrape and knead. It helps that the finished results -- like a "levitating" Dutch baby -- look great in photos, too. (Penguin Random House, $24)
"Peyton Picks the Perfect Pie: A Thanksgiving Celebration," by Jack Bishop
Thanksgiving has passed, but there's a universality in this illustrated story about a young picky eater who decides to be a little more daring. Guests who come over for the holiday each bring a pie, and they offer a little history behind them: ruffled milk pie, chess pie, millionaire's pie. Bishop, the chief creative officer of America's Test Kitchen, wrote the story, and he clearly mines ATK's recipe database to introduce Peyton to the versatile dessert. When she finally takes a bite of her mom's apple pie, it's almost as triumphant as the finale of "Green Eggs and Ham." There's a bonus recipe, too. (America's Test Kitchen Kids, $17)
"Every Night Is Pizza Night," by J. Kenji L³pez-Alt
If you've ever turned to L³pez-Alt for his expertise on pizza-making, you might see a bit of the author in this illustrated story's protagonist, Pipo. She's a young chef whose one and only dish is pizza, because it's the "best" food. But in a bout of surprising maturity, she decides to explore other people's "best" foods, and discovers bibimbap, tagine, dumplings and more throughout her apartment building and neighborhood. The book introduces budding food lovers to a world of cuisines, and comes with a pizza recipe at the end, just in case. (Norton, $18)
"Milk Bar: Kids Only," by Christina Tosi
Tosi, the founder of Milk Bar bakeries, rose to fame by re-creating desserts that hark back to childhood, when cereal and rainbow sprinkles were practically food groups. It only makes sense that she'd distill that wonder for box cake and Rice Krispies Treats to actual kids. The recipes are easy -- many of them dont require a flame -- but don't dumb down technique or flavor. Yes, there are treats nodding to her famous "compost" cookies (try it in the form of pancakes), and hidden bananas are a fun and gooey surprise in her yummy "monkey in the middle" muffins. (Clarkson Potter, $23)
"My First Cookbook: Fun Recipes to Cook Together," by America's Test Kitchen Kids
The littlest hands can make kitchen magic with a little guidance -- and helpful visual tutorials of every step. This collection of recipes from America's Test Kitchen are for the youngest cooks just starting out, with some parental assistance. Melt chocolate and dip banana slices into it. Roll up no-bake energy bites. Or get a little more advanced, baking chicken tenders or flipping pancakes. Any kid (and even some adults) will gain new confidence in the kitchen with these straightforward, photo-based guides to cooking. (America's Test Kitchen Kids, $20)

"100 Cookies: The Baking Book for Every Kitchen," by Sarah Kieffer
This is a must for anyone interested in baking and eating cookies (isn't that everyone?). Kieffer, an enterprising blogger with a devoted following, has obviously captured a moment, because this recently released title is selling like gangbusters. And with good reason: Kieffer crafts enormously appealing recipes, starting with a series of should-be-patented formulas for thin, wrinkled, crispy-chewy "pan-banging" cookies, with versions that range from chocolate chip to toasted sesame to Snickerdoodle. There are tons of gotta-bake bar cookies, too. There's seemingly no end to Kieffer's talents, because she also knows how to use a camera. (Chronicle Books, $27.50)
"The 30-Minute Paleo Cookbook," by Stephanie Meyer
Along with overseeing a Minneapolis-based meal planning company and maintaining a nutrition-focused cooking blog (freshtart.com), Meyer has produced this user-friendly gateway to the Paleo diet, which avoids most dairy, sugar and wheat, emphasizing the hunt-and-gather foods from the Paleolithic era. Her uncomplicated recipes -- a hash brown skillet dinner, a potato-caramelized onion frittata, fish tacos with roasted pineapple, orange-beef-broccoli stir fry and 90 or so others -- target a wide range of appetites. Cook your way through it, and you just might find yourself going the Paleo way. (Rockridge Press, $16.99)
"Fig," by Michelle Courtright
Fig & Farro, Courtright's plant-based Uptown restaurant, sadly did not survive the pandemic, but this strikingly photographed effort (the work of Ellen Hughes) is a memento of that enterprise. The book is a valuable repository of some of the restaurant's signature dishes, including blueberry cinnamon rolls, wild mushroom ravioli, Buffalo cauliflower and biscuits with mushroom gravy, and its handful of essays serves as a welcome reminder of the restaurant's intentional approach to sustainability and climate advocacy. ($28)
"Land of 10,000 Plates: Stories and Recipes From Minnesota," by Patrice Johnson
One of many reasons to pick up this just-released title is the way it views the state's iconic Tater Tot hot dish through the prism of Hmong and African viewpoints. As she enthusiastically explores food cultures from around the state, Johnson, a Minnesota native and the author of 2017's "Jul: Swedish American Holiday Traditions," also shares entertaining stories and compelling recipes from her own culinary heritage. Spam-topped lefse pizza, anyone? (Minnesota Historical Society Press, $24.95)
"Camp Cocktails: Easy, Fun and Delicious Drinks for the Great Outdoors," by Emily Vikre
Plugged-in tourists headed to Duluth -- those over the age of 21, anyway -- know that a visit to Vikre Distillery is a must. Vikre, who owns the Canal Park destination with her husband, Joel, funnels her considerable expertise into a useful mixology-under-the-stars handbook, with libations tailored to backpacking ("Flask Vieux Carr") and congregating around the campfire ("Pontoon Life"). The photos (also by Vikre) will make you want to pitch a tent and reach for a cocktail shaker, and the book is packed with practical tips for bartenders who have left their tools of the trade at home. (Harvard Common Press, $26.99)
RICK NELSON
Winter Pilau With Beets, Cauliflower and Cilantro Chutney
Serves 4.
Note: From "East" by Meera Sodha.
• 1 2/3 c. basmati rice
• 1 1/2 lb. cauliflower (1/2 a large one), broken into bite-size florets
• 1 lb. raw beets, peeled and cut into wedges
• 1/4 lb. rutabaga (1/2 a small one), peeled and cut into 1/2-in.-by-1-in. slices
• 2 1/2 tsp. garam masala
• Canola oil
• Salt
• 1 (14-oz.) can coconut milk, divided
• 6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
• 3/4 in. ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
• 2 serrano chiles, divided
• 1 tsp. ground turmeric
• 1 medium onion, finely sliced
• 2 1/2 c. (about 3 1/2 oz.) cilantro, roughly chopped
• 1 tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon juice
• 1 tsp. sugar
• 2 handfuls pomegranate seeds
Directions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place the rice in a mesh sieve and rinse under cold water until water runs clear, then leave rice to soak in cold water.
Place the cauliflower on a sheet pan in a single layer and place the beets and rutabaga on another sheet pan in a single layer. In a small bowl, combine the garam masala, 5 tablespoons of canola oil and 3/4 teaspoon of salt, then drizzle mixture over the vegetables in both pans and toss to coat. Roast until tender and caramelized in places, about 25 to 30 minutes (the beets and rutabaga may take a little longer).
While the vegetables are roasting, place 1 1/4 cups of the coconut milk in a blender. Add garlic, ginger, 1 chile, turmeric and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Blitz until smooth.
In a large frying pan with a tightfitting lid, heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil over medium heat. Fry the onion for 10 minutes, then add the coconut sauce and cook for 8 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the drained rice with 1 2/3 cup freshly boiled water, and bring to a boil. Put on the lid, reduce the heat to a whisper and cook until rice is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove pan from heat, fold in the vegetables, replace the lid and leave the rice to steam for 10 minutes.
While the rice is steaming, prepare the chutney. In the blender, combine the remaining 1/2 cup coconut milk with the cilantro, the remaining chile, lemon juice, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Blend until smooth and then scrape into a serving bowl.
Transfer the rice to a platter, sprinkle with the pomegranate seeds and serve with the chutney.
Powdered Donut Cake
Makes 1 cake.
Note: This cake mimics the classic bakery doughnut, but in neat little squares. If you prefer a cinnamon sugar doughnut, sprinkle a combination of 2 tbsp. sugar and 2 tsp. ground cinnamon over the top instead of powdered sugar. Any shape of pan can be used: The baking time is the same for a round pan; if using a loaf pan, bake for 40 to 50 minutes; for a Bundt pan, double the recipe and bake 50 to 60 minutes, cool for 10 minutes and invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, and quadruple the topping. From "Snacking Cakes" by Yossy Arefi.
For the cake:
• 3/4 c. sugar
• 2 large eggs
• 1 c. sour cream
• 1/2 c. unsalted butter, melted
• 1 1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg
• 1 tsp. vanilla extract
• 3/4 tsp. kosher salt
• 1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
• 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
• 1/4 baking soda
For the topping:
• 1 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
• 3 tbsp. powdered sugar
Directions
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter or coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with nonstick spray. Line the pan with a strip of parchment paper that hangs over two of the edges.
In a large bowl, whisk the sugar and eggs until pale and foamy, about 1 minute. Add the sour cream, butter, nutmeg, vanilla and salt. Whisk until smooth and emulsified.
Add the flour, baking powder and baking soda. Whisk until well combined and smooth.
Pour the batter into the pan and bake the cake until puffed and golden, and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Set the pan on a rack to cool for about 15 minutes. Then use the parchment paper to lift the cake out of the pan and set it on the rack to cool almost completely.
While the cake is just warm to the touch, brush the top with the melted butter and dust with the powdered sugar. You should have a nice thick layer of powdered sugar -- more than you think might be necessary.
Store the cake, covered, at room temperature for up to three days. The cake will absorb the sugar on top, so it might need a fresh dusting of powdered sugar after the second day.

Unemployment Claims Jump, Casting New Shadow Over U.S. Economy

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
When coronavirus cases began rising across the country this fall, economists sounded a warning: Without government aid, layoffs were sure to follow.
Now those dire predictions are coming true.
More than 947,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was up sharply from the week before, more than reversing a one-week dip that many economists attributed to the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications have now risen three times in the last four weeks and are up nearly a quarter-million since the first week of November.
Nearly 428,000 applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program that covers freelancers, self-employed workers and others who don’t qualify for regular state benefits. That figure, too, was a sharp increase from the previous week.
Unemployment filings during the pandemic have been far above levels recorded in previous recessions. But through most of the fall, they had been edging down week after week, providing some hope that businesses could avoid another round of job cuts. That hope is fading.
“It’s very clear the third wave of the pandemic is causing businesses to have to lay people off and consumers to cut back spending,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist for career site Glassdoor. “It seems like we’re in for a rough winter economically.”
Colleen Levy was laid off in March at a catering company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, when the pandemic led to the mass cancellation and postponement of events in the area. But she was rehired in a few weeks as the company began offering meals for home delivery.
The company scraped together business over the summer through a combination of online ordering and events, many of them outdoors. A federal loan through the Paycheck Protection Program helped.
But business slowed this fall as the weather in Michigan turned cold and coronavirus cases there began to rise. When the state government imposed new restrictions on gatherings last month, Levy and her colleagues knew the business would have to shut down.
“We pretty much all knew that that was the end for us,” she said. She already had her things packed up when her boss broke the news.
Levy, 25, is living with an ex-boyfriend, who is cutting her a deal on rent. And unlike many in her industry, she has been employed for most of the pandemic, although at reduced hours and without the tips she could normally count on to supplement her wages. But she isn’t sure when she’ll find steady work again.
“It’s like, ‘Hey, your industry’s dead, and you aren’t qualified for any other jobs for the next year,’ ” she said. “Eventually parties will exist again, but I don’t know how long that ‘eventually’ will be.”
Unlike in the spring, when tens of millions of people lost their jobs in a matter of weeks, the recent increase in layoffs has been gradual. Virtually no one is predicting a repeat of March and April, when as many as 6 million people a week filed for unemployment benefits.
“This is all a slow-moving disaster, not like the spring where it happened so quickly,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Economics.
But it is a disaster nonetheless, he said. As governments order restaurants and retailers to shut down or reduce capacity, and as consumers pull back on traveling, shopping and other activities that put them at risk, it will lead to layoffs and business failures, which will ripple through the economy. A growing number of forecasters warn that the economy could contract early next year.
The monthly jobs report released last Friday showed that hiring slowed sharply in early November and that some of the sectors most exposed to the pandemic, like restaurants and retailers, cut jobs for the first time since the spring. More up-to-date data from private sources suggests that the slowdown has continued or deepened since the November survey was conducted.
“Every month, we’re just seeing the pace of the recovery get slower and slower,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist with job site Indeed. Now, she said, the question is, “Are we actually going to see it slide backward?”
Many economists say the recovery will continue to slow if the government does not provide more aid to households and businesses. After months of gridlock in Washington, prospects for a new round of federal help have grown in recent days, with congressional leaders from both parties signaling their openness to a compromise and the White House proposing its own $916 billion spending plan Tuesday. But wide divisions persist on key issues.
The stakes are particularly high for jobless workers depending on federal programs that have expanded and extended unemployment benefits during the pandemic. Those programs expire later this month, potentially leaving millions of families with no income during what public health researchers warn could be some of the pandemic’s worst months.
It isn’t clear exactly how many people stand to lose benefits. The Labor Department report Thursday showed that more than 13 million people were enrolled in the two programs. But a recent report from the Government Accountability Office found that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program has been plagued by fraud and overcounting, rendering some of the data unreliable.
By any accounting, however, millions stand to lose their income if the programs end. Many have drawn down savings, leaving them with little financial cushion and putting them at risk of eviction or foreclosure.
“They’re going to be very quickly forced to make a lot of bad financial decisions to put food on the table,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive group. “It can be something you can’t recover from or that takes years to recover from.”
Stephanie Freed, an electrician and lighting designer in New York City, was setting up for a gala at the American Museum of Natural History in the spring when the event was postponed for a month. That was pushed back to July, then to the fall. Now the event has been postponed indefinitely — and Freed hasn’t worked since March. Her state unemployment benefits ran out weeks ago, leaving her relying on the federal pandemic extension.
So Freed, 32, is living in her parents’ basement in Virginia and renting out her New York apartment. Many other unemployed people aren’t so lucky, she said — but many are still trying to help each other out.
“Mutual aid between unemployed people can only go so far,” she said. “People are donating $5 to each other’s GoFundMes in a perpetual circle just trying to survive.”
Earlier this year, Freed and a friend started an online effort to organize unemployed workers and push Congress to extend the pandemic programs and to revive the $600 a week in supplemental benefits that expired over the summer. The group has met with senators and flooded congressional offices with phone calls. But Freed said she was frustrated by the slow pace of progress and worried about what would happen if benefits expired.
“We already have monumental lines for food; we already have people getting kicked out of their homes,” she said. “I don’t know how we recover from it.”

BEIRUT — The Lebanese judge investigating the massive explosion in the port of Beirut has charged the acting prime minister, Hassan Diab, and three former ministers with negligence in the August blast that killed nearly 200 people, the state-run National News Agency reported Thursday.
The charges were a significant escalation in the effort to identify those responsible for the blast by targeting political figures who many in Lebanon had feared were too powerful to hold accountable.
But after the new charges were made public, Diab and a powerful former minister assailed the legitimacy of the inquiry, setting the stage for a battle between the judiciary and the politicians that could end up derailing the investigation.
Since August, a specially appointed judge, Fadi Sawan, has been leading an investigation into the explosion, the largest in Lebanon’s history. It left thousands wounded and did billions of dollars in damage to Lebanon’s capital.
While Sawan’s work has largely been shrouded in secrecy, those arrested during the investigation were mostly low-level port, customs and security officials. That raised fears among blast victims and their families that the country’s political parties were protecting senior officials while letting less powerful people take the fall.
But Thursday, Sawan filed new charges of neglect and carelessness that caused hundreds of deaths against the four men and informed their representatives that he would question them as suspects next week.
Some legal experts applauded the move.
“This is a new era in Lebanon,” said Charles Rizk, who served as justice minister from 2005 to 2008. “We are shifting from politicians being able to do whatever they want to, maybe, a real investigation of what happened with this terrible accident.”
But two of the newly charged men not only denied the allegations but attacked the investigation itself.
Statements Thursday from Diab’s office accused the judge of violating the constitution by circumventing the Parliament with his latest actions and suggested that the judge did not have the authority to charge a prime minister.
“He is confident that his hands are clean and that he has handled the Beirut Port blast file in a responsible and transparent manner,” Diab's office said.
Diab did not make clear whether he would submit to the judge’s questioning next week but said he had already said “what he has to say about this file, period.”
Another of the newly charged men, Ali Hassan Khalil, a former finance minister, took to Twitter to deny the allegations and accuse the judge of leaking confidential information to the news media and not following the law in his investigation.
“We will never accept that the truth is lost to baseless and weak accusations,” Khalil wrote.
In Lebanon’s judicial system, the special judge investigating the blast can file charges against individual suspects as he gathers information, but he only announces formal indictments once the entire investigation is done and ready to go to trial.
There is no time limit for him to complete the investigation, and other such cases have languished for years, with no conclusion ever reached.
Thursday’s charges bring to 37 the number of people that the judge has declared suspects in connection with the blast. Of those, 25 have been detained.
The explosion was caused by the combustion of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a compound used to make explosives, that had been stored in unsafe conditions in the port for years despite warnings sent to multiple government officials that the materials posed a grave danger to the port and its surroundings.
Angry citizens consider the blast, and the years of neglect that allowed the materials to sit in the port for so long, emblematic of the mismanagement and corruption that have long hobbled the country.
It was not clear why Sawan charged only those four men or whether other charges were on the way.
Government documents obtained by The New York Times and other news outlets after the blast showed that warnings about the danger posed by the ammonium nitrate had bounced around the Lebanese state for years, crossing the desks of the port and customs authorities, three ministries, the commander of the Lebanese army, at least two powerful judges, the president and the prime minister.
It appeared that Diab, who had served as prime minister for less than seven months when he and his Cabinet resigned in August after the blast, had been charged because the documents showed that he had been warned about the chemicals weeks before the blast.
Three other men had served as prime minister since the chemicals arrived in Beirut in 2012, including Saad Hariri, the country’s most prominent Sunni Muslim politician. But no documents made public have shown that those men received warnings about the chemicals.
Those who lost loved ones have called for revenge against officials who needlessly endangered the population or knew of the danger and did not do all they could to prevent it.
“Those involved in the blast should be executed. Prison is not enough,” said Zeinab Msheik, whose husband worked in the port’s grain silos and was killed in the blast. “I have three children who lost their father in seconds, and they will live without him forever,” she said.
If the officials charged end up being convicted of negligence and carelessness, they would likely face prison terms of between three to seven years, according to Lebanese lawyers involved in the case.
Some Lebanese jurists and politicians argue that those who have served as minister, prime minister or president can only be tried by a special court that needs to be set up by the Parliament but which has never been activated.
Others say that official immunity does not cover crimes committed outside of someone’s official duties.
Rizk, the former justice minister, said that the size of the catastrophe caused by the explosion should wash away any talk of immunity.
“This country has been destroyed, and it is about time that people react in one way or another,” he said. “This goes beyond the legal niceties that the ministers and prime minister will try to invoke.”
But Lebanon has a weak central state and powerful political parties with standing militias that often operate outside of the law or manipulate state institutions to do their bidding. They could find ways to subvert the legal process to protect their people.
“Definitely, the political parties who are backing these ministers will react one way or another,” he said.
In addition to Khalil, the former finance minister, those charged include two former ministers of transportation and public works, Ghazi Zaiter and Youssef Finianos, the state news agency reported.
Khalil and Zaiter are both members of the Amal Movement, a Shiite political party, and close associates of its leader, Nabih Berri, who is also the speaker of Parliament.
In September, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Khalil and Finianos for engaging in corruption and providing support for Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite militia and political party that the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization.
Blast victims who have criticized the speed and scope of the investigation reacted with cautious optimism to the new charges.
“This is a good step, but we don’t want to be strung along with it,” said Mehieddine Lazkani, 28, a student whose father was killed in the blast. He worried that Diab, who does not appear to have the backing of a powerful political party, and others could be scapegoated for the actions of others.
“We want everyone to be held accountable, everyone who was responsible,” he said.

SACLAY, France — Where are my keys, my wallet, my face mask, my backup face mask? Do I have my ID? Have I filled out paperwork describing where I’m going, and when, and why? Is my destination legal? Can I make it back in three hours or less?
I’ve spent most of the pandemic in New York, but a trip to visit family back home in Saclay, a small town outside Paris, has turned everything upside down. The French government has imposed far more restrictions to help curb coronavirus infections, regulating even something as simple as getting some fresh air.
The differences were evident even before I landed in Paris, when I was checking in for my Air France flight at JFK Airport. Unsurprisingly, I needed a negative coronavirus test and a statement swearing that I was not ill. But I also needed a form allowing me to travel from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport to a hotel near my parents’ house to quarantine for a few days.
That paperwork is not only required for traveling from the airport. In fact, the form — an attestation, in French — is the new lifeline to venturing outside of your home in France. You must fill it out on paper or on a mobile app and have it with you every time you leave home. Forget it and you face serious penalties that can reach six months' imprisonment and a 3,750-euro fine (about $4,500) on the third offense.
This is dramatically different from even the toughest lockdown measures I experienced this past spring in Brooklyn. Leaving my apartment in New York might have felt risky during the worst of the pandemic but never illegal. I could walk or bike in parks for hours at any time of day, meet with friends outdoors, or go shopping at the other end of the city.
In France, just having a bit of fun requires a big effort.
Until Nov. 28, I was not allowed to leave the house for more than an hour a day and could not travel farther than 1 kilometer (less than a mile) from home without facing a fine. I could buy only essential items. Shops that sold nonessential goods were shut down. Those that normally sold a variety of goods could sell only items deemed necessary by the government — with other products off limits to customers. For example, I could buy a newspaper, but not a book. Construction materials, but not flowers.
Thankfully, those rules have eased somewhat, along with the spread of the virus. I can now go outdoors for three hours and travel 20 kilometers (almost 13 miles) from home, which feels liberating. Granted, we are still not allowed to meet people from other households in public spaces.
Still, even adhering conscientiously to the rules doesn’t mean one will avoid an encounter with law enforcement, as happened to me one recent evening.
All I wanted to do was take a walk. The government says that’s among the acceptable reasons to leave home. Among the others: buying groceries, picking up a child at school, helping a family member in dire need.
And it’s still OK to walk at night, at least until next week. (On Thursday, the government announced that a new curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. would be imposed, beginning Dec. 15, but the attestation requirement would be revoked during the day.)
Before venturing out, I filled out the form with the day’s date and the precise time I was leaving the house. My sister and her husband joined me for the walk, both filling out their own certificates. We walked up a hill to the Plateau de Saclay to take in the lovely views of the nearby fields. This was before the recent loosening of restrictions, so we were allowed just one hour outdoors.
It was a spot I’d visited many times before with friends, often on bicycles, though that sort of outing remains off-limits for now. Conflicting feelings of nostalgia, sadness and calm washed over me as I surveyed my old hometown, now more quiet than ever.
There were barriers and chalk instructions on the sidewalk outside a community center, reminding people to social distance while waiting in line to get a coronavirus test, a constant reminder — even here, in a semirural place — of the pandemic.
And to my surprise, a police car appeared out of the darkness. The cruiser approached slowly, its headlights a beacon in the dark, misty night.
We knew right away that the officers intended to do an identity check. They rolled down a window and called us over.
We pulled out our identifications and our attestations and handed them over. The officers looked at our certificates and questioned us.
What were we doing outside during the lockdown? Where were we going? Where did we live?
They were trying to see if we had failed to respect the very specific rules allowing us to leave our home. We weren’t doing anything wrong, but it was unnerving nonetheless. And elsewhere in the country, pandemic-related police stops are not always as smooth as ours.
As the officers left, their greeting resounded in my ear: “Your attestation please” — a stark reminder that one’s physical presence in the outside world is no longer normal or acceptable, but limited and codified by strict laws, even if temporary.
When I originally planned my trip home — in January — I imagined meeting friends at La Villette, a science museum, and eating in restaurants. I looked forward to the delicacies at L’imprévu bar in Paris and a show at the elegant MK2 movie theater along the Quai de Loire. I hoped to visit cousins in Lille, a city close to the Belgian border.
L’année prochaine peut-être?

Months before anyone knew which of the coronavirus vaccine candidates would pull ahead or when they’d be available, airlines were trying to figure out how to transport doses around the world.
Over the summer, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines spoke with government officials, pharmaceutical companies and experts to understand where vaccines might be produced, how they would be shipped and how best to position people and planes to get them moving. More recently, they have flown batches of vaccines for use in trials and research or to prepare for wider distribution.
The industry will play a vital role in moving billions of doses aboard hundreds of flights in the months ahead, putting underused planes and crews to work while circulating the very medicine that airlines hope will get people to book tickets again. But the flights represent just one segment of a massive, global relay race in which airlines will have to be ready to move at a moment’s notice.
“When a request comes in, it’s going to be urgent and we have to act immediately,” said Manu Jacobs, who oversees shipments of pharmaceuticals and other specialty products for United.
An expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday recommended granting emergency authorization of a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Another vaccine, produced by Moderna, is expected to secure approval soon. Once the agency authorizes the vaccines, shipments are expected to begin in earnest.
One of the biggest challenges for airlines has been ensuring that vaccines are transported at frigid temperatures. Pfizer’s must be stored at an incredibly low minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Moderna’s can be kept at a more easily managed minus 4 degrees.
For its vaccine, Pfizer designed special cooler containers that can be stuffed with dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide. But aviation authorities limit how much dry ice can be carried on planes because it turns to gas, making the air potentially toxic for pilots and crews.
After running tests that showed it was safe, United asked the Federal Aviation Administration last month to raise the limit so it could fly the Pfizer vaccine from Brussels International Airport to Chicago O’Hare International Airport, according to an FAA letter. The agency agreed, allowing the airline to carry up to 15,000 pounds of dry ice aboard a Boeing 777-224 plane, compared with the previous limit of 3,000 pounds, according to the letter. A single 777 can carry up to 1 million doses, the airline said.
American and Delta are also working with the agency to increase dry ice limits for vaccine shipment. And Boeing said it has been working closely with passenger and cargo carriers and global regulators to help safely transport as much of the vaccines as possible. In service letters, online symposiums and calls, the airplane manufacturer has shared its own findings on dry ice emission rates and important safety procedures. Boeing also said it is working with other aerospace companies on guidance they can provide to airlines.
United declined to comment on its work with Pfizer, but said that it had been laying the groundwork to ship vaccines since the summer, an effort that involved marshaling teams from across the company and the world.
“We decided very quickly that we needed to bring some bright people together to think about how to prepare,” Jacobs said.
The scale and urgency of circulating the coronavirus vaccine are unlike anything airlines and other logistics companies have seen before. Shipping giant UPS has been installing ultralow-temperature freezer farms — capable of keeping goods as cold as minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit — near its air cargo hubs in the United States and Europe. The company’s health care arm has also increased production of dry ice, with U.S. facilities able to make as much as 1,200 pounds an hour. FedEx has added ultracold freezers throughout its U.S. network, too. And both companies have enormous fleets of cargo planes that will help to ferry the vaccines.
In normal times, about half of all air cargo is transported by airlines, often beneath the feet of passengers. The steep decline in flights this spring removed much of that capacity, but the urgent need for masks, gloves and ventilators created a big opportunity for cash-starved carriers, allowing them to recapture at least some of that lost business. Many airlines, including United, American, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, began running flights only to haul cargo, and some have gone so far as to belt boxes and goods into the seats where passengers normally sit.
Now, airlines are preparing to run vaccine-only flights: planes that are chock-full of freezer boxes or coolers, with a skeleton crew.
In mid-November, American Airlines conducted a series of trial flights from Miami to South America to put thermal packaging and its own handling procedures to the test. It has also already transported shipments for vaccine trials around the world. Other preparations, though critical, are more mundane. Those include lining up the certifications and authorizations to transport the goods, ensuring that handoffs of the vaccine will be perfectly timed, and making sure that the planes needed are in the right place at the right time.
“We believe it’s going to take every single player in this industry — not just the airline industry, but really the supply-chain logistics industry — to pull this off,” said Jessica Tyler, president of cargo for American Airlines.
Airlines have experience transporting the flu vaccine, and the industry has pursued more pharmaceutical business in recent years. In 2015, for example, American built a 25,000-square-foot warehouse at its Philadelphia International Airport hub dedicated to cold storage of pharmaceuticals. That warehouse, which is monitored around the clock, can store shipments as low as minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, and is the largest of a handful of such facilities that the airline operates at a half-dozen airports in the United States and Europe. Delta and United operate similar cold storage networks.
When it comes to cargo, airlines typically work with “freight forwarders,” middlemen who organize shipping on behalf of clients like pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors. With the vaccine, carriers expect to work directly with those customers in some cases, because of the urgency of getting the vaccine to where it is needed.
American and Delta are working with McKesson, a major medical supplier, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this summer assigned to serve as a sort of centralized distributor for coronavirus vaccines. Each major vaccine manufacturer, except for Pfizer, has said it will use McKesson to distribute its product within the United States, according to Rob Walpole, vice president of Delta Cargo.
Since August, Delta has ferried vaccine trial shipments, test kits and other products both within the United States and from Belgium and Latin America into America, Walpole said on a call with reporters this month. The airline has also created a dedicated “vaccine control tower” to track and coordinate shipments.
While the influx of dry ice has posed a challenge for airlines, so has the speed with which the vaccines have arrived, he said.
“Like many things this year, there’s kind of an unprecedented intensity and amount of change that’s happened in the last two months,” Walpole said. “That’s tested everyone that’s associated with this.”

Months after their pledge to dismantle the Police Department fell apart, members of the Minneapolis City Council voted early Thursday to divert nearly $8 million from the proposed policing budget to other city services, a move heralded by some as an important step toward transforming public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.
The shift in funds — about 4.5% of the proposed $179 million police budget — was not nearly the sweeping change that activists and some lawmakers had demanded in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in May. Still, Jeremiah Ellison, a city councilman who had favored more aggressive efforts to defund the police, called it an “incredible investment.”
“I think what we’re able to do with that $8 million is going to do a lot for public safety in our city,” he said.
The money will go toward bolstering the city’s Office of Violence Prevention, starting a team of mental health professionals who can respond to crises without the aid of the police and allowing city workers outside the Police Department to process minor complaints, such as parking violations and property damage.
The decision to divert the funds capped several days of charged, emotional debate over the size of the police force and the role of the department and came amid a spike in violent crime this year.
In his budget proposal, Mayor Jacob Frey suggested slashing last year’s police budget of $193 million by more than 7%. Council members went further, in large part by cutting money earmarked for overtime and other staffing costs. Trimming of those items raised alarm bells among the police chief and some lawmakers, as the department has lost 166 officers this year — some permanently, others because they are on disability, and still others saying they have post-traumatic stress from the massive protests that swept the city over the summer.
“I believe we’re at that breaking point,” said Linea Palmisano, chair of the council’s budget committee. “I’m very concerned that we are reducing our city’s ability to respond to 911 calls and do investigations well. I am extremely concerned because I don’t think that we can keep asking our current officers to work at the rate that they’re working.”
In addition to the diversion of $8 million, the council put $11.4 million in a reserve fund intended for hiring and overtime. The department will have to appeal to the council to gain access to those funds.
The council had originally planned to reduce the number of officers to 750, from 888, starting in 2022, despite a surge in gun violence in Minneapolis this year. Frey had threatened to veto the budget if the council approved such a measure, which narrowly failed.
“My colleagues were right to leave the targeted staffing level unchanged from 888 and continue moving forward with our shared priorities,” Frey said in a statement on Thursday. “The additional funding for new public safety solutions will also allow the city to continue upscaling important mental health, non-police response, and social service components in our emergency response system.”
Steven Belton, the president of the Twin Cities chapter of the Urban League, called the cuts to the police budget misguided and misinformed. He said council members made it an either-or proposition between funding the police and other services when he believed everything was needed.
The city’s roughly $1.5 billion budget is a slight increase over last year’s budget, although many city agencies were forced to take cuts.
The allocation for the Office of Violence Prevention, though, grew to $6.7 million from $1.5 million. Established in 2018, its aim is to prevent crime, deploying strategies such as having community members mediate disputes in their neighborhoods and having social workers meet with victims of violence at hospitals.
This year, the city has logged 5,164 violent crimes, up 25.7% from last year, according to data from the Minneapolis Police Department. The cuts to the police budget could embolden criminals to think that policing was going away, Belton said.
“It’s the wrong optics to the communities that are most impacted detrimentally by violence and the absence of policing and poor policing,” he said.
Across the country this year, violence has spiked in many cities, a rise experts say is likely the result of several factors, including the economic hardship caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The loss of Minneapolis police officers cannot be blamed for the city’s rise in crime, said supporters of the movement to defund the police, a group that largely wants money to be diverted from police departments and directed toward other services it says could prevent or decrease crime. Supporters point to the fact that crime has been high when the Police Department had more officers.
“We are living among a Police Department that has wrought a lot of trauma and damage to our city,” said D.A. Bullock, a filmmaker who lives in Minneapolis. If the department felt like it needed more staff to make the community safer, he added, “they owe it to us to prove that that is actually an effective strategy.”
Residents in Minneapolis, especially Black residents, have long complained of a police force that they say exerts disproportionate violence against them. Minneapolis police have used force against Black people at a rate at least seven times that of white people during the past five years.
That violence against Black residents came into stark relief when video surfaced of Floyd, a Black man, with his neck pinned to the ground by a white officer while handcuffed on May 25. Floyd’s death led to widespread protests, in Minneapolis and across the country, against police brutality and systemic racism.
Less than two weeks after Floyd’s death, a majority of the Minneapolis City Council pledged to dismantle the Police Department and create a new system of public safety.
After an attempt to change the city charter to allow for the elimination of the Police Department failed, some council members backtracked on their pledge. The most far-reaching policy reforms in Minneapolis did not move forward.
“I think our pledge created confusion in the community and in our wards,” Lisa Bender, the council president, said in September when asked if the council’s statement had led to uncertainty at a pivotal moment.
Instead of larger policing changes, Minneapolis agreed to ban chokeholds and passed several reforms, including a revamped use-of-force policy.
Residents in Minneapolis had mixed opinions about the council’s efforts to change how the police force runs. On the city’s North Side, which has a majority Black population, residents have complained about mistreatment, but also about rampant crime.
The Police Department’s 4th Precinct, which covers North Minneapolis, has seen more homicides and violent crimes this year than any other precinct in the city.
“Our communities are in so much trauma now,” Andrea Jenkins, the council vice president, said at this week’s meeting. “We must try all the options to restore a sense of safety — of real safety — in our communities.”

Texto completo: The claim: More Americans died from COVID-19 in each of the first five days of December than in the Pearl Harbor attack
As Americans continue to die from COVID-19, some have sought to compare its impact to deadly attacks on U.S. soil.
An Instagram post by Now This News, a progressive-leaning news outlet, narrows in on Pearl Harbor, noting that the surprise strike on a U.S. naval base in 1941 killed over 2,400 service members and civilians. A U.S. census report confirms that 2,403 people were killed in the attack.
The caption goes on to report that the United States saw more than 2,400 coronavirus deaths each of the first five days of December, citing the COVID Tracking Project as its source.
"Whereas the day after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt said December 7 ‘is a date which will live in infamy,’ Pres. Trump won’t speak publicly about the pandemic that is now killing thousands of Americans daily," Now This News wrote in the post's caption.
Now This News did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
Fact check: Strict lockdowns, experimental vaccine helped China recover from COVID-19
COVID Tracking Project numbers make claim true, other sources vary
It's true that more Americans died each of the first five days of last week than in the Pearl Harbor attack based on the source Now This News cites. The COVID Tracking Project, a well-respected volunteer organization launched by The Atlantic and cited by Now This News, determined that the number of deaths for the first five days of the month were as follows:
Dec. 1 - 2,473
Dec. 2 - 2,733
Dec 3 - 2,706
Dec. 4 - 2,563
Dec. 5 - 2,461
But the toll for Dec. 5 varies in other sources. The New York Times generally found higher death counts than the COVID Tracking Project for the first four days of the month, but its tally of Dec. 5 deaths is lower than the number of casualties at Pearl Harbor.
The New York Times' count of coronavirus deaths between Dec. 1-5:
Dec. 1 - 2,610
Dec. 2 - 2, 885
Dec. 3 - 2,857
Dec. 4 - 2,637
Dec. 5 - 2,190
Johns Hopkins University's COVID tracker shows the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. as being closer to The New York Times' estimates. Its tally of Dec. 5 coronavirus deaths also falls short of Pearl Harbor's casualty count.
Johns Hopkins' count of coronavirus deaths between Dec. 1-5:
Dec. 1 - 2,597
Dec. 2 - 2,804
Dec. 3 - 2,879
Dec. 4 - 2,607
Dec. 5 - 2,254
The discrepancies between the different data sources highlight the challenges in accurately tracking the number of deaths from the coronavirus. Experts cite the lack of a coordinated response, unfamiliarity with the virus and the discussions surrounding it being clouded by conspiracy theories and political motivations as reasons it's hard to keep track.
Despite both The New York Times' and Johns Hopkins' trackers showing Dec. 5 as having fewer deaths than Pearl Harbor, the average number of deaths per day for the first five days of December, is well above the number of casualties seen back in 1941 on all three trackers.
Our rating: True
We rate the claim that more Americans died from COVID-19 in each of the first five days of December than in the Pearl Harbor attack as TRUE, as the source cited in the post affirms the claim. Other sources show a lower death toll on Dec. 5 but higher tolls on Dec. 1-4, highlighting the difficulty to accurately track COVID-19 deaths.

The year death came for the Dakotas

Texto completo: Under normal circumstances, I would have flown to one or both of the Dakotas to write this column, but the whole point is that these aren't normal circumstances. And I don't have a death wish.
Too much? Probably. But how else to convey the proper timbre of outrage, the right pitch of grief, over what happened there? Deep into the coronavirus pandemic, when there was no doubt about the damage that COVID-19 could do, the Dakotas scaled their morbid heights, propelled by denial and defiance. They surged to the top of national rankings of state residents per capita who were hospitalized with COVID-related symptoms or whose recent deaths were linked to it.
As of Friday afternoon, South Dakota led the country in the average daily number of recent COVID-associated deaths per capita, with 3 for every 100,000 people, according to a New York Times database. North Dakota was second, with 1.5.
More than 40% of South Dakota's 1,033 COVID-related deaths to that point occurred in November, according to statistics from the Covid Tracking Project, and the same was true of North Dakota's 983 deaths.
The Dakotas are a horror story that didn't have to be, a theater of American disgrace. Want to understand the tendencies - pathologies might be the better word - that made America's dance with the coronavirus so deadly? Visit the Dakotas.
Intellectually, I mean.
"It's mind-boggling," Jamie Smith, the leader of the Democratic minority in South Dakota's House of Representatives, told me.
He was referring primarily to how politicized such basic safety measures as social distancing and masks became, but also to many South Dakotans' distrust of science and unshakable belief that the virus wouldn't come for them.
"We're dug in," he said when we spoke recently.
Of the 10 counties in America with the most COVID-related deaths per capita, three are in South Dakota.
Lawrence Klemin, a Republican legislator in North Dakota who just finished his two-year term as the speaker of its House of Representatives, told me that people in his state "are pretty much independent-minded about how they conduct their affairs."
"I don't know if maybe some people are stubborn," he added, but the deep sigh in his voice said that he knows full well that many people are. And the most stubborn, he said, have been the loudest. Throughout the pandemic, he said, he was deluged with communications from constituents adamantly opposed to any mask-wearing requirement, which North Dakota didn't even have.
He heard almost nothing from the other side.
But after Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, used an executive order Nov. 13 to institute precisely such a mandate, a poll showed that a significant majority of North Dakotans favored it. Maybe they'd just seen too much dying by then. Or maybe, Klemin conceded, they'd been a silent majority for a while and political leaders underestimated their fellow citizens.
Regardless, he said, the state definitely should have taken that step last spring or summer - before the number of coronavirus cases skyrocketed, before hospitals were so overrun that sick North Dakotans had to be sent to neighboring states and before his own mother tested positive and died in early October.
Until recently, Burgum was loath to exert much pressure on North Dakotans and steered clear of the social-distancing orders put in place by so many other states. But he did invest heavily in testing and never merrily shrugged off the threat of the coronavirus the way his Republican counterpart in South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem, did.
Deaths and hospitalizations have dropped significantly in North Dakota over the past two weeks. On Friday evening, it ranked just ninth among states for the percentage of its residents hospitalized with COVID-19.
South Dakota, in contrast, was No. 1. Still no mask mandate there, and no leadership at all from Noem, who didn't just welcome but beckoned President Donald Trump to Mount Rushmore for that enormous Independence Day rally, the one at which his perpetually maskless entourage clustered near a similarly maskless crowd. Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.'s romantic partner, tested positive then, compelling the two of them to go into isolation. Sadly, they didn't remain there.
One month later, Noem played cheerleader for a 10-day motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that attracted some 460,000 people. In an article in The Times, my colleagues Mark Walker and Jack Healy described it as "a Woodstock of unmasked, uninhibited coronavirus defiance."
Just before Thanksgiving, Noem announced the passing of her 98-year-old grandmother, one of 13 residents of a South Dakota nursing home who died in a two-week period. The home's administrator told The Daily Beast that the other 12 residents, along with many of the nursing home's workers, had tested positive for the coronavirus, but not Noem's grandmother. (Hmmm) While Noem publicly mourned her lost family member, she drew no particular attention to COVID-19's rampage among her grandmother's companions.
I get the sense that Noem has presidential aspirations (though she has denied that). If she ever presses the accelerator on those, please remember this savage season, and please remember her damning indifference to it.
The Dakotas are hardly alone in dealing with an onslaught of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths over the past month, a grim one for most of America. Neighboring Minnesota, a much less politically conservative state, has lately rivaled South Dakota for new cases per day per capita. Iowa is also in terrible shape, as Elaine Godfrey wrote in The Atlantic on Thursday.
"To visit Iowa right now is to travel back in time to the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in places such as New York City and Lombardy and Seattle, when the horror was fresh and the sirens never stopped," Godfrey wrote. "The virus has been raging for eight months in this country; Iowa just hasn't been acting like it."
Then again, has California? It got educated early, but if the lessons had taken as well as they should have, its governor, Gavin Newsom, might not have had to announce the stringent new lockdown measures that he did Thursday as the state's intensive care units were stretched almost to the limit. In New York City, meanwhile, the daily rate of positive coronavirus tests exceeded 5% for the first time since May, according to city figures.
The truth is that the Dakotas are as emblematic as they are exceptional, the American story - or at least a strain of it - in miniature. In resisting the lockdowns, slowdowns and sacrifices that many other states committed to, they indulged and encouraged a selective (and often warped) reading of scientific evidence, a rebellion against experts and a twisted concept of individual liberty that was obvious all over the country and contributed mightily to our suffering.
"North Dakotans will come to each other's aids in a heartbeat, but when asked to give up personal freedom for an amorphous common good - that's difficult," Paul Carson, an infectious-diseases doctor and a professor of public health at North Dakota State University, told me.
Just recently, Carson said, a lawmaker from the western half of the state - whose denizens regard its eastern half, where Carson lives, as elitist and too liberal - wrote to him to share a famous quotation from Benjamin Franklin: "Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
For too long, staying safe from the coronavirus was indeed an amorphous mission to many North and South Dakotans, and their false sense of security was surely intensified by what they heard from Trump, who spoke of disease-ridden blue states versus freedom-loving red ones and kept promising that this would all blow over.
"We maybe believed that our rural nature sheltered us from what cities like yours were experiencing," Carson said. "Then we found out, very brutally, that was wrong."
Klemin, the North Dakota legislator, said that his mother, Carol Roaldson, was 99 when she died but had always thrilled to the idea of reaching 100 and was in excellent health before the coronavirus swept in. Her nursing home had to establish a segregated unit for the many residents who were infected in September, he said. He couldn't visit his mother after she was moved there.
But when she sank into what were clearly her last days, he was allowed by her bedside - in a face mask and shield.
"I watched her die," he told me. "That was a very sad day."

It’s Australia’s First Big Blaze of the Fire Season. How Bad Will the Summer Get?

SYDNEY — The first major blaze of Australia’s wildfire season has now blackened roughly half of Fraser Island, an idyllic getaway north of Brisbane renowned for its golden beaches and lush biodiversity.
With evacuation orders reaching residents Monday, Australians who had hoped there wasn’t much more to burn after last year’s colossal fires are grappling with a brutal reminder: In a vast country that is fire-prone and especially vulnerable to climate change, the risk of record-breaking infernos never goes away.
In fact, it keeps increasing.
“I’m sure it’s hit home for us, as it has for everyone watching,” said Jack Worcester, 34, whose family owns Cathedrals on Fraser, a campground that was recently evacuated. “There’s no such thing as a normal for a fire season now — any fire season can be a quite serious one.”
By this time last year, dried-out forests outside Sydney had been burning for weeks, blanketing the city with an orange-gray haze. But even though this year feels less overwhelming (so far), one question hovers on the minds of many Australians, and it’s the same question that Californians were asking just a few months ago and will ask again next year: How bad is it going to get?
Fires tend to be measured and remembered with hard statistics — acres burned, houses and lives lost — but before the counting comes an impressionistic mapping of risk shaped by terrain, climate, human activity and chance.
This year’s seasonal outlook maps for Australia show a wide amoeba of red for areas of above-average danger running through the grassy plains of central New South Wales, the state in the country’s southeast whose capital is Sydney. But you have to dig deeper to see that many other areas are also at risk.
Fraser Island, for example, is marked “normal fire potential.” The blaze burning now, drawing firefighters on land and in jumbo jets above to douse the flames and locking down the island to visitors, is believed to have been started by an illegal campfire, lit by tourists Oct. 14.
“In the big picture, fire is a natural part of the Australian landscape, so even when we say that the year has normal or below normal risk, it doesn’t mean there is no risk, said Naomi Benger, a climatologist with the government’s Bureau of Meteorology. “It means there is as much risk as there would be in an average year.”
Because of climate change, she added, the average levels of fire danger are increasing.
“It only takes one or two days to have some catastrophic results,” she said. “People should not be complacent.”
Rain: Friend or Foe?
La Nina, a large-scale change in tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures that affects global weather patterns, is the dominant factor in Australia’s 2020-21 fire season. Bringing cooler water closer to the sea surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, La Nina has delivered above-average rainfall to most of the country this year.
Thunderstorms and long weeks of spring rain have filled reservoirs and eased the burden on farmers in New South Wales and Queensland after many years of drought. But the soaking rains have also created fields of grass across the plains west of the Great Dividing Range, the mountain chain that runs up and down Australia’s eastern seaboard.
With just a few hot, dry days, those grasses will turn from green to brown, making them as easy to light as a dry piece of paper, maybe easier. That creates an especially erratic and deadly hazard.
“The main difference is intensity; grass fires are lower intensity than forest fires in general, but they travel very, very quickly,” said Richard Thornton, who runs the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Council, which creates the maps that most of the country relies on to assess each fire season. “They certainly move faster than you can run or walk from them, and they are very much dominated by the wind.”
In 1969, a dozen grass fires near the town of Lara killed 23 people, including 17 who were caught in their cars on the freeway. Some of them tried to outrun the fire and failed.
Grass fires also produce enormous amounts of radiant heat. When pastures caught fire alongside the surrounding forests in the town of Batlow in January, the heat from the blazes in the grass melted part of the firetrucks and helmets of firefighters.
“Because they move fast and can change direction quickly, it’s easy for people to get caught out and overrun by a grass fire,” Thornton said. “We’ve seen it before.”
Climate Connections
La Nina is just one factor among many. Other weather forces have produced drier conditions than normal in places like tropical Queensland.
Fraser Island saw fewer thunderstorms in November than usual, and those arid conditions have been exacerbated by heat. Last month was Australia’s hottest November on record. Forecasts also predict that maximum temperatures from December to February are likely to be above the long-term mean for parts of southeast and far west Australia, as well as along the Queensland coastline.
What that translates to is greater risk. The appearance of a heat wave or two or three this summer could dry out many areas and make whatever fires that do emerge even harder to fight.
Scientists argue that this is climate change in action. With average global temperatures having increased by 1 degree Celsius since the preindustrial era, the variability of weather patterns is intensifying, especially in Australia, the world’s most arid inhabited continent.
What once looked like an anomaly can quickly become the new normal.
“With last year’s Australian fires season, combined with the ones in California last year, you can start to say this is what the future is going to look like because of climate change,” Thornton said. “The fires of last year were unprecedented, but they are no longer that way. Now that we’ve had those fires, they have to be part of the planning.”
Making Changes
A recent report on last year’s fires from an independent Royal Commission acknowledged that climate change had already significantly increased the risk of natural disasters in Australia. It recommended a wide range of changes to how the country fights fires, calling for more aircraft and better coordination of data and communications equipment.
Very little of what the commission requested has been put into practice or even approved. Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to maintain that his government’s effort to combat climate change — widely viewed as underwhelming and weak by the country’s climate scientists — is sufficient.
Emergency managers say the broader challenge, whether it’s in the United States or Australia, is getting the general population of fire-prone areas to recognize the changed environment and the risks.
“It’s hard,” Thornton said. “They don’t want to face the fact that where they live is risky.”
Until, that is, they can see the fires and the smoke.
Worcester, the campground owner on Fraser Island, said that at one point, he was confronting flames close enough to reach by throwing a rock.
“I was standing inside the fire break on our property watching it crest less than 100 meters to our north,” he said. “It was 15 meters tall.”
He said he planned to buy his own firefighting equipment “just for peace of mind.” And yet, he already knows the relief will be short-lived.
The campground, which was 40% full when it had to be evacuated and is now being asked to cancel reservations left and right, is surrounded by bushland on three sides, with the ocean in front.
“The vegetation will have grown beyond what it was this year,” Worcester said. “We’ll have two or three years of reduced risk then another eight of high risk.”
“At the end of the day,” he said, “if it’s really serious, there is only so much you can do.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
BERLIN — Germany this December doesn’t feel right.
There are no groups of friends gripping mugs of steaming red wine spiced with cinnamon and cloves crowding Rothenburg’s medieval market square or beneath Cologne’s towering cathedral. No brass bands play carols before Berlin’s Charlottenburg Palace. No stars shine from the eaves of Seiffen’s wooden huts.
The magical figure known as the Christkind did not spread her golden wings and welcome the world to Nuremberg’s annual Christmas market. The darkened city square did not spring to light, revealing, in the verse she recites annually, a “little town within the city, which of cloth and wood is made; fleeting in its brief splendor, but everlasting throughout the ages.”
The coronavirus is muting Christmas celebrations around the world. But the absence of seasonal merriment and public cheer is particularly palpable, and painful, in Germany’s marketplaces and squares, largely devoid of their beloved Christmas markets because of the pandemic.
“When you walk through the streets of Munich or Nuremberg these days, without the bright lights and good cheer, without the smell of hot mulled wine — I just miss all of that,” said Oliver Pötzsch, 50, an author whose novels draw from his Bavarian family’s history.
Germans have gathered at outdoor markets in the weeks before Christmas since the 14th century, when vendors first built their stands in city centers to sell their wares to people coming from church services. They offer an array of foods, artisanal gifts and other provisions for the coming celebrations and the long winter months.
Tourists from across the globe throng the half-dozen markets — often fashioned on different themes, like a Scandinavian or sustainable Christmas — in major cities like Berlin, Cologne and Munich.
The locals, though, are drawn to the more intimate festivals in towns and villages across the country, often in the regions where they grew up.
“They were always meeting places,” Margot Kässmann, 63, a former bishop of the Lutheran Church in Germany, said of the Christmas markets, also called Advent markets.
“Today, Christmas markets remain very social places where friends and family gather,” she said. “But even people who are alone will go there on their own to take in the smells, the lights and the music, which have something comforting about them.”
Germany’s roughly 3,000 Christmas markets are also an economic boon to many communities, bringing in nearly $3.5 billion last year, according to the German Association of Fairground Employees. Local restaurants, breweries, bakeries and artisans also depend on the annual holiday fairs for a substantial amount of their income.
Nina Engel has been selling glass ornaments at the Christmas market in Berlin’s Gendarmenmarkt for years. But as December drew near and the country’s number of new coronavirus infections remained dangerously high, the German capital joined cities across the country that have canceled their markets, despite pledges made earlier in the year to do everything to keep them open.
The Gendarmenmarkt, an elegant square, stands open to the cold this year. No music lovers spill from the steps of the Konzerthaus into a temporary village of white tents, glowing with golden stars atop their peaks and warmed with laughter, sizzling sausages and a glittering array of crafts and gifts.
This year, the city allowed a small fraction of the vendors to set up pop-up stands on street corners or in empty squares, in an effort to recoup some of their costs and spread the Christmas spirit.
“We have to pay for everything up front,” Engel said, gesturing to rows of sparkling glass hummingbirds, pickles, pizza slices, Santas and snowmen, hung among silver, gold and red bulbs at her stand on the pedestrian zone of the Friedrichstrasse shopping street in Berlin. “This is all seasonal merchandise. We are here to try to sell at least a few items — it’s better than nothing.”
Other cities have also allowed a few stands to open, to aid vendors and maintain a modicum of Christmas cheer — but at a distance compliant with regulations that require strangers to keep 6 feet apart. Local restaurant owners are offering hot mulled wine, or Glühwein, from the steps of their shuttered eateries for patrons seeking a sip of the ubiquitous seasonal drink that doubles as a hand-warmer, as long as your mug is full.
Others are trying to re-create that Christmas market feeling at home, going all out with windows outlined in colored lights, blinking snowmen and giant, glowing Santa Clauses — displays that many Germans only know from Coca-Cola commercials and Hollywood movies.
“I’ve noticed people are decking out their houses with terrible American-style lights and Santa Claus hanging from their balconies,” said Pötzsch, who bought an outdoor heater, extra blankets and a string of “understated” lights to make a festive place for socially distanced meetings on his terrace.
And in a year that has witnessed concerts, plays and school classes moving online, organizers of some Christmas markets have tried to re-create the spirit virtually.
Seiffen, home to the carvers of Germany’s wooden ornaments, candle pyramids and toys, created a virtual Christmas market, complete with jingly music, images of an evening sky flecked with snow and 360-degree graphics, all to promote local vendors whose crafts would ordinarily be offered at markets across the country.
In Nuremberg, Benigna Munsi, 18, is serving her second year as the Christkind — who, in the local tradition, takes the form of a young woman with long blonde curls, a towering crown and winglike golden sleeves. She is the city’s holiday ambassador and patron of its Christmas market.
For Munsi, the first weeks of December would usually be packed with visits to local hospitals, homeless shelters and nursing homes, and with hours spent greeting visitors at the market or reading stories to the children who come there.
“Wherever I go as the Christkind, people are waiting for me,” she said in an telephone interview. “Whether they are young or old, they are always so happy when I enter the room. “I’m sad that I can’t be there for people in person this year.”
She makes a daily appearance in a prerecorded online Advent calendar instead and, twice a week, takes phone calls from anyone wishing to reach out to the Christkind. Most of the callers are children who bring her their Christmas wish lists, but adults reach out to her, too, many with memories to share.
“Since we are not meeting in person, I think that maybe memories are taking on a new meaning, becoming more valuable,” Munsi said.
She recounted how one woman had called to thank her for a gesture last year when, on a tour of the market as the Christkind, she had noticed the woman crying and stopped to ask if she was OK.
“She told me that meant so much to her, that she often thought back to the encounter when she was down, and it gave her strength throughout the year,” Munsi said.
She has been encouraging people to reach out to family and friends they can’t visit with a letter or call — and to remember the spirit of Christmas does not live in the market but in the people who would usually gather there.
“Don’t let things get you down and don’t give up,” Munsi said. Even in a world weary of coronavirus and seemingly endless lockdowns, she said, “Something beautiful can always be found.”

Texto completo: In many ways Joe Biden will enter the presidency in a politically enviable position. The arrival of the coronavirus vaccine means that, after running as the candidate of normalcy, he is poised to preside over its literal return, which could include not just economic recovery but also a period of personal exuberance - at last, restaurants! amusement parks! vacations! - that will feel much more euphoric than the post-financial-crisis grind did under Barack Obama 12 years ago.
At the same time, the fact that Biden did not lead his party to a landslide will also give him certain political advantages. He will not be permitted to reenact the New Deal or the Great Society, but neither will he be tempted into ideologically driven debacles like Bill Clinton's failed health care push or even Donald Trump's failed attempt to repeal Obamacare. Having Joe Manchin and Susan Collins as the most powerful figures in the Senate will not be good for progressivism's policy objectives, but it could be good for Biden's popularity, enabling him to chart a moderate course while telling the left, sorry, but my hands are tied.
In the best-case scenario for Biden, the Trumpian voter-fraud narrative could set in motion a Tea Party redux on the right, with fringe characters and Trump loyalists successfully primarying established GOP figures - but without the high-unemployment economy and the Obamacare fight that enabled the Tea Party Republicans to take the House in 2010. Instead, a radicalized Republican Party campaigning on a supposedly stolen election while the Democrats campaign on prosperity and normalcy could set up the rare midterm scenario in which an incumbent president's party actually picks up seats.
If you want to know how the Biden administration could blow this opportunity, though, look no further than his just-announced choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra.
No Cabinet agency is likely to be as prominent as HHS during the first year of the Biden presidency, given the upcoming vaccine rollout and the slow unwinding of public-health restrictions. And for a campaign that placed so much emphasis on the idea that disinterested expertise and capital-S Science should guide the coronavirus response, Becerra is a peculiar choice: a partisan politician from a deep-blue state whose health care experience is mostly in legal battles with the Trump White House over Obamacare, rather than in health policy or medicine itself.
Of course Cabinet secretaries are often party hacks, but even Trump chose a physician and then a pharmaceutical executive for the HHS post, and it's especially odd - as The New York Times story on the selection notes - to pick a partisan at a moment when so many medical groups were urging the Biden administration to elevate doctors and other acknowledged experts to lead pandemic-era policy.
It's less odd, though, if you anticipate using your Cabinet agencies the way the Obama White House did in its otherwise-gridlocked second term - as aggressive instruments of partisan policymaking, especially on culture-war issues where Congress is particularly loath to act.
Under Obama, this strategy encompassed everything from his attempted immigration amnesties and gun-control executive orders to his Education Department's interventions in college sexual-assault policies and school bathroom regulations to the long-running attempt by HHS to force religious employers like the Little Sisters of the Poor to cover contraception and morning-after drugs.
It was inevitable that a Biden administration would pick up some of these threads. But Becerra is the pick you make if you intend to pursue a lot of them, since that's where his qualifications lie.
Now most Americans aren't social conservatives, and Becerra will have media and Democratic establishment support in many of the fights he might pick.
But Biden won the presidency in part because he was more popular than his party, and deploying his bureaucracy aggressively for liberal ends would be the easiest way for him to squander some of that advantage.
One of Biden's greatest strengths as a politician in a polarized era is that he remembers a time when an ideological liberalism led Democrats into sweeping electoral defeats. Becerra, like Kamala Harris, has a different background: He comes from California, a state where demographics and a hapless opposition have delivered the Democrats a near-permanent majority - meaning that their leaders have few incentives to compromise with or reassure right-leaning voters, and little experience even attempting that feat.
The tension between those two experiences, and the political attitudes they forge, was always destined to run through a Biden administration. But Becerra's nomination is an early sign of how the conciliation that succeeded for Biden on the campaign trail might be abandoned and a great political opportunity thrown away.

Of course Cabinet secretaries are often party hacks, but even Trump chose a physician and then a pharmaceutical executive for the HHS post, and it's especially odd - as The New York Times story on the selection notes - to pick a partisan at a moment when so many medical groups were urging the Biden administration to elevate doctors and other acknowledged experts to lead pandemic-era policy.
It's less odd, though, if you anticipate using your Cabinet agencies the way the Obama White House did in its otherwise-gridlocked second term - as aggressive instruments of partisan policymaking, especially on culture-war issues where Congress is particularly loath to act.
Under Obama, this strategy encompassed everything from his attempted immigration amnesties and gun-control executive orders to his Education Department's interventions in college sexual-assault policies and school bathroom regulations to the long-running attempt by HHS to force religious employers like the Little Sisters of the Poor to cover contraception and morning-after drugs.
It was inevitable that a Biden administration would pick up some of these threads. But Becerra is the pick you make if you intend to pursue a lot of them, since that's where his qualifications lie.
Now most Americans aren't social conservatives, and Becerra will have media and Democratic establishment support in many of the fights he might pick.
But Biden won the presidency in part because he was more popular than his party, and deploying his bureaucracy aggressively for liberal ends would be the easiest way for him to squander some of that advantage.
One of Biden's greatest strengths as a politician in a polarized era is that he remembers a time when an ideological liberalism led Democrats into sweeping electoral defeats. Becerra, like Kamala Harris, has a different background: He comes from California, a state where demographics and a hapless opposition have delivered the Democrats a near-permanent majority - meaning that their leaders have few incentives to compromise with or reassure right-leaning voters, and little experience even attempting that feat.
The tension between those two experiences, and the political attitudes they forge, was always destined to run through a Biden administration. But Becerra's nomination is an early sign of how the conciliation that succeeded for Biden on the campaign trail might be abandoned and a great political opportunity thrown away.

Texto completo: In many ways Joe Biden will enter the presidency in a politically enviable position. The arrival of the coronavirus vaccine means that, after running as the candidate of normalcy, he is poised to preside over its literal return, which could include not just economic recovery but also a period of personal exuberance - at last, restaurants! amusement parks! vacations! - that will feel much more euphoric than the post-financial-crisis grind did under Barack Obama 12 years ago.
At the same time, the fact that Biden did not lead his party to a landslide will also give him certain political advantages. He will not be permitted to reenact the New Deal or the Great Society, but neither will he be tempted into ideologically driven debacles like Bill Clinton's failed health care push or even Donald Trump's failed attempt to repeal Obamacare. Having Joe Manchin and Susan Collins as the most powerful figures in the Senate will not be good for progressivism's policy objectives, but it could be good for Biden's popularity, enabling him to chart a moderate course while telling the left, sorry, but my hands are tied.
In the best-case scenario for Biden, the Trumpian voter-fraud narrative could set in motion a Tea Party redux on the right, with fringe characters and Trump loyalists successfully primarying established GOP figures - but without the high-unemployment economy and the Obamacare fight that enabled the Tea Party Republicans to take the House in 2010. Instead, a radicalized Republican Party campaigning on a supposedly stolen election while the Democrats campaign on prosperity and normalcy could set up the rare midterm scenario in which an incumbent president's party actually picks up seats.
If you want to know how the Biden administration could blow this opportunity, though, look no further than his just-announced choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra.
No Cabinet agency is likely to be as prominent as HHS during the first year of the Biden presidency, given the upcoming vaccine rollout and the slow unwinding of public-health restrictions. And for a campaign that placed so much emphasis on the idea that disinterested expertise and capital-S Science should guide the coronavirus response, Becerra is a peculiar choice: a partisan politician from a deep-blue state whose health care experience is mostly in legal battles with the Trump White House over Obamacare, rather than in health policy or medicine itself.

Iran Is Moving Key Facility At Nuclear Site Underground

Texto completo: The mysterious July explosion that destroyed a centrifuge assembly hall at Iran's main nuclear fuel enrichment facility in Natanz was deemed by the Iranian authorities to be enemy sabotage, and provoked a defiant response: The wrecked building would be rebuilt in "the heart of the mountains," the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization said.
Progress on that pledge, which could shield the facility from an aerial assault or other threats, has been unclear to outside observers. But new satellite imagery is now shedding light on the Iranian plans.
The Visual Investigations team of The New York Times has tracked construction at the site using the new imagery. For the first time, new tunnel entrances for underground construction are visible under a ridge in the mountain foothills south of the Natanz facility, about 140 miles south of Tehran.
The Times worked with Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, to interpret the new image.
"The new facility is likely to be a far more secure location for centrifuge assembly -- it is located far from a road and the ridge offers significant overburden that would protect the facility from air attack," Mr. Lewis stated in written comments.
The July explosion was not the only recent incident that appeared to have exposed major gaps in Iran's security of its nuclear program, which the country insists is limited to peaceful purposes. In late November, a brazen daylight attack killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.
Iran has blamed Israel and the United States for the Natanz explosion and Mr. Fakhrizadeh's assassination, which were both considered serious setbacks to Iran's nuclear program.
Mr. Lewis described the clues that underground construction was underway at the site in Natanz.
"There are what appear to be two tunnel entrances on either side of a large ridge, with a pile of spoil from excavation nearby. The space between the two entrances is large enough to accommodate a facility about the same size as the centrifuge assembly building that was destroyed this summer and that Iran indicated it was rebuilding in the mountains."
Looking at satellite images taken over several months allows for tracking changes. Even something as simple and inconspicuous as a pile of dirt is a clue.
"The major clue is the pile of spoil from the excavation that was not present in July," Mr. Lewis said. "Iran also regraded a pair of roads on each side of the ridge leading to what appear to be tunnel entrances."
Allison Puccioni, an imagery analyst affiliated with the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, pointed out other telltale signs of excavations near the debris pile. In comments provided to the Times, Ms Puccioni said that between the debris pile and excavation site, the imagery showed "trails of excavated earth, lighter in color than the existing hard-packed road."
A flurry of activity in Natanz captured by satellites in recent months includes the building of new roads and additional excavations, which started after the explosion. Researchers from AllSource Analysis and the Institute for Science and International Security have previously identified the area and said that additional tunnels are being constructed, suggesting work on an even larger underground complex is underway.
The destroyed building was built in 2012 and had been used to assemble centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium needed for peaceful purposes -- and when enriched to higher levels, for bombs. The 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers halted high level enrichment, but Iran started amassing enriched uranium again after President Trump left the accord two years ago.
After the July explosion, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran's compliance with the accord, confirmed that there had been no nuclear materials at that specific building.
The ability to see via satellite what Iran has done since the Natanz explosion partly reflects the quantum leap in such visual technology in the past two decades.
In 2002, analysts revealed the construction of the then secret Natanz enrichment facility using commercial high-resolution satellite imagery. Such sharp imagery had only become available in 2000. Back then, the analysis required finding Natanz on Persian maps in the Library of Congress, faxing an order form and waiting for weeks to receive satellite imagery on a CD-ROM. Eighteen years later, even the smallest changes at a site like Natanz can be quickly tracked by analysts and journalists on their laptops.
These monitoring capabilities can create their own challenges. Frequently collected images do not show completed construction, but work in progress. Initial interpretation of the recent changes in Natanz from October focused on a former firing range south of the main facility as the possible location for the new underground centrifuge assembly hall. However, these changes turned out to be a construction support facility used for road work and tunnel excavations.
In response to Mr. Fakhrizadeh's assassination, Iran enacted a law last week to immediately ramp up uranium enrichment and bar international inspectors by February if U.S. sanctions are not lifted. The law also calls for the installment of advanced centrifuges at its nuclear facilities, including in Natanz.
The United States may have been aware in advance of the recent attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure and personnel. How Iran responds to the newest attack could pose an early challenge to the incoming Biden administration, which has said it wants to rejoin the nuclear accord repudiated by Mr. Trump. Graphics b

For the first time, US exceeds 3,000 COVID deaths in one day

Texto completo: US deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday exceeded 3,000 a day for the first time, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That surpasses record fatalities set last week, and is more than the number of lives lost in the country during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The coronavirus is infecting Americans at an ever-increasing clip in the final weeks of 2020. And that trajectory is beginning to show in fatalities: In just over a week of December, deaths were more than double the rate of the same week in November, according to Covid Tracking Project data.
Last week's record — 2,885 deaths reported in a single day — was a milestone because not since the first peak, in the spring, had so many deaths been reported. The high point then was 2,752 deaths, on April 15.
As the surge gathers speed, the country went on last week to record its most coronavirus-related deaths over a seven-day period. With a seven-day average of 2,249 deaths, the United States broke the previous mark of 2,232, set on April 17. Seven-day averages can provide a more accurate picture of the virus's progression than daily death counts, which can fluctuate.
And all the while, the country is speeding toward another stunning total: 300,000 total deaths since the virus slipped into the country at the beginning of the year and began laying siege. At least 288,000 deaths have been recorded, according to a New York Times database.

1 in 5 spent Thanksgiving Day away from own home
More than 1 in 5 people in the United States spent Thanksgiving Day away from their homes, an analysis of phone location data shows.
The latest data on US holiday travel, compiled by SafeGraph, offers another indication of how many Americans have flouted public health guidance by spending time away from their homes. Roughly 22 percent of people in the country on average were not at their household on Nov. 26, according to an analysis of anonymized location data. SafeGraph also found that about 1 in 8 people traveled more than 30 miles during the holiday.
The surge in travel arrived even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised against Thanksgiving trips to help stop mounting coronavirus infections across the country.
While the location data suggests many Americans probably visited other households, the analysis does not reveal other important information, such as the size of gatherings, whether they took place outside, or whether people interacted without masks. It does, however, bolster other findings from the Transportation Security Administration.
On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the TSA recorded its highest number of passengers since the pandemic took hold of the country in March. Over the week leading up the holiday and the weekend when travelers presumably returned home, the TSA screened about 9.5 million people in the United States.
Public health officials reported 219,282 new cases on Tuesday, one of the highest figures ever recorded. Over the past week, several indicators also show the pandemic strengthening: Cases have risen 25 percent, hospitalizations rose 6 percent, and daily deaths have spiked nearly 40 percent.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's leading infectious-disease specialist, has warned that Christmas celebrations may pose an even greater risk of infection than Thanksgiving because of the length of time people typically celebrate.
Washington Post
Data show hospitals running out of intensive care beds
In El Paso, hospitals reported that just 13 of 400 intensive care beds were not occupied last week. In Fargo, N.D., there were just three. In Albuquerque, there were zero.
More than a third of Americans live in areas where hospitals are running critically short of intensive care beds, federal data show, revealing a newly detailed picture of the nation's hospital crisis during the deadliest week of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Hospitals serving more than 100 million Americans reported having fewer than 15 percent of intensive care beds still available as of last week, according to a Times analysis of data reported by hospitals and released by the Department of Health and Human Services.
Many areas are even worse off: One in 10 Americans — across a large swath of the Midwest, South, and Southwest — lives in an area where intensive care beds are either completely full, or fewer than 5 percent of beds are available. At these levels, specialists say maintaining existing standards of care for the sickest patients may be difficult or impossible.
The new dataset, released on Monday, marks the first time the federal government has published detailed geographic information on COVID-19 patients in hospitals, something public health officials have long said would be crucial to responding to the epidemic and understanding its impact.

State Department treats 200 guests to holiday festivities
The State Department hosted roughly 200 guests Tuesday night at the presidential guesthouse despite concerns of public health specialists and a new positive coronavirus case on the premises since last week, according to two US officials.
The party included a tour of the White House's holiday decorations followed by a self-guided tour across the street at Blair House, where foreign diplomats, their families, US staffers, and friends and acquaintances of the State Department's chief of protocol convened.
A State Department spokesman said the “Holiday Cheer" reception that typically follows the tour was canceled this year because of concerns about spreading the coronavirus, but two bars were set up in the guesthouse as the face-shield-wearing catering staff poured drinks into holiday-themed paper cups. Guests unmasked to consume the beverages, causing people to congregate and create occasional choke points, the two officials told The Washington Postunder the condition of anonymity.
About 200 guests attended, among them the ambassadors of Afghanistan, Egypt, South Korea, and Guatemala, officials said.
The tour is one of several holiday functions the State Department is hosting this week and next week even as the Trump administration's own health specialists implore Americans to limit travel and avoid large gatherings amid a pandemic that has killed at least 285,000 people and infected 15 million across the country.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is hosting two receptions next week — including one with an invitation list of more than 900 — which some lawmakers and others have called on him to cancel.

Texto completo: Perhaps you remember the terrible ordeal suffered by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the Red Hen in 2018. She was awaiting her entree at the Virginia farm-to-table restaurant when the co-owner, appalled by Sanders’ defense of Donald Trump’s administration, asked her to leave. This happened three days after the homeland security secretary at the time, Kirstjen Nielsen, was yelled at for the administration’s family separation policy as she tried to dine at a Mexican restaurant in Washington.
These two insults launched a thousand thumb-suckers about civility. More than one conservative writer warned liberals that the refusal to let Trump officials eat in peace could lead to Trump’s reelection. “The political question of the moment,” opined Daniel Henninger in The Wall Street Journal, is this: ‘Can the Democratic Party control its left?’ "
Somehow, though, few are asking the same question of Republicans as Trump devotees terrorize election workers and state officials over the president’s relentless lies about voter fraud. Michigan’s secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, described her family’s experience this past weekend: “As my 4-year-old son and I were finishing up decorating the house for Christmas on Saturday night, and he was about to sit down to watch ‘How the Grinch Stole Christmas,’ dozens of armed individuals stood outside my home shouting obscenities and chanting into bullhorns in the dark of night.”
So far, what happened to Benson doesn’t appear to be turning into a big cultural moment. There’s no frisson of the new about it; it’s pretty routine for Trumpists to threaten and intimidate people who work in both public health and election administration.
The radically different way the media treats boundary-pushing on the left and on the right is about more than hypocrisy or double standards. It is, rather, an outgrowth of the crisis of democracy that shields the Republican Party from popular rebuke. There’s no point asking if the GOP can control its right. It has no reason to.
Democrats have just won the popular vote in the seventh out of the past eight presidential elections. In the aftermath, analysts have overwhelmingly focused on what Democrats, not Republicans, must do to broaden their appeal. Partly, this stems from knee-jerk assumptions about the authenticity of the so-called heartland. But it’s also just math — only one of our political parties needs to win an overwhelming national majority in order to govern.
Republican extremism tends to become a major story only when there are clear electoral consequences for it. Pat Buchanan’s demagogic culture war speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention was seen, at the time, as shocking, and elite Republicans later believed it helped George H.W. Bush lose the election.
Twenty years later, after Mitt Romney’s defeat in 2012, Republicans undertook an “autopsy” and went public with the results of focus groups calling the party “scary,” “narrow-minded” and “out of touch.” There were always zealots in the modern Republican Party, but there were also forces interested in quarantining them.
After that autopsy, Reince Priebus, then the Republican Party chair, called for a more “inclusive” GOP, saying, “Finding common ground with voters will be a top priority.”
Trump would prove that wasn’t necessary. In 2016, he got a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Romney did four years earlier, but still won the Electoral College. And while widespread revulsion toward Trump was a problem for him this November, down-ticket Republicans performed far better than almost anyone expected.
As a result, the effect of right-wing fanaticism on mainstream public opinion has become a nonissue. It doesn’t matter if Joe Biden voters don’t like paranoid militants, many of them armed, menacing civil servants. The structure of our politics — gerrymandering in the House and the rural bias in the Senate — buffers Republicans from centrist backlash.
One thing would change this dynamic overnight: a Democratic victory in the Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. Republicans might learn that there’s a price for aligning themselves with a president trying to thwart the will of the electorate. They might regret the arrogance of Sen. David Perdue, who didn’t deign to show up for a Sunday night debate with his Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff. Trumpism might come to be seen as an electoral albatross, and Republicans would have an incentive to rejoin the reality everyone else operates in.
But unless and until that happens, few will be able to muster much surprise when Republicans condone the most outrageous right-wing thuggery, because few will expect anything else.
The uproar over shunning Sanders was an outgrowth of an old liberal quandary — how a tolerant society should treat those who conspire against tolerance. The people screaming outside Benson’s house raise an entirely different question, about how long our society can endure absent any overlapping values or common truths. You can condemn an anti-democratic party for behaving anti-democratically, but you can’t really argue with it.

Texto completo: Advancing the interests of middle- and low-income Americans isn't something the news media grasps. That's why, to this day, journalists are more concerned with our short-lived "family separation" policy but say not a word about the drug dealers and convicted child molesters who hop across the southern border and into our neighborhoods.
The New York Times on Wednesday ran a front-page story yet again on "family separation" and the "bonds" that were "broken" as a result.
The Trump administration's policy to prosecute all illegal aliens (otherwise known as "enforcing the immigration laws") ended more than two years ago, yet the media are still printing weepy stories about the plight of immigrants who knowingly crossed the border illegally and threw themselves into the care of Border Patrol.
The main subject of the New York Times's story is a Guatemalan woman, Leticia Peren, and her son Yovany, whom she brought here in 2017 when he was 15 years old. The pair were separated, and Peren made the choice to leave her son in the United States and see herself deported.
That must have been terrible. No mother wants to be kept from her child. But it was a price Peren was willing to pay if it meant a better life for her son, who was not entitled to stay here but was nonetheless allowed to do so. He was taken in by a family in Texas, where he made friends and began to attend school.
The New York Times said that Peren left Guatemala after "lawlessness in her city" began to "intensify," culminating in gang members pressuring her son to join them. "At one point," the story says, "a man held a gun to her head and threatened to kill Yovany if she did not come up with several thousand quetzales a month, which she did not have."
Peren made it back to the U.S. — the story doesn't say how, only that she is now seeking asylum. She and her son were reunited in New York. However, Peren "has come to understand that being reunited with her son did not restore the bonds they once shared." True, but at least she's less likely to be extorted by violent Central American gang bangers, and he has an actual future.
The media don't understand that immigration enforcement isn't about hurting people who come here. It's about protecting the people who are already here. Yes, there are some unfortunate consequences and some personally painful separations. But whose interests are the media looking out for?

Major media outlets mostly ignore story linking Rep. Eric Swalwell to suspected Chinese spy

Texto completo: Major news outlets have mostly ignored the Axios report linking Rep. Eric Swalwell to a suspected Chinese spy early in his political career.
“However, despite having been a loyal guest on MSNBC and CNN for three years to promote the Russia investigation — including allegations about President Trump being an ‘agent’ of the Kremlin — the latest Swalwell news received almost no attention from the cable news outlets on Tuesday,” Fox News reported Wednesday.
“MSNBC spent roughly five minutes on Axios' reporting during the network's 5 a.m. program on Tuesday without mentioning it again for the rest of the day. Meanwhile, CNN completely avoided the story altogether, both on-air and online,” the report continued.
Fox News also noted that major newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which dedicated much coverage to allegations against President Trump concerning Russia, had not yet afforded any coverage to the Swalwell story. Broadcast networks ABC, NBC, and CBS also skipped coverage of the controversy during morning and evening shows.
Swalwell did make an appearance on CNN Wednesday, in which he briefly addressed the story.
“I was shocked,” he said. “Just over six years ago, I was told about this individual, and then, I offered to help, and I did help, and I was thanked by the FBI for my help, and that person is no longer in the country, and I was a little surprised to read about my cooperation in that story because the story says that there was never a suspicion of wrongdoing on my part.”
Swalwell also told Politico that he found the timing of the Axios story to be suspect.
“I’ve been a critic of the president. I’ve spoken out against him. I was on both committees that worked to impeach him. The timing feels like that should be looked at," Swalwell said.
Swalwell went on to accuse the intelligence officials who spoke with Axios of attempting to “weaponize” his cooperation in the incident.
"What it appears though that this person, as the story reports, was unsuccessful in whatever they were trying to do. But if intelligence officials are trying to weaponize someone’s cooperation, they are essentially seeking to do what this person was not able to do, which is to try and discredit someone," Swalwell said.
According to the Monday Axios report, a Chinese national named Fang Fang, or Christine Fang, targeted Swalwell when he was an up-and-coming councilman. Axios reported that investigators eventually gave Swalwell a “defensive briefing” on their concerns with Fang in 2015, after which he cut all ties with her. Swalwell was never accused of wrongdoing.
While Swalwell "refused to discuss his relationship with Fang," he did express optimism that he would be able to remain on the House Intelligence Committee.
“As the story referenced, this goes back to the beginning of the last decade, and it’s something that congressional leadership knew about it,” Swalwell said.
Washington Examiner requests for comment from CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and the New York Times were not immediately returned.

MSNBC host to create more problems in journalism as 'race, gender' course instructor at Howard University

Texto completo: Academia has been pushing the "social justice" nonsense on unwitting students for years, turning out a bunch of adult-age children who prefer whining instead of working. That continues with Howard University's announcement last week that liberal MSNBC host Joy Reid will teach a master's level course on journalism next year.
The school said that the course, titled "Covering Race, Gender & Politics in the Digital Age," will cover "concepts of political media coverage, focused on issues of race and gender."
In a sense, Reid is perfectly suited for the role. Her time at MSNBC has been one long career of calling people racist and sexist. She is literally being sued for defamation right now by a California woman, a private citizen, whom Reid falsely characterized as racist on social media. (Reid apologized for the social media posts, admitting that it was inaccurate, but she is fighting the lawsuit.)
To be sure, race and gender are fine subjects to cover in journalism programs. Students can and should learn to be conscious of both. For instance, a reporter gathering quotes from voters on a given election would be smart to make sure he surveys a diverse group of people rather than, say, only Asian women in their 20s.
But anyone familiar with Reid's work knows that's not the kind of education she's going to provide. No, the syllabus will be something like "Lessons in checking white privilege," "Identifying white supremacy in politics," and "Dismantling language rooted in toxic masculinity."
As described in my book Privileged Victims: How America's Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, this is why large newsrooms around the country are erupting with accusations of racism and demands that senior-level editors and managers more or less cease practicing journalism and instead embark on a moral crusade.
Young journalists, having been taught precisely the kind of garbage that Reid will preach to her students, feel now that their jobs as news reporters and writers are not to learn, grow, and explain current events as they are to their audience. No, they feel now that their job is to determine what's good ("diversity" and "inclusion"), what's bad (straight, white men having influence anywhere), and then push readers and viewers to see it the same way, including not just persuading but also haranguing and leveling false accusations.
The Los Angeles Times and the New York Times were perfect case studies this year. At the Los Angeles Times, staff demanded pay raises and race quotas for minority employees. At the New York Times, staff accused the paper's opinion page editor of putting the lives of minority employees in danger after he commissioned a particular piece by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton. That editor responded by resigning.
At Howard University, Reid won't be teaching journalism. She'll be advocating for "social justice."

Byron York's Daily Memo: 'Misinformation' and the 2020 vote

'MISINFORMATION' AND THE 2020 VOTE. When you think about reporting and discussion of the 2020 presidential campaign, has there been any word as often misused as "misinformation"? In much political debate, it was used to mean "information I don't like" rather than something that was provably false. That confusion extends to a new survey of American attitudes done by Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The survey questioned 2,752 respondents and was done in mid-November.
Gallup found that 64 percent of Americans believe they were subjected to more "misinformation" in the 2020 campaign than in earlier campaigns. That number included 52 percent of Democrats, 66 percent of independents, and 79 percent of Republicans. "Majorities of those who say they were exposed to misinformation this election year believe they were exposed to it on social media and cable TV news," the study says. "This finding is in light of the fact that major internet companies handled misinformation differently in the run-up to the election and afterward by enacting measures to label false information -- something they largely did not do before this year.”galluSomething to note: Much press coverage and discussion focused on "misinformation" allegedly coming from the "right wing," but a significantly larger number of Republicans than Democrats believe they were subjected to more "misinformation" in 2020 than earlier. It's unlikely those Republicans were worried about an increase in "right wing" "misinformation," rather than "misinformation" coming from the other side.

Look at where people believe "misinformation" is coming from. Gallup asked, "Where do you think you were exposed to misinformation about the election this year?" Everyone -- Democrats, independents, Republicans -- pointed to Facebook. But Facebook was mostly an aggregator of other media reports. And there were big differences between the parties about the original sources of "misinformation."
Forty-four percent of Democrats said "misinformation" came from cable TV news -- by that, they mostly meant Fox News -- while 77 percent of Republicans pointed to cable TV as the source of "misinformation." By that, they meant CNN and MSNBC. When it comes to traditional broadcast news -- ABC, CBS, NBC -- only 21 percent of Democrats saw that as a source of "misinformation," while 81 percent of Republicans did. That's a big difference.
And then there were the national newspapers. Only ten percent of Democrats pointed to the big papers -- the New York Times, Washington Post -- as sources of "misinformation," while 57 percent of Republicans did.
The results are clear: Democrats believe "misinformation" is coming from the deepest recesses of Facebook and Twitter, while Republicans believe it is coming from ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, the Washington Post, and New York Times.

Then there's more. Remember how Facebook and Twitter clamped down on the Hunter Biden laptop story? Twitter even shut down the New York Post's account. What about that? Was that "misinformation"? It appears the Biden material that was published was accurate, even though Democrats and their allies in the media did not want to see it. Gallup's question related to internet censorship produced the most striking party disparity in the entire poll.
The first problem was the question: "Do you think major internet companies went too far, were about right, or did not go far enough in trying to prevent the spread of false information about the election on their websites and apps? The problem was the phrase "false information." Were the emails on the Hunter Biden laptop "false information"? Certainly not the parts that were verified by some recipients. So it is entirely reasonable to think that the big social media companies clamped down on accurate information in the Hunter Biden case.gallup_york2Nevertheless, in response to Gallup's question, just two percent of Democrats said the social media companies went too far, while 66 percent of Republicans said they went too far. That is a huge, huge difference. On the other end, 60 percent of Democrats said the companies did not go far enough, while just 23 percent of Republicans said they did not go far enough.
Those two numbers undoubtedly reflect different things. Democrats would have been happy had there never been any mention of Hunter Biden at all -- that's their idea of "misinformation." But Republicans have seen four years of false reports about President Trump colluding with Russia, about him being a Russian asset, about a pee tape and a dossier, and much, much more. They've seen "misinformation" in all of those news sources -- ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, Washington Post, New York Times -- that Democrats trust. The new poll tells us a little about American attitudes toward the media and "misinformation." But it doesn't grapple with the dramatically divergent conceptions of what "misinformation" is.

Sara Leland, a principal dancer with New York City Ballet who was entrusted with staging George Balanchine’s ballets worldwide even during her performing career, and who went on to become a beloved ballet master with the company, died Nov. 28 in Westwood, New Jersey. She was 79.
The cause of her death, in a hospital, was congestive heart failure, her niece, Mary-Sue O’Donnell, said.
Leland, who was known to friends and colleagues by her birth name, Sally, was a young dancer with the Joffrey Ballet in New York when Balanchine, the ballet master in chief of City Ballet, saw her dance in a class and invited her to join his company.
In 1960, her first year with City Ballet, she was given a principal role in “Les Biches,” a new ballet by Francisco Moncion; she was promoted to soloist three years later and began to perform principal parts in a wide range of ballets, including Balanchine’s “Agon,” “Symphony in C” and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”; Jerome Robbins’ “Interplay”; and Frederick Ashton’s “Illuminations.”
Balanchine created a role for her in the “Emeralds” section of his full-length “Jewels” (1967) and in the short-lived “PAMTGG,” based on a commercial jingle for Pan American World Airways (1971). Robbins created roles for her in “Dances at a Gathering” (1969) and “Goldberg Variations” (1971). Her ability to rapidly absorb and remember choreographic sequences led Robbins to ask her to assist him at rehearsals, and they worked together closely during the creation of both those ballets.
Leland was promoted to principal dancer in 1972, just before City Ballet’s Stravinsky Festival, which opened with “Lost Sonata,” a pas de deux created by Balanchine for Leland and John Clifford. That same evening she performed the second movement with Edward Villella in the premiere of Balanchine’s “Symphony in Three Movements,” a ballet with which she would be associated throughout her career and which she later taught to generations of City Ballet dancers.
“Sally was a quick learner, and Balanchine really struggled with ‘Symphony’ with regard to tempos, so he gave Sally a lot of steps to show the corps de ballet,” Barbara Horgan, Balanchine’s longtime assistant, said.
Those steps stayed with Leland. “When I first staged ‘Symphony,’ I remember writing down the complicated counts from Sally, who had it all in her head,” said Christine Redpath, a repertory director at City Ballet. “I still remember her abandoned, quicksilver dancing in that work.”
Balanchine went on to choreograph roles for Leland in “Union Jack” (1976) and “Vienna Waltzes” (1977), and her steely technique and versatility allowed her to perform in an exceptionally wide range of the company’s repertory, including abstract ballets like Balanchine’s “Serenade” and “Agon”; romantic, expressive pieces like “La Valse” and “Davidsbündlertänze”; and conventional story ballets like “The Nutcracker” (as Dewdrop and the Sugar Plum Fairy) and “Don Quixote” (as Dulcinea).
“She was fun to watch because you didn’t have to hold your breath,” Horgan said. “She was so strong that she could take risks — but they weren’t risks for her. Some dancers are the same in everything, but she wasn’t.”
Leland began to stage works by Balanchine and Robbins in the mid-1970s while still performing. She traveled to Amsterdam, Havana and Copenhagen to teach their ballets as well as working on them with companies in the U.S., including the Joffrey Ballet, Dance Theater of Harlem and Boston Ballet. She was appointed an assistant ballet master with the company in 1981, two years before retiring from the stage.
“I’m watching Mr. Balanchine as much and as closely as possible these days,” she said in a 1982 interview with The Christian Science Monitor. “I treasure every minute of every rehearsal that he conducts. I’m trying to learn his ballets so accurately that I will never forget them and can stage them in the future exactly as he intended . ”
Sally Harrington was born Aug. 2, 1941, in Melrose, Massachusetts, the second child of Ruth (Gibbons) Harrington and Leland Kitteridge Harrington, known as Hago, a former player for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League. She later adopted the stage name Sara Leland.
An older sister, Leeta, was born with spina bifida, and a doctor suggested she take up ballet as physical therapy. The family lived near the school of E. Virginia Williams, a noted teacher who admired Balanchine’s work and had studied his teaching methods. Leland went along with her sister to study there.
Her talent was immediately apparent, and she began to train intensively with Williams, who in 1958 founded the New England Civic Ballet, the forerunner of the Boston Ballet. Leland’s mother and Williams became close friends, and Ruth Harrington ran the company’s front desk, took dancers into the family home and made costumes for the troupe.
“It became their life,” said O’Donnell, Leland’s niece.
Robert Joffrey saw Leland perform with the company in 1959 and invited her to join the Joffrey Ballet. On vacation in Boston the next year, she attended ballet classes with Williams and was spotted by Balanchine, who was an artistic adviser to the New England Ballet.
“Balanchine adored Sally,” said Richard Tanner, a former ballet master at City Ballet. “She was such an unusual dancer, with such freedom of movement and lack of inhibition. She danced really big, and he loved that. He liked her personality, too, everything about her.”
Soon after Leland began to take on rehearsal duties, Balanchine asked her to coach the principal ballerina roles in his ballets. Her unusual ability to retain the choreography of all parts of a ballet, and to teach it, meant that she could work on more than 30 works in the repertory. She also frequently staged Balanchine’s works abroad, notably “Jewels” at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1998.
Leland married Arthur Kevorkian in 1975; they divorced in 1993. In later years Leland, a keen gardener, lived in New City, New York. O’Donnell, her niece, is her only survivor.
Wendy Whelan, the associate artistic director of City Ballet, said that Leland made an indelible impression on several generations of dancers.
“She was bigger than life; she had this giant, wide smile and so many things that I imagined a Balanchine dancer should exude when I joined the company,” Whelan said. “Passion, freedom, individuality — she was all that. When she taught, it was always ‘More! Bigger! Go for it!’ She embodied all the qualities that we tried to put into the dancing.”

NEW YORK — When Mayor Bill de Blasio reopened elementary schools this week, many New York City parents who had been keeping their children home were offered a last chance to send them back into classrooms this school year.
Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, struggled with the decision, both as a leading mayoral candidate and as a parent of two elementary students. He lost his mother to the coronavirus in April.
He and his wife were nervous about their children’s safety, but they had seen mixed results with remote learning: Their oldest, Max, was having a particularly difficult time learning on an iPad.
So they decided to send Max, who is 9, back to school while keeping their younger son at home. On Monday, Stringer and his wife accompanied Max on a No. 1 subway train and sent him off to school for the first time since March.
“After months of debating and thinking and trying to arrive at the right thing, it really was good to see he was happy,” Stringer said after dropping him off.
If Stringer wins the race for mayor next year, his experience as a public school parent during the pandemic is likely to inform how he guides the school system out of a crisis that could set back a generation of students. The Democratic primary on June 22 is expected to focus on who is the best person to bring the city back, and all of the candidates have criticized de Blasio’s handling of reopening schools.
De Blasio, a Democrat with a year left in office, has been applauded for pushing to reopen New York’s school district, the nation’s largest, when so many cities have not. But he has also angered parents who feel whiplash from the mayor’s shifting strategy, which has resulted in two delays to the start of the school year and then a schools shutdown based on a metric that many found arbitrary.
De Blasio, who takes pride in the fact that his two children attended public schools, oversees a system that has roughly 1.1 million students who have endured a year of educational challenges ranging from difficult to appalling. About three-quarters of students are considered poor and more than 100,000 are homeless.
Many families of color have chosen to keep their students home. Even though there are many more Black students than white students in the system overall, nearly 12,000 more white children have returned to public school buildings than Black children.
Stringer, a Democrat who has moved to the left as progressives capture momentum in his party, is the best-known mayoral candidate whose children attend public schools. He said he was most worried about poor families.
“We’re privileged parents, and we struggled,” he said. “I just cannot imagine parents with very little resources who are going to have to really worry about their children falling further behind.”
Other candidates have seen the challenges up close: Raymond J. McGuire, a business executive, has a son in second grade who attends a private school and has been doing a mix of in-person and remote learning; Maya Wiley, a former top counsel for de Blasio, has a daughter who attends a private high school and is learning from home; Zach Iscol, a nonprofit leader and former Marine, has four young children, two of whom are attending a private school in person and one who is learning online.
Wiley criticized the mayor for closing schools in November, and for failing to properly plan for the reopening.
“The last-second decisions and poor communications have robbed parents and teachers of any peace of mind in a traumatic time and undermined principals’ ability to plan,” Wiley said.
McGuire said he agreed with de Blasio’s decision to reopen schools for the youngest students this week, but said the mayor failed to offer a “consistent game plan” for parents.
“Kids are safer inside a school building than outside of it,” he said. “There are so many things about in-person learning that you simply can’t replicate in remote sessions.”
Several candidates have older children, including Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president; Shaun Donovan, a housing secretary under former President Barack Obama; Kathryn Garcia, the city’s former sanitation commissioner; and Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive.
Garcia, who left de Blasio’s administration in September, said she told officials at the Education Department over the summer that they should prioritize bringing the youngest students and those with special needs back five days a week, instead of the initial plan de Blasio settled on, known as blended learning, where students were in classrooms a few days a week.
“The hybrid and Zoom kills families and particularly women,” Garcia said.
Other candidates have interesting ideas for improving schools. Morales, who worked at the Education Department under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said virtual learning was an opportunity to “desegregate classrooms, integrating students from the Upper East Side with students from Brownsville, the South Bronx and Jamaica.”
Iscol, who helped manage the temporary hospital at Javits Convention Center in the spring, said the mayor should have thought of creative solutions like converting commercial office space into temporary classrooms. He is worried about students’ mental health.
“We’re going to have to reestablish routines, rebuild relationships between students, teachers and parents, and ensure kids have help developing the resilience to get back to learning,” he said.
Before the pandemic, much of de Blasio’s legacy was entwined with his creation of universal prekindergarten early in his first term, and his subsequent expansion of the program to include 3-year-olds.
Those achievements may be slightly tempered by his handling of the schools reopening this year, which fell short of the quick and coordinated effort the mayor pulled off with prekindergarten.
Stringer has called on the mayor to offer low-income families subsidies, known as an “internet passport,” to pay for home internet. De Blasio, he said, has not been clear with parents about what to expect.
“What we wanted was certainty,” he said. “We wanted to know the rules of the road, and they seemed to be changing at every red light.”
Stringer, 60, and his wife, Elyse Buxbaum, who live in the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, took Max to Public School 33 Chelsea Prep in Manhattan on Monday. Max wore a mask on the subway while leafing through a book about Eleanor Roosevelt.
His brother, Miles, 7, adjusted to online learning. It was harder for Max. He would turn his camera off or get frustrated when his teacher did not see him raising his hand, said Buxbaum, executive vice president at the Museum of Jewish Heritage.
“He’s a smart kid — he always did really well in school,” she said. “Suddenly, he wasn’t being inspired by school the way he used to be.”
Stringer said the death of his mother, Arlene Stringer-Cuevas, a former city councilwoman who was 86, has affected his approach to dealing with the virus.
“It was a very tough time,” Stringer said. “We had to explain to the kids what was happening — carefully. There was no closure. We had no funeral, no shiva.”
“It made me very hesitant to expose my family to COVID,” he added.
The couple decided to keep both sons at home.
Now that Max is back in person, his schedule is chaotic — he will be in class four days this month, including two Fridays and a Tuesday, and at home the other days.
On Monday, Buxbaum was still overcoming jitters about sending Max back and packed disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer in his bag.
“I whispered to him, please use them all the time,” she said. “Before you eat. Before you do anything.”

Google Chief Apologizes for AI Researcher’s Dismissal

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google’s parent company Alphabet, apologized for the departure of a prominent artificial intelligence researcher, whose exit has roiled the company’s workforce and raised questions about its stated commitment to diversity and the responsible development of AI technology.
In an email to employees on Wednesday, Pichai, however, stopped short of saying that the company was wrong in how it hastened the resignation of Timnit Gebru, who was a co-leader of Google’s Ethical AI team and one of its best-known Black female employees.
Gebru said last week that the company fired her after she sent an email that criticized the company’s lack of progress in hiring women and minorities as well as biases built into its artificial intelligence technology. She said that she had demanded an explanation for why the company had told her to retract a paper that pinpointed flaws in a new breed of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins the company’s search engine.
She said that short of a transparent explanation or further discussion that she would resign after an appropriate amount of time. The company immediately accepted her statement as a resignation and cut her off from all company services and systems.
Colleagues have rallied to Gebru’s defense, saying that Google did not treat her fairly and that this incident was an example of how Black employees are often mistreated at the company.
“I’ve heard the reaction to Dr. Gebru’s departure loud and clear: It seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google. I want to say how sorry I am for that, and I accept the responsibility of working to restore your trust,” Pichai wrote in an email viewed by The New York Times. Axios had reported about the email earlier.
“We need to assess the circumstances that led to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process,” he added. “We will begin a review of what happened to identify all the points where we can learn.”
On Twitter, Gebru said Pichai’s email was not a true apology. “I see this as ‘I’m sorry for how it played out but I’m not sorry for what we did to her yet.’”
The parting with Gebru is especially fraught for Google, because it involves two thorny subjects for the company — a lack of diversity in its workforce and concerns about the dangerous consequences of artificial intelligence technology.
Gebru, who joined the company last year from Stanford, was vocal about the importance of the company’s efforts to hire and retain more women as well as Black employees, who currently account for less than 2% of the company’s workforce. In addition, her research to examine the long-term implications of AI put her at odds with the company’s strategic goals of depending on artificial intelligence as the breakthrough technology to improve most, if not all, of its products.
Last week, about 2,000 Google employees signed a petition protesting her dismissal from the company and demanding that executives within its research organization be more transparent about the circumstances of Gebru’s exit.
On Monday, members of Google’s Ethical AI team published a post that disputed some of the company’s statements regarding her exit, including the company’s assertion that she resigned and was not fired.
Jeff Dean, one of Google’s most senior executives who oversees the company’s AI research arm, met with a group of employees on Tuesday to explain what took place with Gebru, but many walked away from the meeting even more upset.

This Sport Is a ‘Way of Life.’ In a Pandemic, It’s Also High Risk.

WEST ORANGE, N.J. — On a recent Sunday at a cavernous ice skating complex in suburban New Jersey, locker rooms sat empty while hockey players slipped into their uniforms in the parking lot.
The nearly 2,500 seats surrounding the main rink in West Orange, about 20 miles from Manhattan, were also empty, cordoned off with yellow caution tape. Instead, hockey parents gathered in the parking lot around elaborate audio visual setups, including a projection screen unfurled behind an SUV, to watch livestreams of their children playing.
It was not the typical routine at a youth hockey competition, but it was the new reality the sport has had to adapt to during the pandemic. It was also one of the last times even this strange scene would unfold. New Jersey put hockey on hold Dec. 5 as part of its effort to combat a spike in the coronavirus.
In New Jersey and in many suburban towns across the Northeast, youth hockey is an all-consuming ritual of the cold weather months. Players and their families devote nights and weekends and routinely drive hundreds of miles to compete in multiday tournaments.
“This is a way of life,” said Vincent Cucci III, a lawyer from Scotch Plains, New Jersey, whose two sons and daughter play on three different teams.
But like so many other things, it is a way of life that has been upended by the pandemic after a number of large coronavirus outbreaks were connected to hockey.
In many states, youth hockey is now on hiatus.
New York has banned games and scrimmages since the beginning of the pandemic. New Jersey and Connecticut stopped competitive hockey and other youth sports until January. And interstate tournaments in the Northeast have been suspended.
In places where youth hockey has not been halted, the normal rhythms have been tossed out the window — no spectators allowed in arenas, locker rooms off limits to players, and teams subject to mandatory quarantine if even one athlete tests positive for the virus.
For many state governments, shutting down hockey is a logical step to slow the spread of the virus.
In mid-November, Gov. Philip Murphy of New Jersey said that officials had been hearing of noncompliance with safety protocols, including by parents, and warned that “hockey is in our crosshairs.” In some instances, parents would congregate in restaurants or bars, potentially risky places to be, while their children played.
But to players and parents, canceling hockey means giving up a cherished pastime and the chance to connect with peers when many young people are isolated at home because of remote learning.
Cucci’s son, Vincent Cucci IV, who often plays at the West Orange arena as part of a New Jersey Devils under-18 youth hockey team, described getting out on the ice as “an escape from the world around you.”
New Jersey health officials grew concerned after they connected youth hockey to 22 coronavirus outbreaks around the state, many more than other indoor sports, like basketball, gymnastics and swimming.
The younger Cucci, a 17-year-old senior at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, said he understood the need for safety but believed that the precautions that teams and rink operators had taken were sufficient.
“I’m scared of losing my last season, scared of losing the last opportunity to play with friends I’ve played with since I was 8 years old,” he said.
Even before Murphy’s most recent ban, Cucci’s season had been delayed about two months and was interrupted when teams had to quarantine for two weeks when one of their players tested positive for the virus.
In New York, teams have had to settle for constant practicing.
Brett Jackson, the coach for an under-18 hockey team in Mamaroneck, said his players longed for games.
“It’s a little tougher to get the kids motivated, because it’s just practice,” Jackson said.
Some teams in New York had been traveling to neighboring states to play games before those states started banning the practice.
Ken Smith, the rink manager at Terry Conners Rink in Stamford, Connecticut, said many out-of-state teams had scheduled games there when they could not play in their home states.
“Every local youth hockey organization within 30 miles was kind of ice hunting in Connecticut,” Smith said, adding, “That has all stopped for the time being, obviously.”
New York state officials said teams that ignored the rules and still traveled out of state to play were helping spread the virus.
“The hockey-related clusters in New York have been connected to games played in other states — showing that even when we have strong rules in place, we can be hampered by individual actions,” said Jack Sterne, a spokesperson for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Some parents and hockey players remain unconvinced that hockey is as much of a culprit as public health officials portray.
Kristen Schultz, who lives in Livingston, New Jersey, and manages her son Dillon’s under-16 team, said the operators of Essex County’s Richard J. Codey Arena, the official name of the West Orange facility, were so careful that “you can’t catch a cold, let alone COVID.”
But safety practices differ from rink to rink, and some medical experts see indoor rinks as intrinsically unsafe environments.
Dr. Perry Halkitis, dean of Rutgers University’s School of Public Health and an expert in infectious diseases, said the way hockey is played and its indoor setting made the sport a risky activity.
“It’s really an ideal transmission vector” because of factors like sweat, spit and physical proximity, Halkitis said.
Still, identifying the source of transmissions is not foolproof, and some infections linked to hockey could have actually occurred in other settings, he said.
USA Hockey, the sport’s national governing body and a major organizer of youth leagues, has published best practices on how to play, including enforcing social distancing and avoiding contact on the ice, limiting or avoiding time in locker rooms and wearing masks.
“If you want to keep playing, we’ve all got to do this in and around the rink,” said Dave Fischer, a spokesperson for USA Hockey.
Most players and parents at Codey Arena were less concerned about health risks than the prospect of giving up their season.
Marcos Trasbach, a 16-year-old from Hawthorne, New Jersey, was changing out of his gear in the rink’s lobby after his team lost a game. He sat on a chair set well apart from other players.
“We’re all separated in the rink,” Trasbach said. “Playing hockey, I don’t feel scared at all.”
“This is my primary sport, and I care a lot for it,” he added. “If this season ended, my hockey career would probably peter out,” and he would lose “the brotherhood you get with your teammates.”
As Trasbach and his teammates left the rink, two teams of younger players had their temperatures scanned in the lobby before filing in.
Jay Butchko was sitting in his black Mercedes GLS 550 with his son Ryan, who had just finished playing. Butchko, who lives in Toms River, along the Jersey Shore, had watched the game from his car.
“The ultimate goal of all hockey parents is to be safe and keep playing,” Butchko said. “Whatever it takes to do, we’ll do in order to keep our kids playing.”
Cucci’s last game before New Jersey’s shutdown took effect was against the Cranford Hockey Club. The teams had moved the game up before the ban started.
“I find it a little disappointing, for sure, but there’s been plenty of good that’s come out of hockey,” Cucci said, “and you have to take the bad with the good.”

NEW YORK — For more than 40 years, Ronald Lauder collected knights in shining armor. Now he has decided to be one.
As cultural institutions all over the world are struggling in the pandemic, the cosmetics magnate and philanthropist is giving 91 pieces of arms and armor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which the New York institution is calling the most important donation of its kind in 80 years.
The Arms and Armor galleries are one of the museum’s main attractions, a gateway to culture for children captivated by the majestic warriors on horseback and an internationally renowned collection of chain mail, helmets and breastplates from Europe, Asia, America and the Middle East. Those galleries will be named for Lauder.
“When I was collecting, I was collecting with the Met in mind,” he said in an interview. “Many of the things I bought were things the Met did not have.”
Lauder, who declined to disclose the donation’s value, said he decided to give at a time when so many museums were worried about the future. “It’s important to say, ‘We still care about institutions,’” he said. “It’s an important symbol.”
The donation, which includes funds to support gallery improvements and educational programs, features an armor made in Tuscany in a workshop patronized by the Medicis and another made in the royal court workshops at Greenwich as a gift to Friedrich Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel — both from the 17th century.
“Ronald has had a long relationship with the Met,” said Max Hollein, the Met’s director. “He’s literally been the patron saint of the Arms and Armor department.”
Growing up in New York City, Lauder recalled being awed by the museum’s armor as a youth and said he continued to see those same expressions of wonder on children’s faces in the galleries. “The collection had a major effect on me,” he said. “I still have the excitement when I come to see it.”
Lauder began collecting arms and armor in 1976 and developed a close relationship with Stephen Vincent Grancsay, the Met’s curator in charge of Arms and Armor from 1929 to 1964. “He started to get me interested in it,” Lauder said.
“I have swords dating back to the Crusades,” he added. “They tell a history of various kings, fighting. It would not be as famous as Waterloo, but these were important battles of their time.”
The billionaire, who founded the Neue Galerie and collects deeply in 16 other categories — including 20th-century German and Austrian art and design as well as World War II memorabilia — said he viewed arms and armor as art.
“Some of the greatest artists and sculptors of the 15th and 16th century were working in arms and armor,” Lauder said. “These are not names that people know, but these were some of the greatest artists of their time.”
“You have to be very, very good at what you’re doing,” he continued. “Remember, these helmets were usually pounded out of pieces of metal. To make them perfectly round takes great ability.”
Lauder has built one of the leading armor collections in the world. Pierre Terjanian, who leads the Met’s department, which consists of 14,000 objects, said Lauder “has always been regarded as a giant in the field of collecting European arms and armor.”
“I knew of him long before I had the opportunity to meet him,” Terjanian added.
Two of Lauder’s pieces were included in the Met’s recent ambitious show “The Last Knight: The Art, Armor, and Ambition of Maximilian I,” which was organized by Terjanian with Lauder and his wife, Jo Carole, as lead sponsors.
As co-chairman of the department’s visiting committee, an advisory group, Lauder has also been part of the discussions about the Met’s arms and armor collection.
“He knows us well, because in those meetings we discuss our successes and our ambitions and sometimes our limitations,” Terjanian said. “He had many, many years to get to know us, and he has taken advantage of that position to help us.”
Several of the donated items fill holes in the Met’s collection and will allow the museum to present a more comprehensive narrative from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance. The Greenwich armor’s matching gauntlets, for example, will be reunited with the armor to which they originally belonged — the now-complete outfit will be on view for six months.
“We had unmistakable gaps where we just couldn’t show what happened at certain places at certain times,” Terjanian said. “Those complete armors can anchor groups of objects that we have had but just didn’t have much context for. It’s a very well-rounded ensemble of stories that the gift enables us to tell.”
There will inevitably be some speculation that Lauder is trying to one-up his brother, Leonard Lauder, who in 2013 gave the Met his collection of 78 cubist paintings, drawings and sculptures, valued at more than $1 billion.
But Ronald Lauder said there was nothing to this: “We both have collections in different areas.”
Hollein also disputed that there was any sibling rivalry at work. “Both of them are great lovers of art,” he said. “The museum is lucky to have two great patrons like Leonard and Ronald.”
Although the Met would not provide an estimate of what Ronald Lauder’s gift is worth, Terjanian said, “With all the money in the world, I would challenge you to find anything of the like.”
At the same time, Lauder acknowledged that arms and armor are not exactly a hot segment of the art market; when the odd crossbow or jousting lance comes up for sale, there isn’t a lot of competition.
“I’m the only armor collector,” Lauder joked. “There is no one else.”

The mysterious July explosion that destroyed a centrifuge assembly hall at Iran’s main nuclear fuel enrichment facility in Natanz was deemed by Iranian authorities to be enemy sabotage and provoked a defiant response: The wrecked building would be rebuilt in “the heart of the mountains,” the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization said.
Progress on that pledge, which could shield the facility from an aerial assault or other threats, has been unclear to outside observers. But new satellite imagery is now shedding light on the Iranian plans.
The Visual Investigations team of The New York Times has tracked construction at the site using the new imagery. For the first time, new tunnel entrances for underground construction are visible under a ridge in the mountain foothills south of the Natanz facility, about 140 miles south of Tehran.
The Times worked with Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, to interpret the new image.
“The new facility is likely to be a far more secure location for centrifuge assembly — it is located far from a road and the ridge offers significant overburden that would protect the facility from air attack,” Lewis stated in written comments.
The July explosion was not the only recent incident that appeared to have exposed major gaps in Iran’s security of its nuclear program, which the country insists is limited to peaceful purposes. In late November, a brazen daylight attack killed Iran’s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.
Iran has blamed Israel and the United States for the Natanz explosion and Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, which were both considered serious setbacks to Iran’s nuclear program.
Lewis described the clues that underground construction was underway at the site in Natanz.
“There are what appear to be two tunnel entrances on either side of a large ridge, with a pile of spoil from excavation nearby. The space between the two entrances is large enough to accommodate a facility about the same size as the centrifuge assembly building that was destroyed this summer and that Iran indicated it was rebuilding in the mountains.”
Looking at satellite images taken over several months allows for tracking changes. Even something as simple and inconspicuous as a pile of dirt is a clue.
“The major clue is the pile of spoil from the excavation that was not present in July,” Lewis said. “Iran also regraded a pair of roads on each side of the ridge leading to what appear to be tunnel entrances.”
Allison Puccioni, an imagery analyst affiliated with the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, pointed out other telltale signs of excavations near the debris pile. In comments provided to the Times, Puccioni said that between the debris pile and excavation site, the imagery showed “trails of excavated earth, lighter in color than the existing hard-packed road.”
A flurry of activity in Natanz captured by satellites in recent months includes the building of new roads and additional excavations, which started after the explosion. Researchers from AllSource Analysis and the Institute for Science and International Security have previously identified the area and said that additional tunnels are being constructed, suggesting work on an even larger underground complex is underway.
The destroyed building was built in 2012 and had been used to assemble centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium needed for peaceful purposes — and when enriched to higher levels, for bombs. The 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers halted high level enrichment, but Iran started amassing enriched uranium again after President Donald Trump left the accord two years ago.
After the July explosion, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s compliance with the accord, confirmed that there had been no nuclear materials at that specific building.
The ability to see via satellite what Iran has done since the Natanz explosion partly reflects the quantum leap in such visual technology in the past two decades.
In 2002, analysts revealed the construction of the then-secret Natanz enrichment facility using commercial high-resolution satellite imagery. Such sharp imagery had only become available in 2000. Back then, the analysis required finding Natanz on Persian maps in the Library of Congress, faxing an order form and waiting for weeks to receive satellite imagery on a CD-ROM. Eighteen years later, even the smallest changes at a site like Natanz can be quickly tracked by analysts and journalists on their laptops.
These monitoring capabilities can create their own challenges. Frequently collected images do not show completed construction, but work in progress. Initial interpretation of the recent changes in Natanz from October focused on a former firing range south of the main facility as the possible location for the new underground centrifuge assembly hall. However, these changes turned out to be a construction support facility used for road work and tunnel excavations.
In response to Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, Iran enacted a law last week to immediately ramp up uranium enrichment and bar international inspectors by February if U.S. sanctions are not lifted. The law also calls for the installment of advanced centrifuges at its nuclear facilities, including in Natanz.
The United States may have been aware in advance of the recent attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure and personnel. How Iran responds to the newest attack could pose an early challenge to the incoming Biden administration, which has said it wants to rejoin the nuclear accord repudiated by Trump.

17 Republican Attorneys General Back Trump in Far-Fetched Election Lawsuit

Despite dozens of judges and courts rejecting challenges to the election, Republican attorneys general in 17 states Wednesday backed President Donald Trump in his increasingly desperate and audacious legal campaign to reverse the results.
The show of support, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court, represented the latest attempt by Trump loyalists to use the power of public office to come to his aid as he continues to deny the reality of his loss with baseless claims of voter fraud.
The move is an effort to bolster a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the pro-Trump attorney general in Texas that seeks to delay the certification of the presidential electors in four battleground states the president lost. Trump has held out hope that the Supreme Court will hear the case and ultimately award him a second term. Legal experts are skeptical, however, and have largely dismissed it as a publicity stunt.
Late Tuesday, the president asked Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, if he would be willing to argue the case, according to a person familiar with their conversation. Cruz agreed, this person said. And the president has filed a motion with the court to intervene, which would make him a party to the case.
The willingness of so many Republican politicians to publicly involve themselves in a legal campaign to invalidate the ballots of millions of Americans shows how singular a figure Trump remains in the GOP. That these political allies are also elected officials whose jobs involve enforcing laws, including voting rights, underscores the extraordinary nature of the brief to the court. Even in defeat — a reality that a significant number of Republicans refuse to accept, polls show — allegiance to Trump is viewed as the ticket to higher office.
Cruz is only the latest possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024 to express support for Trump’s baseless allegations that the results of the election are tainted and fraudulent — a claim that the president’s lawyers have been unable yet to demonstrate in court. Indeed, in the president’s own motion in the Texas case his lawyer sidestepped the idea that fraud was rampant, writing that reporting in the media about the lack of proof “misses the point” because the larger issue is whether state officials loosened ballot safeguards “so that fraud becomes undetectable.”
Another Republican senator with presidential ambition, Josh Hawley of Missouri, praised the attorney general of his state Wednesday, Eric Schmitt, after Schmitt declared on Twitter that “Missouri is in the fight” for Trump. “Good work,” Hawley wrote in response. Schmitt’s office took the lead state on the brief filed with the Supreme Court on behalf of the other 16 states Wednesday, which argued that “serious concerns relating to election integrity and public confidence in elections” have surfaced.
Republicans familiar with the dynamics in these states — all of which Trump won — described calculations of ambition and political survival that many party officials are making as they choose to stand behind Trump. Some fear that if they don’t make it clear they are on the president’s side they could open themselves up to a primary challenge or end any hope for attaining higher office in the near future. Some like Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who filed the lawsuit, are considering a run for governor.
Trump has repeatedly tried to pressure Republican state legislators and elections officials — who have the most influence over declaring the formal winner and allocating electoral votes — to deny victory to President-elect Joe Biden. They have largely resisted him. But in a sign of how Trump continues to interfere with the process, he is hosting several Republican state attorneys generals at the White House on Thursday afternoon, according to two people familiar with the plans.
Paxton’s suit claims that voting irregularities in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin should be investigated by the state legislatures before those states formally certify Biden the winner Monday.
After Paxton filed, Republican attorneys general from across the country rushed to declare themselves on board, posting their support on social media and issuing statements that echoed the legally questionable claim in the Texas brief that its citizens are harmed if elections in other states are not conducted properly.
The 17 states behind the amicus brief represent a majority of the 25 Republican attorneys general across the country, and include Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana and South Dakota. Notably, the two Republican attorneys general in the battleground states that Trump lost — Arizona and Georgia — are not part of the brief.
Legal experts and a handful of Republican elected officials have questioned the seriousness of the suit, pointing out that states like Texas have no standing to bring a case involving how another state awards its electoral votes.
Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and former attorney general of the state, seemed baffled by the legal maneuver, calling it “extraordinary” and “unprecedented.”
“I’ve never seen something like this, so I don’t know what the Supreme Court’s going to do,” he said in Washington on Wednesday.
And in Georgia, the office of the Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, quickly pushed back against Paxton’s lawsuit after it was filed. It issued a statement saying that Paxton was “constitutionally, legally and factually wrong about Georgia.”

WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders moved Wednesday to buy more time to strike an elusive deal on an economic relief measure to address the ruin wrought by the pandemic, but with time running short, it was unclear whether a compromise would pass.
The House overwhelmingly approved a one-week stopgap spending bill that would punt a Friday deadline for funding the government to Dec. 18, averting the immediate threat of a shutdown as negotiators continued to haggle over both a broader spending package and the pandemic aid bill.
The Senate was expected to approve the extension, which passed the House by a vote of 343-67.
But an agreement on providing billions of dollars in relief to families, businesses and hospitals remained out of reach.
“One way or another, we’ll get it done,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed Wednesday. Asked how long it would take to reach a deal, she added, “I’m hoping soon.”
There was little indication that she had directly revived talks with the Trump administration, which on Tuesday presented a $916 billion proposal that Pelosi swiftly dismissed as unacceptable. It cut funding for unemployment benefits and failed to revive enhanced federal weekly unemployment payments that lapsed over the summer. Instead, the plan, offered by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, would provide another stimulus payment of $600 per adult and $600 per child.
“We obviously want to get people back to work,” Mnuchin said Wednesday during a wide-ranging briefing. “By sending out checks, we’re putting money into the economy for people."
Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the minority leader, have instead focused on a $908 billion outline offered by a bipartisan group of moderate lawmakers as a starting point for negotiation.
But that group is struggling to hammer out the details of their compromise, primarily how to structure liability protections for businesses and how much funding to provide for state and local governments, issues that have long impeded an agreement.
“We are still working together on this,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the lawmakers involved in the bipartisan discussions. “The possibilities are there to resolve this and to resolve this in a way that makes sense and gains support.”
A six-page framework of the moderates’ plan, which was obtained by The New York Times, said the group had an “agreement in principle” for providing $160 billion to state and local governments and offering liability protections to businesses and other institutions open during the pandemic “as the basis for good-faith negotiations.” But it omitted any substantive details.
The lack of specifics underscored the remaining hurdles for the group, which has steadily broadened in recent days, as it works to complete its plan. And some senators acknowledged that the success of any final agreement rested with congressional leaders in both chambers who had yet to fully embrace their work.
“I think at the end of the day that has to be largely negotiated between the speaker and the majority leader,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who complimented the group on its progress so far. “If they have a broad base of consensus they can start with, maybe that makes it easier for them to make the final determinations.”
The moderates’ outline would revive the weekly federal unemployment benefit at $300 a week for 16 weeks, from the end of December to April, and extend a series of unemployment programs set to expire at the end of the month. It would supply $10 billion for child care providers, $25 billion in rental assistance, $82 billion for education providers, $6 billion for vaccine development and distribution, and $7 billion for state, local and tribal governments to conduct testing and tracing.
Their plan would repurpose money Mnuchin clawed back from the Federal Reserve and leftover funds in the expired Paycheck Protection Program and allow small businesses to receive another loan from the popular small-business program. It notably does not include another round of stimulus checks, for which some lawmakers — including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo. — have lobbied in recent days.
And while Democratic leaders have called it a starting point for negotiations, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, has not endorsed it. Instead, he suggested Tuesday that Democrats drop their demand for funding for state and local governments in exchange for Republicans dropping their insistence on including a liability shield for businesses, an idea that Democrats immediately rejected.
McConnell slammed Democratic leaders on Wednesday for rejecting both the White House offer and his overture a day earlier, which was his first major concession since efforts to reach agreement on another coronavirus relief deal began.
“At every turn, they have delayed, deflected, moved the goal posts and made the huge number of places where Congress agrees into a hostage of the few places we do not,” he said.
Those involved in drafting the $908 billion framework insisted that there was a deal to be had.
In a lift to negotiators, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which supports liability protections, issued a statement applauding the group’s progress. Neil Bradley, the chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer, said, “While some difficult issues remain, we are confident that there are common-sense compromises that can be found that will enjoy the support necessary to become law.”
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., one of the lawmakers involved in the discussions, rejected the prospect of leaving without a deal.
“We’ll be working around the clock until we solve the liability and worker protection issue,” he said. “That’s really the last remaining hurdle. We have no choice but to get it done.”

LONDON — Britain and the European Union on Wednesday failed to break the deadlock in critical negotiations about a post-Brexit trade deal and, with wide divisions remaining between them, set a new deadline for Sunday to reach a decision on the future of the talks.
A meeting over dinner between Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, ended without significant progress, with large gaps left remaining between the two sides, and no clear path to bridging them.
Wednesday’s three-hour meeting had been set up with the goal of ending months of deadlock in trade negotiations, talks that remained stalled just three weeks before Britain completes the final stage of Brexit, by leaving the European Union’s economic area at the month’s end.
But in a statement von der Leyen said that despite “a lively and interesting discussion” the two sides’ positions “remain far apart.”
“We agreed that the teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues. We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend,” she added.
The announcement of a new Sunday deadline still keeps alive hopes for a final push to strike the elusive trade agreement that many analysts had expected to emerge, theatrically, not long before the Dec. 31 deadline. Discussions will now continue this week on a final deal that could determine the shape of Britain’s relations with continental Europe for decades to come.
But the lack of progress at Wednesday’s dinner is another setback to a negotiation that has been stuck for months.
Economic and political logic suggests that the British prime minister badly needs a deal. But having campaigned for Brexit on the basis of reclaiming national sovereignty, Johnson faces a tough task in reaching any agreement acceptable to both the bloc and Brexit supporters back home.
On Thursday, European Union leaders are set to gather in Brussels with other important issues on their agenda, like the next seven-year budget, the coronavirus recovery fund, the rule of law and possible sanctions on Turkey. European leaders were not planning to discuss Brexit, though von der Leyen is expected to brief them on her talks with Johnson.
Had the Brexit trade discussions collapsed on Wednesday night, the political focus on both sides would have shifted to how to cope with the failure to strike a deal, and how to limit disruption in January when an abrupt switch in the terms of commerce could leave ports blocked and trucks stranded.
But the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, remained upbeat on Wednesday, saying “there is still the chance of an agreement.” She stressed, though, that the European Union would not accept any deal “if there are conditions from the British side that we can’t accept” or that threatens the single market.
Given the complexities and acute political sensitivities around any deal, neither side ahead of the meeting had been raising expectations that a breakthrough would be reached over Wednesday’s dinner of pumpkin soup and — appropriately for negotiators divided over fishing rights — scallops and turbot.
The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has expressed his belief that there will be some “thin” deal, a bare minimum agreement, but that the last hurdles are always the most difficult. “I think the negotiating teams and senior politicians will find a way of getting a deal,” he said, “but at the moment we’re in a difficult place as we try to close it out.”
But even Coveney, who is a good barometer of European sentiment, is becoming more gloomy. He said Monday night, after a meeting of bloc foreign ministers, that the mood was shifting toward preparations for going forward without a deal. There is “a great deal of frustration on the EU side, not just within the EU negotiating team” but “also across member states,” Coveney said.
One outstanding issue was resolved on Tuesday when London dropped a threat to break its withdrawal treaty — and to breach international law — over how it would implement rules on the flow of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.
Yet the main issues that have prevented them from striking a trade deal have remained difficult to resolve: fishing rights, the rules on state subsidies and “level playing field” provisions to ensure fair competition between British and European companies, and the mechanisms to enforce them.
While access to fishing stocks is an extremely contentious political issue for Britain, France and other coastal European nations, the other issues are probably more difficult to resolve, because they touch on the hypersensitive principles of sovereignty.
The biggest gap is over the terms of fair trade, because officials in Brussels fear that, as a large economy on Europe’s doorstep, Britain could adopt lower labor or environmental standards, flood the European market and undercut continental companies.
On this point, Johnson faces a dilemma. Negotiators in Brussels want the right to impose tariffs on imports should Britain diverge from Europe’s standards. Given that Britain says it does not, in general, intend to adopt lower standards, it might never have to confront such a situation. But if Britain fails to strike a trade deal, it would definitely face tariffs.
Rather than a dry and technical trade issue, Johnson sees this as a European attempt to tie Britain to the bloc’s future rule book, trampling the national sovereignty that was at the heart of his vision for Brexit.
Johnson told lawmakers on Wednesday that a good deal was still possible. But he added that if Britain failed to follow future European rules, Brussels wanted the “automatic right to punish us and to retaliate,” adding that no British prime minister should accept such terms.
Hard-liners within his own party have amplified that argument, appealing to him not to compromise in the discussions with von der Leyen.
“The reality is that this is all about sovereignty,” Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative Party and a Brexit enthusiast, wrote in The Daily Telegraph. “From the beginning, it has been clear, whilst the U.K. wants a trade deal, EU wants to control us. Either the U.K. is sovereign or it is not.”
Yet the price of exercising complete sovereignty could be very high. Failure to strike a trade deal could well be exploited by pro-independence campaigners in Scotland, where a majority of voters opposed Brexit in a 2016 referendum. It would also wipe an additional 2% off British economic output while driving up inflation, unemployment and public borrowing, official forecasts said last month.
While European nations would suffer, too, none — with the possible exception of Ireland — would be hit as hard as Britain. Senior French officials, like the Europe minister, Clément Beaune, have said that France is ready to veto an unsatisfactory deal, and Dutch officials have suggested that the European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is coming very close in his negotiations to crossing “the red lines” of his mandate in terms of the allowable concessions to reach a deal.
Merkel stressed the need for Britain to adhere closely to the bloc’s rules on labor, the environment and fair competition, as well as for mechanisms to police any agreement.
“We must have a level playing field not just for today, but we must have one for tomorrow or the day after, and to do this we must have agreements on how one can react if the other changes their legal situation,” Merkel said. “Otherwise there will be unfair competitive conditions that we cannot ask of our companies.”
The Europeans are adamant that the mandate will not change and that Barnier has their confidence. While European nations may have differing priorities, their leaders say that they will not break the solidarity shown so far, and that their formal role will be simply to endorse any deal Barnier can reach — or acknowledge that the talks have failed.
Though Thursday’s meeting was seen as an opportunity for European Union leaders to approve a Brexit trade deal, some analysts believe that an accord could still be agreed and ratified in the last days of the month.
How this gets resolved — to what degree Britain must keep to rules set in Brussels and how to settle any disputes that arise — remains at the heart of the continuing disagreements. But selling any deal that emerges is another matter entirely.

Carnegie Hall Stands By Its Chairman, Despite Tax Violations

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — When Robert F. Smith, the billionaire philanthropist, became the new chairman of Carnegie Hall in 2016, he seemed almost too good to be true.
He promised to be a stabilizing presence at Carnegie after the brief, tumultuous reign of his predecessor. Smith was a benefactor with deep pockets and a strong interest in the hall’s education efforts. He was the rare board leader of color in a field where diversity lags. And he was cheered as a national hero last year when, during his commencement address at Morehouse College, he pledged to pay off the student debt of the entire graduating class.
So it came as a shock this fall when Smith, 58, admitted to having played a supporting role in what federal prosecutors called the largest tax evasion case in U.S. history — acknowledging that he had “willfully failed to report” over $200 million in income — and signed a nonprosecution agreement in which he agreed to pay large fines and cooperate with investigators.
Smith’s admission that he had failed to report a substantial amount of income to the Internal Revenue Service made Carnegie Hall the latest in a line of major cultural institutions that have found themselves facing questions about the actions of the benefactors that they rely on for their very survival. Carnegie’s leaders are standing firmly behind Smith, even as some philanthropy experts question whether he should remain in the position.
“I am a huge fan,” said Sanford Weill, a member of Carnegie’s board who served as its chairman for 29 years. “He has done an outstanding job leading Carnegie Hall. He has been very philanthropic and he has helped grow our institution to reach new heights.”
The news could not have landed at a more difficult moment for Carnegie, the nation’s premiere concert hall, with its stage silenced by the pandemic that has put the classical music industry in crisis. A poster near its locked front doors this fall riffed on the ancient joke — “How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice!” — with a plea for “Patience, patience, patience.”
By way of explanation, Smith has essentially said he is human and he is sorry.
“I can learn from my mistakes. And I have,” Smith — who declined to be interviewed — told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times during DealBook’s recent Online Summit. “It’s clear to me that in order for me to focus on the problems of the present, I need to resolve the issues of the past and problems of the past — and the settlement offered me that ability to do so.
“So I’ve agreed to it,” Smith continued. “I’m moving forward, I’ve made right with the government. And — now I’m absolutely committed to continuing my important work, my philanthropy.”
Carnegie Hall’s board members seem to have accepted Smith’s mea culpa and moved on. “He is beloved,” said Darren Walker the president of the Ford Foundation, who is a Carnegie trustee. “I do not think we should ask for his resignation. And I don’t think you will find anybody on the Carnegie Hall board who disagrees.”
Still, it is not always easy for even preeminent institutions to navigate the intersection of power, extreme wealth and high culture.
The Metropolitan Opera took the name of one prominent benefactor, investor Alberto W. Vilar, off its grand tier in 2003 after some promised pledges failed to materialize; he was later convicted of fraud. L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International, sought a prominent profile in New York’s art world, joining the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art, before being convicted of grand larceny, conspiracy and fraud.
Amid mounting public pressure, the Metropolitan Museum of Art recently felt compelled to swear off money from members of the Sackler family because of their links to OxyContin. And last year Warren B. Kanders was forced to step down as a vice chairman of the Whitney after protests over his company’s sale of tear gas. (He later got out of the tear gas business.)
But many institutions stand by their supporters, even if they bring a trail of bad headlines.
The hedge fund titan Steven A. Cohen, whose SAC Capital Advisors agreed in 2013 to plead guilty to insider trading violations and paid a record $1.8 billion penalty, is on the board of the Museum of Modern Art.
And MoMA has been noticeably silent on whether it is reviewing the status of its chairman, Leon Black, the billionaire private equity executive, who paid at least $50 million to Jeffrey Epstein for financial advice in the years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl.
Smith has admitted to hiding more than $200 million in income and evading millions of dollars in taxes by using an offshore trust structure and offshore bank accounts. In a letter to his investors, Smith said that he had created the structure 20 years ago “at the insistence of my only investor in my first private equity fund.”
The Justice Department said in a news release that Smith had used millions of dollars of the unreported income to “acquire and make improvements to real estate used for his personal benefit,” including buying and renovating a vacation home in Sonoma, California, and buying “two ski properties and a piece of commercial property in France.”
Smith ultimately donated all the money in the offshore trust structure to his foundation, the Fund II Foundation, which he established in 2014, he wrote this fall to his investors. The foundation has made over $250 million dollars in contributions to a broad range of institutions, including Carnegie Hall, as well as to an array of organizations and initiatives that support vulnerable populations.
As part of his agreement with prosecutors, Smith will pay $139 million in taxes and penalties, abandon a $182 million tax refund he had been seeking for charitable contributions, and cooperate with ongoing investigations. The main target of those investigations is Smith’s associate and early investor, Robert T. Brockman, a Houston tech executive who has been charged with hiding $2 billion in income from the IRS in what prosecutors called “the largest ever tax charge against an individual in the United States.”
“Since first learning about the Department of Justice’s investigation, I have cooperated fully for the last four and one-half years and have provided all relevant information to them,” Smith said in the letter to his investors. “The decision made 20 years ago has regrettably led to this turmoil, which has put undue stress and burden on too many.”
Experts in philanthropy said that they believe the donations he made to Carnegie were not likely at risk of having to be returned.
“He reached a plea agreement and paid penalties, so I don’t think there is any exposure,” said Daniel Kurtz, an attorney specializing in nonprofits. “It’s hard to find somebody who’s that wealthy who doesn’t have some issue in the past — I don’t think we make that the measure of the value of their gifts.”
But some experts in philanthropy and corporate governance questioned whether he should remain chairman, including Patricia Illingworth, a professor at Northeastern University and the editor of “Giving Well: The Ethics of Philanthropy.”
“Although he has practiced some thoughtful philanthropy, especially the Morehouse gift, he has also been complicit in a 15-year scheme to avoid paying his fair share of taxes, placing an unjust burden on those who are not in a position to bear it,” she said.
And John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in corporate governance, said that while he thinks Smith should be able to remain on Carnegie’s board, he should give up the chairmanship. He said that “Carnegie is wearing a self-imposed blindfold (probably in the hopes of future donations) when they ignore this.”
Smith took the helm of the Carnegie board after the short and stormy tenure of his immediate predecessor, billionaire Ronald Perelman, who stepped down after clashing with the hall’s leadership. His departure put an end to talks about a new major Perelman gift; soon after he left, he donated $75 million to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.
After Smith arrived, things seemed to calm down on Carnegie’s board.
Clive Gillinson, Carnegie’s long-serving executive and artistic director, said he had “absolute, complete trust” in Smith. “Everybody makes mistakes in life; what matters is how you deal with them,” he said. “And he’s a man of great integrity, that’s everything that I see.”
The reluctance of Carnegie Hall’s board to dethrone Smith is understandable; he is financially generous, gets high marks as a collegial steward, and — named the richest Black man in America by Forbes in 2015 — is the first African American to hold the Carnegie Hall post at a time when the lack of diversity at many cultural organizations has become a pressing issue.
Moreover, good arts leaders are hard to find and increasingly necessary in a time when institutions are struggling through the COVID crisis.
“When you have a wonderful chair who is a good leader and generous, it can be challenging to ask them to depart,” said Michael Kaiser, chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the University of Maryland, who has run several major arts institutions. “Great chairs don’t grow on trees.”
Emily Rafferty, the former president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who is also on the board, called Smith “an extremely effective chairman — unbelievably generous, really aligned with the mission and cause of Carnegie Hall.”
Nevertheless, Kaiser added, Smith’s conduct may give prospective donors pause, “or at least, there will always be the question about whether a new donor wants to engage with the organization and is comfortable with Smith as chairman.”
Smith has been a generous donor. Since 2014, he has given about $40 million to Carnegie, much of which was directed toward education and social impact programs. That money includes $20 million of his personal funds, with the other half coming from Smith’s Fund II Foundation, which helped finance the expansion of Carnegie Hall’s national music education programs.
Smith, who loves music (he named his youngest sons, Hendrix and Legend, after Jimi Hendrix and John Legend), has also supported the Hall’s National Youth Orchestra of the USA; Ensemble Connect, a fellowship program for young professional musicians; and its growing digital activities.
In addition, Smith has made substantial gifts to the National Museum of African American History and Culture; helped restore African American monuments in national parks; supported the Louis Armstrong House Museum in New York; and given $50 million to Cornell’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, which was renamed for him.
Smith — who is based in Austin, Texas, where the private equity firm he founded, Vista Equity Partners, has its headquarters — grew up in Denver, graduated from Cornell and earned his MBA from Columbia.
During the DealBook Summit, he said he was “excited about the opportunity to clean up the past.”
Similarly, Gillinson said he was focused on the future. “Who hasn’t made a mistake in their life? You deal with it in a really good way and move on,” he said. “All I can say is that I’m incredibly lucky to have had him as my partner.”
“Without exception,” Gillinson added, “everybody is 100% behind him.”

By her own admission, Lynn Marchessault was not prepared for the odyssey she embarked on last month.
Seeking to reunite with her husband, an Army staff sergeant stationed at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska, she planned a cross-country, cross-border drive more than 4,000 miles with her two children from her parents’ home in Toccoa, Georgia.
But heavy snowfall made the roads treacherous. Trouble getting a cell signal made navigation a struggle. After five days of driving in whiteout conditions, she was stopped cold by frayed nerves, stranded in British Columbia.
That was when a good Samaritan, a Canadian Armed Forces veteran named Gary Bath, came to her rescue. Bath, 53, drove Marchessault and her children — her son, Payton, 13, and daughter, Rebecca, 10 — as well as her two 11-year-old dogs, Rudy and Arrow, and her 3-year-old cat, Midnight, more than 1,000 miles across British Columbia and the Yukon Territory to the Alaska border.
“I probably should’ve taken a flight,” she said in an interview.
She had set on taking the trip and was intent on sticking to it. But she acknowledged that she could also be “a little bit stubborn.”
“By the time I came to that conclusion,” she said, “it was too late.”
For Bath, what would strike most people an extraordinary gesture was an easy call to make.
“As far as I was concerned, they were stranded and needed help,” he said in an interview. “It’s the human thing to do to help them out. And I was in a position to drive them to the border.”
Marchessault, an Army veteran herself, had been planning the trip for months. By early fall, the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic had pushed her and her husband, Staff Sgt. Timothy Marchessault, to decide that he should reenlist indefinitely to ensure he could provide for their family.
He was stationed at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks.
Once the family decided to join him there, Lynn Marchessault ran into delays renewing her family’s passports and pushed the trip back to November from September. Finally, on Nov. 10, she hitched a U-Haul trailer to her 2019 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup and set out from her parents’ home in northern Georgia.
Things went smoothly enough for the first few days, all the way through North Dakota and into Saskatchewan. At the Canadian border, she was given five days to get to her destination.
It ended up taking her seven.
First, she lost her cell signal, and as the weather got worse, she lost her bearings several times, forcing her to buy a GPS along the way. It was getting colder, and the children didn’t have their thick winter coats. She also hadn’t driven through heavy snow before, and she had the wrong tires for the terrain. But pandemic-related restrictions had prevented her from shipping their belongings to Alaska, she said, leaving her no choice but to press on.
After five days of “white-knuckling” her way across snowy Western Canada, she stopped at a gas station in Wonowon, a small mountain town in British Columbia, and started to break down.
“A woman just happened to come out of the gas station and asked, ‘Are you OK?’” she said.
She wasn’t. She was spent and couldn’t bring herself to drive any farther.
“I guess I was at the point where I needed to talk to somebody,” she said.
The stranger, a paramedic named Teena Sew, generously offered to help. First, she guided Marchessault to a tire shop to have her truck outfitted with winter tires. Then, after leading the family to the Buffalo Inn in neighboring Pink Mountain, Sew reached out on Facebook to veterans she knew. Those friends in turn got in touch with other friends, and eventually word got to Bath.
“A friend of mine had shared someone else’s post on Facebook, saying that they were looking for someone to drive from Pink Mountain to Alaska,” he said. “Everybody was wishing they could help, but nobody was able to do it. We talked, and I said I would take her all the way up there.”
Bath lives with his wife, Selena, in Fort St. John, about 1 1/2 hours from Pink Mountain. A veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces’ Cadet Instructors Cadre, he currently assists with Operation LASER, the CAF’s effort to respond to COVID-19.
“I didn’t even think twice about how I was going to get home,” Bath said. “I just concentrated on driving and getting everyone there safely.”
“Tim was very concerned,” Marchessault said, referring to her husband. “He was not a fan of it at all.”
But after multiple video and phone calls with Gary and their new friends, he eventually relented.
The group spent an entire day making plans and going over concerns. By Nov. 17, the Baths had arrived in Pink Mountain with winter jackets in tow, and the Marchessaults set out, with Bath behind the wheel of their pickup.
“I feel I made the right choice,” Marchessault said. “I needed to make a choice for my children.”
The rest of the trip — more than 1,000 miles over two days — was pleasant and uneventful. She and Bath talked about their families, the military and their shared love of military rations. (“Most people hate them, but we like them,” he said.) One Canadian official at the border crossing at Beaver Creek, Yukon, was stern, but after Marchessault presented a receipt for her new winter tires, she and her children were allowed to cross to reunite with her husband on the Alaska side.
Bath was rewarded for his kindness; the veterans who had come together online to discuss Marchessault’s predicament chipped in money for a flight home to Fort St. John. He and his wife are now honorary members of the Marchessault family.
Marchessault and her family have since settled in North Pole, Alaska, not far from Fort Wainwright. She said she was staying away from cars for the time being.
“I’m refusing to drive in the snow,” she said. “I’m still on strike about that one.”

Texto completo: The claim: President Donald Trump leads Joe Biden in the presidential contest
Joe Biden has secured enough electors to be elected president by the Electoral College — a milestone he reached on Dec. 4, per the New York Times.
Based on certified results, he has 306 electoral votes; 270 are needed to be elected. President Donald Trump has 232 certified electoral votes.
Nonetheless, some conservative websites continue to claim that Trump is in the lead.
On Dec. 3, an electoral vote map on Gateway Pundit that claims to show the "actual results" had Trump at 232 and Biden at 227.
The map excludes results from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, six states in which conservatives have alleged electoral fraud and filed lawsuits to challenge results.
Fact check: Some electoral maps show Trump leading with 232 votes. They're wrong.
The map has not changed since USA TODAY fact-checked it in November.
Gateway Pundit has not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.
All six states have already certified wins for Biden
Joe Biden won all six states that Gateway Pundit left out of its results. They have all already certified their election results, per the Washington Post.
Georgia, certified Nov. 20
In Georgia, Biden won with 2,474,507 votes. That was 12,670 votes more than Trump, who received 2,461,837 votes, per a state website.
Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — both Republicans — certified the results on Nov 20. After a second recount, Raffensperger re-certified the results on Dec. 7.
Michigan, certified Nov. 23
In Michigan, Biden won with 2,804,040 votes. That was 154,188 more votes than Trump, who totaled 2,649,852 votes, per a state website.
The Michigan Board of Canvassers certified the state’s election results on Nov. 23. Of its four board members, three voted in favor of certification, including one Republican.
Nevada, certified Nov. 24
In Nevada, Biden won with 703,486 votes. That was 33,596 more votes than Trump, who garnered 669,890 votes, per a state website.
The Nevada Supreme Court, which has seven members, accepted the state's election results on Nov. 24.
Pennsylvania, certified Nov. 24
In Pennsylvania, Biden won with 3,458,229 votes. That was 80,555 more votes than Trump, who received 3,377,674 votes, per a state website.
Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, certified that Biden won on Nov. 24 after receiving confirmation of presidential vote totals from all 67 counties.
Arizona, certified Nov. 30
In Arizona, Biden won with 1,672,143 votes. That was 10,457 more votes than Trump, who totaled 1,661,686 votes, per a state website.
Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, finalized the state’s results on Nov. 30. She completed the process in the presence of Republicans, including the governor, the state attorney general and the chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court.
Wisconsin, certified Nov. 30
In Wisconsin, Biden won with 1,630,673 votes. That was 20,608 more votes than Trump, who garnered 1,610,065 votes, per a state website.
Democrat Ann Jacobs, the chairwoman of the Wisconsin Election Commission, finished her state’s canvass and certified a win for Biden on Nov. 30.
Fact check: Trump lost the 2020 presidential election
Dozens of legal challenges were filed, but few remain
Dozens of legal challenges were filed by the Trump campaign and its allies. But few remain and experts say they will likely be unsuccessful.
On Dec. 4, a tally of lawsuits by the Associated Press showed that of roughly 50 cases, more than 30 have been rejected or dropped. About 10 are awaiting action.
Just one case has resulted in a victory — a case that challenged the extension of a deadline for some absentee voters to provide missing proof of identification.
Kent Greenfield, a professor at Boston College Law School, told the AP that lawsuits "will continue to be a losing strategy" for Trump.
Already, judges in Georgia and Michigan have harshly rebuked lawsuits asking them to decertify their state's results, per the Washington Post.
In Georgia, Judge James Hatten said that by calling for decertification of results, "the plaintiffs essentially ask for perhaps the most extraordinary relief ever sought in any federal court in connection with an election.”
“They want this court to substitute its judgment for that of two and a half million Georgia voters who voted for Joe Biden,” Batten said, "and this I am unwilling to do.”
In Michigan, U.S. District Judge Linda Parker said that the case from Republicans calling for decertification consisted of “nothing but speculation and conjecture."
"Plaintiffs ask this Court to ignore the orderly statutory scheme established to challenge elections and to ignore the will of millions of voters. This, the Court cannot, and will not, do," she concluded. "The People have spoken."

Our rating: False
Based on our research, the claim that President Donald Trump leads Joe Biden in the presidential contest is FALSE. In its map, Gateway Pundit excludes results from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President-elect Joe Biden won all six states, and all six have certified their results. Though there are about a dozen legal challenges outstanding, judges have so far rebuked calls to decertify election results.

Holidays in a Pandemic? Here’s What Happened in 1918

Not long before Christmas, as the pandemic was taking a devastating toll in rural Iowa, Rebecca Tinti was visiting some neighbors who had fallen ill.
At the family’s farm, she found seven of them, including a newborn baby, bedridden with sickness, leaving a 6-year-old girl to take care of everyone else.
Tinti stepped in to help, but she couldn’t avert tragedy.
“The mister had been waiting on the rest till he had a relapse and kept on getting worse, till he died a week later,” she wrote in a letter dated January 1919. “I stayed till the funeral, which was the day before Christmas.”
Tinti’s letters are now in the hands of her goddaughter’s daughter Ruth M. Lux, 72, of Lidderdale, Iowa. Lux has dozens of old family letters, which were passed down from her mother and her grandmother.
“I call my house the Lidderdale branch of the National Archives,” she said.
Those letters — updates about corn harvests and slaughtered hogs, interspersed with reports of illness and death — are dispatches from the domestic front of a pandemic in which millions of Americans were sickened and 675,000 died, among at least 50 million deaths worldwide. It has been attributed to an H1N1 virus that originated in birds.
That pandemic, like the coronavirus today, seemed to roll across the United States in waves. The winter holidays in 1918 were marked by grievous loss. They came during a relative lull after the deadliest wave, in the fall. Another, smaller surge would peak shortly after New Year’s Day.
But the national conversation around private family gatherings appeared to have been less charged in 1918 than it is today, as many weary from months of restrictions bristle at guidance from health agencies to stay home.
“Hundreds of thousands of people lost loved ones,” said J. Alexander Navarro, a medical historian at the University of Michigan and an editor of the online Influenza Encyclopedia. “But by the time of Thanksgiving, there really wasn’t much debate about whether or not they should get together.”
So they did, often with an empty chair at the table.
At the time, another major event was stealing newspaper headlines: the end of World War I. Soldiers were returning to their homes, and the Allied victory was a cause for celebration.
“This year we have special and moving cause to be grateful and to rejoice,” President Woodrow Wilson said in a Thanksgiving proclamation, which did not mention the pandemic. “God has in His good pleasure given us peace.”
And although soldiers’ domestic and international travels played a major part in spreading the flu, news reports from the time suggest that the risk of infection did not stop people from celebrating the Allied victory in person.
On Christmas Eve 1918, The New York Times reported that thousands of soldiers would be welcomed into homes in New York City and invited to attend dances and feasts. At one event at the 71st Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in Manhattan, “besides the fun and the dancing there will be 300 pounds of chocolate fudge made by pretty girls, and ever so many pounds of iced cake, mostly made by their mothers,” the report said.
Other celebrations were more subdued. For many people in the United States, the Christmas holiday was centered around the home, said Penne L. Restad, a historian with the University of Texas at Austin who is an expert on holidays.
Holiday travel was less common in 1918 than it is today, in part because families tended to live closer together, Restad said. The practice of dragging an evergreen tree indoors to decorate it was in fashion. So were gifts for children, delivered by Santa Claus.
For many, church services were also a part of the holiday season. And in 1918, Lux’s great-grandmother Caroline Schumacher was sad to miss them.
“I suppose you’ve seen that the town is quarantined,” she said in a letter from Carroll, Iowa, dated Dec. 29. “Don’t know how long it will be closed yet. It is terrible when there is no church. It didn’t seem like Christmas at all.”
Because personal letters relayed the details of daily life, they sometimes preserved pieces of history that the newspapers overlooked, Restad said.
“Domestic culture, and to a large degree consumer culture, is often recorded by women,” she added.
Lux’s family letters, some of which are hard to read because of wispy handwriting or irregular spelling and grammar, were transcribed in 2014 by Julia Evans, who was then studying history at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, and now manages museum exhibits.
Newspapers covered the pandemic, too, and reports from across the United States showed a patchwork of officials’ responses to the spread of the influenza.
In Hamilton, Montana, The Ravalli Republican reported that a monthslong, citywide shutdown was lifted in late December 1918 — just in time for churches and movie theaters to open on Christmas Day.
In Lodi, California, “owing to the presence of influenza here, Christmas celebrations have been greatly curtailed, though merchants report a good holiday business,” The Sacramento Bee reported on Christmas Eve. “There will be no municipal tree this year.”
And shortly after Christmas, The Chicago Defender published reports about families who had gathered for family visits or church services across Illinois. The reports were interspersed with notices about people who had fallen ill or died of influenza.
This year, with coronavirus cases rising and health professionals girding for a surge in infections associated with holiday travel, Lux plans to stay home alone on Christmas. But her family letters from a century ago told of gatherings, as well as grave diggings.
“I was for three weeks busy doing the neighbors’ chores and burying the dead,” one relative, John Tinti, wrote in February 1919. “I helped lay away more people this winter than I ever did in all my life. It sure was awful.”
Margaret Hamilton, another relative, wrote that she nearly died herself.
“My heart almost refused to work and my lips and nails were a purplish black,” she said in a March 1919 letter. “Sure almost went over.”
Lux was most impressed with Rebecca Tinti, the great-godmother whose letters told of multiple trips to take care of friends and neighbors who were gravely ill.
“This lady was literally the Florence Nightingale of Adair County,” Lux said.
So on a windy day in April — the same month the global death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 200,000 — Lux traveled about 60 miles from Lidderdale to Casey, Iowa, to see the spot where Tinti was buried almost 90 years ago.
The grave was easy to find, in a small cemetery at the top of a hill.
“I thought, ‘No one has put anything on these graves for decades and decades,’” Lux said.
She laid down a bouquet of silk flowers before driving back home.

In the late 1970s, when I was living in Boston, the record store of choice for classical music fans was the Harvard Coop. It had an extensive catalog and informed salespeople eager to offer invariably strong opinions on which albums to buy. I’d often bump into friends and fellow musicians, all of us flipping through bins of LPs. After making a purchase I’d have to squeeze yet more shelf space out of my cramped apartment, but I was pleased at my growing home library.
Then, in 1982, CDs arrived. Slowly everyone started converting from 12-inch vinyl LPs to 4 1/2-inch plastic CDs in jewel-box cases that required a completely different storage setup. And what were you supposed to do with your old LPs?
Now the cycle has repeated itself, with CD sales dwindling to a fraction of their heights a couple of decades ago. Download and streaming services have taken hold, and physical discs have become obsolete. After all, with everything available online, why clutter up your living space?
This question has taken on newly personal significance as two albums of Virgil Thomson’s music that I made as a pianist in the early 1990s were recently reissued. While a two-CD set is available, online options have immediately made these recordings vastly more accessible than ever before. And bringing attention to some wonderful yet little-known music was the main impetus for the original project.
And yet I can’t imagine giving up my home collection. Yes, finding room in a Manhattan apartment to store ever-increasing numbers of CDs is a constant challenge. In my front hallway and living room I have five wall-affixed cabinets made for me by a carpenter friend, more than 90 feet of shelf space. In my home office I also have an industrial-looking file cabinet that efficiently holds nearly 2,000 CDs. I probably have, in total, more than 4,000 discs. (And I know people who have twice that many!)
And, perhaps out of nostalgia, I still have a stereo cabinet with a long shelf for some old LPs, along with a good turntable in the living room. (Vinyl has been making a comeback over the last decade. And when I’ve popped into stores selling used and just-released LPs, the majority of customers seem to be young people looking for rock and pop albums. Go figure.)
Books have gone digital, too, so we all could certainly clear out our shelves. Yet many of us still love holding real books in our hands and keeping a personal library, however crammed. It means so much to me to have bookcases in my apartment filled with novels I love by Charles Dickens, Theodore Dreiser, Thomas Hardy and Philip Roth; dozens of biographies and histories; a complete edition of Shakespeare’s plays; and a 12-volume 1911 edition of Jane Austen’s works that I found in a used bookstore.
I feel the same about having right at hand the historic 22-disc edition of Stravinsky conducting his own works; the EMI collection of Maria Callas’ recordings of dozens of complete operas, both studio accounts and live performances; big boxed sets of Benjamin Britten, Olivier Messiaen, Franz Liszt and Gyorgy Ligeti; multiple surveys of Beethoven’s 32 piano sonatas, from Artur Schnabel’s influential recordings of the 1930s to young Igor Levit’s recent, extraordinary nine-disc set. At last count, I have 15 complete recordings of Richard Wagner’s “Ring.”
Most of these recordings are available online. But not organized in volumes like archival documents, with extensive notes, essays and information.
And then there is the issue of audio quality. For decades, starting in the 1950s, the demand for ever-improving, more faithful sound was driven by devotees of classical music. Rock and pop fans were quicker to latch on to MP3s and iPods, excited to be able to store hundreds of favorite songs on devices they could put in their pockets and quite ready to sacrifice audio excellence for convenience.
The classical music contingent held out — but not for long. In time, even those choosy collectors decided that being able to listen through earbuds to Bach’s “Brandenburg” Concertos as they jogged in a park, or to Claude Debussy’s “La Mer” as they rode the bus, was worth the trade-off in richness of sound. And, at least at home, it’s possible to hook up your computer or device to high-end stereo component systems or to speakers that rival them.
My system, though very good, is hardly top of the line; I’m not a fervent audiophile. Yet the act of going to a shelf, pulling out a recording of the piece I want to hear and sitting down to listen focuses my attention and enriches the experience.
For a while, my husband, Ben, deferred to me about what was, after all, an essential element of my life’s work. And in earlier days, when he was looking forward to joining me for a concert of Jean Sibelius symphonies or a performance of Giuseppe Verdi’s “Falstaff,” he was quite glad to have my library of recordings available to prep himself. But he has gone 100% Spotify. And even if, at home, he can channel online recordings through a small Flip 5, an external Bluetooth speaker that actually sounds very good, he also loves his earbuds.
Years ago, as my collection kept expanding, Ben reached a breaking point and instituted a household regulation: For every new CD I bring in, I must give up an old one. That’s actually reasonable. And when I leave the giveaways in the lobby, they are usually scooped right up, which suggests to me that many other music lovers also still like physical discs and box sets. Maybe it’s generational. My young critic colleagues at The New York Times have minuscule numbers of actual CDs, they tell me. They stream everything.
If streaming has its shortcomings in terms of compensating artists, it may be better from an environmental standpoint. I’ve always assumed that, as with books, CDs can at least be recycled. But a recent Times story set me straight. CDs can be processed into polycarbonate flakes, with some difficulty. But the global market for this material is fast disappearing. So is my home CD library not just a relic, but also an environmental disaster?
Perhaps there’s a middle ground. Many recordings may reach more listeners, do more good and remain available longer online. But it is worth keeping at home recordings I cherish and albums of archival value, like a six-disc set of Bela Bartok at the piano or Artur Rubinstein’s 82-disc RCA catalog. Perhaps it will suffice for me to read an electronic version of Barack Obama’s new memoir, whereas I am very glad to have a hardcover of my friend Alex Ross’ latest book, “Wagnerism.”
And in truth, now and then, despite Ben’s household rule, I sneak new CDs into the apartment. There are worse habits.

LONDON — As Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain headed to Brussels on Wednesday for critical talks on post-Brexit trade with the European Union, economic logic suggested he badly needs a deal. But having campaigned for Brexit on the basis of reclaiming national sovereignty, Johnson faces a tough task in reaching any agreement acceptable to both the bloc and Brexit supporters back home.
With an endgame fast approaching, Johnson was scheduled to meet with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, over dinner for talks that could determine the shape of Britain’s relations with continental Europe for decades to come.
On Thursday, European Union leaders are set to gather in Brussels with other important issues on their agenda, like the next seven-year budget, the coronavirus recovery fund, the rule of law and possible sanctions on Turkey.
If the Brexit trade discussions go badly Wednesday night, the talk may shift to how to cope with the failure to strike a deal, and how to limit disruption in January when an abrupt switch in the terms of commerce could leave ports blocked and trucks stranded. But the Europeans are agreed that they will not be the ones to pull the plug on negotiations.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, remained upbeat on Wednesday about the trade negotiations, saying “there is still the chance of an agreement.” But she stressed that the European Union would not accept any deal “if there are conditions from the British side that we can’t accept” or that threatens the single market.
A breakthrough over dinner, should it come, would give momentum for a final push to strike the elusive trade agreement that many analysts have expected to emerge, theatrically, not long before the Dec. 31 deadline.
Inevitably, given the acute sensitivities, the signals have been mixed, with both sides stressing the distance that must be traveled to strike an accord.
The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has expressed his belief that there will be some “thin” deal, a bare minimum agreement, but that the last hurdles are always the most difficult. “I think the negotiating teams and senior politicians will find a way of getting a deal,” he said, “but at the moment we’re in a difficult place as we try to close it out.”
But even Coveney, who is a good barometer of European sentiment, is becoming more gloomy. He said Monday night, after a meeting of bloc foreign ministers, that the mood was shifting toward preparations for going forward without a deal. There is “a great deal of frustration on the EU side, not just within the EU negotiating team” but “also across member states,” Coveney said.
One outstanding issue was resolved on Tuesday when London dropped a threat to break its withdrawal treaty — and to breach international law — over how it would implement rules on the flow of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.
Yet, the three main issues that have prevented them from striking a trade deal remain unresolved: fishing rights, the rules on state subsidies and “level playing field” provisions to ensure fair competition between British and European companies, and the mechanisms to enforce them.
While access to fishing stocks is an extremely sensitive political issue for Britain, France and other coastal European nations, the other two issues are probably more difficult to resolve, because they touch on the hypersensitive principles of sovereignty.
The biggest gap is over the terms of fair trade, because officials in Brussels fear that, as a large economy on Europe’s doorstep, Britain could adopt lower labor or environmental standards, flood the European market and undercut continental companies.
But at this point, Johnson faces a dilemma. Negotiators in Brussels want the right to impose tariffs on imports should Britain diverge from Europe’s standards. Given that Britain says it does not, in general, intend to adopt lower standards, it might never have to confront such a situation. But if Britain fails to strike a trade deal it would definitely face tariffs.
Rather than a dry and technical trade issue, Johnson sees this as a European attempt to tie Britain to the bloc’s future rule book, trampling the national sovereignty that was at the heart of his vision for Brexit.
Johnson told lawmakers on Wednesday that a good deal was still possible. But he added that if Britain failed to follow future European rules, Brussels wanted the “automatic right to punish us and to retaliate,” adding that no British prime minister should accept such terms.
Hard-liners within his own party have amplified that argument, appealing to him not to compromise in the discussions with von der Leyen.
“The reality is that this is all about sovereignty,” Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative Party and a Brexit enthusiast, wrote in The Daily Telegraph. “From the beginning, it has been clear, whilst the UK wants a trade deal, EU wants to control us. Either the UK is sovereign or it is not.”
Yet the price of exercising complete sovereignty could be very high. Failure to strike a trade deal could well be exploited by pro-independence campaigners in Scotland, where a majority of voters opposed Brexit in a 2016 referendum. It would also wipe an additional 2% off British economic output while driving up inflation, unemployment and public borrowing, official forecasts said last month.
While European nations would suffer, too, none — with the possible exception of Ireland — would be hit as hard as Britain. Senior French officials, like the Europe minister, Clément Beaune, have said that France is ready to veto an unsatisfactory deal, and Dutch officials have suggested that the European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is coming very close in his negotiations to crossing “the red lines” of his mandate.
Merkel stressed the need for Britain to adhere closely to the bloc’s rules on labor, the environment and fair competition, as well as for mechanisms to police any agreement.
“We must have a level playing field not just for today, but we must have one for tomorrow or the day after, and to do this we must have agreements on how one can react if the other changes their legal situation,” Merkel said. “Otherwise there will be unfair competitive conditions that we cannot ask of our companies.”
The Europeans are adamant that the mandate will not change and that Barnier has their confidence. While European nations may have differing priorities, their leaders say that they will not break the solidarity shown so far, and that their formal role will be simply to endorse any deal Barnier can reach — or acknowledge that the talks have failed.
How this gets resolved — how far Britain must keep to rules set in Brussels and how to settle any disputes that arise — remains at the heart of the continuing disagreements. But selling any deal that emerges is another matter entirely.

SAN FRANCISCO — Wall Street loves a pandemic winner.
Shares of DoorDash soared in their first day of trading Wednesday, capping a year of outsize growth for the country’s largest food delivery company. DoorDash stock rose 86% above its initial public offering price of $102 to close the day at $189.51.
That valued the company at $72 billion, including employee-owned shares — more than the market capitalization of Domino’s Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill combined. DoorDash raised $3.4 billion, making it one of the largest IPO of the year.
Investors piled into the stock despite DoorDash’s deep losses and the intensely competitive market in which it operates. In the week before it went public, DoorDash raised its proposed price range 16% to $92.50 per share at the midpoint before pricing even higher. The pandemic has been a boon to the company, as people turned to delivery services while stuck in their homes.
Tony Xu, chief executive of DoorDash, said the company would try not to “chase the scoreboard” and the stock market hype as a public company. “I recognize the significance of the milestone and the moment, but it is one day on this multidecade journey,” he said.
DoorDash’s listing heralds a banner week of public offerings for technology startups. Airbnb priced its offering Wednesday at $68 a share, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The home rental company had raised its offering price range once, in the face of high demand, and could be valued at $47 billion, far above its $18 billion valuation in the private market this year. It will begin trading Thursday.
The e-commerce startup Wish, the video gaming company Roblox and the real estate startup OpenDoor also plan to list their shares before the end of the year. The events are set to deliver windfalls to the companies’ founders, employees and investors in what is expected to be the busiest year for IPOs since 1999. More than 200 companies valued at more than $50 million have gone public so far this year, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks IPOs.
Many of these companies lose money. Even so, investors have largely given them warm welcomes as they go public. Private investors valued Snowflake, a data warehousing company, at $12 billion before it went public in September. Since then, its valuation has soared to $107 billion.
“It’s been 20-plus years since we’ve seen this many IPOs,” said David Hsu, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania. But he added a cautionary note about the enthusiasm. “At some point, we do have to look at some fundamentals,” he said.
DoorDash’s debut also shows the extreme economic disparities created by the pandemic. Restaurants, struggling to survive government-mandated closures, have increasingly relied on delivery apps like DoorDash to stay in business.
The apps, which dispatch armies of gig workers to pick up and deliver orders, charge fees that some restaurant owners have said are onerous. In many cases, takeout orders have not made up for the lost revenue of indoor dining. Chains including Ruby Tuesday, California Pizza Kitchen and the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese have gone bankrupt this year.
But DoorDash has thrived. In the first nine months of the year, its revenue more than tripled from the same period last year, to $1.92 billion. Orders surged to 543 million through September, compared with 181 million a year earlier.
Before its IPO, DoorDash announced a $200 million pledge to various programs to help restaurants and delivery drivers. It invited a number of restaurant owners and delivery drivers to virtually attend the stock market opening bell ringing and featured them in outdoor marketing campaigns around New York and San Francisco.
Despite its rapid growth, DoorDash is burning cash. It lost $149 million in the first nine months of the year and warned investors that the pandemic-spurred growth was likely to slow down.
Xu said the company would continue to spend money to grow “commensurate with the opportunity.”
Hsu said DoorDash’s “astonishing” valuation made him think investors had overemphasized the effects of the pandemic. “When you get to this market cap level, there are questions about where do you go from here?” he said.
DoorDash recently won a long-fought battle over its use of contract workers. Last month, Californians passed Proposition 22, a ballot measure that exempts DoorDash, Uber, Lyft and others from a state law that would have required them to treat their drivers as employees. The companies are expected to push for similar rules in other states.
DoorDash has grown, in part, by focusing on suburban markets and partnerships with large chain restaurants. Founded in 2013 by Xu, Stanley Tang, Andy Fang and Evan Moore, it survived a ruthlessly competitive market for longer than many of its competitors. This year, two players, Grubhub and Postmates, were acquired by larger rivals.
Through the deal-making, DoorDash has remained independent. It counts 1 million drivers and 18 million customers in the United States, Canada and Australia.
The company has experimented with different business models, including a subscription service, DashPass, which costs $9.99 a month for unlimited deliveries. DashPass has 5 million subscribers.
DoorDash began operating commissary buildings where restaurants can rent space and prepare food specifically for deliveries. It has struck partnerships with grocers, pet food companies and drugstores. The company even invested in Burma Bites, a local restaurateur.
The succession of tech IPOs provides long-awaited returns to venture capital investors. Many of the companies going public are a decade old. Plentiful venture funding has allowed “unicorn” startups, worth $1 billion or more, to put off going public, and with it the pressure to turn a profit, for as long as possible.
Sequoia Capital, which has backed Airbnb, DoorDash, Snowflake and several other sizable startups going public this year, is expected to reap a bonanza. So is Founders Fund, a venture firm that is a large shareholder in Airbnb and Wish. And the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which was bruised by bad bets on the office rental company WeWork and others, could be redeemed by its investments in DoorDash and OpenDoor.

One man left the house after an argument with his wife and walked 280 miles to cool off, breaching Italy’s national curfew.
Another man wandered outside his quarantine room in Taiwan for eight seconds and caught the attention of authorities.
Still another drove 19 miles for a butter chicken curry during a strict lockdown and was apprehended by Australian police.
All those actions ended up costing them thousands of dollars in penalties.
During the global pandemic, with entire cities locked down, travel heavily restricted and isolation fatigue setting in, thousands of people have been caught, fined or jailed for breaching coronavirus restrictions that have made once normal activities taboo.
Some have intentionally broken the rules to make a political statement. Others have claimed they are immune to the disease and from the consequences of breaking those restrictions. Others have simply blundered into breaches because they apparently didn’t understand the rules or were acting in a moment of desperation.
“Everyone is operating in a crazy world where our normal, rational decision-making goes out the window,” said Robert Hoffmann, a professor of economics at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. “A pandemic is a perfect storm.”
Here are a few unusual cases.
Eight Seconds + Six Strides = $3,550
In the port city of Kaohsiung, in the south of Taiwan, a migrant worker from the Philippines was caught on surveillance cameras briefly stepping into the corridor of a hotel while he was under quarantine in November.
The unidentified man wanted to leave something outside the door of a friend, who was quarantining at the same hotel, according to the Central News Agency, the official Taiwanese news agency, citing the health department.
In a video clip that circulated online, the man, wearing shorts and flip-flops, could be seen taking six lumbering strides between his room and that of his neighbor, before turning around.
The breach cost him $3,550.
His behavior, economists say, shows a kind of “optimism bias” — human beings tend to underestimate their chances of getting into trouble.
In the past month, nine foreign workers in Taiwan were caught breaking the rules, local news outlets reported, citing government data.
Taiwan has been lauded for its successful response to the coronavirus, an effort led by Chen Chien-jen, a public health researcher who until May was vice president. But in recent weeks, the island has had a surge in cases, largely imported from Indonesia, prompting it to temporarily bar some migrant workers from entering and crack down on those in quarantine.
While punitive measures like fines act as deterrents, there is a limit to their effectiveness, economists say. Winning cooperation, they added, is a far better defense.
A Long (Long) Way From Home
After a heated argument with his wife, a man in Como, in Italy’s north, stepped outside his house for some air in November. Authorities found him a week later — after he had walked 280 miles south to the coastal town of Fano, breaching a national curfew.
They fined him 400 euros (about $485).
The unidentified man, 48, had walked about 40 miles per day, according to local news reports. Police confirmed his story after contacting authorities in Como, where the man’s wife had reported him missing. He told authorities that he was feeling a little weary but had been given food and water by strangers along the way.
Italians on social media dubbed the man “Forrest Gump,” after the Tom Hanks character in the 1994 film who runs thousands of miles to clear his head.
Some said he deserved the fine, while others expressed relief that the argument ended at that. (Domestic violence rates around the world have soared during the pandemic, studies show.)
Italy, which captured the world’s attention in March when the coronavirus hit, is fighting a second wave that is almost as deadly. The country is also battling a sense of exhaustion and despair.
“People are taking desperate measures; they are overreacting to the stimulus,” said Jelena Kecmanovic, an adjunct professor of psychology at Georgetown University.
Referring to the man in Como, she added that normally, someone might walk around the neighborhood to cool off.
“But now it’s accumulated, accumulated, and he snapped,” she said.
A Party — and a Fine — Fit for a Prince
After Prince Joachim of Belgium landed in Spain in late May, he was supposed to quarantine for 14 days and adhere to the country’s lockdown measures.
He did neither.
The prince, 28, the nephew of King Philippe, instead flew from Madrid to Córdoba to meet his girlfriend. A few days later, the couple went to a house party with more than two dozen people in attendance, local news media reported.
Then he tested positive for the coronavirus.
Spain, which had one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, has fined more than 1 million people for flouting those measures. It did not let the Belgian prince off the hook, handing him a 10,400-euro fine (about $12,630) for breaching the restrictions.
“I would like to apologize for not having respected all the quarantine measures during my trip,” he said in a statement released publicly. “In these difficult moments, I did not mean to offend or disrespect anybody.”
Other public figures, including singer Rita Ora, rapper Cardi B, reality TV star Kim Kardashian and model Kendall Jenner, have drawn criticism for ill-conceived public forays during the pandemic, such as hosting large, mask-less gatherings.
“It’s quite hard to live life that different from the rest of the public and not to start to feel like the rules don’t apply to you,” said Kecmanovic, the psychology professor. But, she added, celebrities could use their power to encourage people to cooperate with the restrictions: “They really have power.”
‘I Just Had a Craving’ for Butter Chicken
In Melbourne, Australia — amid one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in the world — Noel Atkinson, a 48-year-old construction worker, had a yearning in July.
So he drove nearly 20 miles from his home to a downtown Indian restaurant for butter chicken curry. But he did not get the butter chicken. Instead, he got a police fine of $1,230, after they caught him contravening lockdown orders.
“I just had a craving for it,” Atkinson said in an interview. “My mum was born in Ambala,” he added of the city in the north of India. “It reminds me of home.”
As an essential worker, Atkinson had been exempt from most coronavirus restrictions during the day in the state of Victoria. He explained that since he traveled more than twice the distance for work, he had not considered the drive to the city lengthy or realized that he would be in breach of the rules.
“I have to risk my life to go to work, but I can’t risk my own life to get takeaway,” he said. “That’s a bit unfair.”
Before he was identified publicly, Australians tried to hunt down his identity. One restaurant offered to reimburse him for his trouble in curries.
Amit Tuteja, owner of Desi Dhaba, the restaurant where Atkinson had planned to order his curry, said that while he did not condone Atkinson’s actions, “he made a mistake, but I’m pretty sure he just did not know.”
“He’s not the type who’s a freeloader; he’s a hard worker,” he added. “I said to him, ‘Mate, for the next year, you can have as much butter chicken to your heart’s content.’ "

Chris Hurn wasn’t surprised scammers were trying to get government money. An enormous relief effort like the $523 billion Paycheck Protection Program is bound to attract grifters.
As thousands of applications for government-backed loans flooded into his firm, Fountainhead Commercial Capital, it reported at least 500 suspicious cases to federal officials, Hurn said. But what shocked him was the brazen glee of the scammers who got money anyway.
At least a dozen times, “someone tried to defraud us, got turned down and then followed up to taunt us that they got their loan,” said Hurn, Fountainhead’s chief executive.
Four months after the federal government’s signature coronavirus relief program for small businesses expired, investigators and lawmakers have only scratched the surface of schemes that illicitly tapped its forgivable loans. The program’s hastily drafted and frequently revised rules, its removal of normal lending guardrails and governmental pressure to swiftly approve applications created the ideal conditions for thievery to thrive.
“We couldn’t believe how many people were trying to take advantage and game the system,” said Hurn, whose firm made more than 8,000 loans. “A lot of my employees, including me, were a little frustrated with humanity.”
So far, the Justice Department has brought criminal charges against more than 80 people accused of stealing at least $127 million from the relief program, but there’s far more to uncover. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis said it had identified more than $4 billion in potentially improper loans, and some bankers believe the total will be much higher.
A Small Business Administration fraud hotline that took in 742 complaints in 2019 has received more than 100,000 this year. And there are hundreds of active investigations across more than a dozen government agencies, meaning a program that offered borrowers a few months of relief will spark years of court actions.
In more than a dozen interviews, bank executives described the fraudsters’ methods. Many attempts were lazy and unsophisticated, like listing employees who all made the same salary. Others had many employees collecting a monthly paycheck of $8,333, reflecting a $100,000 salary, the largest that a Paycheck Protection Program loan could be used to subsidize.
Fabricated documents were also common: doctored payroll lists, faked business tax returns and modified bank statements. One lender, who asked for anonymity to describe her company’s security measures, used a software tool to detect alterations on PDF files; it flagged thousands of forgeries.
Lenders typically followed up on suspicious applications with emails and phone calls, and the applicants who were angriest about being questioned were the ones most likely to be scammers, bank executives said.
A criminal complaint against a man in Hawaii describes a tactic that several bankers said was common — bluster and threats. The man, Martin Kao, obtained $12.8 million in loans from the program by lying about his company’s head count and payroll, according to prosecutors. When a local bank hesitated to approve his application, Kao barraged its employees with emails, claimed he worked “very closely” with government officials and demanded to know if the bank’s executives were “willing to get onto a call with Congress.”
A few days later, the bank approved his loan. (Kao and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.)
While the loans that have already sparked criminal cases involve allegations of overt wrongdoing, more complicated questions of eligibility or use of funds will also have to be sorted out.
The issue has already come up in lawsuits. In Naples, Florida, a finance executive sued the Grey Oaks Country Club, claiming as part of a broader suit that the club had engaged in fraud by taking a $2.9 million loan. The plaintiff, William Verhelle, lives in a residence at the club and claims Grey Oaks — which charges six-figure initiation dues — violated a rule barring loans to private clubs that limited their memberships for any reason other than capacity.
“I don’t think PPP money was intended for club members to subsidize gourmet dining and spa treatments and golf,” he said in an interview.
The Grey Oaks board said in a statement that it was confident the club met all requirements. “Obtaining the PPP loan allowed Grey Oaks to bring back 60 employees from furlough, in spite of a significant downturn in its business due to COVID,” the board said.
Some fraud was inevitable, experts said.
“Any time the government is pushing out that magnitude of government assistance, in such a short period of time, at such large scale, it’s going to invite criminals and fraudsters and bad guys who are trying to get their hands on it,” said Tom Miller, chief executive of Clearforce, a risk-management technology company.
The Paycheck Protection Program’s standards were purposely low: The application did not require borrowers to show a sales drop or other specific injury. They simply had to affirm that “current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary.”
And the Treasury Department, which gave banks crucial technical guidance about the program just hours before lending began in early April, urged banks to turn loans around within hours.
“You get the money. You’ll get it the same day,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told borrowers the day before lending began.
To entice lenders to participate, the government allowed them to rely on borrowers’ certifications that they were eligible for a loan and had provided accurate information. So the kind of deep vetting that normally accompanies business loans, including otherwise routine eligibility checks, is being done only now. Receiving a loan “doesn’t mean that SBA has made an affirmative declaration that a borrower is eligible or that it will receive loan forgiveness,” the agency said in a fact sheet published this week.
In an analysis for one large unidentified lender on about 131,000 approved or pending loans, Clearforce found 181 that applicants had recent felony convictions — a clear violation of the program’s rules. If that rate held across all of the program’s 5.2 million borrowers, that would mean about $1 billion in improper loans went to felons, Miller said.
Some of the fraud won’t come to light until the middle or end of next year, when most borrowers will reach their deadline to seek forgiveness or start repaying the money. Many scammers will simply default; others may be caught when they file a forgiveness application that is reviewed by both the lender and the government.
Mnuchin pledged to have the SBA audit all loans over $2 million. Late last month, the agency released a questionnaire asking recipients of loans of that size about their 2020 revenue and other questions that seemed aimed at figuring out whether the businesses suffered financial harm because of the pandemic.
Chris Ferris, chief executive officer of Fidelity Bank, a community bank in New Orleans, said that its smaller loans were mostly flying through the forgiveness process but that none over $2 million had yet been approved. An executive at a community bank in the Midwest, who asked for anonymity to discuss his clients’ accounts, said that none of the nine forgiveness applications that his bank had sent in for loans of $2 million or more had been approved yet and that the SBA had asked for additional information on seven of them.
In theory, the government’s guidance on determining eligibility means lenders won’t be penalized for not detecting fraud. But the increased scrutiny has made some nervous that they could be on the hook for bad loans. The SBA has leeway in deciding which loans it will pay off, and that could leave lenders in the lurch.
“We’re concerned that we’re going to get stuck and have trouble getting our money back from the government on some loans,” said Ira Robbins, chief executive of Valley National Bank, which made nearly 13,000 loans.
Concerns about fraud and waste have shadowed talks in Congress about reviving the Paycheck Protection Program. As challenging as the program was, many bankers said they would like to see it restarted so devastated businesses like restaurants and entertainment venues could get a second round of help.
“There’s more fraud associated with unemployment payments, and no one is talking about closing the unemployment program,” Robbins said. “There’s a huge need for more stimulus, and overall, I think the government did a really good job in the speed with which they got this aid out.”

Trump Administration Is Planting Loyalists in Biden Transition Meetings

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — Loyalists to President Donald Trump have blocked transition meetings at some government agencies and are sitting in on discussions at other agencies between career civil servants and President-elect Joe Biden's transition teams, sometimes chilling conversations, several federal officials said.
At the Environmental Protection Agency, political appointees have joined virtually every discussion between career staff members and Biden’s team, monitoring conversations on climate change, scientific research and other topics. At the State Department such drop-ins are happening on what Trump appointees define as an as-needed basis. On Tuesday Biden’s transition team was allowed for the first time into the National Security Agency, but at the United States Agency for Global Media, parent of Voice of America, the Trump-appointed leader is refusing to cooperate with the Biden transition team, two agency officials confirmed.
Presidential transition experts said the presence of political officials at agency handoff meetings was not unheard-of and could even be seen as helpful. President George W. Bush, for example, worked closely in late 2008 with Barack Obama’s incoming team to help calm volatile financial markets. But against a backdrop of Trump’s refusal to concede election defeat, the actions of Trump appointees appeared to be a pernicious effort to slow the transition, some experts said.
“The norm is that the political people are not involved in the nuts and bolts of this,” said Michael Herz, a professor of administrative law at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.
He called the Trump administration’s apparent determination to micromanage the transition process by overseeing meetings part of its broader plan to “milk their authority as long as they can and disrupt the new administration as much as they can.”
Under the Presidential Transition Act, career employees play the primary role in managing the agency transitions, largely because they bring an institutional knowledge about the government functions and have been viewed as unpolitical stewards of the agencies they serve. No clear rules or guidelines, however, detail how the process should unfold.
During the handoff from Obama’s administration to Trump, for example, political officials were explicitly disinvited from transition meetings, said Thomas Burke, who served as EPA science adviser in the Obama administration at the time.
“To me, that’s the equivalent of having the opposing coach sitting in the room as you’re developing your team’s strategy,” he said.
Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who led the Trump administration’s transition for the EPA, agreed that Obama’s political appointees were not present but said he would have liked to meet with them. Regardless, he said, meetings were held in an open-plan office space.
“I assumed that everything we said and the people we were talking to was open to the political people there,” Ebell said. “And they never said ‘we cleaned the room and it has no microphones in it.’”
The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the process. Several people close to the president-elect’s team said that, after taking more than two weeks to begin the formal transition process, the Trump administration’s handover has been fairly smooth and that Biden is loath to disrupt that process by remarking on tensions.
So far, about 40 federal agency review teams have conducted more than 1,000 interviews and meetings, Biden’s transition officials said.
Federal employees who discussed the transition and asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak about the process offered mixed reviews on the presence of political leaders.
Several said they felt the Trump officials were implicitly intimidating employees from speaking openly about issues awaiting the new administration. Others described the meetings as merely awkward.
At the Department of Education, one official said Trump appointees had not crashed briefings but said the written briefing materials given to Biden’s teams “gloss over anything controversial” and described the briefings as “politically influenced.”
At the State Department, Trump’s appointees have insisted that they attend some, but not all, meetings of Biden’s transition team with career employees, according to an official familiar with the process. it was not immediately clear if doing so was seen as broadly intrusive or stifling the discussions at the State Department, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
However, the official said, including the outgoing administration’s appointees in at least some diplomacy discussions was not unheard-of, and that, so far, the State Department personnel had been cooperative in accommodating the Biden team’s requests.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told department officials he was ready to meet with Biden’s transition team, CNN reported last week, and on Monday described the incoming administration as “plenty smart enough.” That was a shift from late November, when he said in a Fox News interview that Biden’s foreign policy advisers “lived in a bit of a fantasy world” when they served during the Obama administration.
This week the Biden team was allowed into the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency after several days of what two people close to the transition described as an effort by newly appointed Trump administration officials at the Pentagon to slow the transition by blocking access to Department of Defense intelligence agencies.
Susan Gough, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said the agency sometimes adds personnel to the list of people with whom Biden’s team requests meetings “so that we have the right subject matter experts present,” but she added, “there is no requirement that all meetings be attended by a political appointee.”
No classified material has yet been given to Biden’s team, and it is not clear if or when that will be made available. Meetings at other intelligence agencies, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, are expected to come later.
On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that Michael Pack, a Trump appointee who oversees the Voice of America and other federally funded news agencies, has declined to make records and personnel available to Biden’s team.
At the EPA, James Hewitt, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed that political leaders were attending meetings and said it was happening with the blessing of Biden’s transition team.
“Associate Deputy Administrator Benevento asked the Biden environmental transition team if political staff could sit in on transition calls so they could provide any information they might have regarding the agency and they obliged,” he said, speaking of Doug Benevento, in a statement. “We have not been made aware that they have had any concerns with the quality of information provided on those calls.”
Lisa Brown, who served as co-director of the EPA review team during the Obama administration, said after enduring weeks of the Trump administration’s effort to slow-walk the transition, the Biden team most likely agreed to the conditions simply to get work underway.
They want to get in and see what they can learn rather than wasting time on a fight, is my guess,” she said.
But Brown described the arrangement as out of the ordinary and worrisome.
“What you have to worry about is the chilling effect on career employees” she said. “You’re going to worry that people are not completely forthcoming, especially when you have a president who still hasn’t conceded.”

No one expects civility from Republican Party

Texto completo: Perhaps you remember the terrible ordeal suffered by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the Red Hen in 2018.
She was awaiting her entree at the Virginia farm-to-table restaurant when the co-owner, appalled by Sanders' defense of Donald Trump's administration, asked her to leave. This happened three days after the homeland security secretary at the time, Kirstjen Nielsen, was yelled at for the administration's family separation policy as she tried to dine at a Mexican restaurant in Washington.
These two insults launched a thousand thumb-suckers about civility. More than one conservative writer warned liberals that the refusal to let Trump officials eat in peace could lead to Trump's reelection. "The political question of the moment," opined Daniel Henninger in The Wall Street Journal, is this: 'Can the Democratic Party control its left?'"
Somehow, though, few are asking the same question of Republicans as Trump devotees terrorize election workers and state officials over the president's relentless lies about voter fraud.
Michigan's secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, described her family's experience this past weekend: "As my 4-year-old son and I were finishing up decorating the house for Christmas on Saturday night, and he was about to sit down to watch 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' dozens of armed individuals stood outside my home shouting obscenities and chanting into bullhorns in the dark of night."
So far, what happened to Benson doesn't appear to be turning into a big cultural moment.
The radically different way the media treats boundary-pushing on the left and on the right is about more than hypocrisy or double standards. It is, rather, an outgrowth of the crisis of democracy that shields the Republican Party from popular rebuke.
Democrats have just won the popular vote in the seventh out of the past eight presidential elections. In the aftermath, analysts have overwhelmingly focused on what Democrats, not Republicans, must do to broaden their appeal.
Republican extremism tends to become a major story only when there are clear electoral consequences for it. Pat Buchanan's demagogic culture war speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention was seen, at the time, as shocking, and elite Republicans later believed it helped George H.W. Bush lose the election. Twenty years later, after Mitt Romney's defeat in 2012, Republicans undertook an "autopsy" and went public with the results of focus groups calling the party "scary," "narrow-minded" and "out of touch."
After that autopsy, Reince Priebus, then the Republican Party chair, called for a more "inclusive" GOP, saying, "Finding common ground with voters will be a top priority."
Trump would prove that wasn't necessary. In 2016, he got a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Romney did four years earlier, but still won the Electoral College. And while widespread revulsion toward Trump was a problem for him this November, down-ticket Republicans performed far better than almost anyone expected.
As a result, the effect of right-wing fanaticism on mainstream public opinion has become a nonissue. It doesn't matter if Joe Biden voters don't like paranoid militants, many of them armed, menacing civil servants. The structure of our politics buffers Republicans from centrist backlash.

Texto completo: How our day at the food pantry hit close to home. Plus, your questions about vaccine distribution, answered.
Hey, hey everybody -- Happy Friday. Our team is on the hunt for new things to watch this weekend, having ripped through "The Queen's Gambit" and "The Undoing" during our days off for Thanksgiving, so email us any recommendations you've got!
After resurfacing from our carbo-induced couch comas, here's what we covered on the show this week. On Monday, we investigated when and how you might get a coronavirus vaccine. On Tuesday and Wednesday, we examined the careers of President-elect Joe Biden's cabinet picks, beginning with Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary, followed by Antony Blinken for Secretary of State. On Thursday, one man shared his story of sexual abuse while in the Boy Scouts, and on Friday, we analyzed President Trump's pre-emptive pardons.
If you're looking for a weekend binge, our Podcast Club recommends "Tom Brown's Body," a true-crime series about the mysterious disappearance of one teenage boy in Texas. And for a little delight, here's a video of the host Michael Barbaro responding to Sho Shibuya's artwork of The Daily.
A reporter's diary from a food pantry
In last Wednesday's episode , Nikita Stewart, who covers social services for The New York Times, took us through a day at a food pantry in Brooklyn. She introduced us to some of the food bank's many clients: an unemployed single mother with a baby on the way, a teenage boy whose parents had been laid off from work and a woman hoping to collect healthy food for her children.
Moved by the familiarity of their experiences, Nikita decided to join the chorus of diverse voices by sharing her own story in the episode:
I enjoy the anonymity of journalism. We write the story. We report the story. We are not the story. But I'm a human being with feelings and experiences that inform my reporting. My emotions and memories of the way my family went in and out of poverty spilled over in a recent episode of The Daily.
On a Friday in September, I stood outside a food pantry operated by Council of Peoples Organization, or COPO, with the producers Stella Tan and Annie Brown. The line for food stretched around the block in Midwood, Brooklyn, and people had positioned carts on the ground overnight to save their places in line.
I had seen lines like that before. I'd spoken in the past to plenty of people who use pantries. But that day, we met a woman who told us it was easier to be in the line because she was wearing a mask, and no one would recognize her. She said she was also comforted by the length of the line -- evidence she was not alone.
Turning away, I lost it right there, happy to have been wearing glasses to hide the tears welling in my eyes.
Later, as I recounted the day with Stella and Austin Mitchell, another producer, I offhandedly talked about my experience with food insecurity as a child. They asked me, though not wanting to push, if I would be willing to share my thoughts with listeners.
I was torn. As I said, I don't like to make myself the story. But then I remembered the time I'd spent with a troop of Girl Scouts. For more than a year, I worked on a book about Troop 6000, formed in a homeless shelter in Queens. I asked the Scouts, their troop leaders and their parents to share intimate details about themselves at the most difficult times in their lives. I also watched girls evolve from being ashamed about their homelessness to openly explaining the obstacles and injustices of poverty.
Couldn't I, shouldn't I, do the same?
Ultimately, I decided to share my stories of food stamps, free lunch and food insecurity. As I said in the episode, if we all keep this secret of poverty, past or present, it creates a stigma where there shouldn't be one. If we talk openly, we can do something about it.
Answering your questions about the vaccine rollout
Many of you wrote in with questions after Monday's episode on vaccine distribution . So we decided to check back in with Carl Zimmer, a Times science reporter whom you may remember from our kids' episode on the coronavirus . In that episode, he offered answers to many of your concerns. Below, he does it again:
Q: How long is vaccine-induced immunity to the coronavirus expected to last?
Carl: We don't know yet because this disease is still so new. People who have recovered from Covid-19 appear to keep having a strong immune response against the virus months later, suggesting immunity might last years. Vaccine immunity would most likely do the same. So we might need just one vaccination, we might need a booster later or we might need seasonal shots as we do for the flu. We just don't know which yet.
Q: What's the status of vaccines being developed outside the U.S.?
Carl: The New York Times's coronavirus vaccine tracker has all of the information we know of about vaccine projects worldwide. There are 58 vaccines in clinical trials around the world, in countries including Thailand, Italy, India, Japan and Australia. China alone has five late-stage clinical trials, some of which should be delivering efficacy data soon.
Q: To what extent will children be vaccinated? Have they been included in any clinical trials?
Carl: Trials for children are beginning. Pfizer has started one for kids as young as 12, and other companies are moving to start their own. They should take a few months to deliver results.
Q: If you've already had Covid-19, do you need the vaccine? Where does this group rank in the distribution timetable?
Carl: Those are great questions. Government health officials will have to make a decision about those issues. Clinical trials did not exclude people who already had the virus, so researchers will be able to look at their outcomes to see if it's safe and effective in them, too.

Texto completo: MinnPost provides updates on coronavirus in Minnesota Sunday through Friday. The information is published following a press phone call with members of the Walz administration or after the release of daily COVID-19 figures by the Minnesota Department of Health.
Here are the latest updates from December 8, 2020:
* 359,203 cases; 4,027 deaths
* Walz to detail vaccine rollout plan
* Minnesota refuses to send data to feds on who takes vaccine
359,203 cases; 4,027 deaths
Twenty-two more Minnesotans have died of COVID-19, the Minnesota Department of Health said Tuesday, for a total of 4,027.
Of the people whose deaths were announced Tuesday, one was over 100 years old, five were in their 90s, eight were in their 80s, five were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and one was in their 50s. Fifteen of the 22 people whose deaths announced Tuesday were residents of long-term care facilities.
The state has reported 434 deaths in December, making it the third deadliest month of the pandemic after just eight days. There were 696 deaths reported in May and 1,136 deaths reported in November.
MDH also said Tuesday there have been 359,203 total cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota. That number is up 3,051 from the total announced on Monday and is based on 27,432 new tests. The seven-day positive case average, which lags by a week, is 13 percent. After a recent stretch of decline, the seven-day case average has been rising again. Health officials say a rate higher than 5 percent is a concerning sign of disease spread.
The most recent data available show 359 Minnesotans are hospitalized in intensive care with COVID-19, and 1,245 are in the hospital with COVID-19 not in intensive care. You can find more information about Minnesota’s current ICU usage and capacity here.
More information on cases can be found here.
Walz to detail vaccine rollout plan
Update (5:24 p.m.): State officials estimated on Tuesday that Minnesota would get enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for 183,400 people in the first month of vaccine administration. Top priority for first doses of a vaccine will go to people working in COVID-19 units in hospitals, intensive care units, emergency departments and COVID-19 urgent care clinics, plus people who are living or working in nursing homes, COVID-19 testers and people who dole out vaccines.
Read more about the full vaccine distribution plan here.
As the federal government inches closer to approving COVID-19 vaccines, Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday afternoon will outline Minnesota’s plan for distributing them.
Workers in health care and at long-term care facilities are likely to be a top priority for vaccination, along with those in populations vulnerable to severe cases of COVID-19, such as the elderly.
The governor will be joined by state legislative leaders at 1:30 p.m. news conference and then will do a media call afterward for Greater Minnesota press with the mayors of Duluth, Luverne, Rochester and Moorhead.
NBC News reported Tuesday morning the Food and Drug Administration says Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine offers partial protection after one dose and close to full protection after two doses. The FDA gave the vaccine a good safety review, too. Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group, told the news outlet he could “see absolutely no reason why this emergency use authorization would not be granted.”
Minnesota refuses to let feds know who has taken vaccine
State health officials won’t report personal patient information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that can identify who has been vaccinated for COVID-19, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.
The Times says the Trump administration is requiring states to give personal data such as names, birth dates, ethnicities and addresses of those who are vaccinated in part to ensure people who travel across state lines get a second dose of the vaccine. Some states, however, are refusing.
Such information has been tracked at the state level and the idea of a federal vaccine registry has raised privacy concerns. Minnesota plans to report “de-identified doses-administered data,” Minnesota Department of Health spokesman Doug Schultz told the Times. “We will not be reporting name, ZIP code, race, ethnicity or address,” Schultz said.

Ross Douthat: The Biden opportunity and how to blow it

Texto completo: In many ways Joe Biden will enter the presidency in a politically enviable position. The arrival of the coronavirus vaccine means that, after running as the candidate of normalcy, he is poised to preside over its literal return, which could include not just economic recovery but also a period of personal exuberance — at last, restaurants! amusement parks! vacations! — that will feel much more euphoric than the post-financial-crisis grind did under Barack Obama 12 years ago.
At the same time, the fact that Biden did not lead his party to a landslide will also give him certain political advantages. He will not be permitted to reenact the New Deal or the Great Society, but neither will he be tempted into ideologically driven debacles like Bill Clinton’s failed health care push or even Donald Trump’s failed attempt to repeal Obamacare. Having Joe Manchin and Susan Collins as the most powerful figures in the Senate will not be good for progressivism’s policy objectives, but it could be very good for Biden’s popularity, enabling him to chart a moderate course while telling the left, sorry, but my hands are tied.
In the best-case scenario for Biden, the Trumpian voter-fraud narrative could set in motion a Tea Party redux on the right, with fringe characters and Trump loyalists successfully primarying established GOP figures — but without the high-unemployment economy and the Obamacare fight that enabled the Tea Party Republicans to take the House in 2010. Instead, a radicalized Republican Party campaigning on a supposedly stolen election while the Democrats campaign on prosperity and normalcy could set up the rare midterm scenario in which an incumbent president’s party actually picks up seats.
If you want to know how the Biden administration could blow this opportunity, though, look no further than his just-announced choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra.
No Cabinet agency is likely to be as prominent as HHS during the first year of the Biden presidency, given the upcoming vaccine rollout and the slow unwinding of public-health restrictions. And for a campaign that placed so much emphasis on the idea that disinterested expertise and capital-S Science should guide the coronavirus response, Becerra is a peculiar choice: a partisan politician from a deep-blue state whose health care experience is mostly in legal battles with the Trump White House over Obamacare, rather than in health policy or medicine itself.
Of course Cabinet secretaries are often party hacks, but even Trump chose a physician and then a pharmaceutical executive for the HHS post, and it’s especially odd — as The New York Times story on the selection notes — to pick a partisan at a moment when so many medical groups were urging the Biden administration to elevate doctors and other acknowledged experts to lead pandemic-era policy.
It’s less odd, though, if you anticipate using your Cabinet agencies the way the Obama White House did in its otherwise-gridlocked second term — as aggressive instruments of partisan policymaking, especially on culture-war issues where Congress is particularly loath to act.
Under Obama, this strategy encompassed everything from his attempted immigration amnesties and gun-control executive orders to his Education Department’s interventions in college sexual-assault policies and school-bathroom regulations to the long-running attempt by HHS to force religious employers like the Little Sisters of the Poor to cover contraception and morning-after drugs.
It was inevitable that a Biden administration would pick up some of these threads. But Becerra is the pick you make if you intend to pursue a lot of them, since that’s where his qualifications lie — as a partisan warrior on issues like guns and immigration and as an abortion-rights maximalist who has used his attorney general’s office to sue the Little Sisters of the Poor after a Supreme Court decision in their favor and to pursue felony convictions against the pro-life filmmakers who made undercover videos of Planned Parenthood executives talking about the sale of fetal body parts. (That prosecutorial push was denounced for “disturbing overreach” by the Los Angeles Times editorial page, which is not exactly noted for its pro-life sympathies.)
As John McCormack of National Review puts it, to understand how social conservatives feel about Becerra, imagine if a Republican president elected on a promise to heal partisan wounds and deal with a pandemic nominated Rick Santorum as his first secretary of Health and Human Services.
Now most Americans aren’t social conservatives, and Becerra will have media and Democratic establishment support in many of the fights he might pick. But Biden won the presidency in part because he was more popular than his party (to say nothing of the press), and deploying his bureaucracy aggressively for liberal ends would be the easiest way for him to squander some of that advantage.
Especially since America doesn’t have a conservative coalition these days so much as it has an anti-liberal one, with different groups united by their anxieties about different aspects of a consolidated progressive agenda. That means that liberals can be deceived by polls even when they’re accurate, because they seem to show that on issue X or Y or Z, the liberal position is popular — while eliding the fact that the full spectrum of liberal policies activates intense anxiety and opposition in multiple different highly motivated groups.
A Democratic presidency that genuinely tried to address some of those fears, at a time when the economy is recovering and the GOP could be going Trumpishly insane, might consolidate and expand the victory that Biden just won. But a Becerra-fied Democratic presidency, in which the bureaucracy is using “public health” as an excuse to battle gun owners one week and Catholic hospitals the next, will be successful only in keeping the conservative coalition united, loyal and activated.
One of Biden’s greatest strengths as a politician in a polarized era is that he remembers a time when an ideological liberalism led Democrats into sweeping electoral defeats. Becerra, like Kamala Harris, has a very different background: He comes from California, a state where demographics and a hapless opposition have delivered the Democrats a near-permanent majority — meaning that their leaders have few incentives to compromise with or reassure right-leaning voters, and little experience even attempting that feat.
The tension between those two experiences, and the political attitudes they forge, was always destined to run through a Biden administration. But Becerra’s nomination is an early sign of how the conciliation that succeeded for Biden on the campaign trail might be abandoned and a great political opportunity thrown away.

Texto completo: I still remember exactly where I was sitting decades ago, during the short film shown in class: For a few painful minutes, we watched a woman talking mechanically, raspily through a hole in her throat, pausing occasionally to gasp for air.
The public service message: This is what can happen if you smoke.
I had nightmares about that ad, which today would most likely be tagged with a trigger warning or deemed unsuitable for children. But it was supremely effective: I never started smoking and doubt that few if any of my horrified classmates did either.
When the government required television and radio stations to give $75 million in free airtime for antismoking ads between 1967 and 1970 — many of them terrifyingly graphic — smoking rates plummeted. Since then, numerous smoking “scare” campaigns have proved successful. Some even featured celebrities, like Yul Brynner’s posthumous offering with a warning after he died from lung cancer: “Now that I’m gone, don’t smoke, whatever you do, just don’t smoke.”
As the United States faces out-of-control spikes from COVID-19, with people refusing to take recommended, often even mandated, precautions, our public health announcements from governments, medical groups and health care companies feel lame compared to the urgency of the moment. A mix of clever catchphrases, scientific information and calls to civic duty, they are virtuous and profoundly dull.
The Centers for Diseases Control urges people to wear masks in videos that feature scientists and doctors talking about wanting to send kids safely to school or protecting freedom.
Quest Diagnostics made a video featuring people washing their hands, talking on the phone, playing checkers. The message: “Come together by spending time apart.”
As cases were mounting in September, the Michigan government produced videos with the exhortation, “Spread Hope, Not COVID,” urging Michiganders to put on a mask “for your community and country.”
Forget that. Mister Rogers-type nice isn’t working in many parts of the country. It’s time to make people scared and uncomfortable. It’s time for some sharp, focused terrifying realism.
“Fear appeals can be very effective,” said Jay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University, who co-authored a paper in Nature about how social science could support COVID response efforts. (They may not be needed as much in places like New York, he noted, where people experienced the constant sirens and the makeshift hospitals.)
I’m not talking fear-mongering, but showing in a straightforward and graphic way what can happen with the virus.
From what I could find, the state of California came close to showing the urgency: a soft-focus video of a person on a ventilator, featuring the sound of a breathing machine, but not a face. It exhorted people to wear a mask for their friends, moms and grandpas.
But maybe we need a PSA featuring someone actually on a ventilator in the hospital. You might see that person “bucking the vent” — bodies naturally rebel against the machine forcing pressurized oxygen into the lungs, which is why patients are typically sedated.
(Because I had witnessed this suffering as a practicing doctor, I was always upfront about the trauma with loved ones of terminally ill patients when they were trying to decide whether to consent to a relative being put on a ventilator. It sounds as easy as hooking someone to an IV. It’s not.)
Another message could feature a patient lying in an ICU bed, immobile, tubes in the groin, with a mask delivering 100 percent oxygen over the mouth and nose — eyes wide with fear, watching the saturation numbers rise and dip on the monitor over the bed.
Maybe some PSAs should feature a so-called COVID long hauler, the 5 percent to 10 percent of people for whom recovery takes months. Perhaps a professional athlete like the National Football League’s Ryquell Armstead, 24, who has been in and out of the hospital with serious lung issues and missed the season.
These PSAs might sound harsh, but they might overcome our natural denial.
“One consistent research finding is that even when people see and understand risks, they underestimate the risks to themselves,” Van Bavel said. Graphs, statistics and reasonable explanations don’t do it. They haven’t done it.
Only after Chris Christie, an adviser to President Trump, experienced COVID, did he start preaching about mask-wearing: “When you have seven days in isolation in an ICU though, you have time to do a lot of thinking,” Christie said, suggesting that people, “follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others.”
We hear from many who resist taking precautions. They say, “I know someone who had it and it’s not so bad.” Or, “It’s just like the flu.”
Sure, most longtime smokers don’t end up with lung cancer — or tethered to an oxygen tank — either. (That, in fact, was the justification of smokers like my father, whose two-pack-a-day habit contributed to his death at 47 of a heart attack.)
These new ads will seem hard to watch. “We live in a Pixar era,” Van Bavel reflected, with traditional fairy tales now stripped of their gore and violence.
But studies have shown that emotional ads featuring personal stories about the effects of smoking were the most effective at persuading folks to quit. And quitting smoking is much harder than social-distancing and mask-wearing.
Once a vaccine has proved successful and enough people are vaccinated, the pandemic may well be in the rearview mirror. In the meantime, the creators of public health messaging should stop favoring the cute, warm and dull. And — at least sometimes — scare you.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s continuing attempts to overturn an election he lost decisively more than a month ago is, like so much of what he’s done in office, shocking but not surprising. Who imagined that he would go quietly?
What some people may not have been fully prepared for is the way Trump’s party as a whole has backed his dangerous delusions. According to a survey by The Washington Post, only 27 Republican members of Congress are willing to say that Joe Biden won. Despite the complete lack of evidence of significant fraud, two-thirds of self-identified Republicans said in a Reuters/Ipsos poll that the election was rigged.
But you really shouldn’t be surprised by this willingness to indulge malicious, democracy-endangering lies. After all, when was the last time Republicans accepted a politically inconvenient fact? It has been clear for years that the modern GOP is a party that can’t handle the truth.
Most obviously, Republican refusal to accept the election results follows months of refusal to acknowledge the dangers of the coronavirus, even as COVID-19 has become the nation’s leading cause of death, and even as a startling number of people in Trump’s orbit have been infected.
Sure enough, virus denial and vote denial converged almost perfectly Saturday, when Trump addressed a large, mostly unmasked crowd in Georgia — creating a potential superspreader event — and demanded that the governor overturn the state’s election results. The next day Rudy Giuliani, who has been directing Trump’s efforts to cling to office, was hospitalized with the virus.
The thing is, Republican rejection of reality didn’t start in 2020, or even with the Trump era. Climate change denial — including claims that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by an international cabal of scientists — has been a badge of partisan identity for many years. Crazy conspiracy theories about the Clintons were mainstream on the right through much of the 1990s.
And one half-forgotten episode in particular seems to me to have foreshadowed much of what we’re seeing right now: Republican reactions to the mostly successful introduction of Obamacare.
The Affordable Care Act went into full effect in 2014, amid dire predictions by Republicans. The act, they claimed, would drive insurance premiums sky-high, fail to reduce the number of uninsured, and have a devastating effect on employment.
None of that happened. Instead, millions of Americans gained health insurance coverage. Job creation continued, with 3 million jobs added in the year following the ACA’s implementation. Obamacare may have fallen somewhat short of its sponsors’ hopes (although nobody expected it to yield universal coverage), but from the beginning it helped many Americans, and was nothing like the disaster opponents predicted.
As far as I can tell, however, no prominent Republican was willing to admit that the party’s apocalyptic warnings had been proved false, let alone talk about why they were wrong. Nor, of course, did Republicans make any effort to come up with a better health plan. (It has been almost 11 years since Obamacare was signed into law, and we’re still waiting.) Instead, party leaders simply pretended that the promised catastrophe had, in fact, materialized.
For example, John Boehner, the speaker of the House at the time, insisted that there had been a “net loss” of people with health insurance. After that 3 million-job gain, Jeb Bush (remember him?) insisted that Obamacare was “the greatest job suppressor in the so-called recovery.”
And in a move that prefigured the Trump team’s desperate attempts to find evidence for election fraud, right-wing groups went in search of health care horror stories, tales of ordinary Americans devastated by Obamacare.
To be fair, while there is no evidence of significant electoral fraud, some people really were hurt by health reform — mainly young, healthy individuals who previously had cheap policies and made too much money to be eligible for subsidies. But these weren’t the victims Republicans were looking for. Instead, they peddled tales of older, working-class Americans who supposedly had lost access to affordable insurance.
None of these tales stood up to scrutiny. But that didn’t matter to the GOP. As I wrote at the time, Republicans had already — pre-Trump — entered the era of post-truth politics.
Now, there’s obviously a big difference in immediate impact between refusing to accept evidence that contradicts your policy preconceptions and refusing to accept the results of an election. But the mindset is the same.
The point is that once a party gets into the habit of rejecting facts it doesn’t want to hear, one fact it’s bound to reject sooner or later is the fact that it lost an election. In that sense there’s a straight line from, say, the Republican embrace of climate denial to the party’s willingness to go along with Trump’s attempts to retain power.
And the Republican Party’s previous history of dealing with inconvenient reality gives us a pretty good idea about when it will accept Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2020 election — namely, never.

ARTISTS CALL OUT ARCHITECTS PAST

Texto completo: Philip Johnson was one of the most influential architects of the past century, chameleonic in each of his roles as a New York power broker, art collector and creator of his "Glass House," a celebrated landmark of modernist design in Connecticut.
He also championed racist and white supremacist viewpoints in his younger years. Johnson's Nazi sympathies, for example, have been well documented, and he spent the years after World War II trying to distance himself from them.
Now a group of more than 30 prominent artists, architects and academics are casting a light on the more unsavory part of Johnson's legacy, demanding in a letter published online Nov. 27 that institutions such as the Museum of Modem Art and the Harvard Graduate School of Design remove the name of the architect, who died in 2005, from their spaces.
"There is a role for Johnson's architectural work in archives and historic preservation," the Johnson Study Group, a largely anonymous group of designers and architects, wrote in the letter. "However, naming titles and spaces inevitably suggests that the honoree is a model for curators, administrators, students and others who participate in these institutions."
The letter was signed by contemporary artist Xaviera Simmons; the landscape architect and MacArthur fellow Kate Orff; and V. Mitch McEwen, an assistant professor of architecture at Princeton University, who is among eight of the 10 architects in an upcoming exhibition at MoMA - "Reconstructions: Architecture and Blackness in America" - that is slated to open Feb. 20.
It cites Johnson's "widely documented" advocacy for white supremacist views, his attempt to found a fascist party in Louisiana, and failure to include work by a single Black artist or designer in MoMA's collection during his tenure there. (He served in various roles over six decades.) The letter called on any institutions using his name to remove it.
"He not only acquiesced in but added to the persistent practice of racism in the field of architecture," the letter said, "a legacy that continues to do harm today."
Johnson's name has been on one of the exhibition galleries at the Museum of Modern Art, where he served as its first head of architecture and design, since 1984. His name is also included in the title of the museum's chief curator of architecture and design.
Johnson created buildings that are widely considered architectural masterpieces of the 20th century, among them the MoMA sculpture garden and the pavilion that houses pre-Columbian art at the Dumbarton Oaks estate in Washington. New York Times critic Paul Goldberger praised him as American architecture's "godfather, gadfly, scholar, patron, critic, curator, and cheerleader" in his obituary.
But in his younger years, he openly admired Hitler's manifesto, "Mein Kampf," attended Nazi rallies in Germany and was investigated by the FBI for his connections to the Nazi party. He rejected Nazism after the end of World War II.
Representatives from MoMA and Harvard did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Orff, the landscape architect and MacArthur fellow, said in an email Thursday that removing Johnson's name from the gallery and the curator position would represent a significant step in dismantling racism in design culture.
"Landscape architecture is catching up in its assessment of its own legacy," Orff said. "To move forward with a more imaginative, just, and equitable culture in the design fields, we have to reckon with past figures who set the ground rules."

White House Offers $916 Billion Stimulus Proposal as Talks Intensify

WASHINGTON — Jump-starting negotiations with days to spare, the White House on Tuesday offered Democrats a $916 billion pandemic stimulus proposal that would meet their demand to provide some relief to state and local governments and include liability protections for businesses that have been a top priority of Republicans.
The offer from Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, to Speaker Nancy Pelosi was the first time since November’s elections that the Trump administration had engaged directly in talks on Capitol Hill about how to prop up the nation’s flagging economy. It came as lawmakers raced to reach a deal on another round of coronavirus relief before they conclude this year’s session, expected to happen next week.
The plan does not include a proposed revival of $300 weekly enhanced unemployment benefits, although it would extend other federal unemployment programs set to expire in the coming weeks. Instead, it would include another, smaller round of direct payments to Americans, amounting to $600 per person.
The original $2.2 trillion stimulus law enacted in March distributed a round of $1,200 stimulus checks and established the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week through July, which President Donald Trump later extended at $300 a week for most workers. The proposal put forward by Mnuchin would not address the lapsed benefit and would halve the one-time payment.
“The president’s proposal must not be allowed to obstruct the bipartisan congressional talks that are underway,” Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a statement, calling the cuts to unemployment insurance benefits from a proposed $180 billion to $40 billion “unacceptable.”
In a statement issued after his conversation with the speaker Tuesday, Mnuchin offered little detail other than his intent to offset the cost of the package in part by repurposing $429 billion in funds from earlier legislation and using unspent funds from a popular federal program for small businesses that lapsed this year.
The proposal emerged as a bipartisan group of moderate lawmakers was meeting virtually to work toward an agreement on the details of its $908 billion compromise plan. It was unclear how Mnuchin’s proposal would affect discussions on that package, which Democratic leaders Tuesday said “are the best hope for a bipartisan solution.”
The two provisions Mnuchin singled out as part of his offer — what he called “robust” liability protections for businesses, schools and hospitals, and funds for state and local governments — have been the largest sticking points in efforts to reach a compromise.
The administration’s proposal also included funds for vaccine distribution and the revival of the Paycheck Protection Program, the small-business loan program.
“It’s a very good offer,” said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the minority leader, who, along with Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, was briefed on the plan by Mnuchin and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff. “It focuses on the things that need to be there.”
Earlier Tuesday, McConnell signaled openness to a deal, floating the possibility of removing both the liability provision and funding for state and local governments. He argued that dropping both parties’ top priorities could smooth the way for a narrower deal with funding for vaccine distribution, schools and small businesses.
“We know the new administration is going to be asking for another package,” McConnell said Tuesday, offering an implicit acknowledgment of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. “What I recommend is we set aside liability, and set aside state and local, and pass those things that we agree on, knowing full well we’ll be back at this after the first of the year.”
The idea amounted to the first significant concession in months from McConnell, who had previously called the legal protections a “red line” in stimulus talks. But Democrats scoffed at it, after months of insisting that any stimulus agreement include funds to bolster state and local governments that have lost hundreds of billions of dollars during the pandemic and are facing devastating budget cuts. Republicans have branded the provision a “blue-state bailout,” although state officials in both parties have lobbied for additional relief.
“He’s sabotaging good-faith bipartisan negotiations because his partisan ideological effort is not getting a good reception,” Schumer said. In her own statement, Pelosi declared that “Leader McConnell’s efforts to undermine good-faith, bipartisan negotiations are appalling.”
Schumer said Democrats’ proposals for funding state and local governments had “broad bipartisan support,” unlike McConnell’s liability proposal. The measure would provide five years of legal protection from coronavirus-related lawsuits for businesses, schools, hospitals and nonprofit organizations that make “reasonable efforts” to comply with government standards.
But many Democrats have rejected what Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., derided as “a get-out-of-jail-free card to companies that put the lives of their workers and customers at risk.” And while McConnell has warned of a wave of lawsuits related to the pandemic, economic data shows that there have been only a relatively small number so far.
The bipartisan group of lawmakers is discussing liability protections in its outline of the $908 billion compromise, as well as how to allocate $160 billion set aside for state and local governments. But after unveiling an outline this month, the group has not yet completed text.
“I hope that we can come up with an agreement,” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters when asked about McConnell’s suggestion. “If we can’t, then I see a certain logic in passing what we do agree with, given that there’s widespread support for another round of PPP, helping our schools, our health care providers, providing more money for testing and vaccine distribution.”
Leaders of both parties have agreed that some form of relief needs to be approved before Congress departs at the end of the year, and to work toward attaching it to a catchall government spending package. Lawmakers and aides are still working to resolve a number of issues in the dozen must-pass bills that would keep the government fully funded.
Both chambers are expected to approve a one-week stopgap bill in the coming days to avert a government shutdown Friday and buy additional time for negotiators.

¿Qué pasaría si expiran los beneficios de la Ley CARES y no hay una nueva ley de ayuda económica ni cheque de estímulo aprobado?

Texto completo: El Congreso se acerca a un nuevo proyecto de ley de estímulo a pesar que las negociaciones entre republicanos y demócratas han sufrido retrasos por parte de un grupo de senadores que se oponen a ciertos aspectos del paquete de ayuda de $908,000 millones de dólares que se encuentra sobre la mesa.
En caso de que la propuesta bipartidista se apruebe permitiría dar dinero a los gobiernos locales y estatales, financia el Programa de Protección de Cheques y ayudaría a pagar el desarrollo y la distribución de la vacuna para COVID-19 pero no contempla un pago de un segundo cheque de estímulo .
¿Qué pasaría si los beneficios de la Ley CARES expiran y no existe una nueva ley de ayuda económica sin un cheque de estímulo?
Un informe del periódico The New York Times revela que sin un nuevo proyecto de ley de estímulo para ampliar los programas que fueron establecidos por la Ley CARES:
* Cera de 21 millones de personas deberán comenzar a hacer sus pagos de préstamos estudiantiles .
* 125,000 empresas perderán los incentivos fiscales por no despedir a los trabajadores.
* 150,000 millones de dólares de ayuda al gobierno estatal y local terminarán.
* 7 millones de trabajadores y contratistas perderán sus beneficios.
* 5 millones se quedarán sin cheques de desempleo .
* Y millones de personas se enfrentarán a desalojos .
Hasta el momento no se tienen novedades de un acuerdo entre los partidos políticos ni por parte del gobierno de Estados Unidos hasta que Joe Biden tome posesión en el cargo el 20 de enero. Por lo que ahora el presidente Donald Trump tendría que firmar cualquier paquete de ayuda que pase por el Congreso , que sería la única manera de conservar las prestaciones de desempleo mejoradas antes de que expiren el 31 de diciembre.
La Ley CARES estableció múltiples programas con fecha de vencimiento el 31 de diciembre de 2020 . Además de los cheques de pago directo, el proyecto de ley de rescate también extendió los beneficios de desempleo para los nuevos solicitantes a 39 semanas en lugar de las 26 semanas típicas establecidas por los estados. Esas semanas adicionales desaparecerán excepto en aquellos estados que ya establecieron un período de tiempo más largo hasta el 2021.
Otro programa que expirará es el Programa de Asistencia de Desempleo por Pandemia que este año brindó apoyo a los contratistas y trabajadores independientes para recibir fondos semanales similares a la de otros trabajadores desempleados.
Según el Departamento del Trabajo en Estados Unidos se registraron 712,000 nuevos reclamos por desempleo la semana pasada , 75,000 menos que la semana anterior. El The New York Times dijo que el Día de Acción de Gracias pudo haber reducido el número de nuevas demandas.
El informe de empleo de noviembre muestra que se crearon 245,000 puestos de trabajo , un 45 por ciento menos que los 444,000 que eran esperados, según el reporte de NBC News.

Texto completo: Under normal circumstances, I would have flown to one or both of the Dakotas to write this column, but the whole point is that these aren’t normal circumstances. And I don’t have a death wish.
Too much? Probably. But how else to convey the proper timbre of outrage, the right pitch of grief, over what happened there? Deep into the coronavirus pandemic, when there was no doubt about the damage that COVID-19 could do, the Dakotas scaled their morbid heights, propelled by denial and defiance. They surged to the top of national rankings of state residents per capita who were hospitalized with COVID-related symptoms or whose recent deaths were linked to it.
As of Sunday, South Dakota led the country in the average daily number of recent COVID-associated deaths per capita, with 2.4 for every 100,000 people, according to a New York Times database. North Dakota was second, with 1.7.
More than 40% of South Dakota’s 1,091 COVID-related deaths to that point occurred in November, according to statistics from the Covid Tracking Project, and the same was true of North Dakota’s 1,013 deaths.
The Dakotas are a horror story that didn’t have to be, a theater of American disgrace. Want to understand the tendencies — pathologies might be the better word — that made America’s dance with the coronavirus so deadly? Visit the Dakotas.
Intellectually, I mean.
“It’s mind-boggling,” Jamie Smith, the leader of the Democratic minority in South Dakota’s House of Representatives, told me.
He was referring primarily to how politicized such basic safety measures as social distancing and masks became, but also to many South Dakotans’ distrust of science and unshakable belief that the virus wouldn’t come for them.
“We’re dug in,” he said when we spoke recently.
Of the 10 counties in America with the most COVID-related deaths per capita, three are in South Dakota.
Lawrence Klemin, a Republican legislator in North Dakota who just finished his two-year term as the speaker of its House of Representatives, told me that people in his state “are pretty much independent-minded about how they conduct their affairs.”
“I don’t know if maybe some people are stubborn,” he added, but the deep sigh in his voice said that he knows full well that many people are. And the most stubborn, he said, have been the loudest. Throughout the pandemic, he said, he was deluged with communications from constituents adamantly opposed to any mask-wearing requirement, which North Dakota didn’t even have.
He heard almost nothing from the other side.
But after Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, used an executive order Nov. 13 to institute precisely such a mandate, a poll showed that a significant majority of North Dakotans favored it. Maybe they’d just seen too much dying by then. Or maybe, Klemin conceded, they’d been a silent majority for a while and political leaders underestimated their fellow citizens.
Regardless, he said, the state definitely should have taken that step last spring or summer — before the number of coronavirus cases skyrocketed, before hospitals were so overrun that sick North Dakotans had to be sent to neighboring states and before his own mother tested positive and died in early October.
Until recently, Burgum was loath to exert much pressure on North Dakotans and steered clear of the social-distancing orders put in place by so many other states. But he did invest heavily in testing and never merrily shrugged off the threat of the coronavirus the way his Republican counterpart in South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem, did.
Deaths and hospitalizations have dropped significantly in North Dakota over the past two weeks. On Friday evening, it ranked just ninth among states for the percentage of its residents hospitalized with COVID-19.
South Dakota, in contrast, was No. 1. Still no mask mandate there, and no leadership at all from Noem, who didn’t just welcome but beckoned President Donald Trump to Mount Rushmore for that enormous Independence Day rally, the one at which his perpetually maskless entourage clustered near a similarly maskless crowd. Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.’s romantic partner, tested positive then, compelling the two of them to go into isolation. Sadly, they didn’t remain there.
One month later, Noem played cheerleader for a 10-day motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that attracted some 460,000 people. In an article in the New York Times, my colleagues Mark Walker and Jack Healy described it as “a Woodstock of unmasked, uninhibited coronavirus defiance.”
Just before Thanksgiving, Noem announced the passing of her 98-year-old grandmother, one of 13 residents of a South Dakota nursing home who died in a two-week period. The home’s administrator told the Daily Beast that the other 12 residents, along with many of the nursing home’s workers, had tested positive for the coronavirus, but not Noem’s grandmother. (Hmmm …) While Noem publicly mourned her lost family member, she drew no particular attention to COVID-19’s rampage among her grandmother’s companions.
I get the sense that Noem has presidential aspirations (though she has denied that). If she ever presses the accelerator on those, please remember this savage season, and please remember her damning indifference to it.
When I said “horror story,” I was cribbing. That was a description used in a series of mid-November tweets from a South Dakota emergency room nurse, Jodi Doering, that went viral. Doering was reeling from tending to dying COVID-19 patients who continued to insist that the coronavirus was some kind of hoax.
They “scream at you for a magic medicine” and warn that Joe Biden will ruin America even as they’re “gasping for breath,” she wrote. She added: “They call you names and ask why you have to wear all that ‘stuff’ because they don’t have COVID because it’s not real.”
“They stop yelling at you when they get intubated,” she wrote. “It’s like a horror movie that never ends.” I altered that last sentence. Doering put a curse word before “horror,” and who can blame her?
The Dakotas are hardly alone in dealing with an onslaught of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths over the past month, a grim one for most of America. Neighboring Minnesota, a much less politically conservative state, has lately rivaled South Dakota for new cases per day per capita. Iowa, which abuts southeastern South Dakota, is also in terrible shape, as Elaine Godfrey wrote in the Atlantic on Thursday.
“To visit Iowa right now is to travel back in time to the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in places such as New York City and Lombardy and Seattle, when the horror was fresh and the sirens never stopped,” Godfrey wrote. “The virus has been raging for eight months in this country; Iowa just hasn’t been acting like it.”
Then again, has California? It got educated early, but if the lessons had taken as well as they should have, its governor, Gavin Newsom, might not have had to announce the stringent new lockdown measures that he did Thursday as the state’s intensive care units were stretched almost to the limit. In New York City, meanwhile, the daily rate of positive coronavirus tests exceeded 5% for the first time since May, according to city figures.
The truth is that the Dakotas are as emblematic as they are exceptional, the American story — or at least a strain of it — in miniature. In resisting the lockdowns, slowdowns and sacrifices that many other states committed to, they indulged and encouraged a selective (and often warped) reading of scientific evidence, a rebellion against experts and a twisted concept of individual liberty that was obvious all over the country and contributed mightily to our suffering.
“North Dakotans will come to each other’s aids in a heartbeat, but when asked to give up personal freedom for an amorphous common good — that’s difficult,” Paul Carson, an infectious-diseases doctor and a professor of public health at North Dakota State University, told me.
Just recently, Carson said, a lawmaker from the western half of the state — whose denizens regard its eastern half, where Carson lives, as elitist and too liberal — wrote to him to share a famous quotation from Benjamin Franklin: “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.”
For too long, staying safe from the coronavirus was indeed an amorphous mission to many North and South Dakotans, and their false sense of security was surely intensified by what they heard from Trump, who spoke of disease-ridden blue states versus freedom-loving red ones and kept promising that this would all blow over.
“We maybe believed that our rural nature sheltered us from what cities like yours were experiencing,” Carson said. “Then we found out, very brutally, that was wrong.”
Klemin, the North Dakota legislator, said that his mother, Carol Roaldson, was 99 when she died but had always thrilled to the idea of reaching 100 and was in excellent health before the coronavirus swept in. Her nursing home had to establish a segregated unit for the many residents who were infected in September, he said. He couldn’t visit his mother after she was moved there.
But when she sank into what were clearly her last days, he was allowed by her beside — in a face mask and shield.
“I watched her die,” he told me. “That was a very sad day.”

Erika Becerra was eight months pregnant when she learned she had tested positive for the coronavirus. Almost immediately after she got the result, her body began aching, she developed a fever and she felt tightness in her chest. When she began having trouble breathing, her husband called for an ambulance.
Three days later, on Nov. 15, she gave birth in a Detroit hospital to a healthy boy, Diego. She never got to hold him, her brother told KCBS-TV in Los Angeles.
Becerra’s health declined so rapidly that doctors put her on a ventilator, where she remained for 18 days. Becerra, 33, who had no known health problems before she became ill, died Thursday, surrounded by her parents and brother, who had rushed from East Los Angeles, according to her godmother, Claudia Garcia.
“It was a complete shock — she was fine,” Garcia said. “I’m speechless. I’m still trying to wake up from this nightmare.”
Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added pregnancy to the list of conditions that put people with COVID-19 at increased risk of developing severe illness, including a heightened risk of death.
The agency added pregnancy to the list after a study that examined the health outcomes of 409,462 symptomatic women ages 15 to 44 who tested positive for the coronavirus, 23,434 of whom were pregnant.
The study found that pregnant women faced a 70% increased risk of death compared with nonpregnant women who were symptomatic.
The pregnant women also were significantly more likely to require intensive care, to be connected to a specialized heart-lung bypass machine and to require mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant women.
“When you think about a growing uterus pressing on the diaphragm and lifting it upward, in general, it’s harder to breathe when you’re pregnant,” said Dr. Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, an obstetrician at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “Adding a respiratory disease just makes it more challenging.”
Gyamfi-Bannerman said Becerra’s death was a reminder of the importance for pregnant women to maintain social distance, wear masks and minimize time outside their homes.
But she said doctors still needed more data to get a better sense of the risks for pregnant women who contract the virus. The absolute risk of death for pregnant women who contracted the coronavirus was still lower than for women who contracted the H1N1 virus during pregnancy, according to the CDC study.
A Nov. 19 study, which was published in JAMA Network Open, also found that 95% of pregnant women who tested positive for the coronavirus had no adverse outcomes.
“The vast majority of pregnant women with COVID do very well,” Gyamfi-Bannerman said.
Garcia said the family did not know how Becerra contracted the virus. Relatives speculated that she must have become infected in early November, during her many visits to the doctor late in the pregnancy, when she began experiencing mild contractions. She learned she was infected with the virus Nov. 7.
Becerra’s husband, Diego, a landscaper, has been taking care of his infant son and the couple’s 1-year-old daughter, Erika. All three have tested negative for COVID-19, Garcia said.
Garcia said her goddaughter was ecstatic when she learned she was having a boy.
“She was so excited,” Garcia said. “She would say, ‘I’m going to have my boy and I’m going to have my girl and they’re going to grow up together.’ ”

Camilla Wicks, Dazzling Violinist From a Young Age, Dies at 92

Howard Taubman, reviewing violinist Camilla Wicks’ New York debut at Town Hall in The New York Times in 1942, had to admit that she had “a certain flair for the fiddle.” He was especially impressed by her handling of difficult passages in the Paganini D major Concerto, a work requiring an abundance of technical skill.
By the way, Wicks at the time was, as the review’s opening sentence noted, “a pretty, flaxen-haired lass of thirteen and a half.”
She had already been impressing West Coast audiences for years, having made her debut with an orchestra at age 7 in Long Beach, California. But she was no flash-in-the-pan prodigy whose abilities don’t develop with age. Eleven years after that New York debut, now in her mid-20s, she played Beethoven’s Violin Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, and even the orchestra’s musicians were impressed.
“The Larghetto was especially fine,” the review in The Times said, “for here her playing was so rapt and serene that it fully justified her unusually slow tempo. The men of the orchestra joined with the audience in the hearty applause.”
Wicks had blossomed from prodigy into one of the finest violinists of her time, and she was among the few women in that era to achieve prominence as a violin soloist. Later she became a respected teacher.
She died Nov. 25 in Weston, Florida, at the home of her daughter Lise-Marie Thomas Wertanzl, where she had been living for some months. She was 92. Thomas Wertanzl said Wicks had contracted COVID-19 in April and had been hospitalized for 42 days but had been testing negative for the virus recently.
Camilla Delores Wicks was born Aug. 9, 1928, into a musical family. Her father, Ingwald, was a violinist, and her mother, Ruby (Dawson Stone) Wicks, was a pianist.
A biography on her website said that she asked for a violin at 3 1/2 and was playing Vivaldi’s A minor Concerto from memory at 4. Her father was her first teacher and recognized her innate talent; at 10 she was sent to the Juilliard School in New York to study with noted teacher Louis Persinger, who was her accompanist at her Town Hall concert in 1942.
She played the Hollywood Bowl in 1946 while still in her teens and was heard frequently on the radio in the years after World War II. In 1952 she recorded the Sibelius Violin Concerto, an interpretation that has been admired ever since.
In the early 1950s, she married Robert Thomas, and in 1953 the first of their five children was born. For a time she was able to manage the demands of being both a mother and a professional musician.
“I was always playing with one of my children inside of me,” she said in a 2017 interview with the auction site Tarisio, which that year sold the Arthur Smith violin she had played for half a century for $84,000. “I was pregnant with my first daughter for the Beethoven Violin Concerto at Carnegie Hall, and then I continued when I was pregnant with my son, and so on.”
In a 1987 interview with Louise Cavanaugh Sciannameo that the music site the Strad published last week, Wicks elaborated on the difficult balancing act.
“I don’t think the difficulty of having a career, marrying, and raising children will ever be solved,” she said. “I didn’t dare tell management when I was pregnant. It was so hard. I wore special dresses and learned how to walk so I didn’t look pregnant.”
Eventually, in the late 1950s, she stepped away from performing for a time, even selling her prized instrument, a 1725 Stradivarius. But she returned to playing periodically. Her online biography recounts that in the early 1970s, when she settled in Washington state and taught at Wenatchee Valley College, she would sometimes play with a nonprofessional community orchestra there. In a remembrance published last week in The Wenatchee World, that paper’s publisher emeritus, Rufus Woods, said that the orchestra’s conductor, not realizing who she was, at first sat her in the second violin section.
But Wicks also performed in her later years with professional groups like the Detroit Symphony, as well as overseas, especially in Scandinavia. She taught at institutions including the University of Michigan, Rice University and the Eastman School of Music.
She made few recordings but gained a new appreciation among classical music aficionados in 2015 with the release of “Camilla Wicks: Five Decades of Treasured Performances,” a six-CD collection that compiled numerous live recordings.
In the Tarisio interview, Wicks recalled the difficulties she sometimes had in her younger days as a woman in the male-dominated field of classical music.
“I was one of the few women who broke through to play in the big leagues,” she said, “and some of the conductors were really quite miffed about it. I won’t name names, but one of them was not following me on purpose and was a half measure behind me the whole time. I didn’t know then to pace myself to the stubborn conductor’s accompaniment. That would have been the answer, but I went ahead and played my speed!”
Her marriage to Thomas ended in divorce. Her son Philip Thomas died in 2011, and her son Paul Thomas died in 2017. In addition to Wertanzl, she is survived by another daughter, Angela Thomas Jeffrey; a son, Erik Thomas; and three grandchildren.
In the interview published posthumously by the Strad, Wicks reflected on the role of music.
“We need something that is going to bring us hope,” she said. “All music can accomplish this. The greatest of pieces are those that say, ‘Yes, this is terrible, but there is hope.’”

BUENOS AIRES — Dr. Tabaré Vázquez, a former Uruguayan president who ushered in 15 years of leftist leadership and continued to practice as a physician while in office, died at his home in Montevideo, Uruguay, on Sunday. He was 80.
The cause was lung cancer, his son Dr. Álvaro Vázquez said.
Vázquez, an oncologist, announced in August 2019, toward the end of his term, that he had the disease.
Both his parents and a sister died of cancer, motivating him to make that his medical specialty. And as president, he waged an aggressive battle against tobacco companies and imposed one of the strictest anti-smoking regulations in the world.
His successor, President Luis Lacalle Pou, who took over in March, declared three days of mourning.
The election of Lacalle Pou, of the center-right National Party, marked the end of a 15-year streak in the presidency for the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist parties, that started with Vázquez in 2005, when his alliance defeated the two traditional center-right parties that had long dominated Uruguayan politics. He was one of several left-leaning politicians who took power in Latin America at the time.
Entering office on the heels of an economic crisis, Vázquez pursued market-friendly reforms while also boosting social welfare programs, including a plan to give all public-school students free laptops and the expansion of pensions and public health care.
He also made headlines around the world when he turned Uruguay into the first Latin American country to prohibit smoking indoors, part of an anti-tobacco crusade that led Philip Morris to file a lawsuit against the country at the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes in 2010. Uruguay won the suit in 2016.
A specialist in breast cancer, he continued to see patients one day a week at the clinic where he had long worked.
“Practicing medicine is not only my vocation, it gives me an opportunity to continue to be in direct contact with people, to see them and hear their needs,” Vázquez said in an interview with The New York Times in 2006.
Vázquez also promoted an effort to investigate crimes committed during the military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1973 through 1985.
He was known for his centrist policies and he even went against his own party when he vetoed a bill in 2008 that would have legalized abortion. The practice was legalized four years later.
The Uruguayan Constitution bars consecutive presidential terms, so Vázquez left office in 2010, with a high approval rating. He was succeeded by José Mujica, also of the Broad Front, and after Mujica’s presidency, Vázquez again ran for president and won in a runoff in November 2014.
His second term was marked by more difficulties than the first and his popularity took a hit as the Uruguayan economy began to stagnate amid increasing unemployment and rising crime. A corruption scandal forced his vice president, Raúl Sendic, to resign in September 2017.
All of that contributed to Lacalle Pou winning a narrow victory in November 2019 after a closely contested runoff against the Broad Front candidate, Daniel Martínez.
Tabaré Ramón Vázquez Rosas was born Jan. 17, 1940, in what he later described as a “very humble” home in the Montevideo neighborhood of La Teja. He was one of five children of Héctor Vázquez, a union leader who worked at the state-owned oil company Ancap, and Elena Rosas, a homemaker.
Vázquez graduated from the School of Medicine at Uruguay’s Universidad de la Republica in 1969, working as a carpenter and server, among other jobs, to finance his studies. He chose oncology as his specialty after his parents and a sister died of cancer.
He married María Auxiliadora Delgado, a civil servant, in 1964. She died in 2019. He is survived by their four sons, Álvaro, Javier, Ignacio and Fabián; nine grandchildren; and a brother, Jorge.
Vázquez joined the Socialist Party in 1983, which he had to do in secret because the country was under military rule. Four years after that military rule ended, he won the mayoralty in Montevideo as a Broad Front candidate, in 1989. He then lost two presidential elections, in 1994 and 1999, before winning in 2004.
In an interview that aired late last month, Vázquez was asked how he would like to be remembered.
“Like a president who tried to be serious and responsible in his actions,” he answered, “and who tried his best to fulfill his commitments.”

WASHINGTON — Loyalists to President Donald Trump have blocked transition meetings at some government agencies and are sitting in on discussions at other agencies between career civil servants and President-elect Joe Biden's transition teams, sometimes chilling conversations, several federal officials said.
At the Environmental Protection Agency, political appointees have joined virtually every discussion between career staff members and Biden’s team, monitoring conversations on climate change, scientific research and other topics. At the State Department such drop-ins are happening on what Trump appointees define as an as-needed basis. On Tuesday Biden’s transition team was allowed for the first time into the National Security Agency, but at the United States Agency for Global Media, parent of Voice of America, the Trump-appointed leader is refusing to cooperate with the Biden transition team, two agency officials confirmed.
Presidential transition experts said the presence of political officials at agency handoff meetings was not unheard-of and could even be seen as helpful. President George W. Bush, for example, worked closely in late 2008 with Barack Obama’s incoming team to help calm volatile financial markets. But against a backdrop of Trump’s refusal to concede election defeat, the actions of Trump appointees appeared to be a pernicious effort to slow the transition, some experts said.
“The norm is that the political people are not involved in the nuts and bolts of this,” said Michael Herz, a professor of administrative law at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.
He called the Trump administration’s apparent determination to micromanage the transition process by overseeing meetings part of its broader plan to “milk their authority as long as they can and disrupt the new administration as much as they can.”
Under the Presidential Transition Act, career employees play the primary role in managing the agency transitions, largely because they bring an institutional knowledge about the government functions and have been viewed as unpolitical stewards of the agencies they serve. No clear rules or guidelines, however, detail how the process should unfold.
During the handoff from Obama’s administration to Trump, for example, political officials were explicitly disinvited from transition meetings, said Thomas Burke, who served as EPA science adviser in the Obama administration at the time.
“To me, that’s the equivalent of having the opposing coach sitting in the room as you’re developing your team’s strategy,” he said.
Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who led the Trump administration’s transition for the EPA, agreed that Obama’s political appointees were not present but said he would have liked to meet with them. Regardless, he said, meetings were held in an open-plan office space.
“I assumed that everything we said and the people we were talking to was open to the political people there,” Ebell said. “And they never said ‘we cleaned the room and it has no microphones in it.’”
The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the process. Several people close to the president-elect’s team said that, after taking more than two weeks to begin the formal transition process, the Trump administration’s handover has been fairly smooth and that Biden is loath to disrupt that process by remarking on tensions.
So far, about 40 federal agency review teams have conducted more than 1,000 interviews and meetings, Biden’s transition officials said.
Federal employees who discussed the transition and asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak about the process offered mixed reviews on the presence of political leaders.
Several said they felt the Trump officials were implicitly intimidating employees from speaking openly about issues awaiting the new administration. Others described the meetings as merely awkward.
At the Department of Education, one official said Trump appointees had not crashed briefings but said the written briefing materials given to Biden’s teams “gloss over anything controversial” and described the briefings as “politically influenced.”
At the State Department, Trump’s appointees have insisted that they attend some, but not all, meetings of Biden’s transition team with career employees, according to an official familiar with the process. it was not immediately clear if doing so was seen as broadly intrusive or stifling the discussions at the State Department, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
However, the official said, including the outgoing administration’s appointees in at least some diplomacy discussions was not unheard-of, and that, so far, the State Department personnel had been cooperative in accommodating the Biden team’s requests.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told department officials he was ready to meet with Biden’s transition team, CNN reported last week, and on Monday described the incoming administration as “plenty smart enough.” That was a shift from late November, when he said in a Fox News interview that Biden’s foreign policy advisers “lived in a bit of a fantasy world” when they served during the Obama administration.
This week the Biden team was allowed into the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency after several days of what two people close to the transition described as an effort by newly appointed Trump administration officials at the Pentagon to slow the transition by blocking access to Department of Defense intelligence agencies.
Susan Gough, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said the agency sometimes adds personnel to the list of people with whom Biden’s team requests meetings “so that we have the right subject matter experts present,” but she added, “there is no requirement that all meetings be attended by a political appointee.”
No classified material has yet been given to Biden’s team, and it is not clear if or when that will be made available. Meetings at other intelligence agencies, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, are expected to come later.
On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that Michael Pack, a Trump appointee who oversees the Voice of America and other federally funded news agencies, has declined to make records and personnel available to Biden’s team.
At the EPA, James Hewitt, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed that political leaders were attending meetings and said it was happening with the blessing of Biden’s transition team.
“Associate Deputy Administrator Benevento asked the Biden environmental transition team if political staff could sit in on transition calls so they could provide any information they might have regarding the agency and they obliged,” he said, speaking of Doug Benevento, in a statement. “We have not been made aware that they have had any concerns with the quality of information provided on those calls.”
Lisa Brown, who served as co-director of the EPA review team during the Obama administration, said after enduring weeks of the Trump administration’s effort to slow-walk the transition, the Biden team most likely agreed to the conditions simply to get work underway.
They want to get in and see what they can learn rather than wasting time on a fight, is my guess,” she said.
But Brown described the arrangement as out of the ordinary and worrisome.
“What you have to worry about is the chilling effect on career employees” she said. “You’re going to worry that people are not completely forthcoming, especially when you have a president who still hasn’t conceded.”

NEW YORK — When Donald Trump’s childhood home in Queens was on the market four years ago, Trump, then a candidate for president, publicly mused about buying it himself.
Now, he might not have to: The home’s latest owner is launching a crowdfunding campaign with the goal of giving the five-bedroom Tudor in Jamaica Estates to the president as a gift — once the $3 million price tag is met.
The unusual real estate maneuver seeks to capitalize on the devotion of some of Trump’s supporters, in the hopes that the same commitment that has driven them to attend his large rallies in the middle of a pandemic will also induce them to open their wallets. The sellers hope donations might also be fueled by an impulse to mollify Trump with a personalized parting gift as his presidential term nears its end.
The fundraiser could also solve another problem that has plagued the home’s owner in recent years: an inability to find a buyer.
The house was put up for auction last fall, but failed to meet the reserve price, said Misha Haghani, principal of Paramount Realty USA, which has represented the property in three past auctions. This most recent attempt asks contributors to purchase the house as a gift to the president via GoFundMe, the charitable fundraising platform, “as a token of appreciation,” Haghani said.
“Love Trump?” the fundraiser, which kicked off Tuesday, reads. “Thank President Trump by contributing to this campaign to buy his childhood home in his honor!”
The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Even before the latest attempt to unload the property, the brick-and-stucco home was swept up by a series of speculative buyers cashing in on Trump’s political ascendancy.
Just before his 2017 inauguration it was sold for about $1.4 million — about 78% higher than when it sold in 2008 for only $782,500. That buyer swiftly flipped it to the most recent owner for $2.14 million at auction, more than double its value based on comparable homes in the area.
Trump already owns scores of properties, of course, and after years of toxic exchanges with political leaders from his hometown, he recently changed his official residency to Florida. The seller’s hope is not necessarily for Trump to end up once again in 85-15 Wareham Place, where he lived until he was 4 years old, but to donate it to a charity of his choosing, or perhaps install a presidential library. Trump’s father, Fred C. Trump, a real estate developer, built the home in 1940.
“Technically, he could accept the home and say, ‘Great, I just got another property to add to my empire,’ but he’s not going to do that,” Haghani said. “I believe if the president were to accept the property, he would do something with it in honor of his presidency. It’s either that or he’ll just donate it to some charity.”
Trump’s childhood house is not the only presidential home base for sale in the city: The three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on West 114th St. in Manhattan where former President Barack Obama lived while he studied at Columbia University was listed for sale last month. The asking price is $1,450,000. (It is not intended as a gift, though presumably a future buyer can do what they like with the apartment.)
Just who currently owns the home, Haghani refused to say; the owner’s identity remains obscured behind a limited liability corporation called Trump Birth House.
But the 2017 transaction in which Trump Birth House purchased the property was overseen by a lawyer who specializes in representing overseas Chinese buyers in real estate transactions. When the pale yellow house was listed for sale that year, it had been thronged by visitors who spoke Chinese and pulled up in droves to take pictures, neighbors said at the time; Trump’s image as a successful businessman has drawn him strong admiration in China.
Shortly after that 2017 sale, a person with knowledge of the deal but who was not authorized to speak about its details confirmed that the person who purchased the president’s childhood home was a woman from China, but would not disclose her name.
For a time, while Trump Birth House has owned it, the home was offered as an $815-a-night Airbnb rental. A cardboard cutout of Trump greeted visitors, and guests could sleep in a bedroom with a plaque that noted it was where “President Donald J. Trump was likely conceived.”
But in the past several years the home has stood largely empty. Some of the only visitors appeared to be utility workers turning off the power for unpaid bills. In November 2019, it was offered again at auction by Paramount, with another stunt — the chance for observers to win money by guessing the correct sale price — but it did not sell.
This time around there are other sweeteners: The seller has agreed to donate half of anything raised over the $3 million asking price to charity. And if the goal is not met, information on the GoFundMe page says all money raised will be donated to charity. But the seller has not revealed which nonprofit might benefit, or how long the fundraiser would stay active.
Trump is deeply unpopular in New York City, where 72% of the city voted for his opponent, Joe Biden, in the presidential election, and where protests have been held outside Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan throughout his presidency. Haghani said he was not worried how that might affect the sale.
“There are plenty of people who love him, including 70-plus million who voted for him,” he said.
Haghani has his own motivations, he added, which are not political: “I don’t want to have to sell this again.”

CARDIFF, Wales — It was a simple thing. A swipe with an alcohol pad, a tiny needle prick in the upper arm and the application of a small Band-Aid.
But the health care workers receiving a new coronavirus vaccine here on Tuesday, among the first in Britain, know it’s more than that.
“I’m excited for the world, really,” said Dr. Chris Hingston. “I just feel very lucky that we’re making this first step back toward normality.”
He was among 225 people given the vaccine at this makeshift clinic in Cardiff on Tuesday, a site scrambled into existence as Britain revved up a mass inoculation program that a week ago was only theoretical.
Hingston, who works as an intensive care doctor in the nearby University Hospital of Wales and as a helicopter ambulance doctor, described the event in understated terms: “Just like the flu jab.”
But he was clearly aware that the simple act had greater purpose: protecting not only himself but also hopefully his family, colleagues and patients from a potentially life-threatening virus. The vaccinations taking place here have already resonated around the world.
It had been just six days since regulators in Britain announced emergency approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first country to release a tested vaccine to the public. The start of the vaccination program — for a virus that has infected tens of millions globally and claimed more 1.5 million lives — signals a new phase in battling the coronavirus in Britain, which has been hard hit by the illness.
Eventually, Britain plans to vaccinate as many people in the nation that it can. But for now, as it rolls out its first 800,000 doses of the vaccine, those aged 80 and over, those working in nursing homes and health care workers are at the top of the list.
Hingston has spent more than two decades in the profession and more than half of that as an ICU doctor. But on this particular morning, as he visited the clinic set up in the disused gymnasium in Cardiff, he was the patient.
He arrived alone and masked, and showed his ID before being ushered into the gym. There, a handful of small, blue-curtained cubicles lined the perimeter, surrounding chairs placed several feet apart in a grid.
In a separate room nearby, pharmacists filled syringes with the vaccine and trained new staff members in the careful process. Unlike a typical vaccine — like the flu shot — which often comes preloaded in a syringe for ease of use, the new Pfizer doses must be prepared on-site. Before being used, they must be stored in a deep freeze, and once thawed last for only five days.
They are kept refrigerated on-site and then prepared vials must be used within hours, contributing to a sense of urgency among the staff.
Darrell Baker, the clinical director of the site’s pharmacy operations, looked on as a colleague drew a saline solution up a syringe, flicked his finger against the needle to shake off a droplet, and then injected it into a vial of the vaccine. The mixing is necessary because the manufacturers have yet to develop a way to effectively package the vaccine in individual doses.
“Hopefully over time, all of this fiddling around we have to do will be automated and we will get it in syringes,” Baker said. “But the fact that we’ve even got the vaccine is fantastic.”
The mixture was drawn up into five syringes and laid out in blue trays. The trays were then shuttled into the gym and picked up by nurses who moved swiftly to get through the waiting patients. By the end of the day, the center was scheduled to provide 225 vaccinations, including one for Hingston. For him, the whole process was over in minutes.
“I didn’t even feel it,” he said with a chuckle, chatting breezily with Lynne Cronin, 60, the acting lead nurse at the center, who delivered his vaccine.
“You’re exactly the people we need to come through,” she said, after learning that he works in an ICU.
Hingston has described the past year as a challenging one. He and his colleagues scrambled to prepare their ICU for an outbreak as they saw coronavirus cases grow from a cluster in China to a global pandemic. He watched doctors in the same roles as his fall ill and die in hospitals in China, Spain and Italy as the numbers swelled.
By spring, the first cases reached Wales. Initial projections there estimated their hospital would run out of beds during the first wave. That didn’t happen. Nor did it during the second wave this fall. But cases numbers have continued to climb and so have the deaths.
In some ways, things have become less difficult during the second wave, the phase still underway in Wales. Equipment has improved as have treatment options for patients, Hingston said. And Cardiff in particular has seen a smaller number of patients compared to the spring. But the patients being treated have tended to be sicker and older.
“These patients are in the hospital a long time,” he said. “And their families are unable to come in and visit unless there’s end-of-life care in process. So that’s been really difficult.”
It’s the fear of overwhelmed wards, being unable to treat patients and hearing families’ last words to their loved ones delivered over the phone that’s been the hardest on him, he said.
Recently, he said he overheard the goodbye call of the family of a Filipino patient in the ward.
“Even though it’s a different language, it is very obvious what was being said,” Hingston said. “It’s those kinds of days which have been pretty rough for everyone.”
For other health care workers who were inoculated here Tuesday, the experience was also an emotional one.
Betty Spear, a retired pediatric nurse, pulled back the blue curtain from the small cubicle she was working in after administering a vaccine to a nurse who openly wept. The woman had worked in a COVID ward.
“She just cried and said this was such an emotional day,” Spear said. “I presume she has seen a lot.”
Cronin, who administered Hingston’s vaccine, said it had been an extensive undertaking to get the clinic up and running for Tuesday.
“It’s been a huge ask to get everybody ready,” she said. “We’re still trying to train people up. We needed today and the next few days to sort any teething problems.”
But other than a few issues staff had with the computer system being used to document each vaccination, she said the morning had been smooth.
Fiona Kinghorn, the executive director of public health at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, the public health body that led the rollout of the mass vaccination program here, said there would be challenges in coming weeks as teams reached more people. She asked that the public be patient as they grew their vaccination staff into the “army” that would be needed.
“That’s going to take some time,” she said. “We’ve got really small amounts, relatively, and we will have to phase this in over time.”
For the health care workers like Hingston who were vaccinated Tuesday, it was just the start of this next stage. He’s booked for the second dose next month and, according to Pfizer’s data, within seven days will have the full protection this particular vaccine offers.
“Will it change anything I do today? No,” he said. He’ll still be wearing his mask, still donning his PPE at work, social distancing and hand washing frequently.
“But, in months’ time,” he said, “when everyone can be vaccinated, then life will change back to some normality, hopefully, for all of us.”

Texto completo: Democrats, smart and good. Republicans, ignorant and bad.
That's the only way that the national media know how to portray developments of the pandemic (and basically everything else political). So it continued this week with a front-page story in the New York Times implying that the Trump administration is already screwing up the distribution of coming coronavirus vaccines by declining to order as many doses as possible.
"U.S. rejected chance to buy more vaccine," the story's headline said. The report said that pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which has created a highly effective vaccine on track for emergency distribution, earlier this year offered the U.S. "the chance to lock in supplies beyond the 100 million doses" that the government initially ordered. The administration, the report said, "never made the deal, a choice that now raises questions about whether the United States allowed other countries to take its place in line."
The idea here is that the administration has left us short on a vaccine that's in high demand, allowing other countries to swoop in and take what could have been ours.
It's not until about much later in the piece that a more complete picture emerges.
"Pfizer has struggled to meet initial expectations," the report finally gets around to admitting. "This summer, the company predicted that it would have 100 million doses by the end of the year, but in November, it said manufacturing challenges forced the company to scale that back to 50 million." It also notes that "vaccine manufacturing is notoriously unpredictable and any number of factors ... could cause further setbacks."
In other words, Pfizer, like every other pharmaceutical company attempting to manufacture a vaccine, was never a sure bet.
White House officials on a Monday call with reporters denied the thrust of the New York Times's report. It's not necessarily false that the administration declined to lock in a purchase of more vaccines that it had initially agreed to buy, but that point is neither here nor there. It wasn't until after the election in November that Pfizer announced it had a vaccine with a roughly 95% success rate.
Negotiations between the government and pharmaceutical companies were happening back during the spring and summer, when there was no guarantee that a vaccine would come any time soon at all, let alone one that could be so effective. Did it make sense for the government to wait and see what it was getting?
Pfizer was trying to get the government to gamble that the company would be the first to produce a vaccine. What the administration did instead was spread out the odds by making deals with six manufacturers, two of which, Pfizer and Moderna, have produced promising vaccines.
This isn't a matter of President Trump failing to get us as many doses as possible. It's a matter of Pfizer perhaps winning the bet that everyone has a stake in.
Speaking of which, since when has the media assumed the best of profit-driven Big Pharma? Apparently since it could be used to make Republicans look bad once again.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
MOSCOW — With a momentary hiss of gas escaping a canister, the limp red balloon suddenly came to life, filled with helium.
After a practiced twirl of her fingers, Anastasia Bukhiyeva, an employee at a party supply shop in Moscow, attached a string, and the balloon floated up to a net under the ceiling, joining dozens of others in this upside-down system of storage.
Russian party balloons are more or less the same as balloons anywhere else but for one distinction: The helium is from Russia.
Soon, though, Russian helium could be used all over the world.
A huge production facility in Siberia is nearing completion, one that some analysts say could disrupt the global market for the lighter-than-air gas, which plays an increasingly critical role in industries like medical technology, space exploration and national security.
The United States and Qatar together generate the vast majority of the world’s helium. But Russia, already self-sufficient, plans to become a major exporter starting next year.
This ambition, in the works for years now, coincides with the U.S. government’s exit from the helium business after decades as a major supplier. It has raised worries that Russia could bring to helium the same politically influenced trading practices that worry buyers of Russian natural gas and crude oil.
Like oil and natural gas, helium is a finite resource. It is usually extracted as a byproduct of natural gas, and it is slowly becoming scarcer because, once released, it is too light to be contained by gravity and floats into space, lost forever.
And analysts expect demand to rise over time.
Initially, the new Russian supply might lower prices, said Michael Dall, an economist specializing in industrial chemicals at research firm IHS Markit. But longer term, he said, “the dynamics could become more political, something similar to OPEC,” which manipulates prices by raising or lowering the production of oil.
“The geopolitical risks of threats to supply, and potential supply outages, will rise,” Dall said. “And the way demand is going, helium is going to be highly sought after.”
Liquid helium is the coldest thing on Earth, with a boiling point of minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit. This exceptional property, plus the fact that it is not flammable and does not interact with other gases, makes it essential in devices ranging from MRI machines to rocket engines.
Liquid helium circulates inside MRI machines to cool the superconducting magnets that produce the scans that help doctors detect diseases in patients. In space travel, helium is used several ways, including to pressurize tanks of rocket fuel. (It remains a gas even at the low temperatures of liquid hydrogen.)
It is useful in welding and in printing computer chips, and if magnetic levitation trains ever take off, it could be a critical resource in that industry, said Christopher J. Cramer, vice president for research at the University of Minnesota, which buys helium for its laboratories.
Given its wide use, “people began to get nervous about helium supply,” Cramer said.
Medical device makers and scientists have questioned helium’s continued use in party balloons, where about 10% of the world’s supply winds up. The American Chemical Society calls helium an endangered element.
“Just like certain animals here on Earth, there are endangered elements, too,” the society’s website says. The society recommends that people “opt not to buy helium balloons.”
Siberia holds some of the largest-known untapped reserves of natural gas with high levels of helium, and Russia is preparing for a major leap in production when its new complex of factories comes online next year, operated by Gazprom, Russia’s huge natural gas producer. The company will export canisters of cryogenically cooled liquid helium from the Pacific Ocean port of Vladivostok, well-positioned to supply China and the technology industry on the U.S. West Coast.
Others also see opportunity in helium. Qatar plans new refineries, and companies are prospecting for new deposits in the United States, Canada and Africa, said Phil Kornbluth, a helium analyst and founder of a consultancy focused on the global market for the gas.
Still, after ramping up to full production in the middle of this decade, Russia expects to produce 25% to 30% of all helium used worldwide.
It will do so without breaking a sweat, so vast are its reserves, analysts say. In fact, Gazprom has the ability to reserve extracted helium in Siberia by injecting it back into the natural gas fields — essentially taking its helium off the market — which is one reason for concerns about price manipulation in the future. Gazprom declined to comment for this article.
In other commodity markets where Russia has a finger on the scale of prices, such as natural gas in Europe, a complicated mix of politics and economics influences the Kremlin’s decisions. Its Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project, intended to connect Russian gas fields to Germany, for example, has been fiercely opposed by the White House as a means of stoking dependence on Russia.
Helium has been a focus of countries’ national security policies for more than a century.
The U.S. government began stockpiling the gas in the 1920s, when zeppelins seemed to have a future in military air power, a role that never came. Still, the Federal Helium Reserve holds in the porous rock of an abandoned gas field outside Amarillo, Texas, about 2.8 billion cubic feet of helium owned by the American people — enough for an armada of blimps, or about 3 billion balloons if Congress decided to throw a big party instead.
The 1996 Helium Privatization Act required the Bureau of Land Management, which runs the site, to sell the entire reserve to privatize the helium market. Periodic auctions became a major source of helium for industry and created a benchmark for global prices, affecting the cost of everything from balloons to MRI scans. Private American companies will still produce helium. But the government reserve is expected to hold its last auction in 2023.
The change in the market is coinciding with Russia’s debut as a major supplier.
Gazprom said in September that its Siberian helium machine was more than 60% completed. Photos of the main refinery depict a panoramic scene of pipes and cooling towers, rising in a remote forest. When it opens, it will be the largest helium plant in the world, Gazprom says.
“Possibly, this factory could hand Russia world leadership in helium,” a Russian business news site, Rambler, reported in an article exuberantly headlined “A Flight to the Sun: A New Russian Factory Will Influence the Global Helium Market.”
With so much helium expected to begin coming online next year, Russian balloon sellers are hoping for some benefit, too. In the Soviet era, the gas was reserved mostly for the space industry, the military and scientists.
Helium balloons were an afterthought and a rarity. “I never had helium balloons when I was a child,” said Bukhiyeva, the clerk at the Moscow store. It is called Shariki 24, or Balloons 24, open around the clock.
She sells mylar unicorns and rainbows and has balloons in the shapes of all the letters in the Cyrillic alphabet, to spell messages.
Bukhiyeva saw no downside to Russia’s becoming a helium superpower. Balloons will become cheaper, she said. “It will be great.”

COVID Cases, and Blame, Rise Along Southeast Asian Borders

MAE SOT, Thailand — The border between Thailand and Myanmar is more than 1,500 miles long, much of it thickly forested. Myanmar has suffered runaway transmission of the coronavirus. Thailand, so far, has not.
But over the past couple of weeks, at least 19 COVID-19 cases in Thailand have been linked to migrant workers who slipped between the two countries undetected. The infections have spooked Thai officials, who have managed one of the world’s most successful coronavirus containment strategies.
The health authorities in Thailand are now racing to trace the contacts of hundreds of people who may have been exposed to the virus. And the events have cast a spotlight on how regions like Southeast Asia that depend on porous borders are fighting to keep the virus out while allowing economic activity to continue.
From Mexican farmworkers in California to Ethiopian construction workers in the Persian Gulf and Zimbabwean domestic workers in South Africa, essential labor is often carried out by undocumented people who slip across borders for work. Yet several countries are now using the illicit flow of migrant labor to accuse their neighbors of virus outbreaks.
In Southeast Asia alone, Myanmar has blamed people from Bangladesh, and Thailand has blamed Myanmar. Vietnam has pointed fingers at China. And China says its southwestern flank is suffering because of movement from Southeast Asia.
The winding frontier between Myanmar and Thailand — separating one country that has managed the virus from one that has not — is putting the crisis in stark relief.
“The border is very long,” said Col. Chatri Sanguantham, whose soldiers patrol the mountainous northern Thai region, near the town of Tachileik, Myanmar. “They will do anything, take any measure, to get what they want, including entering the country illegally,” he said of migrant workers from Myanmar.
Compared with other countries, the total caseload in Thailand — a shade over 4,000 infections — seems absurdly low. But over the past few days, Thailand said it had fortified parts of its border, increased military patrols and uncoiled barbed wire at popular illegal crossing points to try and stop the recent spread of infections.
The police have arrested those suspected of being people-smugglers, who are paid as little as $15 to help migrants cross the border illegally.
Undocumented workers, who often labor in crowded conditions, are of particular concern to the authorities because their uncertain legal status also makes them less likely to admit when they are sick, increasing the odds that the virus could spread undetected.
“Because these people came in illegally, they will lay low, work in hiding,” said Suthasinee Kaewleklai, a coordinator for the Migrant Workers Rights Network in Thailand. “If they get sick, they will never go to the doctor or hospital to get themselves checked.”
The dangers of overlooking foreign laborers, even those who are registered with the government, was made clear in Singapore, where the virus spread fast in crowded dormitories for migrants. While meticulous contact tracing suppressed outbreaks in other communities, the laborers were not monitored as closely, making them more vulnerable, rights groups said.
In Malaysia, thousands of foreign factory workers tested positive for the coronavirus at Top Glove, the world’s largest disposable glove maker, which went into overdrive to supply personal protective equipment. Malaysian authorities are now pursuing legal action against the company for keeping its workers in cramped conditions in which COVID proliferated.
And in Saudi Arabia, the virus spread unchecked in filthy migrant detention centers filled with workers from Asia and Africa, who were often abused and deprived of wages. When migrants were eventually deported to their home countries, some took the coronavirus with them.
Vigilance against the virus has been heightened in the Thai border town of Mae Sot, which sits directly across the Moei River from Myawaddy, Myanmar. Soldiers wearing camouflage and face masks patrol the riverbank. Before the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of people used to cross the river every year to work, study and play in Thailand, where roughly 5 million migrants normally find work, only about half of them legally.
At the narrowest point of the river, children could toss a ball between the two countries. In the dry season, migrants wade across the Moei, and in the rainy season they hop on skiffs.
Thailand began tightening the Mae Sot border in the spring, suspending traffic over the Friendship Bridge to Myawaddy. Restrictions eased a bit over the summer, then tightened again in August when the number of cases in Myanmar grew quickly.
But for all the talk of a fortified frontier, undetected cross-border movement continues, including people who want to avoid Thailand’s mandatory two-week quarantine. Thais still skip over to Myanmar, where casinos and clubs operate in a less-regulated environment, for a few hours of fun. Boats evade border posts to openly transport goods back and forth.
Despite this movement, Thailand has not reported sustained local transmission since May. Hospitals are currently treating about 180 COVID cases, according to health officials, and almost all of them are among people who returned from abroad and tested positive in state-mandated quarantine.
Yet over the past few months, travelers from Thailand have tested positive after arriving in Japan, Malaysia and South Korea. At least 70 migrant workers who returned from Thailand tested positive in Myawaddy, according to the Myanmar authorities.
In September, Ma Win Win Maw, who worked as a cleaner at a construction site in Mae Sot, sneaked back to Myanmar hidden in the back of a truck carrying food. She said she went straight from the truck to a car that took her to her village, where she was put in quarantine by local officials.
While in quarantine, Win Win Maw tested positive for the coronavirus. The two drivers who took her home tested negative, as did residents of her village, leading to suspicions that she contracted the virus in Thailand.
“I’m sure there are many positive cases in Thailand that are undetected,” said Dr. Brang Aung, the head of Hpa-An Hospital in Myanmar, not far from the Thai border. In September, his hospital treated four cases of the virus that he believes originated in Thailand.
The 17 people who crossed illegally from Myanmar to Thailand and tested positive in recent days are all Thai and are connected to a hotel entertainment complex in Tachileik. Almost all are women. They slipped across the border on multiple days in late November and dispersed to at least five locations across Thailand. The health authorities have since closed schools, used contact tracing and disinfected airports.
As Thais, the women would have had little fear going to hospitals where health care for citizens is subsidized and high quality. But for the many undocumented migrants in the country, medical clinics can be unaffordable and risky. Labor groups say that they know of multiple cases of workers returning to Myanmar from Thailand with the virus, leading to fears that it may be quietly circulating in Thai factories and construction sites, despite the low national numbers.
Dr. Sopon Iamsirithaworn, director of the communicable diseases division at the Thai Ministry of Health, acknowledged that the country had “very low local transmission.”
At least two cases of local transmission in recent days have been connected to the women from the hotel in Myanmar.
In Mae Sot, Thais have started to organize neighborhood watches and set up nighttime roadblocks to prevent outsiders from coming in. But in a border town situated directly across the river from a place in Myanmar where at least 1,200 people have had COVID, keeping out disease is all but impossible.
In October, two truck drivers ferrying goods from Myanmar to Thailand tested positive at a Thai hospital. They spread the virus to their family members in Myanmar and to Myanmar nationals living in Thailand.
By November, that cluster in Thailand was successfully contained. But late last month, a pair of Thai women who had crossed over the border illegally from Myanmar tested positive in Mae Sot.
“This area depends on trade, on migrants,” said Col. Krit Kityathiwat, the deputy commander of the 4th Infantry Regiment that patrols the Mae Sot area border. “We don’t want to be known as the place where COVID is coming to Thailand.”

SAPELO ISLAND, Ga. — Fall is cane syrup season in pockets of the Deep South, where people still gather to grind sugar cane and boil its juice into dark, sweet syrup in iron kettles big enough to bathe in.
Homemade cane syrup used to be the only sweetener that some families in rural communities could afford. Not many of those sugar shacks remain, so a jar of well-made local syrup, with its sweet, grassy notes and molasses backbeat, is as prized as the first pressing of an estate olive oil.
This autumn, no cane syrup has been more significant than the batches that Maurice Bailey and his friends made from the first purple ribbon sugar cane grown here on Sapelo Island since the 1800s.
The 11-mile-long barrier island is home to the Salt Water Geechees, who can trace an unbroken line back to about 400 West Africans who were enslaved and put to work growing a type of sugar cane that their descendants are now trying to revive. Almost all of the island’s 16,500 acres are in public hands, save the land in and around the community of Hog Hammock, where fewer than 50 people still live.
Members of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society hope that selling cane syrup will preserve Salt Water Geechee culture and protect the precious remaining pieces of property that haven’t been lost to developers or to pay tax bills. The 100 bottles they put up in November are part of a plan to build a boutique agricultural business that will produce Geechee red peas, indigo, sour oranges and a variety of island garlic that is used for cooking and medicine.
Growing enough cane to make syrup hasn’t been easy. The effort to bring purple ribbon cane back to Sapelo Island started in 2014, when David Shields, a culinary historian and professor at the University of South Carolina, met with Cornelia Walker Bailey, the author and unofficial historian for the island, who died in 2017. It was her idea to create an agricultural business.
Armed with a new mission, Shields worked with Clemson University plant geneticists to develop a close match to the original purple ribbon cane that was first brought to Georgia from the West Indies in 1814. The cane was recently added to the Ark of Taste, a catalog of distinctive foods facing extinction maintained by the international organization Slow Food.
Before she died, Bailey passed the agricultural project to Maurice, one of her six children.
“My mother always said do your part, so I’m just trying to do my part,” he said.
The cane project is essentially a one-man operation, with a lot of sweat and support from Nik Heynen, a geography professor at the University of Georgia, and a rotating band of volunteers. Growing the cane, cutting it and figuring out how to make cane syrup has made the two men as close as brothers. Heynen is so devoted to the project that he had an image of one of the island’s wild bulls tattooed on his arm after he saw one while driving across the island with Cornelia Bailey.
The first planting was a stand of cane only 125 feet long. Each year they’ve grown a little more. In 2017, just as they were getting the hang of things, Hurricane Irma nearly destroyed the crop. Last month, they harvested almost 5 acres, of both purple and white cane.
The purple cane is the real prize. Some say its flavor is more intense and complex, and done right the syrup has a lovely magenta tint. A small company with family connections to the island already sells something it calls Sapelo Purple Ribbon Sugar Cane Syrup ($95 for about 24 ounces). The company worked with Maurice Bailey’s mother to get the project off the ground, but he says its product is not true Sapelo Island syrup because the cane was grown off the island. It’s a sore spot for him.
Bailey had hoped to make syrup on the island this year, but the pandemic made it difficult to finish the sugar shack. So the two men piled the cane into a dumpster, put it on the ferry and headed to a relative’s farm on the mainland.
The family hadn’t made syrup for a few years and were happy to clean the equipment and give Bailey and Heynen a lesson in grinding cane and making syrup. By the end of the weekend, they had filled about 70 25-ounce bottles, which they plan to sell for $89 apiece.
Making syrup is a long, slow process. Ten gallons of starchy cane juice will boil down into about 1 gallon of syrup. The men strained the juice into a big plastic garbage can, then poured it into the kettle and heated it to a simmer. For hours, everyone took turns skimming scum from the surface. When the syrup was close to being finished, they dumped in baking soda to make it “jump,” or boil up over the rim and purge the last impurities.
In the old days, syrup makers would pour some onto a dinner plate and watch the way it dripped to determine whether it was done. (Just a few minutes too long, and it can turn into sticky candy.) Heynen used a hydrometer, which is more reliable.
“The real test,” Bailey said, “is when you pull that biscuit or that cornbread through it. It’s got to stick to the bread, but not break the bread.”

More Than 100 Accusers Seek Restitution From Epstein’s Estate

The fund set up to compensate victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual exploitation has already received more than 100 claims and paid out tens of millions of dollars.
The number of claims has already surpassed expectations even though the fund will accept requests until the end of March, said Jordana Feldman, its administrator and a lawyer who worked on the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund for many years.
Feldman would not say how many claims have been paid. But so far, the fund has paid more than $30 million to accusers, according to a person familiar with the fund, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The fund is poised to reach additional settlements in the coming weeks.
The fund began taking claims in July, a little less than a year after Epstein, a financier, died in a Manhattan jail cell following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges. Because he had put his roughly $600 million fortune into a trust, there were concerns that it could take years for his victims to get any money back from his estate.
But the estate’s executors agreed to establish the fund, allowing accusers — including those who had reached settlements with Epstein after his 2008 conviction on soliciting prostitution from an underage girl — to seek compensation. The terms of individual settlements are confidential.
Each claim takes about 60 days to review, with the victim interviewed over video because of the coronavirus pandemic, Feldman said.
“It gives the victims an opportunity to tell their story, and it gives me an opportunity to get to know them in a way that can’t be fully captured in a paper file,” she said. “I do see some of the rawness of the emotions. There is very deep, long-lasting impact that the abuse has had on their lives.”
One accuser who has received a settlement, according to court documents, was identified in the July 2019 federal sex-trafficking indictment against Epstein as “Minor Victim-1.” She had accused him of sexually abusing her beginning when she was 14.
Another unidentified woman, who said in a lawsuit that Epstein had sexually abused her after promising to help her get a modeling job with Victoria’s Secret, has also received compensation from the fund, according to court records. Epstein, for many years, had been the principal money manager to Leslie Wexner, the retail magnate who until this year was chief executive of the parent company of Victoria’s Secret.
In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to a charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor. As part of that plea agreement, he avoided more serious federal charges but was required to register as a sex offender.
That plea, which later became the subject of much criticism, called on Epstein to reach settlements with about two dozen victims but did not specify any amounts. As part of the agreement with prosecutors, Epstein was permitted to pay for his accusers’ third-party attorneys, a process that raised suspicions among some victims’ advocates.
Spencer Kuvin, a Miami lawyer representing nine women who have submitted claims to the fund, said the settlement process appeared to be fair. None of his clients have yet to receive a settlement offer, but Kuvin said he was “cautiously optimistic.”
Three of them received settlements from Epstein when they were teenagers but had felt intimidated by him and his legal team.
“This process is light-years different,” Kuvin said.
Feldman said a person who received a settlement was normally barred from coming back for more money. But she said given the circumstances surrounding the earlier investigation of Epstein, it was important not to close the door on any victims.
Plans for the compensation fund were announced last year but were delayed while the estate’s lawyers addressed objections by the attorney general for the Virgin Islands, Denise George. George, whose office has filed a civil forfeiture lawsuit against Epstein’s estate, had wanted more safeguards for the victims because the executors were former business advisers to Epstein.
Epstein’s primary residence for nearly two decades was an island he owned in the Virgin Islands, and the companies that constituted his business interests were mostly incorporated there.
Epstein’s estate has shrunk recently to about $400 million after paying $190 million in estate taxes to the federal government. The restitution fund, which is not limited in the amount it can dole out, is being financed with money from Southern Trust, one of Epstein’s main companies in the Virgin Islands.
One of Southern Trust’s biggest clients was Leon Black, the billionaire private equity executive, who paid as much as $75 million in fees for tax and estate planning advisory services. In all, Southern Trust had raked in more than $200 million in revenue since 2012.
“They have a lot of money to work with,” Kuvin said.

It’s a Lovely Winter in Europe. If You’re Selling Christmas Trees.

LONDON — As much of the world huddled at home in lockdowns and the days grew shorter, Christmas-tree growers like Rory Young waited anxiously for the most important month of their calendar, wondering if the years of pruning, shearing and weeding would pay off.
“No one really knew how people would take Christmas,” said Young, who harvests about 40,000 Christmas trees a year on his farm near the town of Dumfries, Scotland. “We only have four weeks in a year to sell our product.”
There is good news and bad news for tree growers like Young. Demand appears to be up, but the coronavirus has created unusual challenges.
In Denmark, which exports some 10 million of the 12 million trees it produces every year, the supply of workers from Eastern Europe, which the industry in the country relies on, has dried up. Tree sellers also describe problems caused by international restrictions on travel that affect cross-border trade.
But there’s no shortage of festive spirit. The pandemic seems to have had the opposite effect.
“To be honest with you — it’s gone absolutely nuts,” Young said of the demand, noting that sales were about 20% higher than in previous years. Customers seem to “want something to see the year out on a high,” he added.
Heather Parry, a spokeswoman for the British Christmas Tree Growers Association, said the last weekend in November had been the busiest on record. “The Christmas tree is that beacon of hope,” she said.
Early indications suggested that sales of real trees had grown by 31% compared with the same period last year, and many of the buyers were new customers, she added.
Sellers in France like Carlos Mourao, the manager of Aux Fleurs de France in Paris, reported a brisk trade in Christmas trees, with families descending on stores the moment they were allowed to reopen. “I told them that the tree would be dry within three weeks,” Mourao said. “They said, ‘It doesn’t matter, we’ll buy another one.’”
There was a similar story in Germany. “My first impression is that it’s going really well,” said Thomas Emslander, who runs a Christmas-tree nursery in Bavaria. He noted that he had sold significantly more trees than usual by the end of November.
The industry has lobbied in some countries to allow sellers to continue trading even while other commercial activities are restricted. Still, many wholesalers were initially cautious about putting in orders.
Claus Jerram Christensen, managing director of the Danish Christmas Tree Association, said, “We thought there might be a bigger demand,” given that many more people were expected to stay put for the holidays. Orders were slow and erratic at first, he noted, complicated by the coronavirus restrictions and labor shortages, but the industry was now busy “picking up.” He said he expected business to be slightly higher than average for the season.
Stephan Meijer, a Dutch plant broker, said the blockages to international trade caused by the virus were still causing problems. “The lorries are stopped at the border and the trucks and drivers cannot exit,” he said. “We hope a solution can be found in time.”
Nonetheless, the promise of a strong season is welcome to growers, considering the investment of time and effort that goes into the business. The average six-foot tree takes about 10 years to grow, Parry of the British growers group noted. “You put all this work in, you weed and you shape it — a lot of hard work that’s done on these trees,” she said.
Nobody, of course, wants a Christmas tree in January. “You are putting all your eggs in one December basket,” Parry said.
Anne-Sophie Lecoanet was carrying a small tree home one recent morning in Paris. “Since the times are a bit sad, I thought it was a good moment” to get one, she said.
A student who lives alone, she said she had decided to cancel an extended trip to see her family over the holidays because of the virus. The tree would help her in some small way to get through a period of loneliness, she said.
Others, some who were first-time buyers or who had bought a bigger tree than normal, expressed similar sentiments about hoping their purchase would offer some much-needed cheer.
“The smell … it just does bring you in the mood for the holiday,” said Deborah Chow, who said she would have to spend Christmas in London for the first time in years. Rich Pan, her boyfriend, agreed. “Even going out and buying it puts you in a festive mood,” he said.

LOS ANGELES — After George Floyd was killed by the police in Minneapolis this summer and America erupted in protest, cash started flooding the race for district attorney of Los Angeles County.
George Gascón, the former top prosecutor in San Francisco, seized the momentum swirling in the streets and honed his promises to reduce incarceration, tackle racial bias and reopen old police shooting cases that the incumbent had declined to prosecute. At his swearing-in ceremony Monday, Gascón immediately put his plans in motion, announcing an end to seeking cash bail and other sweeping policy changes.
Los Angeles, with the nation’s largest prosecutor’s office and its biggest jail system, was at the vanguard of communities, urban and rural, in liberal and conservative states, that went in the opposite direction of President Donald Trump’s law-and-order message last month by electing prosecutors who promised to send fewer people to prison.
The dynamics that propelled Gascón to victory played out in similar fashion in Austin, Texas, where a candidate vowing to end prosecutions of some drug sales won, and in Orlando, Florida, where voters elected Monique Worrell, whose background includes investigating claims of wrongful convictions.
In Georgia, Jackie Johnson, the Republican district attorney accused of mishandling the case of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger who was chased and shot dead by a former investigator for her office and his son, was ousted by an independent who had the support of activists outraged over the handling of the case.
“It’s telling, because it’s not just in bluer, urban locations like Los Angeles,” said Miriam Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor and executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, which advises prosecutors and candidates seeking change. “We saw a number of DAs elected in Georgia. We saw DAs in Florida elected. We saw wins of reform-minded DAs in Michigan and Texas and Colorado and Columbus, Ohio.”
As the movement builds momentum, with more progressive prosecutors taking office each election cycle, they have increasingly come together to influence policy and make significant changes in America’s criminal justice system, despite growing pushback from police unions and state officials.
In a joint statement last month, dozens of prosecutors across the country called for reducing the number of people on parole and probation. And in California, several prosecutors, including Gascon’s successor in San Francisco, Chesa Boudin, formed an alliance aimed at promoting progressive candidates and taking positions on state legislation.
Taken together, their efforts amount to a challenge to the power and money of law enforcement unions, which have typically backed traditional, tough-on-crime candidates and have been seen by critics as standing against efforts to change policing.
In Los Angeles, which was seen as the most important prize for progressive activists in a wave of victories that started with the 2016 elections of Kim Foxx in Chicago and Kimberly Gardner in St. Louis, both candidates framed the outcome of the election, at least in part, around the reconsideration of policing and racial disparities in the criminal justice system forced upon the nation when Floyd, a Black man, died under the knee of a white police officer.
Gascón’s opponent, Jackie Lacey, who is Black and was the first woman to become district attorney in Los Angeles, told reporters in announcing her concession, “It may be said that one day the results of this election is a result of our season of discontent, and a demand to see a tsunami of change.”
Gascón, a Cuban émigré who began his law enforcement career patrolling the streets of Los Angeles as a police officer, was always a viable candidate — he earned enough votes in the March primary to force a runoff with Lacey, a fellow Democrat. He pushed back on the notion that the activism around Floyd’s death was decisive in his election but acknowledged that it “altered the dynamics of this race.”
“There’s no question that the murder of George Floyd shook the conscience of this country in many corners where people were not concerned about this work before,” Gascón said in declaring victory.
Los Angeles has recently sent people to prison at a rate of four times its northern rival, San Francisco, where Gascón enacted a series of changes after becoming its district attorney in 2011. Lacey had the backing of several law enforcement unions, while Gascon benefited from the support of Black Lives Matter activists and wealthy individuals, including George Soros and Reed Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix.
All told, more than $19 million poured into their race, according to The Los Angeles Times, a record for a district attorney’s race.
Sensing the mood in the streets after the killing of Floyd, many liberal leaders in Los Angeles, including Mayor Eric M. Garcetti and Rep. Adam Schiff, pulled their endorsements of Lacey and backed Gascón. His message of reducing incarceration resonated with voters despite a surge in gun violence and homicides in Los Angeles, a similar trend seen in other U.S. cities that experts blame on the coronavirus pandemic.
Gascón’s victory came as Californians also voted down a measure, Proposition 20, that would have rolled back earlier reforms by reinstituting harsher sentences and reducing opportunities for parole, and approved a measure restoring voting rights for people convicted of felonies. And as a direct result of protests and national calls to “defund the police,” Los Angeles voters approved an initiative to shift money from jails to social services.
After taking office Monday, Gascón enacted many of his campaign promises as policy, including efforts to review thousands of old cases to determine whether the prosecutor’s office should ask courts to reduce sentences or overturn convictions. Gascón also said he would end prosecutions of most first-time, nonviolent offenders and ban his office from seeking the death penalty or enhanced prison sentences for accused gang members.
“Whether you are a protester, a police officer or a prosecutor, I ask you to walk with me,” he said after being sworn in, adding, “We can break the multigenerational cycles of violence, trauma and arrest and recidivism that has led America to incarcerate more people than any other nation.”
His sweeping policy changes met with resistance, however, from proponents of more traditional law enforcement.
“His plans will do nothing but further victimize Los Angeles residents,” the Los Angeles Police Protective League, a police union, said in a statement.
In his campaign, Gascón built a large coalition of support among Los Angeles’ diverse communities, including white voters who said they were moved by the summer protests and police shootings in the city and around the country.
“It’s policing gone too far,” said Janice Bronco, 72, who is white and lives in Lakewood, a small city in southern Los Angeles County.
She decided to vote for Gascon after seeing an increase in news reports about Black men and women killed by the police.
“I’m a supporter of the police, but so many are getting killed,” she said.
Bronco said she was concerned that Gascon had been too lenient on crime during his time as district attorney in San Francisco but voted for him anyway.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Last month, between tweets disputing his election loss, President Donald Trump posted an article from a conservative website that said his sister Elizabeth Trump Grau had just joined Twitter to publicly back her brother’s fight to overturn the vote.
“Thank you Elizabeth,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “LOVE!”
But the Twitter account that prompted the article was not his sister’s. It was a fake profile run by Josh Hall, a 21-year-old food-delivery driver in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.
“I was like, ‘Oh, my goodness. He actually thinks it’s his sister,’” Hall, a fervent Trump supporter, said in an interview last week.
It was a surreal coda to nearly a year of deception for Hall. Since February, he had posed as political figures and their families on Twitter, including five of the president’s relatives. He had pretended to be Robert Trump, the president’s brother; Barron Trump, the president’s 14-year-old son; and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. The accounts collectively amassed more than 160,000 followers.
Using their identities, he gained attention by mixing off-color political commentary with wild conspiracy theories, including one that the government wanted to implant Americans with microchips, and another that John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a plane crash in 1999, was alive and about to replace Mike Pence as vice president.
“There was no nefarious intention behind it,” Hall said. “I was just trying to rally up MAGA supporters and have fun.”
Many of those “Make America Great Again” followers appeared to believe the posts. Records also show that some accounts served another purpose: directing people to give Hall money. They promoted a fundraiser for a political group Hall created called “Gay Voices for Trump.” In an interview, he admitted that the group didn’t exist. The fundraiser brought in more than $7,300.
Hall’s Twitter spree seems to be a case of mischief spun out of control, illustrating how a person simply needs a phone and some knowledge of the internet to start trouble that gets the attention of hundreds of thousands of people.
Hall was hardly the first self-professed Trump fan to try to profit off fellow Trump backers. Federal prosecutors, for example, said in August that Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former adviser, and three others had solicited donations to build a border wall and then pocketed more than $1 million.
And he was hardly the first person to create a fake online persona. Fake accounts have been instrumental in the spread of conspiracy theories, and scammers have repeatedly posed as celebrities, soldiers and even Mark Zuckerberg to defraud people on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Those companies said they remove millions of fake profiles each year. Yet Hall showed that it was still fairly simple to impersonate key White House officials and the president’s family, including his teenage son, and amass tens of thousands of followers before Twitter took notice.
Millions of people have been lured down dark internet rabbit holes like QAnon, a pro-Trump conspiracy theory that claims satanic Democrats abuse and eat children and is fueled by someone posing as a government official. By comparison, Hall was a small-timer. His escapades in the alternate reality universe might have gone unnoticed — until Trump’s mistaken tweet elevated him to the big time of MAGA misinformation.
The New York Times identified Hall as the person behind the fake Trump accounts, which have now all been taken down by Twitter, and constructed a recap of his deception via screenshots of some of his tweets and an archive of many others collected by Ian Kennedy and Melinda Haughey, University of Washington researchers who use software to save millions of tweets about the election and pandemic. The Times also interviewed Hall, people close to him and people he misled online.
Hall said he became interested in politics in 2016 when he was a teenager, energized by Trump. “I kind of thought he was like a clown at first,” he said. “But the more I heard him talk, I realized: Yeah, he says kind of off-the-wall things, but I do agree with what he’s saying.”
He dreamed of becoming a conservative talk-radio host, he said, so he opted against college and decided to instead build a persona online. He sparred with liberals on Twitter; created a “public figure” page on Facebook; and self-published a 49-page e-book on Amazon called “Hall Nation” that detailed his “38 essential rules to live life in order to be happy and successful.” (The first rule? “Insults are a good thing.”)
Offline, he was not so successful. He struggled to hold a job, he said, including stints as a hotel clerk and sandwich maker. Most recently, he delivered food for DoorDash.
But online, he started to develop a small following. In January, he asked followers to help him pay for a lawyer, saying “a Planned Parenthood loving radical leftist” whom he used to date had accused him of harassment. He also began selling T-shirts that said “Josh Hall did nothing wrong.” He raised $815 on GoFundMe. Court documents indicate he is using a public defender. A hearing in the case is scheduled for later this month.
Hall said that around that time Twitter suspended his account without explanation. “Once I got banned from Twitter, my attitude was kind of like, ‘What the hell, I’m just going to have fun now,’” he said. (A Twitter spokesman said the company suspended his original account because he had created multiple accounts under different identities.)
So he started a new account under a different name: Rod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois best known for trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat. Blagojevich’s prison sentence had just been commuted by Trump, making him a sudden ally in the eyes of some conservatives.
“OBAMA STARTED THE CORONAVIRUS,” Hall wrote on Feb. 27 under Blagojevich’s photo and a profile named @GovBlago. It was typical fare for the account, which eventually drew more than 26,000 followers. For much of the time it was active, the profile included a disclaimer in its bio that it was a parody account, which Twitter allows under some conditions.
The rest of Hall’s impostor accounts did not include such disclaimers.
Twitter eventually removed the @GovBlago account, prompting Hall to impersonate someone else in the headlines: Birx, the White House official working on the pandemic. “The media is lying to you about this virus,” he wrote as @DoctorBirx on April 22. The pandemic was “plotted by the powers that be to crash our economy in hopes that Trump will pay for it in November.”
The account didn’t gain much traction, so he moved on to a brand that was sure to attract more eyeballs: The Trump family. Hall said he went on Wikipedia to find Trump relatives who didn’t yet have Twitter accounts, and first landed on Robert Trump, the president’s brother.
As @BigRobTrump, he quickly gained more than 25,000 followers, partly by spreading conspiracy theories. “The coronavirus was planned and released onto the world by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,” Hall said as Robert Trump. It was unclear if Hall believed such lies or if he thought they were just good at attracting attention, but they had become almost banalities in the conspiracy-filled corners of the internet where he spent much of his time.
When Twitter removed the first Robert Trump account, Hall started a new one, this time under the username @UncleRobTrump. It did even better, ultimately collecting more than 77,000 followers from July to August.
As the new Robert Trump account gained influence, Hall began using it to promote his own Twitter profile, @TheBiTrumpGuy.
On that account, Hall, who said he is bisexual, called himself the founder of a group called Gay Voices for Trump. Hall used the fake Robert Trump profile to promote the group.
“Uncle Rob runs Gay Voices For Trump with @TheBiTrumpGuy, although I am very much a heterosexual male. It’s the Trump genes - we love women,” Hall wrote as Robert Trump in July. “But we are trying to reach out to LGBT and other minority voters. Josh is doing great work so please give him a follow and support him!” The tweets brought Hall’s real profile thousands of new followers.
Not long after, Hall started messaging Trump supporters as Robert Trump, asking them to donate to a fundraiser for his group, according to screenshots posted online by two people who received the messages.
“Hey patriot. Would really appreciate if you have a couple of bucks to spare to organization,” he wrote, according to one screenshot.
Hall denied he sent such messages and suggested that the screenshots had been fabricated. “I would tell you if I did,” he said. “I should have used better judgment and stuff. But I didn’t deliberately try and dupe people out of money.”
His fundraiser on the website GoFundMe called his group “a grassroots coalition of LGBT Americans” and said all donations would go to “field organizing, events and merchandise.” He brought in $7,384.
Hall admitted last week that the group didn’t exist. He didn’t do more than register about 100 people to vote. “I didn’t end up ever really doing anything with the Gay Voices for Trump,” he said. “So I never got the funds from it.” He said the money was still with GoFundMe.
A GoFundMe spokeswoman said that the organizer behind the fundraiser — an account named Josh H. — had withdrawn the money. She said GoFundMe was now investigating how the funds were used and that the company would give refunds to any donors who requested one.
Hall didn’t respond to follow-up questions about the fundraiser.
Josiah Bruns, an engineer from Goffstown, New Hampshire, donated $100. With his donation, he left a comment: “Uncle Rob Trump asked me too.”
Bruns said in an interview that a QAnon message board had led him to the Robert Trump account, which also promoted the conspiracy theory. “We’re trained on the Q research board to always question everything,” he said, adding that he used those lessons to scrutinize the Robert Trump account. “I’m probably 65% sure that it was real.”
After The Times told Bruns that he had been deceived, he said he didn’t mind. In the future, he said, he would apply more research techniques he had learned from the QAnon movement to decipher what was real on the internet. The web is a minefield of lies, he said, “especially if it’s something you want to believe, because those are the easiest lies to fall for.”
In August, Robert Trump died. The news drew scrutiny to the fake Robert Trump account, and some of its followers began to suspect that Hall was behind it, given the pattern of tweets between the profiles. In response, Hall said on Twitter that the fake account was run by “a close political friend of mine” who “did not know about Mr. Trump’s serious condition.”
He began impersonating different Trump relatives, including Fred Trump III, the president’s nephew; Maryanne Trump Barry, the president’s sister and a federal judge; and Barron Trump, the president’s teenage son.
“COVID is a scam,” he wrote on Aug. 23 as Barron Trump, a fake account that attracted more than 34,000 followers in eight days. On Aug. 25, the account posted: “Q is real. The more the media delegitimizes it, the more it shows that they’re scared.”
The Trump Organization, which has spoken on behalf of the Trump family members in the past, did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.
The Twitter spokesman said the company eventually took down all of Hall’s accounts for violating its rules on impersonation and evading a previous ban from the site. In response to questions about why someone could create accounts impersonating the president’s teenage son and a White House official, the spokesman said in an email, “We’re committed to protecting the integrity of the conversation on Twitter, and we’re working hard to ensure that violations of our rules against impersonation, particularly when people are attempting to spread misinformation, are addressed quickly and consistently.”
A review on Saturday showed nearly 100 fake Barron Trump accounts were still active on Twitter, not counting those that identified as parodies.
Without a Twitter account, Hall felt left out after the election, as many fellow Trump supporters convened on Twitter to claim that the vote was rigged. “Why not make a comeback?” he recalled thinking. “I’m going to do something to spice things up.”
On the afternoon of Wednesday, Nov. 18, he created a new impostor, this time posing as the father of Kamala Harris, the vice president-elect. “My daughter is not who she portrays herself to be. She is dangerous for our democracy,” he posted.
The tweet got little attention, so he abandoned that fake for another Trump sibling. The final living sibling he hadn’t tried was Elizabeth Trump Grau, the president’s older sister, who is in her late 70s, lives in Florida and has hardly said anything public since her brother was elected.
Hall changed the name, photos and bio of the Harris account and erased the old posts. Then he started with a new message: “This election inspired me to break my silence,” he wrote under a photo of Trump Grau and the username @TheBettyTrump. “My brother Don won this election.”
He went viral again, collecting about 20,000 followers in 24 hours. Hall delighted many of his followers with dozens more juvenile and bizarre tweets, including claims that President-elect Biden is a pathological liar, Harris is a communist and Michelle Obama is a man.
On Nov. 20, Hall said, he woke up and checked the president’s Twitter account, as he did most mornings. “I was like shellshocked,” he said.
He quickly began bragging on Snapchat that Donald Trump had tweeted about his fake account. “My friend was joking, ‘Maybe he’s not close with his sister, and you just brought him and his sister a lot closer,’” he said. “So I kind of felt good about that.”
Within hours, the account was outed as a fake.
Hall argued that his accounts were clear parodies, if anyone just looked at what they posted. As Trump Grau, for instance, he called the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper “Anderson Pooper” and said he would cover the legal fees of anyone who poured gravy down the pants of Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor.
“I’m a big Trump supporter, but I’m thinking, ‘He’s got to know that that’s a parody,’” he said. “How does he not know?”

The year is 2031. Cities are concrete jungles crossed by flying buses that can twist in space and populated by avatars in oversize puffers and shredded jeans that resemble antique draperies over windows to interior worlds. They gesture toward posters promoting a secret rave in a watery wood that leads to a red rock desert where a woman in silver armor pulls a sword from a stone.
The on-ramp to it all: a cavernous boutique.
Shopping as the gateway to the dystopian future? Welcome to Balenciaga, fall 2021: the collection video game.
The latest entrant in the what-could-shows-be-next sweepstakes — following Jonathan Anderson’s show-in-a-box DIY exercise, Proenza Schouler’s show-in-a-book print collectible and Gucci’s miniseries — Balenciaga’s video game, titled Afterworld: the Age of Tomorrow, is not, actually, the first video game created to showcase a collection. That would be Collina Land, from Collina Strada, which bowed last month as part of Guccifest, the brand-sponsored short film festival featuring work from 15 independent brands.
It also probably won’t be the last, as fashion has been flirting with the gaming world for a while now. Burberry aired its most recent show on the livestreaming platform Twitch, and Dior Men is doing the same with its prefall collection this week. Louis Vuitton designed custom skins and a trophy case for the battle arena game League of Legends.
And truth is, Afterworld isn’t even that much of a game: The interactivity involves simply “walking” through the five levels of the environment, following a predetermined path — a task someone who has never played Fortnite or even Animal Crossing can complete without too much stress — stopping, perhaps, along the way to take a closer gander at the clothes worn by the various scanned-in models, the only real free choice on offer.
The news release that accompanied the experience called it “a hero’s journey,” though there are no challenges to overcome, no doors to decide upon, no enemies to battle. You can’t really lose.
Well, maybe it’s true that just getting through the day right now is enough.
Besides, what Afterworld does offer is a next step: a detailed immersive environment, even more comprehensive than the environments that designer Demna Gvasalia has been increasingly effective at creating with his in-person shows, the better to frame the clothes he is making and illuminate their effect.
One of the big head-scratchers when viewing a collection is always: Where did that idea come from? In this case, Afterworld paints a pretty clear picture of the answer. Ten years in the future, this is where Gvasalia thinks we could be. Yikes.
The last physical show that Gvasalia held was set in a cavernous warehouse, the air scented with gaseous lime, the walls lined with stadium seating, the runway a watery river under a LED ceiling roiled with storm clouds and flames.
Afterworld, which was preceded by a virtual runway parade viewed through VR glasses, is an imaginative iteration of the same idea, built for the socially distanced present. And by taking the clothes off the runway and actually putting them on a street, albeit a surreal one, it also shows how good they might look in the world.
A fairly comprehensive representation of the Balenciaga vocabulary that Gvasalia has been building since he got to the house, the collection is built on over-the-knee articulated armorial boots and sharp-edged pumps in silver and gold for both men and women. It includes his couture puffers, the shoulders dropped down and molded out or raised high à la Poiret to swaddle the throat, back turtled out like protective coverings, some patched with NASA logos.
The notorious shirt-that-wears-a-shirt is back; also jeans-that-wear-khaki shorts. There are fake fur yeti coats and tartan blanket capes, shredded silver glam gowns and crinkled silk sack dresses, oversize suiting and oversize sweats. Nods to PlayStation 5 and the word “free.”
The armor you might need, in other words, to fight your way through whatever happens next, all of it weaponized with a certain scavenged beauty and spiked with a subversive giggle.
To wit: There is a prize at the end of the adventure for those who complete the journey. A golden ring? A heavily beaded evening gown?
No. A breathing exercise. Just exhale. In the real world, we’re all playing for keeps.

What New York City’s Sewers Reveal About the Virus

NEW YORK — New York City’s sewers, whose lore has spawned films, children’s books and fantastical tales of alligator infestation, have now seized a role in the pandemic: Scientists are tracking outbreaks by monitoring the smelly, gray effluent that flows through underground pipes in hopes of identifying coronavirus clusters days before they appear through patient testing.
The undertaking, which has ramped up in recent weeks, has mirrored efforts across the country to surveil waterways for viral components, flushed down toilets by infected Americans who are excreting it in feces, even when asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.
Rising traces of the virus were detected in New York in recent months in wastewater samples scooped from sewage treatment plants near coronavirus hot spots in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. But now, scientists say, increases are being seen citywide, as infection rates reach their highest levels since the spring.
“At first, we thought it was a testing error, but then we kept seeing it,” Dr. Dimitri Katehis, a scientist with the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, said of the initial heightened readings.
This kind of wastewater testing is especially challenging in New York, a sprawling and dense city that is served by the nation’s largest combined water and wastewater utility.
In smaller towns and on college campuses, such testing is easier to conduct. But in New York, 7,500 miles of pipes handle 1.3 billion to 3 billion gallons of wastewater a day, depending on rainfall levels, making it nearly impossible for the scientists to pinpoint exactly which neighborhoods the viral remnants are actually coming from.
This is one reason that city health officials say person-by-person testing is still the best tool to track the virus. On Tuesday, the seven-day average positive test rate was 4.94%, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Still, Katehis and his team remain optimistic that the sewers will be helpful in detecting new outbreaks — especially when cases are not as widespread.
The city’s health and water departments were working out how the current wastewater data could best be incorporated into the tracking of the virus, said Dr. Jay Varma, the mayor’s senior adviser for public health.
“It’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle, and we are still trying to figure out where it fits,” Varma said. “It is absolutely worth pursuing.”
The virus breaks down too rapidly to spread through sewage, Katehis said, but its surviving genetic components can be measured as viral indicators, which provide a type of early-warning system. For instance, officials recorded heightened readings at the two treatment plants that serve Staten Island, corresponding to the increase in cases there early last month.
The city began planning out wastewater sampling sites and testing protocols in the spring, when New York was a global epicenter of the pandemic. By April, workers were collecting specimens. These early samples were frozen to be tested later to see if they aligned with sections of the city that had been recording large numbers of virus cases. (Preliminary tests indicated that they had.)
By September, the agency was taking six wastewater samples per day at each of its plants and testing them twice a week — its current testing rate. The agency provides the results to city health officials.
The samples are all analyzed at Newtown Creek, the wastewater treatment plant in North Brooklyn that is the city’s largest and is notable for its huge, gleaming digestion tanks that break down organic materials in sewage.
A microbiology lab that was long used to measure bacteria in wastewater, as well as viruses like the poliovirus and norovirus, was expanded to include the coronavirus analyses.
Several academic partners helped the agency develop the lab methodology. Department officials said they have spent $250,000 on new equipment, acquired $300,000 from grants and academic partnerships and hired a handful of new staff members.
The recent spikes in cases that they detected provided a proving ground for the system, city officials said. The outbreaks in Brooklyn and Queens, identified through lab and rapid coronavirus tests of individual people, were also being borne out by heightened sewer readings at nearby plants, said Pam Elardo, a deputy commissioner who oversees the 14 plants.
This was the case, for example, at the Owls Head plant in Brooklyn, which treats wastewater from Borough Park, Gravesend and Bensonhurst — all of which had outbreaks. The Bowery Bay plant in Astoria, Queens, showed increases linked to outbreaks in Kew Gardens and other areas, agency officials said.
“We were definitely seeing a parallel,” Elardo said as she entered an intake location at the Newtown Creek plant where wastewater is strained for stray objects — which included on this day a dead pigeon, a $20 bill and clumps of sanitary wipes.
A deputy chief at the plant, Michael Radano, lowered a sampling container down with a rope into an open pipe bearing a river of pungent wastewater from Brooklyn and Queens sewers.
Vincent Sapienza, commissioner of the Environmental Protection Department, watched Radano and said his agency was eager to be on the front lines of fighting the virus.
Sewer work is not glamorous, but the department’s employees take pride in maintaining a system that most New Yorkers know little about yet rely heavily upon. After pulling up the sample, Radano said he was a third-generation worker for the department.
Sapienza chuckled and said, “He’s got sewage running through his veins.”
In the lab, technicians conduct the sewage testing in protective biosafety cabinets. The samples are pasteurized and put through a centrifuge to remove other pathogens, so that the traces of the virus can be measured, according to Katehis.
Experts say that ideally, the concentration of viral components in a sample can indicate the rough number of infected people in a broad area. But the testing has limitations in such a large system. The Newtown Creek plant, for example, handles about 300 million gallons of wastewater a day from parts of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan that have a combined population of roughly 1 million people. Even the city’s smallest plant, the Rockaway facility in Queens, handles waste from about 90,000 people.
Also, New Yorkers’ household sewage is combined with runoff from storm drains, which dilutes viral components in the wastewater.
So, while city health officials say sewer surveillance may prove helpful, they are measured in their public assessment of it — especially when comparing it with simply testing patients for the coronavirus.
Varma, of the mayor’s office, said that since the city’s health department only began receiving samples in September, it was still too early to gauge how vital it might be.
Dr. Dave Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said in a statement that the testing was “promising and may prove to have great value for disease surveillance and decision-making in the months to come.” But, he added, “We have to follow the science in determining how to use the data from this innovative program.”
Still, New York City seems to be testing in more locations than many other municipalities.
Newsha Ghaeli, president of Biobot Analytics, a wastewater epidemiology company that handles testing for roughly 200 municipalities nationwide — including agencies that handle Boston and Miami — said that while New York’s 14 sampling sites were far more than most of their municipal clients, New York City could increase its number of sites and do more localized sampling around communities that have had a history of outbreaks.
Katehis said his department was planning to perhaps expand the testing to nearly 100 pumping stations. The department has begun acquiring more equipment and hiring researchers and microbiologists to allow for sampling from sewers further upstream, to zero in on the source of heightened levels.
Other municipalities in New York state have emulated the city’s model and also send samples to the city’s Department of Environmental Protection for testing, when it has extra room in its centrifuge.
In the lab, Katehis pointed to newly arrived wastewater samples from Plattsburgh, New York, which were sitting next to a deep freezer where the specimens are kept.
He said that even when the pandemic was over, the testing system could be used to detect the flu and other possible outbreaks.
“We’re using the sewers,” he said, “to keep people healthy.”

Britain’s National Health Service delivered its first shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, opening a mass vaccination campaign with little precedent in modern medicine and making Britons the first people in the world to receive a clinically authorized, fully tested vaccine.
At 6:31 a.m. Tuesday, Margaret Keenan, 90, a former jewelry shop assistant, rolled up the sleeve of her “Merry Christmas” T-shirt to receive the first shot, and her image quickly became an emblem of the remarkable race to produce a vaccine and the global effort to end a pandemic that has killed 1.5 million people worldwide.
“I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19,” said Keenan, who lives in Coventry, in central England. “It means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year.”
British regulators leapt ahead of their U.S. counterparts last week to authorize a coronavirus vaccine, upsetting the White House and setting off a spirited debate about whether Britain had moved too hastily, or if the United States was wasting valuable time as the virus was killing about 2,200 Americans a day over the past week, as of Monday.
President Donald Trump planned Tuesday to issue an executive order proclaiming that other nations will not get U.S. supplies of its vaccine until Americans have been inoculated, a directive that appeared to have no real teeth but nevertheless was indicative of the heated race to secure shipments of doses.
For the people receiving vaccinations in Britain, among them doctors and nurses who have fortified the country’s National Health Service this year, the shots were an early glimpse at post-pandemic life. Besides Keenan, none attracted as much attention as William Shakespeare, who was second in line for a shot in Coventry and who, the NHS confirmed, really is named William Shakespeare.
“Today is a great day for medical science, and the future,” Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said Tuesday.
The first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for Britain were transported in recent days from a manufacturing plant in Belgium to government warehouses in Britain and then to hospitals.
Fifty hospitals will be administering the shots until the government can refine a plan for delivering them at nursing homes and doctor’s offices. The vaccine must be transported at South Pole-like temperatures before it can be stored for five days in a normal refrigerator, Pfizer has said. First to receive the vaccine will be doctors and nurses, certain people aged 80 and over, and nursing home workers.
Some doctors and nurses have received invitations in recent days to sign up for appointments, with the first shots intended for those at the highest risk of severe illness. The government has indicated that people aged 80 and older who already have visits with doctors scheduled for this week, or who are being discharged from certain hospitals, will also be among the first to receive shots.
Nursing home residents, who were supposed to be the government’s top priority, will be vaccinated in the coming weeks, once health officials start distributing doses beyond hospitals.
Hundreds of people are still dying in Britain each day from the virus, and the country has made allowances for travel over the Christmas period that scientists fear will seed another uptick in infections.
“It is amazing to see the vaccine, but we can’t afford to relax now,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said Tuesday morning as he visited a London hospital. Trying to calm a recipient’s nerves about needles, he suggested, “I always try to think of something else — recite some poetry.”
Keenan, the first vaccine recipient, showed no such nerves. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said on Twitter that watching Keenan receive the shot gave her “a bit of a lump in the throat.”
“Feels like such a milestone moment after a tough year for everyone,” Sturgeon added.
Administering Keenan’s shot was May Parsons, a nurse who is originally from the Philippines and has worked for the National Health Service for 24 years.
“The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS,” she said, “but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
The cartoonist Berkeley Breathed introduced us to “Bloom County” and its eclectic residents — including the penguin Opus, whose bulbous nose was only eclipsed by his big heart — 40 years ago. The newspaper strip, which originally ran from Dec. 8, 1980, to Aug. 6, 1989, offered a satirical look at pop culture and politics and earned Breathed, 63, a Pulitzer for editorial cartooning in 1987 — much to the chagrin of some editorial cartoonists.
Another surprise came in 2015: new strips. At the time of its second premiere, Breathed said, “I had planned to return to ‘Bloom County’ in 2001, but the sullied air sucked the oxygen from my kind of whimsy.” By 2015, however, it seemed the country was ready for silliness again, he said, and he began posting new strips on Facebook which have continued occasionally through this year. One difference about the new endeavor? “No deadlines,” he wrote during a recent email interview. “Age brings such wisdom,” he added.
In honor of the 40th anniversary of the birth of “Bloom County,” Breathed answered questions by email about its beginning, its future and a somewhat faulty Opus telephone. These are edited excerpts from the interview.
What was the initial inspiration for “Bloom County”?
In 1980, two months out of college, the Washington Post sent me a syndication contract. Under “Name of Feature and characters” was a blank space. I wrote in “TBD.”
Nobody had the faintest idea what comic strip I should concoct, least of all me. They didn’t care. All I’d ever drawn were college stereotypes, which were the only characters I was instructed NOT to use. What to do?
I named it a place — Bloom County — and figured I’d decide later who should live there. Hadn’t a clue. If you were to substitute “Maycomb, Ala.,” the setting for “To Kill a Mockingbird,” for “Bloom County,” you would have guessed the correct literary inspiration for the setting. You’ll imagine the delight I took years later when I received a fan letter from Harper Lee, who eventually tried her best to convince me not to end Opus’s comic life a decade later. I told her I’d reconsider if she brought back Boo Radley. We remained in a standoff.
When did you come up with Opus?
I’d cook up some baloney to make it interesting, but Trump has made creative fibbing unrascalish. His greatest sin.
I was a year in on “Bloom County” and hugely bored of drawing people standing in profile. Saddled with vertical boxes, I needed an animal that could stand and fit in the damn rectangles that wasn’t a beagle nor a fat orange cat. Any child will tell you that that leaves penguins: They’re already standing, they don’t look particularly naked and they have the blissful countenance of looking always about to say something pleasant. New penguin’s name? It was a blazing hot June Iowa night around 3 a.m., I was slightly drunk and the disc jockey of Iowa City’s only rock station, KRNA, yelled out the name of his next song from the group Kansas — one that could only be played at such an hour: “Magnum Opus.” Things sometimes happen.
What is the most memorable or regrettable “Bloom County” merchandise?
An Opus telephone. We spent months engineering it so Opus’s head turned when you pulled the handset out of his back. The phone would tip over onto the floor each time. I didn’t see why that should be a problem. I’d like to apologize right here about that.
Do you have a favorite strip?
I will occasionally laugh at my own material. Akin, I suppose, to applauding your kid if he kicks a goal or marries really well, but more embarrassing. There is a single frame where Bill the Cat has half swallowed Snoopy still holding his “Get Met” briefcase. Don’t show that to me if I’m eating soup. I chose the right line of work, one presumes.
Were the deadlines hard on you? Are there any strips you wish you could revisit?
Read this carefully: “Bloom County” had a weekly deadline for 10 years. I missed 100%. Each of those 500 weeks, I had to drive 40 miles at 4:30 a.m. to the airport at whatever city I lived in to put the strips on a plane as cargo, delivered by a cabdriver in Washington, D.C., a few hours later. Every. One.
The strips I’d like more time with? All of “Bloom County.” I’ll have a psychologist explain this one day, when I can face it. One theory is that sleeplessness accounted for the oddly seductive style of the strip’s writing. Well.
You often push against the mainstream. Was the popularity of Opus difficult for you?
No, it was the delight of my life. Any actor, writer, artist or filmmaker who isn’t moved by a fan telling them what their invented nonsense meant to the lives of people who embraced it all should be shot. A rare privilege.
What was it like winning a Pulitzer and how did you feel about the backlash?
As the saying goes, a Pulitzer really only guarantees what the first words of your obituary will be. The editorial cartoonists of the late ’80s were anxious to hurry that process along. Fussbudgets, all of ’em.
Is there any question you wanted to be asked in an interview, but never were?
Will we ever see “Bloom County” go into TV production? “New York Times: OK, will we?” Possibly very soon, thank you for asking. Speaking of deadlines …

Shift to a Not-So-Frozen North Is Well Underway, Scientists Warn

Texto completo: The Arctic continued its unwavering shift toward a new climate in 2020, as the effects of near-record warming surged across the region, shrinking ice and snow cover and fueling extreme wildfires, scientists said Tuesday in an annual assessment of the region.
Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the University of Alaska and one of the editors of the assessment, said it “describes an Arctic region that continues along a path that is warmer, less frozen and biologically changed in ways that were scarcely imaginable even a generation ago.”
“Nearly everything in the Arctic, from ice and snow to human activity, is changing so quickly that there is no reason to think that in 30 years much of anything will be as it is today,” he said.
While the whole planet is warming because of emissions of heat-trapping gases through burning of fossil fuels and other human activity, the Arctic is heating up more than twice as quickly as other regions. That warming has cascading effects elsewhere, raising sea levels, influencing ocean circulation and, scientists increasingly suggest, playing a role in extreme weather.
This year the minimum extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, reached at the end of the melt season in September, was the second-lowest in the satellite record, the scientists reported. On land, the Greenland ice sheet and glaciers in Alaska and elsewhere lost mass at above-average rates, although the rate in Greenland slowed from last year.
Permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, continued to thaw and erode along Arctic coastlines, leaving Indigenous communities struggling to cope with damaged infrastructure.
And perhaps most stunning, snow cover across the Eurasian Arctic reached a record low in June. The drying of soils and vegetation that followed contributed to wildfires that burned millions of acres of taiga, or boreal forest, particularly across Siberia. The fires spewed one-third more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than the year before, according to European researchers.
The amount of snow that fell across the Eurasian Arctic was actually above normal this year, said Lawrence Mudryk, a researcher with Environment and Climate Change Canada and lead author of the section on snow cover in the assessment.
“Despite that, it was still warm enough that it melted faster and earlier than usual,” he said.
The warmth was pervasive across the Arctic. The average land temperature north of 60 degrees latitude, as measured from October 2019 through September, was 1.9 degrees Celsius, or 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit, above the baseline average for 1981-2010 and the second-highest in more than a century of record-keeping.
The outsized influence of the Arctic is why the assessment, called the Arctic Report Card, has been produced annually for the past 15 years by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. More than 130 experts from 15 countries contributed to this year’s version, which was issued at the annual conference of the American Geophysical Union.
In recent years Arctic researchers have increasingly come to recognize that the region is moving from a climate that is characterized less by ice and snow and more by open water and rain.
In a study published in September, two researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colorado, argued that for sea ice at least, a permanent shift had already occurred. Ice extent has now declined so much, Laura Landrum and Marika M. Holland wrote, that even an extremely cold year would not result in as much ice as was typical decades ago.
Donald K. Perovich, a professor at Dartmouth College and the lead author of the chapter on sea ice in the assessment, said that 2007 was a critical year.
“We had the largest drop in ice extent we’d ever seen,” he said. “While there have been these variations since, we’ve never returned to those levels before 2007.”
“It’s as though we’re in this new state,” he said.
The age of sea ice is declining as well as the region warms. Three decades ago, ice that was at least 4 years old made up about one-third of the Arctic Ocean pack ice at the end of winter. This year, according to the assessment, old ice accounted for less than 5% of the pack ice.
The increasing dominance of younger, and thus generally thinner, ice has contributed to the reduction in sea-ice extent, Perovich said, since thinner ice is less likely to last through a single season.
The shift from old to young ice has also led to a decline in overall ice volume. Volume this year, measured at the end of the melt season in September, was the second-lowest in the 10 years that satellites have been making reliable measurements.
The assessment noted how conditions in the Arctic affected the Mosaic expedition, in which a German research icebreaker was deliberately allowed to freeze into the pack ice Russia and drifted across the Central Arctic for most of a year. The expedition, Mosaic, ended in October when the ship left the pack ice between Greenland and Norway and returned to Germany.
At the beginning of the expedition in September 2019, the ship struggled to find an ice floe to use as a mooring that was thick and stable enough to last through months of drifting. And as the voyage proceeded, the wind patterns that brought such warm temperatures to the Arctic also caused the ice and the ship to drift much faster than expected.
