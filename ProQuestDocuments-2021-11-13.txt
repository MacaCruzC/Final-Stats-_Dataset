Texto completo: This is the year that broke the truth. This is the year when millions of Americans — and not just your political opponents — seemed impervious to evidence, willing to believe the most outlandish things if it suited their biases, and eager to develop fervid animosities based on crude stereotypes.
Worse, this was the year that called into question the very processes by which our society supposedly makes progress.
So many of our hopes are based on the idea that the key to change is education. We can teach each other to be more informed and make better decisions. We can study social injustices and change our behavior to fight them.
But this was the year that showed that our models for how we change minds or change behavior are deeply flawed.
It turns out that if you tell someone their facts are wrong, you don’t usually win them over; you just entrench false belief.
One of the most studied examples of this flawed model is racial diversity training. Over the last few decades, most large corporations and other institutions have begun racial diversity programs to combat the bias and racism pervasive in organizational life. The courses teach people about bias, they combat stereotypes and they encourage people to assume the perspectives of others in disadvantaged groups.
These programs are obviously well intended, and they often describe systemic racism accurately, but the bulk of the evidence, though not all of it, suggests they don’t reduce discrimination. Firms that use such courses see no increase in managerial diversity. Sometimes they see an increase — not a decrease — in minority employee turnover.
Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev offered a clear summary of the research in a 2018 essay in Anthropology Now. One meta-analysis of 985 studies of anti-bias interventions found little evidence that these programs reduced bias. Other studies sometimes do find a short-term change in attitudes, but very few find a widespread change in actual behavior.
Dobbin and Kalev offer a few reasons for why these programs generally don’t work as intended. First, “short-term educational interventions in general do not change people.” This is as true for worker safety courses as it is for efforts to combat racism. Second, some researchers argue that the training activates stereotypes in people’s minds rather than eliminating them. Third, training can make people complacent, thinking that because they went through the program they’ve solved the problem.
Fourth, the mandatory training makes many white participants feel left out, angry and resentful, actually decreasing their support for workplace diversity. Fifth, people don’t like to be told what to think, and may rebel if they feel that they’re being pressured to think a certain way.
These days a lot of the training is set up to combat implicit bias. This is based on research led by Anthony Greenwald, Mahzarin Banaji and Brian Nosek, showing that most Americans, and especially most white Americans, have hidden biases that influence who gets hired, who gets promoted and how people are seen.
Implicit bias is absolutely real. The problem is that courses to reduce its effects don’t seem to work. As Greenwald told Knowable Magazine: “I see most implicit bias training as window dressing that looks good both internally to an organization and externally, as if you’re concerned and trying to do something. But it can be deployed without actually achieving anything, which makes it in fact counterproductive.”
Or, as Tiffany L. Green and Nao Hagiwara wrote in Scientific American this past August, “But to date, none of these interventions has been shown to result in permanent, long-term reductions of implicit bias scores or, more importantly, sustained and meaningful changes in behavior.”
Part of the problem is that a lot of discrimination is structural; not in people’s attitudes but in organizational practices and the way society is set up. Part of the problem, as Matt Martin writes in Fast Company, is: “There’s surprisingly little correlation between most people’s attitudes and behavior. And the correlation between bias and discrimination is weak.”
Finally, our training model of “teaching people to be good” is based on the illusion that you can change people’s minds and behaviors by presenting them with new information and new thoughts. If this were generally so, moral philosophers would behave better than the rest of us. They don’t.
People change when they are put in new environments, in permanent relationship with diverse groups of people. Their embodied minds adapt to the environments in a million different ways we will never understand or be able to plan. Decades ago, the social psychologist Gordon Allport wrote about the contact hypothesis, that doing life together with people of other groups can reduce prejudice and change minds. It’s how new emotional bonds are formed, how new conceptions of who is “us” and who is “them” come into being.
The superficial way to change minds and behavior doesn’t seem to work, to bridge either racial, partisan or class lines. Real change seems to involve putting bodies from different groups in the same room, on the same team and in the same neighborhood. That’s national service programs. That’s residential integration programs across all lines of difference. That’s workplace diversity, equity and inclusion — permanent physical integration, not training.
This points to a more fundamental vision of social change, but it is a hard won lesson from a bitterly divisive year.

The NBA is not what it once was

Texto completo: The NBA’s pandemic restart was a perfect time to sow the seeds of social justice. And as the league tips off its new season, now is the time to reap.
An activist group has taken out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times calling on the league to force the sale of one of its teams. The team is the Detroit Pistons. The owner is Tom Gores, who also owns a prison telecommunications company. Gores, the charge goes, perpetuates racism because the company, Securus Technologies, charges so much for prison phone calls.
“If Black Lives Matter, what are you doing about Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores?” the advertisement asks.
“In his current position and how he's currently building his wealth and what he's doing to our communities, he shouldn't be allowed to own one of our favorite basketball teams,” said Bianca Tylek, a leader of the group behind the ad.
The NBA was once a professional basketball league, and it was a good one. While it was a long way from its Michael Jordan-fueled peak in 1998, the 2000s and even most of the 2010s boasted a strong presence in the culture. People wanted to see Kobe Bryant’s Lakers battle Paul Pierce’s Celtics or the triumphs and defeats of LeBron James in Cleveland and Miami or Stephen Curry in the San Francisco Bay Area.
But that audience has been fading and replaced by a smaller, but louder, contingent. Similar to a lot of corporations these days, the NBA has surrendered to the “extremely online” progressive activists who like to make demands. NBA players, too, increasingly make up a part of this group, making demands about how the league should show adherence to social justice movements.
The NBA was once a major cultural player, one that extended beyond political lines to the public. It now cares mostly about approval from the New York Times and activists like Tylek, whose demands will never cease. The league of Air Jordan and the Black Mamba is in the past. It’s now the league of the activists.

From Tom Cotton op-ed fallout to Twitter censoring New York Post: 10 media headlines from 2020

Texto completo: The media was tasked with chronicling one of the most turbulent and unpredictable years in recent memory in 2020, covering major stories ranging from the coronavirus pandemic to the presidential election.
And sometimes, news outlets and journalists themselves became the story:
MSNBC's Chris Matthews retires amid controversies (March):
Host Chris Matthews abruptly retired after a slew of negative stories came out about him, the most recent of which was Laura Bassett, a columnist with GQ and frequent guest on MSNBC, alleged in an opinion piece that Matthews made comments about her appearance, which was the most recent of many allegations of harassment.
This followed reports over the years about Matthews rating female guests on a numerical scale based on appearance, getting reprimanded for comments directed to a subordinate that led to a separation-related payment, and getting caught on camera joking about a "Bill Cosby pill," which was a reference to a date-rape drug.
The network chose Joy Reid to fill the weekday evening vacancy left by Matthews.

New York Times Tom Cotton op-ed (June):
The New York Times published an op-ed from Sen. Tom Cotton in which the Arkansas senator urged President Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to U.S. cities to respond to protests and, in some cases, riots that followed the death of George Floyd.
Some staffers were critical of the piece, claiming that it puts minorities “in danger.” The New York Times ultimately blamed a “rushed editorial process” as to why the op-ed got published. The New York Times also ran a separate article on the backlash the paper received from running Cotton's op-ed. Three unidentified journalists said they had informed their editors that sources told them they wouldn't provide them with information anymore because of his article.
James Bennet, the then-top editor of the opinion section, announced his resignation shortly thereafter. “The journalism of Times Opinion has never mattered more than in this time of crisis at home and around the world, and I’ve been honored to be part of it," he said. "I’m so proud of the work my colleagues and I have done to focus attention on injustice and threats to freedom and to enrich debate about the right path forward by bringing new voices and ideas to Times readers.”
Cotton criticized the outlet for not standing by the op-ed.
"In the face of the woke mob of woke kids that are in their newsroom, they tucked tail, and they ran," Cotton said. "They confessed and said that they were going to go to re-education camp, and they were going to cut the number of op-eds they run. And for that, I will apologize, or I will say to the world 'you're welcome' for getting the New York Times to publish less of the garbage that you normally see in their pages."
Fox News wins lawsuit by arguing Tucker Carlson shouldn't be taken seriously (September):
A federal judge dismissed Karen McDougal’s defamation lawsuit against Fox News and Tucker Carlson over commentary he delivered about her claims of an affair with Trump.
McDougal sued Fox News and Carlson after a December 2018 episode of his show in which Carlson accused the former Playboy model of extortion and claiming that she "approached Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if he doesn't give them money." He also characterized her behavior as "a classic case of extortion."
"Fox persuasively argues, that given Mr. Carlson's reputation, any reasonable viewer 'arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism' about the statement he makes," Manhattan federal judge Mary Kay Vyskocil wrote in his ruling. "Whether the Court frames Mr. Carlson's statements as 'exaggeration,' 'non-literal commentary,' or simply bloviating for his audience, the conclusion remains the same — the statements are not actionable."
Jeffrey Toobin's Zoom incident (October):
In October, Jeffrey Toobin of the New Yorker was seen by colleagues touching himself during a Zoom breakout session. Following an investigation, the outlet fired him.
Toobin remains a legal analyst at CNN. At the time the news broke, the network said it granted Toobin some "time off" to deal with the situation, and it has repeatedly ignored inquiries about his future on CNN.
C-SPAN’s Steve Scully, chosen to be a presidential debate moderator, suspended after lying about a hacked Twitter account (October):
An investigation found Steve Scully, who had been selected to moderate the second presidential debate between Trump and then-candidate Joe Biden, lied about having his Twitter account getting hacked after he sent a tweet to former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.

Amid questions over the tweet, Scully claimed his account had been hacked and that he hasn’t sent the tweet in question, which was him asking for advice on how to handle public criticism from the president, but he has admitted to lying about it and has apologized for it.
The debate that Scully was supposed to moderate was canceled after the debate commission opted to change the town hall-style debate to a virtual one, given Trump's coronavirus diagnosis. The president rebuffed the idea, saying he wasn't going to "waste my time" in a virtual debate, and his campaign accused the commission of switching the format to help Biden.
Twitter blocks New York Post's Hunter Biden story, locks the paper out of account (October):
The New York Post published a story that purported to show Hunter Biden facilitated communications between his father and then-vice president, Joe Biden, and a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm where the younger Biden had served on the board. The president-elect denied that any meeting took place as the New York Post described it.
Twitter blocked users from sharing the report, which focused on documents taken from a laptop and hard drive Hunter Biden purportedly left at a computer repair shop that were later obtained by Rudy Giuliani, a personal lawyer to Trump, and the FBI. Twitter also locked the New York Post out of its account until it decided to delete the tweets sharing the report, and Twitter did not back down until two weeks later, when the outlet tweeted a "Free Bird" newspaper headline.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded to critics saying his company's "communication" on the issue was "unacceptable."
After the election, it was revealed that Hunter Biden has been under criminal investigation as federal authorities scrutinize his taxes and foreign business dealings.
Veteran reporters make high-profile exits from their publications:
Bari Weiss, an opinion columnist, left the New York Times in July, a month after Bennet resigned. Her resignation letter talked about vitriol she faced from coworkers who disagreed with her columns and viewpoints and claimed that Twitter had become the "ultimate editor" of the outlet.
Glenn Greenwald, one of the founders of the Intercept, left the publication in October after claiming it censored his work, and Andrew Sullivan departed New York magazine.
There was also an exodus from Vox Media, with Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias, two of the outlet's founders, announcing their departures.
CNN contributor Miles Taylor comes out as "Anonymous" after lying on-air about it (October):
Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who publicly denounced Trump, revealed that he is the mysterious Trump administration official dubbed "Anonymous" who first made waves in September 2018 with a New York Times op-ed claiming to be part of an internal "resistance."
Months before revealing his alter ego, Taylor, who served as chief of staff to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and was also a counterterrorism adviser to White House chief of staff John Kelly, explicitly said he was not "Anonymous" during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper.
“I wear a mask for two things, Anderson: Halloweens and pandemics. So, no," he said to Cooper on Aug. 21.

New York Times all but retracts Caliphate:
After an investigation, the New York Times announced that its hit, award-winning podcast Caliphate did not meet the publication's standards for publishing.
In September, Shehroze Chaudhry, who used the pseudonym Abu Huzayfah, was arrested in Canada and charged with concocting a terrorist hoax. That pushed the venerable newspaper to investigate the claims he made in the 12-part audio documentary, which was done by Rukmini Callimachi, a New York Times correspondent who has frequently reported from conflict zones, who has since been reassigned.

In an editor's note posted earlier this month, the paper said its investigation “found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the ‘Caliphate’ podcast. As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of ‘Caliphate’ that presented Mr. Chaudhry’s claims did not meet our standards for accuracy.”
Conservative media fact-check election fraud claims amid threat of lawsuit:
Fox News and Newsmax aired what were essentially fact checks of election fraud claims made on their networks after Smartmatic issued a legal threat and demanded a retraction. The voting machine company, along with Dominion, have threatened to sue a handful of media outlets for promoting conspiracy theories that their corporations helped swing the election for Biden.
The Fox package, which featured an interview with Eddie Perez, the global director of technology development and open standards for the Open Source Election Technology Institute, aired on Lou Dobbs's, Maria Bartiromo's, and Jeanine Pirro's shows last week. Newsmax's John Tabacco read a lengthy statement on-air in which he acknowledged that the network had "no evidence" to support the claims that have been spread on its airwaves.
One America News Network was also threatened with legal action, but it hasn't issued a fact check, nor has it stopped talking about certain claims.

2020 was the point of no return for establishment media

Texto completo: This may be the year that the establishment press crosses the point of no return.

After 2020, it will be hard to see corporate media as anything but a public relations arm of the Democratic Party following the former’s attempts to bury not one, not two, but three major allegations leveled against left-wing politicians.

Axios, one of the more aggressive and fairer online news outlets, revealed in December that failed presidential candidate and Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California developed a relationship with a suspected Chinese spy who worked on behalf of the Communist Chinese government as part of a far-reaching espionage operation.

Swalwell, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, has declined to address his past interactions with Christine Fang, including that she managed somehow to place an intern in his office. He has offered no good reason for why he should remain in his congressional assignment despite the sensitive nature of what is discussed in the committee. His ability to dodge the issue has been enabled in part by media, which have not bothered to press him on the matter. In fact, news of the congressman’s entanglement with a Chinese spy has been ignored entirely by the larger, older news outlets.

ABC, CBS, and NBC ignored the story entirely when it broke. The major broadcast networks continued to ignore it even after Republicans moved to have the congressman removed from the intelligence committee. NBC has nothing on its website about the Chinese spy scandal. Neither does CBS or ABC. The New York Times, the Associated Press, and the Los Angeles Times, similarly have avoided reporting on the scandal. Swalwell, meanwhile, has been allowed to skate on the excuse that the Axios report was a hit job orchestrated by the Trump White House, which doesn’t make any sense.

What a change of pace for the newsrooms that have spent the past four years hunting relentlessly for some connection between the Trump administration and Russian intelligence operations!

Next, there is Democratic Georgia Senate candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock, whose ex-wife, Ouleye Ndoye, is on tape alleging assault by her former spouse.

Ndoye told Atlanta law enforcement officials in March that Warnock had run over her foot during a domestic dispute, according to a police report obtained this month by the Washington Examiner.

“[A]ll he cares about right now is his reputation” because of his Senate campaign, a tearful Ndoye says in footage recorded by a police body camera.

“I’ve tried to keep the way that he acts under wraps for a long time, and today he crossed the line,” she added, tearing up. “So that is what is going on here. And he’s a great actor. He is phenomenal at putting on a really good show.”

The two were going through divorce negotiations at the time.

Weirdly, the newsrooms that published practically every allegation leveled against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings have seen no news value in Ndoye’s on-camera remarks about the Georgia Senate candidate.

Neither NBC, nor CBS, nor ABC has reported on her allegations. The Washington Post hasn’t touched the story. The New York Times has not touched the story. CNN hasn’t touched the story. MSNBC hasn’t touched the story. The New Yorker hasn’t touched the story. And so on. Just a brief reminder: The New York Times and the New Yorker share a Pulitzer Prize for their #MeToo coverage.

Lastly, there is the Hunter Biden laptop fiasco. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.

Hunter Biden revealed in December that he is under federal investigation. The FBI, the IRS, and federal prosecutors in Delaware are reviewing his overseas business activities for possible tax and money laundering violations.

Evidence of the investigation, which launched in 2018, first came to light in October after the New York Post revealed the existence of a laptop that reportedly belonged to the president-elect’s son. The New York Post’s investigation into whether Hunter Biden leveraged his father’s political influence to line the family’s pockets included the publication of the laptop's contents, including an FBI report marked with a case number with “the code associated with an ongoing federal money-laundering investigation in Delaware,” according to the Daily Beast.

“Another document — one with a grand jury subpoena number — appeared to show the initials of two assistant U.S. attorneys linked to the Wilmington, Delaware, office,” the report adds.

The New York Post's coverage was questioned and ridiculed for weeks by competing newsrooms, including the New York Times, Politico, and MSNBC, which alleged, without a shred of evidence, that the laptop story was Russian disinformation. The New York Post was even locked out of its Twitter account because of its laptop coverage.

The federal investigation is real. The contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop are real. Swalwell’s past relationship with a suspected Chinese spy is real. Warnock’s ex-wife is on tape alleging abuse.

Yet, many of the same news outlets that have spent the past four years chasing after nearly every allegation leveled against conservatives, no matter how ridiculous or outlandish, have ignored all three stories. At some point, one must conclude that the deciding factor in whether these establishment newsrooms cover scandals is whether it hurts members of the Democratic Party.

If that’s how it’s going to be, then what good are these news organizations?

Texto completo: It has been another embarrassing year for the establishment press.

In 2020, the year of the coronavirus pandemic and the final year of President Trump’s term in office, there were several faulty and busted news cycles. For the sake of brevity, however, we can narrow it down to just five.

So, in no particular order, here are the sloppiest, most erroneous, and dishonest media-driven narratives of 2020:

5. COVID-19 is no big deal

Few claims in 2020 aged as poorly as the one that said fears over COVID-19 were overblown.

“Is this going to be a deadly pandemic?” Vox asked on Jan. 31. “No.”

The Associated Press published a report elsewhere that declared, “Is the new virus more ‘deadly’ than flu? Not exactly.”

Former-Fox Business news anchor Trish Regan, meanwhile, told her viewers that the viral outbreak was being blown out of proportion and that it was just “another attempt” by Democrats “to impeach the president.”

An estimated 344,525 Americans and counting have died so far from the virus.

4. China has this virus beat, according to China

Members of the free press jumped at the chance in 2020 to parrot Chinese state officials who alleged, without any convincing evidence, that the country responsible for the coronavirus had everything under control. No one had any reason to trust China, given its well-established record of lying and its attempts to suppress the sharing of relevant information, including arresting and punishing medical professionals who tried to warn people that there was something going around with SARS-like symptoms. There was even less reason to believe China, given its downright unbelievable infections and fatalities figures. Yet, Western journalists were all too happy anyway to mimic the Chinese Communist Party’s data uncritically.

“How uncomfortable is it,” asked NBC News’s Chuck Todd, “that perhaps China’s authoritarian ways did prevent this? Meaning, had China been a free and open society, this might have spread faster?”

“Its Coronavirus Cases Dwindling, China Turns Focus Outward,” reported the New York Times.

CNN even ran a story this year copying, almost word-for-word a Chinese Communist Party press release praising the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s efforts to contain the coronavirus. The CNN report made it a point to criticize the U.S. Navy’s failures to do likewise.

And this is to say nothing of the Western journalists who reported in March that the United States had more known COVID-19 cases than any country in the world, ignoring all the while that China was clearly lying about its coronavirus totals.

3. “Mostly peaceful” riots

As riots spread last year from Los Angeles to New York City, razing entire communities, members of the press assured viewers against backdrops of burning buildings and smashed-in storefronts that the “protests” were “mostly peaceful.”

The “protests” were not “mostly peaceful,” as the estimated $1 billion-plus in damages, the most expensive in insurance history, can attest.

Yet viewers were treated anyway to on-air headlines such as the one CNN ran on Aug. 27 that read, “Fiery but mostly peaceful protests after police shooting.”

ABC News claimed earlier in an alert that read, “Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station, and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified.”

Individual journalists in New York City, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere also sought to downplay the destruction visited upon their cities by boasting that there had been no violence in their respective neighborhoods and parks. The Associated Press ran damage control for rioters “caught up in the moment.” The Washington Post even published a rioter fashion spread (it’s exactly what it sounds like).

2. Vaccines will not be ready until at least the summer of 2021

Newsrooms were maybe a little too eager to report that a coronavirus vaccine would not be available until at least by the summer of 2021. They were wrong, obviously, while Trump, who promised during the election that a vaccine would likely be available before the end of the year, was right.

But newsrooms were convinced otherwise.

“Trump appears to be expediting the vaccine development process, misrepresenting how fast a vaccine will be available to the public in fighting the novel coronavirus,” the Washington Post reported.

NBC News published a fact-check later challenging the president’s promises, citing “experts” who said, “he needs a 'miracle' to be right.”

"[J]ust one of the five — Pfizer — has said that it could have initial results this month,” the New York Times claimed in a fact-check that awarded Vice President Mike Pence a “misleading” rating after he claimed during a debate that a vaccine would likely be ready for widespread distribution by the end of the year, “and the Food and Drug Administration this week published guidelines for evaluating emergency authorizations that detailed why it could take at least several more months for a company to clear the bar."

As of this writing, healthcare workers have administered an estimated 3.17 million doses.

1. Hunter Biden’s laptop is Russian disinformation

President-elect Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, announced in December that he is under federal investigation. Prosecutors in Delaware, the IRS Criminal Investigation agency, and the FBI are investigating possible tax and money laundering violations regarding Hunter Biden’s business ties to China.

Details of the federal probe first surfaced in October, however, when the New York Post revealed the existence of a laptop that reportedly belonged to the president-elect’s son and had since been turned over to the FBI. The laptop’s contents, which were obtained by the New York Post via Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, include an FBI document marked with a case number with “the code associated with an ongoing federal money-laundering investigation in Delaware,” according to the Daily Beast.

“Another document — one with a grand jury subpoena number — appeared to show the initials of two assistant U.S. attorneys linked to the Wilmington, Delaware, office,” the report adds.

Evidence of the federal investigation was out in the open following the New York Post's publication of the laptop’s contents. It was right there for establishment newsrooms to investigate. Major media organizations could have gotten the scoop about the federal investigation rather than wait on Hunter Biden and his father’s campaign to confirm its existence. But major news organizations didn’t investigate the laptop or its alleged contents. Instead, they asserted, without a shred of evidence, an insidious plot by the Russians.

“Trump said to be warned that Giuliani was conveying Russian disinformation,” reported the New York Times.

Said Politico, “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.”

“Trump embraces reported Russian anti-Biden disinfo campaign,” claimed MSNBC.

We know now that there is indeed a federal investigation into possibly illegal overseas business activities by Hunter Biden. We also know now that the Justice Department has been investigating said activities since 2018. And we know all of this only because Hunter Biden himself confirmed publicly that he is under investigation, not because of any effort by the New York Times or Politico. Those groups were content to ignore the story as Russian propaganda.

Again, it was an embarrassing year for the press.

In a way, it's fitting that news coverage in the Trump era should end as poorly as it began, back when journalists misreported everything from the disappearance of a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office to mass resignations at the State Department.

Fou Ts’ong, Pianist Whose Family Letters Inspired a Generation, Dies at 86

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Fou Ts’ong, a Chinese pianist known for his sensitive interpretations of Chopin, Debussy and Mozart, and whose letters from his father, a noted translator and writer, influenced a generation of Chinese readers, died Monday at a hospital in London, where he had lived for many years. He was 86.
The cause was the coronavirus, said Patsy Toh, a pianist, who had been married to Fou since 1975.
In 1955, Fou became one of the first Chinese pianists to achieve global prominence when he took third place in the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, Poland, also winning a special prize for his performance of Chopin’s mazurkas.
Almost overnight, he became a national hero at home. To China’s nascent communist-led government, Fou’s recognition in a well-known international competition was proof that the country could stand on its own artistically in the West. Chinese reporters flocked to interview Fou, while many others sought out his father, Fu Lei, a prominent translator of French literature, for advice on child-rearing.
But the authorities’ goodwill did not last long.
Two years later, Mao Zedong initiated the Anti-Rightist Campaign, during which hundreds of thousands of Chinese intellectuals, including Fu, were persecuted. Many were tortured and banished to labor camps. Fou, then studying at the Warsaw Conservatory in Poland, was made to return to China to undergo “rectification” for several months.
Not long after going back to Warsaw, Fou found himself in a quandary. Having witnessed the increasingly tumultuous political climate back home, he knew that if he returned to China upon graduation — as the government expected him to do — he would be expected to denounce his father, an unimaginable situation.
So in December 1958, Fou fled then-communist Poland for London, where he claimed political asylum.
“About my leaving, I always felt full of regret and anguish,” he later recalled in an interview. So many intellectuals in China had suffered, he said, but he had escaped. “I felt uneasy, as if I owed something to all my friends,” he added.
After his defection to London, Fou maintained a written correspondence with his father in Shanghai — a special privilege that was said to have been personally approved by Zhou Enlai, the Chinese premier.
Then, in 1966, Mao unleashed the Cultural Revolution, a decadelong period of chaos that upended Chinese society. Militant Red Guards accused Fu, a prolific translator of writers like Balzac and Voltaire, of having “capitalistic” artistic taste, among other crimes. They humiliated and tortured the scholar and his wife for days until the couple, like many other Chinese, were driven to suicide. Fou, still in London, did not learn of his parents’ deaths until several months later.
In 1981, after China’s post-Mao government posthumously restored the reputations of Fou’s parents, a volume of letters written by his father, primarily to Fou, was published in China. Full of advice, encouragement, life teachings and stern paternal love, the book, “Fu Lei’s Family Letters,” became an instant bestseller in China.
For many, the long disquisitions on music, art and life offered a welcome contrast to the Cultural Revolution years, which saw sons turn against fathers, students against teachers and neighbors against neighbors — all in the name of politics.
“If you imagine the environment we grew up with, it was very rigid,” said Xibai Xu, a political analyst who first read the letters in middle school in Beijing. He added, “So when you read ‘Fu Lei’s Family Letters,’ you realized how a decent human life could be — a life that is very delicate and artistic, with real human emotions and not just ideology.”
Besides influencing a generation of Chinese, Fu’s words resonated long after his death with the person for whom they were originally intended.
“My father had a saying that ‘First you must be a person, then an artist, and then a musician, and only then can you be a pianist,’” Fou once recalled in an interview. “Even now, I believe in this order — that it should be this way and that I am this way.”
Fou Ts’ong was born on March 10, 1934, in Shanghai. His father, in addition to being a translator, was an art critic and a curator. His mother, Zhu Meifu, was a secretary to her husband.
Under the strict supervision of their father, Fou and his brother, Fu Min, were educated in the classical Chinese tradition, and they grew up surrounded by both Western and Chinese cultural influences. As a child, Fou studied art, philosophy and music, frequently making use of his father’s phonograph and extensive record collection.
A lover of classical music from a young age, Fou began taking piano lessons when he was 7. He later studied under a number of teachers, including Mario Paci, the Italian conductor of the Shanghai Philharmonic.
But the chaos of wartime China prevented the young pianist from receiving a systematic musical education. In 1948, Fou, then in his teens, moved with his family to the southwestern province of Yunnan, where he went through what he described as a rebellious period. It was only after returning to Shanghai several years later that he began to dedicate himself in earnest to the piano.
In 1952, Fou made his first stage appearance, playing Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. The concert caught the attention of officials in Beijing, who selected the young pianist to compete and tour in Eastern Europe, Fou’s first trip abroad.
Soon, Fou moved to Poland, where he studied at the Warsaw Conservatory on a scholarship. To prepare for the fifth Chopin Competition in Warsaw in 1955, he practiced so diligently that he hurt his fingers and was nearly cut from the first round of competition.
After the deaths of his parents in 1966, Fou stayed abroad, rising to become a renowned concert pianist on the international circuit. Though he was best known for his interpretations of Chopin, he also received acclaim for his performances of works by Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and Debussy. In a review of a 1987 recital in New York, critic Bernard Holland wrote in The New York Times of Fou’s “sensitive ear for color” and “elusive gift of melody.”
“We should hear Mr. Fou more often,” Holland wrote. “He is an artist who uses his considerable pianistic gifts in pursuit of musical goals and not for show.”
In 1979, after Mao’s death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, Fou was granted permission to return to China for the first time in more than two decades, reuniting with his brother to hold a memorial service for their parents.
On subsequent visits, Fou gave performances and lectures; he became known to many Chinese as the “Piano Poet” for his lyrical musical interpretations. Later versions of “Fu Lei’s Family Letters” were updated to include some of Fou’s letters to his father.
Fou’s death came at a time of resurgent nationalism in China. On Chinese social media, some ultranationalist commentators called him a traitor to the country for having defected decades ago, echoing similar accusations that Fou faced in the 1950s not long after settling in London.
“What would I tell them? There was nothing to say,” Fou once said of such critics in an interview. “It’s not that I was longing for the West.”
“I was choosing freedom,” he added. “It was not an easy situation. There was no other choice.”
Many other Chinese honored his memory, including well-known pianists like Li Yundi as well as Lang Lang, who called Fou “a clear stream in the world of classical music and a beacon of light in our spirit.”
“Fou Ts’ong’s legacy was to show people and musicians the importance of integrity, character and music beyond technique,” said Jindong Cai, a conductor and the director of the U.S.-China Music Institute at Bard College Conservatory of Music.
Fou’s first marriage, to Zamira Menuhin, daughter of the prominent violinist Yehudi Menuhin, ended in divorce, as did a brief marriage to Hijong Hyun. In addition to Toh, Fou is survived by a son from his first marriage, Lin Xiao; a son from his marriage to Toh, Lin Yun; and his brother.
Fou remained passionately devoted to music in his later years, playing piano for hours every day even as his fingers grew frail. It was a love that he invoked often in interviews, alongside nuggets of wisdom from his father.
“When I was very young, I wrote to my father from Poland that I was sad and lonely,” he once recalled. “He wrote back: ‘You could never be lonely. Don’t you think you are living with the greatest souls of the history of mankind all the time?’”
“Now that’s how I feel, always,” Fou said.

U.S. Reaches 20 Million COVID-19 Cases

The United States on Thursday recorded its 20 millionth case since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, surpassing a grim milestone just as the prospects for getting the virus under control quickly in the new year appeared to dim.
Half of those 20 million cases have been recorded just since Nov. 8, a reflection of how widespread and devastating the recent surge has been. And earlier this week, Colorado identified the first known case in the United States of a new variant of the virus that is believed to be much more contagious, and which threatens to overwhelm an already burdened health care system.
The United States now accounts for nearly a quarter of the more than 83 million coronavirus cases reported in the world, and nearly a fifth of the death toll. The country has recorded more than 340,000 coronavirus deaths. Reporting of deaths has been uneven in recent days because of the holidays, but the week from Dec. 15 to Dec. 22 was the worst week for coronavirus deaths in the United States over the course of the pandemic, with 18,971 new deaths recorded.
California has become the new epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, with the huge numbers of new cases reported there in recent days offsetting declines elsewhere, including in the Great Lakes, Great Plains and Mountain West states, where the surge began. Hospitals are stretched to the breaking point in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.
The federal government is beginning to distribute two vaccines that clinical trials have shown to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19. But while the vaccines’ development in record time represents a scientific triumph, the rollout so far is proving to be yet another government failure.
It has proceeded at a snail’s pace, with progress falling far behind what the administration had promised. Earlier in December, federal officials said their goal was for 20 million people to receive their first dose by the end of this year. But, while more than 14 million vaccine doses have been distributed, a mere 2.7 million have actually been administered, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dashboard. At the current rate, it would take years to vaccinate enough Americans to substantially curb the pandemic.
Meanwhile, the deaths mount, minute by minute, hour by hour.
“In 2020, we let ~340,000 Americans die, sometimes in the thousands per day,” Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor in epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “And we watched. There were no protests, no daily banner headlines befitting a national tragedy on this scale. It’s as if we watched 9/11 in a loop for 300+ days.”

Georgia Republicans Deliver Persistent Message: Fear the Democrats

NORCROSS, Ga. — The biggest applause lines in Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s stump speech are not about Loeffler at all.
When the crowd is most engaged, including Thursday morning at a community pavilion in suburban Atlanta, Loeffler invokes President Donald Trump or attacks her Democratic opponents as socialists and Marxists. Her own policy platforms are rarely mentioned.
“Are you ready to keep fighting for President Trump and show America that Georgia is a red state?” Loeffler said when she took the microphone. “We are the firewall to stopping socialism and we have to hold the line.”
Such are the themes of the closing arguments in the all-important Georgia Senate runoffs, which have reflected the partisanship and polarization of the national political environment. Loeffler and her Senate colleague, David Perdue, are seeking to motivate a conservative base that is still loyal to Trump while also clawing back some of the defectors who helped deliver Georgia to a Democratic presidential nominee for the first time since 1992.
Democrats are eager to prove that Joe Biden’s victory over Trump in Georgia was more than a fluke, and that the state is ready to embrace their party’s more progressive policy agenda, rather than anti-Trumpness alone.
But the race is also emblematic of each party’s current political messages. Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic Senate candidates, have put forth an array of policy proposals that blend the shared priorities of the moderate center and the progressive left: passing a new Voting Rights Act, expanding Medicaid without backing a single payer system, investment in clean energy while stopping short of the Green New Deal, and criminal justice reform that does not include defunding the police.
Republicans are seeking no such calibration. Perdue, who announced Thursday that he would quarantine after coming into contact with someone who had tested positive for the coronavirus, and Loeffler are banking that their loyalists are motivated more by what their candidates stand against than by what they stand for.
There are signs that this approach has resonated with many Republican voters. At Loeffler’s event in Norcross, and later at a New Year’s Eve concert in Gainesville, voters said their top priorities were supporting Trump and his allegations of voter fraud and beating back the perceived excesses of liberals and their candidates.
“The biggest factor for me is stopping socialism,” said Melinda Weeks, a 62-year-old voter who lives in Gwinnett County. “I don’t want to see our country become the Chinese Communist Party.”
John Wright, 64, said that he was voting for Loeffler and Perdue but that he thinks Republicans must do a better job of reaching minority voters. He cited the change in racial makeup that has continued apace in Georgia and fueled Democrats’ chances at winning statewide seats.
“Republicans need to figure out how to help these people, how to reach these people,” Wright said. “Those demographics are changing, and you can’t just pitch the American dream to people who haven’t been able to achieve the American dream.”
The statewide jockeying comes at a tumultuous time in Georgia politics, as Trump continues to upend the Senate races with his baseless accusations of voter fraud, persistent attacks on the state’s Republican governor and secretary of state, and bombastic tweets regarding the coronavirus relief package.
In the past month alone, Trump has called for Gov. Brian Kemp to resign, accused Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of having a brother in cahoots with the Chinese government (Raffensperger does not have a brother), threatened to veto the pandemic relief package, sided with Democrats on the need for bigger stimulus checks, and claimed Georgia Republicans were “fools” who were virtually controlled by Stacey Abrams and the Democrats.
Trump is scheduled to visit northwest Georgia on Monday, just one day before election day. The appearance underscores the complicated relationship Republicans have with the departing president at this time, according to party operatives and members of the state Republican caucus. They need Trump to motivate the base, while he remains a source of tension that has put Perdue and Loeffler under significant pressure in the runoffs.
Trump is “delivering a sort of mixed message,” said Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. “Because if you look at the rally he held down at Valdosta, the first time he came down, he spent more time airing his own grievances over the presidential election and claiming that he was cheated out of victory than he really did supporting Loeffler or Purdue. He endorsed them, but he didn’t seem to be as concerned about those races as he was about trying to re-litigate the presidential race.”
Charles. S. Bullock III, a political-science professor at the University of Georgia, said the critical question surrounding Trump’s rally is: “Will it convince some people who have up until that point said they’re not going to vote?”
Democrats, he said, had appeared to have done a better job in getting people to the polls for early voting, which ended in some places Thursday. “So that would be the last moment — a last chance effort to get folks who have been sitting on the sidelines,” Bullock said.
Democratic candidates spent New Year’s Eve targeting voters representing their base: young voters, minority voters in the Atlanta area, and liberal churchgoers. Ossoff was scheduled to speak at two virtual “Watch Night” services, the New Year’s Eve tradition that dates to 1862, when freed Black Americans living in Union states gathered in anticipation of the Emancipation Proclamation.
Ossoff and Warnock have several drive-in rallies scheduled from Friday through election day, including separate events with Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
More than 3 million residents have already cast a ballot in the races. The breakdown of votes so far has buoyed Democratic hopes: Population centers such as Fulton and DeKalb counties in metropolitan Atlanta are posting sky-high turnout numbers, and the percentage of Black voters continues to trend above presidential election levels.
Videos of nearly four-hour-long voting lines in Cobb County angered some liberal groups and voting rights advocates who said it was a failure of state and local leadership. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund sent two letters to Raffensperger, the state’s lead election official, which warned that an increase of polling locations in the county was necessary to accommodate increased turnout.
Republicans believe that many of their supporters are waiting until Tuesday to vote in person. Across the country in November, Republicans saw big in-person voting turnout wipe away Democratic leads in states like Florida and Texas. Republicans could also be particularly keen to cast their ballots in person this time, considering the widespread fears of voter fraud that Trump has instilled in his base since his loss.
The announcement that Perdue would be temporarily off the campaign trail in the race’s final days startled some Republicans, who had been gearing up for Trump’s visit Monday. Perdue is still hopeful that he will attend the rally with the president, according to a person familiar with the campaign, considering he has not tested positive for the virus and has several days to test negative before the event.
Even before Thursday, when his campaign revealed the virus exposure, Perdue had done fewer public events than Loeffler or their Democratic opponents. The campaign did not provide an exact timeline for when Perdue might return to public events.
“The senator and his wife have been tested regularly throughout the campaign, and the team will continue to follow CDC guidelines,” a statement read.
At the New Year’s Eve Concert in Gainesville on Thursday, organized by the two Republican senators’ campaigns, Perdue’s absence was not acknowledged. Instead, speakers used Trump’s scheduled appearance Monday as a hook: Go vote Tuesday after watching the president the day before.
Loeffler was joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who emphasized that turnout in the north was crucial to overcoming Democratic enthusiasm in urban centers.
“This is the part of the state that runs up the score to neutralize Atlanta, you get that?” he said. “If Republicans win, I'm the budget chairman. If we lose Georgia, Bernie Sanders is the budget chairman.”
He left no room for subtext. A vote for Republicans in Georgia, Graham said, was a vote to ensure Democrats can get little of their agenda enacted in Washington.
“Anything that comes out of Pelosi's House, it’ll come to the Senate and we’ll kill it dead,” he said, as the crowd roared with approval.
“If you’re a conservative and that doesn’t motivate you to vote, then you’re legally dead.”

A.J. Edelman was worried.
He knew about devastating crashes in the sledding sports, particularly in his specialty, skeleton, and about the retired athletes who struggled with memory loss and an inability to perform simple activities, like reading.
He wanted to pursue his Olympic dream though, even if doing so would risk damaging his brain. So he devised a new technique for hurtling down the icy track, thinking his innovation would keep him safer.
But when Edelman made it to the 2018 Winter Olympics — competing for Israel, his adopted second country — officials there disallowed his new technique, saying it violated the sport’s rules. He finished the event in 28th place out 30 competitors and then retired, having accomplished far more than anyone could have predicted when he entered the sport 3 1/2 years earlier, crashing on his very first run.
A Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate, Edelman settled into pursuing a master’s of business administration at Yale. Though he played ice hockey while growing up in suburban Boston and made the team at MIT, sports had never been his primary calling. He seemed ready to move on.
Yet the lure of the Olympic Games can make people act in surprising ways. Parents subject their children to coaches who blur the line between discipline and abuse. Runners foolishly starve themselves to lose weight, believing lighter bodies will mean more speed.
And athletes like Edelman sign up again for repeated brain-rattling rides at 75 mph, even when they have had headaches, blurred vision, dizziness, depression, exhaustion and other symptoms associated with traumatic brain injuries. And even as there is a growing awareness about a series of deaths from overdoses, suicides and lingering neurological problems that former athletes in sledding sports have experienced in recent years.
Now Edelman, who has taken a break from business school, has decided to try another sledding sport, becoming a bobsled driver and aiming to reach the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.
“I know I am going to get hurt brain-wise doing this,” Edelman, 29, wrote in a recent text message. He also expects to spend more than $100,000 of his own money on the effort, which will mean draining his savings, borrowing what he can, seeking donors and trying to auction off his Olympic ring. “The mission is more important than my health or savings.”
The bobsled feels safer to him, he said, because he sits upright and can see where he is going. His family is still concerned. After an article about the dangers of sledding sports appeared in The New York Times this summer, Edelman texted his father, a cardiologist and a professor of biomedical engineering, asking him not to show the article to his mother.
“Only 2 seasons. I’m out after 2022, no matter what,” he wrote to his father.
“Please be careful,” his father, Elazer Edelman, responded.
Making the Olympic Games generally requires years of practice, beginning at an early age.
Bobsled and skeleton are the rare exceptions, and that is part of the appeal for Edelman. They are sports with perhaps 1,000 athletes combined globally (the exact number is difficult to quantify), with little recreational participation. Many of the sports’ athletes had barely heard of bobsled or skeleton until they were adults.
Then someone — a coach, another athlete, a stranger in a gym — suggested their strength and speed, honed for years in track and field, or football or rugby, might transfer well to these little-known Olympic sports. Lolo Jones, the standout hurdler, competed in bobsled at the 2018 Winter Games and is trying for 2022.
There are only 16 bobsled tracks in the world. Four are in Germany, and many of the others are in remote mountain towns, which helps make sledding sports among the most inaccessible in the world. Also, sleds are expensive, about $40,000 for a used model and $100,000 for a new one.
And yet that inaccessibility is what ultimately makes elite-level participation accessible. Because almost no one outside Germany grows up as a bobsledder, someone like Edelman can share a world-class distinction with Michael Phelps — being an Olympian.
“There is a big expense and you have to get to a place where there is a track, so these aren’t the easiest sports to get into, but almost anyone can try it,” said David Greaves, who became an Israeli citizen two decades ago and leads Bobsled/Skeleton Israel, the national governing body, from his home in Canada. “It’s doable if you have decent athletic ability and you are in some ways fearless, because very few people get on the sled a second time.”
Edelman was eligible for Israeli citizenship because he is Jewish, and he had fallen in love with the country during a high school trip there.
In 2014, Edelman realized he had a shot at becoming an Olympian by representing Israel in a sledding sport. A Mediterranean country that is half-desert, Israel had never had an athlete compete in Olympic bobsled, skeleton or luge (feet-first sledding) and barely funds those sports.
Learning technique from YouTube videos, Edelman took as many skeleton runs as he could to make up for lost time, sometimes hurtling down the track nine times in a single day. That volume of training is three times what most experienced athletes endure. Many of the sport’s coaches and officials now acknowledge that excessive daily training runs increase the likelihood of brain injuries, even if crashes do not occur.
In 2018, two years after becoming an Israeli citizen, Edelman qualified for the Olympics in South Korea, Israel’s first Olympic competitor in skeleton. Edelman mitigated the risks of brain injury by using a longer face shield that allowed him to rest his head on the sled, limiting the chances that his head would bang off the ice as gravitational forces spiked around tight turns.
He used the technique in several international races, but a last-minute ruling by skeleton officials in South Korea prevented him from using it in the Olympics. He beat only athletes from Jamaica and Ghana.
Heartbroken, Edelman fell into a deep depression. Doctors told him the excessive training had probably exacerbated it.
“It is possible that multiple head strikes have played a role in increased neuropsychiatric symptoms e.g., impulsivity, mood swings,” Mary-Ellen Meadows, a neuropsychologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, wrote in October 2018 after evaluating Edelman. He has committed to donating his brain upon his death to Boston University’s Concussion Legacy Foundation.
Then, late last year, his depression and other lingering effects of skeleton training abated, and he felt the pull of the Olympic rings again. He impressed an Australian coach during a trial bobsled run. The coach told Edelman if he trained hard and found some strong, fast teammates to push the sled, he could qualify for the next Winter Olympics.
Edelman recruited three Israeli Arabs who play for the national rugby team to push the bobsled and tuck behind him for the 50-second runs down the ice.
The men, Amir and Ward Fawarsy, who are cousins, and Moran Nijem, are students at the Wingate Institute for Physical Education and Sports in Netanya, a seaside city in Israel. Until December, they had yet to ride in a bobsled or see a track in person.
Much of what they knew about the sport before they met Edelman they learned by watching “Cool Runnings,” the 1993 movie loosely based on Jamaica’s bobsled team at the 1988 Winter Olympics.
As Olympic narratives go, the story of the Israeli bobsled team is seductive. Representing a nation torn by religious and ethnic conflict for more than 60 years, three Arabs and a Jew are coming together, potentially on the biggest stage in sports.
Nijem and the Fawarsy cousins joined Edelman in late December in South Korea, where Edelman has been working on his driving skills. Edelman plans to have more than 200 practice runs by the end of the season — which would mean two to three runs a day three or four days a week through the winter.
Greaves said Bobsled/Skeleton Israel had hired Aliyah Snyder, a neuropsychologist and former skeleton athlete to develop safety protocols. Snyder spent years recovering from brain injuries, she said in an interview in November.
Qualification is hardly guaranteed for the Israeli team, especially with the coronavirus pandemic limiting travel and making it more difficult for sleds to achieve the necessary number of races and quality performances to make it to the Olympics.
Nijem said he was not worried about the potential danger of getting into a sled with a novice driver still learning how not to flip a 200-pound sled on a treacherous curves.
“If A.J. crashes, we still trust him,” he said in an interview last month.
“We are rugby players,” Amir Fawarsy added. “We know all about concussions.”

5 Anchorwomen to Leave NY1 After Settling Discrimination Suit

NEW YORK — Five NY1 anchorwomen, including longtime New York City television personality Roma Torre, are leaving the local news channel after settling an age and gender discrimination lawsuit against the beloved local media institution.
“After engaging in a lengthy dialogue with NY1, we believe it is in everyone’s interest — ours, NY1’s, and our viewers’ — that this litigation be resolved, and we have mutually agreed to part ways,” Torre, along with her fellow plaintiffs, Amanda Farinacci, Vivian Lee, Jeanine Ramirez and Kristen Shaughnessy, wrote in a statement on Thursday.
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
The announcement ended a legal saga that began in June 2019, when the anchorwomen, who at the time ranged in age from 40 to 61, sued NY1’s parent, cable company Charter Communications, alleging they had been forced off the air and rebuffed by managers who favored younger, less experienced hosts.
The decision by the anchorwomen to leave NY1 entirely was a jarring outcome for many viewers, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
“2020 was a year of loss, and NY1 just lost five of their best reporters,” Cuomo wrote on Twitter on Thursday. “This is a tremendous loss for all of their viewers.”
For New Yorkers who revered NY1 as a lo-fi televised public square for the five boroughs — with amiable anchors who were part of the all-in-the-neighborhood charm — the discrimination lawsuit was bracing. In the legal complaint, Torre, a signature on-air presence who joined the network at its start in 1992, described her frustration at what she perceived as NY1’s more favorable treatment of the channel’s star morning anchor, Pat Kiernan, including a glitzy ad campaign and a new studio that she said she was barred from using.
Executives at Charter responded that the suit and its allegations were meritless, describing NY1 as “a respectful and fair workplace.” The company noted that Cheryl Wills, another long-serving female anchor, had been appointed host of a prominent weeknight newscast as part of a network revamp.
On Thursday, Charter, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, said it was “pleased” by the resolution of the anchorwomen’s suit. “We want to thank them for their years of dedicated service in reporting the news for New Yorkers, and we wish them well in their future endeavors,” Charter said in a statement.
Torre and the other plaintiffs continued to appear on air in their regular slots at NY1 while the lawsuit was pending. But tensions occasionally spilled into open view.
In early December, the New York Post wrote about a demand by a lawyer for the journalists that Charter reveal Kiernan’s contract as a way to determine his salary. (The demand was denied.) Another court filing accused Kiernan’s talent agent of trying to intimidate Torre by telling her brother that the suit should be dropped, a claim the agent denied.
The women were represented by the firm of Douglas H. Wigdor, a prominent Manhattan employment lawyer who has brought discrimination suits against major companies including Citigroup, Fox News and Starbucks.
The lawsuit also touched on larger tensions in the TV news business, an industry where older women can often find their careers fading as male colleagues thrive. In the world of New York TV, the case evoked memories of Sue Simmons, the popular WNBC-TV anchor who was ousted in 2012 and whose longtime co-anchor, Chuck Scarborough, remains a star at the station.
“We feel we are being railroaded out of the place,” Torre told The New York Times in 2019, when the suit was filed. “Men age on TV with a sense of gravitas, and we as women have an expiration date.”

Daniel M. Tellep, an aerospace engineer who initiated a merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta to form the world’s largest military contractor, then became its first CEO, died Nov. 26 at his home in Saratoga, California. He was 89.
His death was confirmed by his daughter Susan Tellep.
Tellep was at Lockheed’s helm as the Cold War was ending. Lockheed, based in Calabasas, California, was struggling and looking at potentially diminished demand with the relaxation of global tensions, as was Martin Marietta, led at the time by Norman R. Augustine. The merger, in 1995, created a defense industry behemoth. In 2019, Lockheed Martin net sales were $59.8 billion.
“The ‘merger of equals’” that he orchestrated between Lockheed and Martin “led to innovations and capabilities that continue to protect our nation, our allies, and our highest ideals,” Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin’s executive chair, said in a statement after Tellep’s death.
As a CEO at Lockheed and then at Lockheed Martin, Tellep oversaw development of military communications satellites, photographic intelligence satellites, the Hubble Space Telescope and more.
As an engineer at Lockheed, he was a pioneer of space and missile technology systems. He was the principal scientist on the country’s first reentry flight experiments, conducted to determine how a nuclear missile could best go through the atmosphere, into space and then back into the atmosphere without being destroyed. He also worked on submarine-launched ballistic missile systems and on producing thermal tiles to protect space shuttles.
“He had a lot of knowledge of how to keep things from burning up, basically,” his longtime colleague David Klinger said in a phone interview. “He was very good at the mathematics as well as the practical side to actually make things work. And he was so good that the company put him in charge of more and more people.”
Daniel Tellep was born on Nov. 20, 1931, in Forest City, Pennsylvania, about 25 miles northeast of Scranton, to John and Mary Tellep. His father worked as a coal processor and then as a carpenter. His mother, who had immigrated from Eastern Europe as a child, worked for a thread company. The family later moved to San Diego, where his father worked as a machinist and where Daniel grew up.
Daniel was obsessed with flight from a young age, when he began developing a lifelong passion for model airplanes; in a memoir he wrote for his family, he recalled building his first:
“No doubt the finished model was crude, but there it was, three-dimensional, recognizable as one of the popular airplanes of the era, and I could hold it out on my arm and move it as if it was in flight. I remember looking at it for hours.”
He studied mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating summa cum laude in 1954 and earning a master’s degree in 1955. He joined Lockheed that year. He was the principal scientist on the X-17, one of the earliest research rockets.
Tellep’s work in reentry technology and thermodynamics won him, at 32, the Lawrence B. Sperry Award from the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics. He was later elected to the National Academy of Engineering.
Rising through Lockheed’s ranks, Tellep was named president in 1984 and chair and CEO in 1989. The company had been struggling, and he helped turn it around. He was in charge when it won a large contract to build the F-22, the newest generation of Air Force fighter planes at the time. The contract translated to $70 billion in revenue for the company and its partners and solidified Lockheed’s corporate rebound.
He leadership was noticed.
“Throughout Lockheed’s travails over the past several years, Mr. Tellep has maintained his characteristic outward calm and affability,” The New York Times wrote of him in 1991, “though he proved himself to be as tough as the most ruthless corporate raider.”
Tellep became Lockheed Martin’s first chair and CEO in 1995, serving as CEO for nine months and remaining as chair until 1998.
He met Margaret Lewis, in college and married her in 1954. The couple had four girls and later divorced. He met and married Patricia Baumgartner, a psychotherapist, in 1970. They remained together until her death in 2005.
In addition to his daughter Susan, he is survived by his three other daughters, Teresa and Mary Tellep and Patricia Axelrod; his first wife, with whom he remained close; two stepdaughters from his second marriage, Chris Chatwell and Anne Bossange; seven grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
Tellep’s passion for flight extended into his adult years, when he would take to the sky in engineless gliders, a pursuit requiring deep knowledge of wind and thermodynamics. He flew radio-controlled airplanes into his early 80s. And the model planes he built as a boy, including a treasured one he lost, remained in his memories.
“On a hot summer day, I launched the glider,” he wrote in his family memoir, “and it seemed to circle forever, barely descending. This was when I learned about ‘thermals.’ This rising column of air carries with it all things light — and this included my glider. Since I didn’t put my name on it, there was no way it could be returned. Now, so many years later, it is with me in a different way.”

NEW YORK — New Yorkers stand this week as the living footnotes of tomorrow’s textbooks. The year 2020 will be studied by historians, scientists and schoolchildren for generations, and yet it will be known by many of those who lived through it for the singular moments that arrived behind a pandemic’s deadly waves.
Dimitrios Fragiskatos, forced to shut down his comic book store in Brooklyn for almost three months, will remember 2020 as the year he started an online shop and regulars from his fantasy game tournaments helped it flourish.
“It was a kind of restoration of faith in humanity,” Fragiskatos said. “‘Change or die’ — isn’t that the saying?”
Richard Schwartz and Amy Jablin, together nearly 10 years, will define the year by their October rooftop wedding, attended by four socially distant witnesses.
Sarah Goodis-Orenstein, a schoolteacher from Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, said the pandemic, by erasing her commute, forced her to slow down and spend more time with her young children.
“There’s some pieces of normalcy that I don’t really want back,” she said. “Our normal wasn’t always ideal.”
The Year Like None Before, the Year That Lasted Forever is finally drawing to a close, becoming a thing that happened even as its tolls follow into 2021. More than 25,000 New Yorkers who rang in 2020 died of the coronavirus in the months that followed. For those who bore witness, this has been a time for taking stock and taking a breath amid all that has changed.
The city was ending the year hopeful, if unwell, its big annual party blocked off and its people unsure of exactly how to celebrate, if at all. It’s a question familiar in other tumultuous years.
In 1918, as an influenza epidemic ravaged the city, Times Square was somber, “crowded, but the procession was as quiet as if on the way to the parish church,” The New York Times reported. In 1941, a few weeks after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, air raid sirens and 2,000 police officers surrounded Times Square. And New Year’s Eve the month after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 found many skipping the fancy balls and gathering instead for special evening church services.
Several New Yorkers, asked about New Year’s Eve plans, expressed shock it was almost here. In the year that seemed to alter the passage of time, when an afternoon or a month could go by practically unnoticed, and with all the familiar forms of celebration off-limits, some said they had no plans at all.
Others had concrete aspirations and the tools to make them happen: a new down jacket, bought especially for dinner outside. A spot on the sofa and snacks for movie night. A glowing screen for those home alone but among friends.
In Long Island City, Queens, the Hasman family — mother, father and daughter Sofie, 11, one another’s constant company since March — said they would each select two songs that everyone has to dance to.
“We’ll all dance together as a family,” said Theresa Hasman, 46, “and just have to go with the flow.”
The dancing was to cap a long evening: At noon, they were planning to gather online with Hasman’s parents in her native Denmark — where it would be 6 p.m. — and have a glass of Champagne and watch the queen’s annual speech. Hasman spent 2020 making homemade masks for health care workers and patients when supplies were low. One mother who received a mask sent a message saying she endured labor and childbirth while wearing one.
“People wrote the nicest notes,” she said. “I will always keep them.”
Some said they would keep it simple. Vallnez Mozell, 44, from Mill Basin in Brooklyn, had planned to end the year on her sofa with her husband, William, and their 6-year-old son, Rhys, watching some movie from the 1980s; “The Goonies” was a recent crowd-pleaser. Schwartz and Jablin, the newlyweds, would meet friends at a restaurant. Schwartz bought a new coat for the occasion.
One couple in Astoria, Queens — Ken Bergreen, an advertising manager, and his partner, Cassandra Lam, who runs the curry paste and hot sauce company Mama Lam’s — normally travel over the holiday: 2018 in Vermont, 2019 in Portugal. In 2020: “No plans at all,” he said.
Ali Lake, a New Yorker who planned to spend the night in Boston with one — and only one — old friend, Alexandra Yesian, would nevertheless be dressed to party.
“I bought this amazing sequin dress,” Lake said, “even though Alexandra will be the only one to see me in it.”
New Yorkers looked back at the year that was and noted where they had been pushed along to new and interesting places and where the year had left them feeling stranded off to the side.
Virginia Gourin, 76, was a career babysitter for decades in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Word-of-mouth kept her busy with toddlers; she converted one room in her apartment into something resembling the showroom of FAO Schwarz with its big stuffed animals.
As news of the coronavirus began to intensify early in 2020, Gourin was at the carousel in Central Park with a 3-year-old in her charge. She remembered thinking, “This is like a dream;. I hope something bad doesn’t happen.”
Her work halted immediately, leaving her lonely and adrift. She closed off the playroom, its cheerfulness unbearable.
“It’s heartbreaking,” she said. “I aged.”
A high school sophomore from Long Island City — Kayan Abu Juma, 16 — felt the opposite sensation. His growth into adulthood was stunted by the virus and the end of in-person school.
“At home, you really start to slack off,” he said. “I’m really lost, and I don’t know what to do.”
His plans for 2021 feel intensely urgent: “I want to experience new things in life and look forward to what I’m going to do when I grow up. I know that I’m not supposed to worry about this now, but I really need to start thinking about it. Thinking that I’m going to be lost is really putting me in a state of stress.”
Elsewhere, New Yorkers found reasons to give thanks as 2020 wound down. Mozell, who makes accessories and shoes, pivoted to masks when the pandemic hit; one unique design commemorated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while another bore an “I Voted” check mark.
Lake, a 28-year-old assistant at a literary agency, focused on writing an adventure novel for young adults. A couple in Sunnyside, Queens, Paul Metzger and Mary Giaimo, found great comfort in long walks — “like a sacrament,” Giaimo said. Tselmeg Zuunbaatar and Nathan Kan, both college students from New Jersey who were visiting Central Park recently, met through friends, “socially distant caught each other’s eyes,” Zuunbaatar said, and began dating.
Others were simply looking forward to the end of this harrowing year.
To Jada Jones, 25, who moved to New York from Chicago a week before the pandemic arrived, New Year’s is just another holiday ruined, and dwelling on it only makes her strangely miss the dark days of March. Back then, staggered by the speed at which the city shut down and not knowing how long it would last, one could hope.
“But at this point in December I can say that, for myself and a lot of my friends, that we’ve fully transitioned,” said Jones, who lives in Brooklyn. Frustration has become resignation: “We’re no longer upset.”
To have lived through history is to hope — or even demand — that it be remembered in ways that feel true and honest. New Yorkers in 2020 thought about what they want their future neighbors, their successors — the newcomers of 2050 — to know about what the city endured.
“I want people to remember that there are a lot of people in New York who are not rich and who need help,” Giaimo said. “I think once this is over, it’s going to be normal to pay $20 for a bottle of wine — no, a glass of wine. That’s what this city has become.”
Shanell Duck, 33, hopes future Americans can embrace hard-fought progress in areas of race and economic disparity — or keep fighting for it.
“They are intense and draining conversations emotionally,” she said. “So what is the willpower to continue?”
Bergreen, the advertising manager in Astoria, sought to remember the positive changes he saw out his window.
“For the first time in New York, everybody kind of stepped back and looked out for each other,” he said.
Mozell would agree.
“They say New Yorkers are rude and inconsiderate — no,” she said. “I’m proud of our city for that.”
Bob Cucurullo, a 67-year-old accountant, walked in Central Park with Charlie, his rescue dog, on a recent afternoon.
“I give 2020 two stars,” he said.
It could have been worse, in his eyes, and a vaccine brings hope.
He wanted to speak directly to those not yet born, who might someday read this paragraph.
“Don’t count New York out,” he said. “We always come back.”

PARIS — It is done at last. On Jan. 1, with the Brexit transition period over, Britain will no longer be part of the European Union’s single market and customs union. The departure will be ordered, thanks to a last-minute deal running to more than 1,200 pages, but still painful to both sides. A great loss will be consummated.
Loss for the European Union of one of its biggest member states — a major economy, a robust military and the tradition, albeit faltering, of British liberalism at a time when Hungary and Poland have veered toward nationalism.
Loss for Britain of diplomatic heft in a world of renewed great power rivalry; of some future economic growth; of clarity over European access for its big financial services industry; and of countless opportunities to study, live, work and dream across the continent.
The national cry of “Take back control” that fired the Brexit vote in an outburst of anti-immigrant fervor and random grievances withered into 4 1/2 years of painful negotiation pitting a minnow against a mammoth. Posturing encountered reality. The British economy is less than one-fifth the size of the bloc’s. President Donald Trump is leaving office, and with him goes any hope of a rapid offsetting British-American trade agreement.
“Brexit is an act of mutual weakening,” Michel Barnier, the chief European Union negotiator, told the French daily Le Figaro.
But the weakening is uneven. Britain is closer to fracture. The possibility has increased that Scotland and Northern Ireland will opt to leave the United Kingdom and, by different means, rejoin the European Union. The bloc, by contrast, has in some ways been galvanized by the trauma of Brexit. It has overcome long-standing obstacles, lifted its ambitions and reignited the Franco-German motor of closer union.
“Brexit is not good news for anyone, but it has unquestionably contributed to a reconsolidation of Europe, which demonstrated its unity throughout the negotiations,” said François Delattre, secretary-general of the French foreign ministry.
The European Union — prodded by Brexit, facing the coronavirus pandemic and confronting the hostility of Trump — has done things previously unimaginable. It has taken steps in a quasi-federal direction that Britain always opposed.
Germany abandoned a tenacious policy of austerity. The federalization of European debt, long taboo for the Germans, became possible. The European Union can now borrow as a government does — a step toward sovereign stature and a means to finance the $918 billion pandemic recovery fund that a British presence would probably have blocked.
“Brexit made Angela Merkel willing to abandon positions that had been sacred,” said Karl Kaiser, a former head of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “There has long been a debate about widening or deepening the European Union. Well, it has deepened.”
Part of this process has been a rethinking of Europe’s role. President Emmanuel Macron of France now speaks often of a need for “strategic autonomy.” At the heart of this idea lies the conviction that, confronted by Russia and China and a United States whose unreliability has become evident, Europe must develop its military arm to buttress independent policies. European soft power goes only so far.
“Who would have said three years ago that Europe would adhere so quickly to a budgetary relaunch through shared debt and to strategic military and technological autonomy?” Macron told the French weekly magazine L’Express in December. “This is essential, because France’s destiny lies in a sovereign Europe.”
He alluded to an autonomous Europe operating “beside America and China,” a telling formulation.
Military autonomy is a long way off, probably a pipe dream. The attachment of Central and Eastern European states to NATO, and through it to the United States as a European power, is strong. Germany recognizes the need for an adjusted trans-Atlantic bond but does not question the bond itself. Nor, in the end, does France.
Still, the European Union, through its European defense fund, agreed in 2020 to invest more than $10 billion in jointly developed military equipment, technology and greater mobility — not a lot, and less than planned, but enough to indicate a new European state of mind. When France and Germany plan a “euro-drone,” something has shifted.
This change will almost certainly lead to tensions between the European Union and the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who, as one official put it, “is part of the Euro-American décor.”
Biden, a regular at the Munich Security Conference for decades, is by formation and experience a man with a traditional view of the alliance: The United States leads; allies fall into line. But the world has changed. The impact of the Trump years — and of an America AWOL during the global crisis caused by the pandemic — cannot be waved away.
“You can only lose trust once,” said Nicole Bacharan, a French political analyst. “When it’s gone, it’s gone. We’ve learned that an American president can just undo things.”
Most European governments are delighted to see Trump go. They believe that American decency has returned in Biden. They do not, however, necessarily equate their relief with a long honeymoon, even if the incoming president and Antony Blinken, his nominee for secretary of state, are aware that times have changed and that solving big problems demands the give-and-take multilateralism that Trump shunned.
On China policy, on Iran, on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and on climate issues, a Europe girded by the experience of a U.S. president who scorned NATO and coddled Russia will be more assertive. Already France and Germany have cooperated on a voluminous dossier covering all major international issues and handed it to officials in the future Biden administration.
Of course, the ailing European Union that produced Brexit and rising nationalism has not gone away — a union perceived as too bureaucratic and insufficiently democratic. The divisions that plague a now 27-member entity, with 19 of those countries sharing a currency but none of them sharing a government, will not disappear.
Still, the European Union has been jolted into a new sense of its value. Brexit looks like a one-off. The nations of Europe have seen up close that a divorce is always a defeat — and a negotiation whose end point is new barriers is, too.
Britain’s decision to leave was quintessentially of its era — an act inspired by an imaginary past, borne aloft by an imaginary future, turbocharged by social media and enabled by the withered hold of truth. It was a failure of the dream of a “United States of Europe” — on the continent that British and U.S. troops died to liberate from the Nazis — first articulated by Winston Churchill in 1946 when he spoke of a free Europe offering “the simple joys and hopes that make life worth living.”
Everyone in Europe — and Britain is — has lost something. But as Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of what would become the European Union, observed, “Europe makes itself in crises.”

How Does the Coronavirus Variant Spread? Here’s What Scientists Know

A more contagious form of the coronavirus has begun circulating in the United States.
In Britain, where it was first identified, the new variant became the predominant form of the coronavirus in just three months, accelerating that nation’s surge and filling its hospitals. It may do the same in the United States, exacerbating an unrelenting rise in deaths and overwhelming the already strained health care system, experts warned.
A variant that spreads more easily also means that people will need to religiously adhere to precautions like social distancing, mask-wearing, hand hygiene and improved ventilation — unwelcome news to many Americans already chafing against restrictions.
“The bottom line is that anything we do to reduce transmission will reduce transmission of any variants, including this one,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert affiliated with Georgetown University. But “it may mean that the more targeted measures that are not like a full lockdown won’t be as effective.”
What does it mean for this variant to be more transmissible? What makes this variant more contagious than previous iterations of the virus? And why should we worry about a variant that spreads more easily but does not seem to make anyone sicker?
We asked experts to weigh in on the evolving research into this new version of the coronavirus.
The new variant seems to spread more easily between people.
Many variants of the coronavirus have cropped up since the pandemic began. But all evidence so far suggests that the new mutant, called B.1.1.7, is more transmissible than previous forms. It first surfaced in September in Britain but already accounts for more than 60% of new cases in London and neighboring areas.
The new variant seems to infect more people than earlier versions of the coronavirus, even when the environments are the same. It’s not clear what gives the variant this advantage, although there are indications that it may infect cells more efficiently.
It’s also difficult to say exactly how much more transmissible the new variant may be, because scientists have not yet done the kind of lab experiments that are required. Most of the conclusions have been drawn from epidemiological observations, and “there’s so many possible biases in all the available data,” cautioned Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government.
Scientists initially estimated that the new variant was 70% more transmissible, but a recent modeling study pegged that number at 56%. Once researchers sift through all the data, it’s possible that the variant will turn out to be just 10% to 20% percent more transmissible, said Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
Even so, Bedford said, it is likely to catch on rapidly and become the predominant form in the United States by March. Scientists like Bedford are tracking all the known variants closely to detect any further changes that might alter their behavior.
Apart from greater transmissibility, the variant behaves like earlier versions.
The new mutant virus may spread more easily, but in every other way it seems little different than its predecessors.
The variant does not seem to make people any sicker or lead to more deaths. Still, there is cause for concern: A variant that is more transmissible will increase the death toll simply because it will spread faster and infect more people.
“In that sense, it’s just a numbers game,” Rasmussen said. The effect will be amplified “in places like the U.S. and the U.K., where the health care system is really at its breaking point.”
The routes of transmission — by large and small droplets, and tiny aerosolized particles adrift in crowded indoor spaces — have not changed. That means masks, limiting time with others and improving ventilation in indoor spaces will all help contain the variant’s spread, as these measures do with other variants of the virus.
“By minimizing your exposure to any virus, you’re going to reduce your risk of getting infected, and that’s going to reduce transmission overall,” Rasmussen said.
Infection with the new variant may increase the amount of virus in the body.
Some preliminary evidence from Britain suggests that people infected with the new variant tend to carry greater amounts of the virus in their noses and throats than those infected with previous versions.
“We’re talking in the range between 10-fold greater and 10,000-fold greater,” said Michael Kidd, a clinical virologist at Public Health England and a clinical adviser to the British government who has studied the phenomenon.
There are other explanations for the finding — Kidd and his colleagues did not have access to information about when in their illness people were tested, for example, which could affect their so-called viral loads.
Still, the finding does offer one possible explanation for why the new variant spreads more easily. The more virus that infected people harbor in their noses and throats, the more they expel into the air and onto surfaces when they breathe, talk, sing, cough or sneeze.
As a result, situations that expose people to the virus carry a greater chance of seeding new infections. Some new data indicate that people infected with the new variant spread the virus to more of their contacts.
With previous versions of the virus, contact tracing suggested that about 10% of people who have close contact with an infected person — within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes — inhaled enough virus to become infected.
“With the variant, we might expect 15% of those,” Bedford said. “Currently risky activities become more risky.”
Scientists are still learning how the mutations have changed the virus.
The variant has 23 mutations, compared with the version that erupted in Wuhan, China, a year ago. But 17 of those mutations appeared suddenly, after the virus diverged from its most recent ancestor.
Each infected person is a crucible, offering opportunities for the virus to mutate as it multiplies. With more than 83 million people infected worldwide, the coronavirus is amassing mutations faster than scientists expected at the start of the pandemic.
The vast majority of mutations provide no advantage to the virus and die out. But mutations that improve the virus’s fitness or transmissibility have a greater chance to catch on.
At least one of the 17 new mutations in the variant contributes to its greater contagiousness. The mechanism is not yet known. Some data suggest that the new variant may bind more tightly to a protein on the surface of human cells, allowing it to more readily infect them.
It’s possible that the variant blooms in an infected person’s nose and throat, but not in the lungs, for example — which may explain why patients spread it more easily but do not develop illnesses more severe than those caused by earlier versions of the virus. Some influenza viruses behave similarly, experts noted.
“We need to look at this evidence as preliminary and accumulating,” Cevik said of the growing data on the new variant.
Still, the research suggests an urgent need to cut down on transmission of the variant, she added: “We need to be much more careful overall, and look at the gaps in our mitigation measures.”

NEW YORK — The days have turned gray; the future feels black. We’re all seeing red; we’re all feeling blue. Perhaps it’s the isolated colors that are bringing us down; perhaps what we need is a whole spectrum.
All the shades of the planet are brought together in “The Nature of Color,” a polychrome production at the American Museum of Natural History that delves into the chemistry, physics and culture of the visible spectrum. The show opened in March and closed swiftly thereafter, along with every other museum exhibition in town. New sanitary restrictions required the reopened installation to remove several interactive exhibits, do away with touch screens and eliminate games and puzzles.
The show offers visitors, old but especially young, a broad view of color as both a scientific and a cultural phenomenon — even if, to my eyes, it now feels a bit thin for an exhibition with an additional admission charge. But I’m not the target audience: The masked kids in “The Nature of Color” were having a blast, preening in front of projected lights and staring wide-eyed at their prismatic reflections.
Your eyes don’t perceive color, not exactly. They perceive light — specifically, light with wavelengths of 380 (violet) to 740 (red) nanometers. Light stimulates the cone cells in your retinas, and then the brain takes over. As Isaac Newton first showed in his “Opticks” of 1704, color is not an inherent property of objects (excepting luminescent ones). Color is, rather, the effect of an object’s reflection of certain wavelengths of visible light, and absorption of the rest.
The kids’ Newtonian lessons begin in the first groovy gallery of “The Nature of Color,” which is equipped with two sets of oscillating light bulbs, one white and one yellow. When the yellow ones go on, it makes everything in the room look gray, unless you are wearing a yellow rain slicker or carrying a rubber duck. When the white lights are on, everything looks normal, proving that white is the sum of all colors. Later in the show, children can boogie in front of beams of colored light, and can discover the secrets of additive color mixing if they aren’t too in love with their own multicolored shadows.
We humans have a trichromatic view of the world, with cones aligned to red, green and blue. Other species have other perceptions — both bees and reindeer can see ultraviolet wavelengths — and, evolutionarily speaking, color has allowed us to find love or find food, or else to avoid becoming someone else’s lunch. The rainbow lorikeet, resident of the Philippines and New Guinea, has riotously parti-colored plumage on its breast (the better to attract a mate) but tail feathers of solid green (the better to blend into the trees).
Other species making use of color for courtship include the fan-throated lizard, with a wattle of iridescent blue and orange, and the Siamese fighting fish, its tail bristling with blood-orange finnage. As for our own species’ pigmentation, a display by Brazilian photographer Angélica Dass pictures humans of all “races” — the word, appropriately for a science museum, appears in quotes in the wall text — classified according to the one true universal color language: the Pantone palette. (I threw a selfie of my own into Photoshop and grabbed a pixel from my skin. Under even lighting, my “white” skin appears to be Pantone 481c.)
Humanity’s favorite color, polls confirm year after year, is blue. It was also, for centuries of Western art history, the most expensive color, produced from rare lapis lazuli. (In the past you’d paint the Virgin Mary wearing pricey blue as a symbol of your devotion, although if you did so today you might get brought up on charges of abetting a terrorist organization: Lapis lazuli comes chiefly from mines in Afghanistan, many controlled by the Taliban.) Its rarity endured until the early 18th century, when a German color grinder accidentally contaminated a batch of red with some oil and ended up with a rich aqua he called Prussian blue. It was the first ever cheap synthetic pigment, and it set off a “blue fever” as far as Japan, where Hokusai and other printmakers used the rare imported color.
If blue is the most prized color, red is the oldest. Ocher clay, like the sample here, appears in South African cave paintings that are 73,000 years old. And it seems fair to proclaim that red has the most diverse cultural meanings of any color: love and also anger, fortune and also injury. Red was thought to ward off smallpox in medieval Europe; Charles V, king of France, wore scarlet shirts, hose and veils when he got the virus.
Red signifies the political left, except in the United States — and even here the Republican Party has been identified with “red states” only since the 2000 presidential election. Too bad for you if your stock portfolio is in the red — unless you live in China or Japan, where red means the price went up.
Is color a universal thing or a particular one? Is it an affair of nature or culture? In Europe only the highest nobility could wear purple clothing; in China, they wore yellow. You wear white for a Buddhist funeral and a Christian marriage. Kids can explore the cultural meanings of color in an interactive game show here, with the adorable title “All About Hue,” hosted by an anthropomorphic blob of paint, which they can play live on a smartphone.
And yet beyond these cultural meanings, and beyond the scope of this show, lies a larger debate, one still raging among linguists and cognitive scientists. Every human eye, unless you are colorblind, catches the same 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum. But does that mean that every human understands these colors in roughly the same way?
After all, Homer, in both the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey,” repeatedly calls the Aegean Sea “wine-dark” — although it doesn’t look very purple to sunbathers in Rhodes or Bodrum. In the language of the Karajá people of central Brazil, the single word “ãrè” can signify what English speakers identify as blue, yellow or green (and women and men use different color names). The Warlpiri people of northern Australia, it’s argued, have no words for colors at all but instead describe chromatic phenomena within a multidimensional space of texture, iridescence or size.
My job is to write about pictures, in English. The cones of my eyes aren’t especially sensitive, in the way that a perfumer’s nose might be, but over the years I’ve had to build up an extensive color vocabulary: amaranth, gamboge, falu red, Tiffany blue. I use these words because I’m trying to capture some objective qualities of hue, lightness, saturation — but the colors I see may be a subjective impression, from which you might reasonably diverge. And what about the dog, who can distinguish blue from yellow but not red from green, or the shark with no color perception at all? Might the shark art critic see things I’ll never perceive, unshackled by my rainbow handcuffs?

Coronavirus Dominates Merkel’s Last New Year’s Speech as Chancellor

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s New Year’s speeches have typically been aspirational exercises in political agenda setting, touching on dozens of broad themes like immigration and climate change, and sometimes presenting her latest projects for Germany.
But Merkel’s speech this year, her 16th as chancellor, is noticeably different. For what is almost certainly her last New Year’s Eve speech as the government’s leader, as she is expected to leave office in 2021, she focuses on a single topic: the coronavirus.
“The coronavirus pandemic was and is a once-in-a-century political, social and economic challenge,” Merkel says in the annual prerecorded televised speech that is watched by millions of German households.
The pandemic has killed more than 33,000 people in Germany and sickened hundreds of thousands more. And even if generous government subsidies have averted much of the widespread economic pain that other countries have experienced, long-term economic consequences loom for the nation.
As the speech makes clear, the pandemic has upended Merkel’s last full year in office, upsetting a period in which she hoped to cement her legacy with leadership on issues like climate change, digital transformation and a robust social state.
Abroad, Merkel had hoped to focus on tackling issues like refugees and European Union unity as Brexit played out and countries like Hungary and Poland tested the bloc’s liberal values. Instead, she spent much of her time during Germany’s six-month term in the European Council’s rotating presidency traveling to Brussels for meetings to persuade EU members to break budget rules and set up a fund to counter the economic effects of the pandemic.
“I don’t think I am exaggerating when I say that never in the past 15 years have we all experienced such a difficult year — and never have we greeted the new year with so much hope, despite all of our concerns and some skepticism,” she says.
As she notes in the speech, Merkel will not run in the next election, slated for September. Several weeks from now, those in her party who hope to succeed her — a powerful state governor, a former political competitor and a senior lawmaker — will compete for the leadership of her party.
But the winner of that contest faces a difficult path to the chancellery. None of them are adored like Merkel, who after a decade and a half in office and, especially after her handling of the pandemic, remains Germany’s most popular politician.
Outside politics, the country’s liberal consensus also seemed increasingly in danger as tens of thousands took to the streets to protest COVID-19 regulations because they either didn’t believe the coronavirus was real or thought the government had no business imposing measures to stop it.
“I can only imagine how painful it must be for those who are mourning for loved ones lost to coronavirus or are themselves struggling with the lingering effects of this illness to see willful deniers disputing the virus’ existence,” Merkel says, calling conspiracy theories about the virus “cynical and cruel.”
The protests have found resonance on the country’s far right. A planned gathering of protesters opposing the COVID-19 restrictions in Berlin on Thursday was prohibited by the authorities, who feared that the event would lead to new infections.
In Germany, the tradition of an annual speech by the country’s leader dates back at least to the turn of the last century, when Kaiser Wilhelm II gave speeches from a balcony in Berlin. The practice continued during the Weimar Republic (when it was first broadcast) and the Third Reich. In recent decades, the tradition is for the country’s president to give a speech on Christmas and the chancellor on New Year’s Eve.
Even as Merkel speaks of hope that came with the coronavirus vaccinations that began in Germany on Sunday, she acknowledges that the situation remained dire. “This is a hard winter, and it is far from over,” she says.
The health authorities in Germany are registering record infections despite a weekslong lockdown, and on Tuesday reported 1,129 COVID-19 fatalities in a single day, a record.
Merkel’s broadcast is likely to be seen by more Germans than the over 3 million spectators who watched it last year, because — for the first time since the television broadcasts started in the 1950s — it does not have to compete with the country’s usually boisterous New Year’s Eve traditions. Fireworks have been banned across the country, and many places have curfews. As in other cities, an increased police force in Berlin were sent to patrol the streets to break up any gatherings.
Merkel’s last New Year’s Eve speech also comes after a year during which the usually taciturn chancellor was forced to address Germans directly on several occasions, usually in an effort to get acceptance for new coronavirus rules.
Video clips of her explaining scientific details off the top of her head went viral as Germans looked to her calm and thoughtful leadership during the crisis.

Despite his best efforts, Randall Cunningham just can’t retire from football. A former quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings, he tried walking away from the game twice, dabbling in a variety of activities to fill the void.
“Going golfing and going to the movies, and concerts or boxing matches,” Cunningham said. “It got boring.”
After his second retirement from the NFL, in 2002, Cunningham settled in Las Vegas permanently and became an ordained pastor two years later. With his wife, Felicity, the couple began their own church, Remnant Ministries, where Cunningham gives three services every Sunday to a small live audience and, he estimated, around 4,000 online viewers. In the meantime, he has also coached their two children: Vashti and Randall II are both Olympic team hopefuls in track and field.
But this past summer, when the Raiders also settled in the city from Oakland, California, football came knocking once again. The team’s head coach, Jon Gruden, had an idea about luring Cunningham back — as the Raiders’ chaplain.
“That guy warms my heart,” Gruden said. “He is special. He has a great way of spreading the Lord’s word, he is a great resource and great friend to all of us.”
Gruden, who was Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator in Cunningham’s final season there, said, “To be reunited with him at this point in life is really cool.”
No other NFL team has as its spiritual adviser a former superstar player, but both men insist that Cunningham, famed for being a progenitor of the modern game’s dual-threat quarterback role, maintains a singular focus in his new role.
“I coach them in the spiritual aspects of life, and that’s it,” Cunningham said.
The reality of Cunningham’s first season as Raiders chaplain has been plenty different from the hands-on pastoring and locker room camaraderie that have been made impossible this season because of the NFL’s COVID-19 protocol.
“I haven’t had the opportunity to slap Zay Jones a high-five, or hug Alec Ingold, or give a fist bump to Darren Waller,” Cunningham said.
Instead, Cunningham stays in touch through phone calls and texts. He hosts a 7 p.m. Bible study on a video call the night before games where, sometimes, football seeps into the message.
The night before the second game of the season, when the New Orleans Saints visited, Cunningham focused on the original underdog story — David’s battle with Goliath.
“I said, ‘Man, here comes Goliath, the great champion from Gath, all the accolades and all the victories,’” Cunningham recalled. “Drew Brees is the man, so is the coach, but you have to take Goliath down.”
As he spoke to the Raiders players on the video call that night, Cunningham was so focused on the story of young David knocking out the giant with a slingshot, that he kept accidentally calling Derek Carr, the team’s starting quarterback, David (the name of his older brother, who is a retired NFL quarterback).
The next day, Derek Carr played like the biblical David, throwing three touchdown passes and leading the Raiders to a 34-24 victory in their first game at home in Las Vegas.
“It felt like I had affected them in a way that gave them a little confidence,” Cunningham said. “Not false confidence, but to give them true confidence to go out and be who they are.”
Carr talked to Cunningham on the phone on his drive home from the stadium after sustaining a serious groin injury in a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers two weeks ago. The Raiders starter left the must-win Thursday night game in the first quarter and watched his team lose in overtime from the sideline, their playoff hopes almost completely dashed. Together, they prayed for healing.
The Raiders did not make any players available for comment, but Carr’s agent, Timothy Younger, said in an email to The New York Times that Carr and Cunningham have “an extremely close relationship, and Derek recognizes his own growth this year due in large part to Randall’s help.”
In a text message via his agent, Raiders receiver Nelson Agholor said: “Randall is amazing. The same passion he played with, he preaches with.”
In his playing days, Cunningham loved being a star and redefining what it meant to play quarterback with each mad dash. In the 1990 season, Cunningham passed for 3,466 yards and 30 touchdowns, and also rushed for 942 yards and five touchdowns.
He drove a Porsche, buddied up with celebrities and dressed in bold outfits that Eagles teammate Keith Byars compared to Michael Jackson’s style.
Cunningham regularly made headlines in Philadelphia for quotations that could come off as selfish and cast doubt on his leadership ability. After he evaded a Bruce Smith sack and threw an improbable 95-yard touchdown pass in a losing effort against the Buffalo Bills in 1990, Cunningham said, “Sometimes I do amaze myself.”
Byars said he often had to act as a mediator between his quarterback and members of the defense who took issue with Cunningham’s comments.
“When Randall first came into the league, he was in a cocoon and waiting to expand who he was,” Byars said. “You can’t help others until you help yourself, and get to know yourself. And so, that’s what Randall was going through early in his football career, still knowing who he was.”
Cunningham grew up in Santa Barbara, California, going to church on Sundays, but it wasn’t until he came out of retirement for the first time in 1997, after spending a year away from the game following 11 seasons in Philadelphia, that he became serious about his faith.
He had spent the time off running a building supply company and serving as an analyst for TV broadcasts. But on a vacation in Hawaii with his family, Cunningham realized he wasn’t cut out for a life of leisure.
“It was beautiful, but there came a time when it was like, ‘Wow, is this what life is?’” he said. “Just drinking iced tea and having a nice meal and working out every day?”
Cunningham returned to the league with Minnesota in 1997 and became involved with the Vikings’ team ministry. He said he started praying between plays and during commercial breaks: “Lord, I am about to launch this ball to Randy Moss. Please let him catch it for a touchdown.”
After the 2001 season, his final one as a player, Cunningham went back to Las Vegas and continued to lead a Bible study he had started there a few years earlier.
“He is one of the favorite sons here in Las Vegas,” Gruden said of Cunningham, who set passing records that still stand during his college career 40 years ago at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
It didn’t take long for his ministry to take off.
“The next thing you know, we had 90 people in the Bible study,” Cunningham recalled, “and my pastor said, ‘This is not a Bible study; it’s a church.’”
Cunningham says he does not want to get into coaching or any front office roles, but he does confess to bigger ambitions for his work as team chaplain.
A missed field-goal attempt stopped Cunningham from making it to a Super Bowl with the Vikings in the 1998 season, the best year of his career. He won just two of seven playoff games with the Eagles, never advancing past the divisional round. The Raiders are officially out of postseason contention this year, but now that he is back in the NFL, Cunningham has his eye on that elusive Lombardi Trophy.
“I want to preach myself into a Super Bowl ring,” he said.

Death has rarely so shaped a year as it did in 2020. It swept the world riding the back of the coronavirus. It galvanized a Black Lives Matter movement across the United States and abroad, sending people of all colors into the streets to demand social justice. It altered the ideological makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court so decisively that the consequences of that shift will assuredly be felt for decades.
Almost one year in, the pandemic races on like the unstoppable wildfires that blackened the West, and it’s far from done with us, we know, even as vaccines have arrived to defeat it.
Some segments of the population suffered more than others, but the virus felled people from all walks of life, some of them famous: former presidential candidate and pizza chain magnate Herman Cain, playwright Terrence McNally, former French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
George Floyd’s death, by contrast, was seen as symptomatic of a societal sickness. There were other Black Americans killed by police officers in 2020 — Rayshard Brooks Jr., Mike Ramos and Breonna Taylor among them — and their names became rallying cries in their own right. But more than any other, Floyd’s death at the hands of the Minneapolis police in May became a tipping point in the long struggle for racial equality.
Another death in 2020 with historical implications was that of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Coming in September in the heat of a presidential election campaign, it mobilized Republicans to fill her seat as quickly as possible with her jurisprudential polar opposite, a rock-solid conservative.
Ginsburg’s death, for all the sorrow it brought, did not come as a complete shock. But Kobe Bryant’s death did shock, the former basketball superstar perishing alongside his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others in a helicopter crash north of Los Angeles in January.
Bryant became the first in a parade of sports idols who passed from the scene this year. Within a span of six weeks, Major League Baseball lost Tom Seaver (another COVID casualty), Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, Whitey Ford and Joe Morgan. The Green Bay Packers lost four stalwarts from the team’s glory years: Willie Davis, Willie Wood, Herb Adderley and Paul Hornung, Hall of Famers all. Gale Sayers, one of the NFL’s greatest running backs, left Chicago bereft. And Mickey Wright, whom some called the greatest women’s golfer, died at 85.
Don Shula, died in May still holding the NFL record for total victories, 347. And this month gold-medal Olympian Rafer Johnson was gone, his death coming just a few weeks after that of Diego Maradona, by all measures one of the greatest players in soccer history.
Causes Worth Fighting For
The competitive sport of politics suffered the loss of John Lewis, who, bloodied but unbowed on a bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, took the fight for civil rights to Congress and never let up.
Lewis was accompanied in death this year by two of his brothers in arms in the civil rights struggle. In the case of the Rev. C.T. Vivian, death came on the very same day it arrived for Lewis, July 17. The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery preceded them in March.
Across the ocean was Betty Williams, who had taken to the streets and the halls of power to stop the violence in Northern Ireland, earning a share of the Nobel Peace Prize.
In the U.S., the Rt. Rev. Barbara Harris, the first woman to be ordained a bishop in the Episcopal Church of the United States, sought to push open the doors to the church hierarchy even wider, to let in more women as well as Black people (like her) and gay people. Debra White Plume spent a lifetime fighting the power — be it government, corporate or police — pressing for the rights of Native Americans.
Quieter but altogether significant figures of government also left the stage: David Dinkins, the courtly career politician who broke a race barrier when he was elected mayor of New York, a belated recognition that his city’s complexion had long been multihued; Paul O’Neill, the former Alcoa CEO who became George W. Bush’s treasury secretary, only to be cashiered within two years after showing, it was said, too independent a mind about the economy and insufficient loyalty to the president; and Brent Scowcroft, whose privately imparted views were often mouthed, and turned into foreign policy, by the Republican presidents he advised.
Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith was the last of the Kennedy siblings to pass on. Annie Glenn and Rene Carpenter, the wives of astronauts (but more than that), evoked NASA’s glory years, the 1960s. So did Chuck Yeager, the sound-barrier-breaking test pilot. And so did space agency mathematician Katherine Johnson, who was belatedly celebrated in the 2016 movie “Hidden Figures.”
Their deaths did not necessarily signal the end of one era or another, but Kirk Douglas, dead at 103, and Olivia de Havilland, at 104, were certainly among the very last vestiges of that proverbial golden Hollywood era that spanned the 20th century’s middle decades.
It gave way, we remember, to the filmic disruptions of the ’60s, in one case to the over-the-top Cold War likes of Bond, James Bond, as originally embodied by the dashing, suave and seemingly perpetually amused Sean Connery, who died in his sleep in the Bahamas on Oct. 31.
What Survives
Connery joined a long list of actors, ranging across the eras, whose embedded stars in a Hollywood sidewalk now constitute memorials: Rhonda Fleming, Ian Holm, Max von Sydow, Brian Dennehy, dancer-actor Marge Champion.
Chadwick Boseman's life was cut short at 43 — another blow that only his intimates saw coming. He had worked right up until the end, presumably through the pain of cancer, and showed us what the future might have held when he offered a couple of blazing last performances in “Da 5 Bloods” and “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”.
Old TV shows and old movies are continually resuscitated, and never more so than now. So it is that screen stars, too, are assured of an electronic afterlife. Farewell, Jerry Stiller, Carl Reiner, Regis Philbin, Diana Rigg, Alex Trebek and Honor Blackman, we’ll see you again.
Even the transitory art of theater has found means to freeze performances in time on film and videotape, letting us watch a master like multiple Tony winner Zoe Caldwell at work in “Master Class,” or revisit unsparing scenes from “The Normal Heart,” the autobiographical play by Larry Kramer that charted and channeled his fervent AIDS activism.
Little Richard is gone, but not his indelible primal rock ’n’ roll. Bill Withers, Betty Wright, Kenny Rogers, Helen Reddy, Trini Lopez, John Prine and Charley Pride (the last two still more casualties of COVID) will continue to sing to us. We’ll continue to marvel at Eddie Van Halen’s guitar playing, McCoy Tyner’s melodic jazz piano, percussionist Ray Mantilla’s inventive versatility, Julian Bream’s sublimely updated classical guitar and soprano Mirella Freni’s rapturous embrace of Italian opera.
John le Carré left us a pile of spy novels that rose to literature. Some say Roger Kahn’s sportsbooks and Jan Morris’ travel writing did the same. A journalist’s work, by its nature, rarely has a long shelf life, but Gail Sheehy’s “Passages” has already upended that truism.
Business empires, for all their riches and reach, may not last forever, although one doesn’t see Sumner Redstone’s media colossus or Stanley Ho’s casino kingdom crumbling any time soon. Nor will Pierre Cardin’s fashion juggernaut be closing up shop following his death.
For certainty we turn to scientists, even if they can’t always provide it. We turned to Margaret Burbidge to answer questions about the stars; to Freeman Dyson to elucidate something even smaller than an atom; to neuropathologist Mary Fowkes to help us understand the coronavirus plague through the autopsies she performed; and to Takuo Aoyagi to give us something that will tell us when our health is in danger. He did so by inventing the modern pulse oximeter, which became a critical tool in the fight against the coronavirus.
And if 2020 taught us anything, it was about the universal will to survive in the constant face of one irrefutable certainty: our impermanence. That has always been the human condition, of course, but seldom has there been a year when staying alive felt more urgent.

As the Pandemic Took Lives, It Also Stole Hopes

The scythe of COVID-19 was unsparing as it devastated one nation after another, claiming all types of people in a death toll now heading toward 2 million.
The elderly, especially those in nursing homes, have been cut down in tragic proportions. So have health care workers, Black Americans and Native peoples. At various times it was New Yorkers, Northern Italians, Peruvians, Brazilians, Indians.
People in many professions suffered: teachers, police officers, politicians and former professional athletes; college professors, preachers, musicians and journalists. Couples died within days of each other. Even a survivor of the Spanish flu of 1918 succumbed.
Here is another category, a less obvious one: those who were starting new chapters in their lives — a second-act career, a home after homelessness, freedom after unjust imprisonment, rediscovered love, parenthood. For them, in the words of poet Philip Larkin, the loss was “time / Torn off unused.”
The 1980 graduating class of the Yale School of Drama included a young woman named Margaret Holloway, a budding director, actor and playwright filled with promise. Mental illness and drug addiction intervened, and Holloway became a disheveled fixture on the streets of New Haven, Connecticut, often homeless, cadging change with dramatic readings of Shakespeare. Finally, in recent years, she found stability: a permanent residence in a nursing home with regular meals, clean clothes and visits from friends.
Willie Levi, whose life was for so long marked by virtual servitude, had 11 years of freedom at the end. He and other men with intellectual disabilities were dispatched in 1974 to an Iowa turkey-processing plant; for decades they were confined to a miserable bunkhouse, earned pitiful wages and suffered abuse. Only in 2009, spurred by newspaper reports, did local officials intervene and liberate the men.
Myles Coker was sent away to prison for life for dealing heroin, leaving his two young sons without a father’s presence. But through an oversight, Coker was never told that the sentence was reducible. His sons and lawyer figured it out, and after nearly 23 years in prison, Coker was released. He had six years more of freedom.
The road to a career or stable job can be long and hard for many. Several victims of the pandemic had traveled that road and reached a resolution but had little time to live in it.
Casale’s Halfway Club, the oldest restaurant in Reno, Nevada, had been in Tony Stempeck’s family for more than 80 years. When his mother died Sept. 26, it effectively passed to him. He died less than a month later.
Yves-Emmanuel Segui was a pharmacist in his native Ivory Coast; after emigrating to the United States, it took him eight years to pass the exam needed to practice here, and seven more to find a steady job in the field. He died less than a year later.
Marni Xiong, a community and union organizer in St. Paul, Minnesota, had political ambitions — she mused about becoming the city’s first Hmong mayor. She was right on track when elected chair of the school board in January. Six months later, Xiong was dead.
Vanee Sykes discovered her calling six years ago, on her release from prison for a white-collar crime: establishing and running programs to help women make the transition from jail to home life.
After years of more downs than ups in the theater, Nick Cordero achieved success in 2014 in the musical “Bullets Over Broadway,” leading to a succession of other Broadway roles. He died July 5.
In Brazil, José Luiz da Silva, a poor farmer’s son, realized stardom of another sort. His “What, me worry?” response to a social media post in 2016 mocking his small stature and high-pitched voice went viral, and he was lofted into internet stardom — which he parlayed into television and music video appearances.
COVID victims had arrived at so many other milestones before their deaths. Israel Sauz, the assistant night manager at a gas station in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was a father for only three weeks; Lorena Borjas, an activist on behalf of transgender people, many of them immigrants, became a citizen last year; David Toren had doggedly sought to recover a treasured painting that had been looted from his family by the Nazis; he had possession of it for just five of his 94 years.
Stuart Cohen, a cabbie, discovered Buddhism. Kimarlee Nguyen, a high school English and accomplished short story writer, had begun a novel. Raymond Copeland, a New York City sanitation worker, had found love after raising his three daughters as a widower; he was planning to buy a house with his fiancée.
As his friend Mike Arroyo said, perhaps speaking of so many COVID victims, “Ray was living his best life the last couple of years.”

Cities to Toast End of 2020 At Long Last, Minus Crowd

Texto completo: The year that seemed to drag on forever is finally coming to an end.
In most cities this New Year's Eve, there will be no roaring crowds, no gatherings for fireworks shows and, let's hope, no strangers kissing at midnight. But, after a year punctuated by disease, unemployment and racial unrest, people around the world, in different circumstances than usual, will still raise a glass and toast the start of 2021.
Muted celebrations in big cities
Even in countries where coronavirus cases are low, like Australia, local governments have gone back and forth, making plans and then canceling them again, as they try to balance keeping people safe with allowing them to let loose after a difficult year.
In Sydney, the authorities tightened restrictions in recent days after an increase in locally transmitted cases. Parties of up to 10 guests are allowed in parts of the city, but residents are being encouraged to watch the seven-minute fireworks show over the Sydney Harbor Bridge on TV. A viewing party for frontline workers was canceled.
The fireworks display over Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong was also canceled, along with the Lunar New Year parade in February, according to The South China Morning Post.
In London, the annual fireworks along the Thames River have been canceled, but Big Ben, which has been silent while undergoing renovation, will chime at midnight. The city's residents are under England's strictest lockdown measures, which are being extended on Thursday to cover the majority of the country's population. Under those rules, people can leave home only for certain activities, such as exercise and grocery shopping.
Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations, which typically involve processions, fireworks and singing, will be held online.
In Paris, the composer-performer Jean-Michel Jarre will host a free, virtual live-streamed concert called "Welcome to the Other Side," from a studio near the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. France and Italy are among several countries in Europe that have imposed curfews during the pandemic to prevent large gatherings at night.
Federal and state leaders in Germany banned the sale of fireworks, as the government tries to limit gatherings.
In Rio de Janeiro, where revelers usually wear white and flock to the beach, the authorities will block beach access to prevent crowds from gathering.
And in New York, for the first time in decades, Times Square will be closed to most members of the public. Only dozens of selected frontline workers and their families will be permitted near the stage, where the performers will include Gloria Gaynor, who will sing her hit "I Will Survive."
Will the ball still drop at midnight in Times Square?
Yes. While there will be no rowdy crowds, the descending crystal ball will still count down the final seconds of the year.
The ball first dropped in 1907, when hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks over the newly built New York Times building. The tradition has happened nearly every year since, aside from 1942-43 and 1943-44, when lights were turned off as a precaution against air raids during World War II.
Thousands of revelers still gathered those years, even if the celebrations were less rowdy than usual.
"There was a note of sluggishness, an absence of real gayety," Meyer Berger wrote in a front-page article in The Times on Jan. 1, 1943. "The restless thousands lacked zest. War somehow laid its hand on the celebration and tended to mute it."
New Year's Eve in an earlier pandemic
In 1918, a deadly pandemic swept the world, but the front page of The Times on Jan. 1, 1919, barely mentioned it, other than a small advertisement for lozenges to "ward off influenza!"
The headlines instead were dominated by the end of World War I.
On New Year's Eve, "Times Square was crowded," according to The Times, although it was not as loud as the celebrations after the end of the war less than two months earlier.
"Men in uniform were lined up, leaning against buildings on both sides of Broadway, watching critically to see whether New Year's Eve in the heart of New York City was an event which deserved its reputation."
Will the night look normal anywhere?
In New Zealand, the fireworks show and parties will go on as usual in Auckland, one of the first major cities to ring in 2021.
"Thanks to the incredible efforts of all New Zealanders to eliminate Covid-19, we're in the fortunate position of being able to live our lives relatively normally," Mayor Phil Goff said this month. "That's worth celebrating, and this year's spectacular display will be a perfect opportunity for Aucklanders to do that."
I'll be home. How should I celebrate?
There are plenty of virtual events happening, some of which require tickets.
Tomorrowland, a Belgian music festival franchise, is hosting a party with performers including David Guetta, the French D.J. and producer. Steve Aoki, the D.J., musician and music producer, will be headlining an event streamed by Los Angeles's Grand Park. Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will be broadcasting live from Times Square starting at 8 p.m. Eastern on CNN.
If you never liked New Year's Eve to begin with, this is the year to watch a bit of TV or listen to some music, go to sleep before midnight and revel in the fact that you're probably not missing anything.

Texto completo: At this point, most of us have heard about allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines: the doctor in Boston who had to administer his EpiPen, the hospital worker in Alaska who had trouble breathing. But it’s not at all surprising that allergic reactions happen. What matters most is the severity and the rate at which they occur. And for the COVID vaccines, there’s no doubt that the value of vaccination outweighs the risk.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued updated guidance on administering the COVID vaccines on Dec. 19. The agency noted that a small number of people had experienced significant allergic reactions. The CDC recommended that everyone who received a vaccine be observed for at least 15 minutes. Those with a history of severe allergic reactions to pretty much anything should be observed for 30 minutes.
Anaphylaxis — a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction — is nothing to be ignored. It’s most commonly associated with allergies to foods, like peanuts, or bee stings, and it’s the reason many people carry EpiPens. Often, immediate administration of epinephrine is the only thing that can prevent death.
Even so, an average of around 60 people die each year from hornet, wasp and bee stings and three times as many die from food allergies. When the CDC updated its guidance, at least six out of hundreds of thousands of recipients had experienced a severe allergic reaction, but all of them recovered with treatment.
The news media has covered these reactions, and it’s understandable that the public would be concerned about the dangers of new medications, especially ones that were developed so quickly and under such enormous pressure.
But put those numbers in context: More than 2.1 million people in the United States have received a dose of a vaccine at this point. So far, according to reports, about 11 severe allergic reactions — representing about one in 190,000 doses administered — have been noted. This is still higher than the overall rate of anaphylaxis in vaccinations, at 1.3 per one million given, but that may be only because we are being much more careful about monitoring reactions at the moment.
Context also matters. About one in 10 Americans have reported an allergic reaction to penicillins. About one in 100, perhaps, have a true allergy to that class of drugs (I’m one of them). Between one in 2,500 and one in 5,000 experience anaphylaxis. But pediatricians like me dispense penicillin all the time, with minimal concerns. We do so because most allergic reactions are minor and serious ones can be managed, and because we believe that the benefits outweigh the harms.
Every potential bad outcome of a Covid vaccine should be weighed against the chance of getting sick or dying from the disease.
Using data from Indiana, which has conducted multiple statewide studies on the prevalence of COVID-19, colleagues from the I.U.P.U.I. Fairbanks School of Public Health and I calculated the disease’s infection fatality rate. We found that, for people 60 years and older who were not living in jails or nursing homes, COVID-19 killed about one in 58 of those infected. For people between the ages of 40 and 59, it was about one in 833, and for people younger than 40 it was about one in 10,000. For those who were not white, the fatality rate was more than three times that for whites.
While a vast majority of people who develop COVID-19 survive, more than 670,000 Americans have been hospitalized with the disease this year; scientists are still struggling to treat so-called long-haulers, who endure long-term effects of the disease. A recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine also showed that when the coronavirus is more prevalent in an area, outcomes worsen. Surges are occurring all over now.
Getting a vaccine appears to be orders of magnitude safer than getting infected with the virus.
In order for the crisis to end, we need herd immunity. The only way to reach that is to get most people immunized or infected. Based on the numbers above, the latter would be a tragedy. Scaring people unnecessarily away from the former would result in more infections, more deaths and more economic and societal hardship. We should definitely be transparent and plain about the risks and benefits of the vaccines, but we need to put numbers in context of the risks of COVID-19.
Vaccines aren’t perfect. In the coming weeks and months, we can expect to read about people who were immunized and got sick anyway. This won’t mean that the vaccine is a failure; it will simply show, as we already know, that the shots are not 100 percent effective.
Those of us who communicate about public health have too often failed to be clear during this pandemic. Many Americans wound up being confused about masks, tests and certainly in how we should think about risk. This has not only led to confusion. It likely also led to sickness and death. Let’s do better with vaccines. There’s a real chance we can stop this pandemic in 2021 if we get this right.

Near the Navajo Nation, the place hit hardest by the virus

Texto completo: Hospitals in Gallup are nearly full. Most stores are empty. The unemployment rate in the county where the city sits is one and a half times the national average. Earlier this month, it had the most cases per capita of any metro area in the United States, according to a New York Times database.
As the pandemic has steadily marched across the country in recent months, places like Gallup have been among the hardest hit.
Perched between the Navajo Nation to the north and Zuni Nation to the south, almost half of Gallup’s residents are Native American, according to census data.
Native American communities have been particularly vulnerable to the virus, at one point accounting for nearly 40% of all cases in New Mexico, even though those communities make up less than a tenth of the state’s population. And some who have so far been spared by the virus are nonetheless reeling from the consequences of the economic slowdown.
Eric-Paul Riege, a 26-year-old artist, is the son of a veteran and hotel manager and a Navajo mother who taught him the art of weaving. His work has appeared in galleries and collections around the country. But paid projects this year all but dried up.
When I met Riege, he was working shifts at a diner called Grandpa’s Grill, processing orders for takeout food.

Route 66 cuts through Gallup. The town has relied on tourism to help drive its economy, counting on visitors to shop at local galleries and trading posts selling Native American art and crafts. But limits on activity in the area have made that hard.
When the region was experiencing an extreme wave of virus cases in May, the city locked down, and state police officers and the National Guard barricaded highway exits to prevent people who didn’t live in Gallup from entering town unless it was an emergency.
Last month, long after the barricades came down, trading posts were open but closed for indoor shopping, limiting the chances of anyone passing by to stop and browse.
The iconic El Rancho hotel, where John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn and other Hollywood stars once stayed, was roughly a quarter full.
Gallup is in many ways a relic of conquered Indigenous lands and American expansion. Many of the trading posts, for example, are owned and operated by white people. Those small shops sit in the shadows of McDonald’s, Walmart and other big American franchises, where cars and people often spill out of parking lots now.
Bill Lee, the head of Gallup’s Chamber of Commerce, said there has been a growing economic divide because of the restrictions put in place by local and state officials. Smaller businesses often have to operate with stricter guidelines, including rules preventing in-store shopping, while bigger box stores, especially those deemed essential, could operate with fewer limits. “The governor has chosen winners and losers,” Lee said.
When the barricades were erected earlier this year, Walmart was inundated by shoppers stocking up on weeks’ worth of supplies, especially because grocery stores on Indigenous lands are few and far between. The barricades, however, also had the effect of preventing members of Native American groups from coming into town to shop.

Indigenous groups in the area have long suffered from a lack of information and resources.
Even before the pandemic, the Indian Health Service, the government program that provides health care to the 2.2 million members of the nation’s tribal communities, had severe shortages of funding and supplies, in addition to a lack of doctors and aging facilities.
The virus made those weaknesses that much more apparent.
Amid the devastation of the pandemic, some people have gotten lucky. Dan Bonaguidi, the son of the town’s mayor who owns Michele’s Ready Mix Rock and Recycle with his wife, Michele, is one of them. His business has been thriving as government grants in the pandemic have led to greater demand for building materials for home renovations and projects like new or expanded health care facilities.
But even with bright spots, there are many more stories of businesses sitting empty or being shuttered — small and large.
After an oil and natural gas boom in New Mexico and Texas in recent years, the pandemic has cut into oil demand and prices. Marathon Petroleum announced plans in August to shut down its operations in the area and lay off more than 200 workers — roughly 1% of the city’s population.
Operations like Marathon’s are vital to Gallup’s economy, and the job losses helped push the area’s unemployment rate to 10.6% in October. Raul Sanchez is one of the workers who lost his job.
As I drove by his home on a hill overlooking the western part of town one afternoon two days before Thanksgiving, Sanchez was tinkering with a red pickup truck. He’d worked at Marathon for 10 years. “No other jobs in this town pay as well,” Sanchez, 39, said.
“It’s going to have an effect on us,” the city’s mayor, Louis Bonaguidi, said earlier this year about the closing of the Marathon plant. “It’s going to affect the housing market for sure. But it’s going to affect all the businesses, too.”
When I drove through Gallup the day before Thanksgiving, the last few minutes of sun lit up the railroad rails. Despite the town’s struggles, I could still feel a sense a pride in the community as I drove around.
But the sense of vulnerability was just as apparent. Even before the pandemic hit, more than a quarter of the city’s residents lived in poverty, and those numbers have swelled this year.
Not long after my visit to the Rehoboth medical center, I watched a group of Navajo men lower a bronze-colored coffin into a grave at a cemetery 50 miles north of Gallup. It was not the only virus-related funeral scheduled there that week.

SIMLA, Colo. — An isolated ranching community on the high plains is the last place its residents expect to be first for anything, especially a new, more infectious variant of the coronavirus. But on Wednesday, state health officials announced the first known case of the variant in the United States had been confirmed in at a nursing home in Simla.
The variant had infected a National Guard soldier sent to help with a COVID-19 outbreak at the town’s Good Samaritan Society nursing home. A second soldier at the nursing home tested positive and may also have the variant, Emily Travanty, the interim director of the state public health laboratory, said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters.
All 26 residents of the nursing home and 20 of its 24 regular employees have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and four residents have died. It was not clear whether the two National Guard soldiers were infected at the nursing home or had picked up the virus before they came to Simla. They arrived on Dec. 23, after most of the cases at the facility had occurred, said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s state epidemiologist.
Simla is an unlikely place for a virus variant only recently detected in the United Kingdom to turn up. Most things that happen don’t happen here. Trends come and go without notice. News is usually a thing watched from a distance. For generations this wind-swept stretch of shortgrass prairie perched at 6,000 feet, about 80 miles southeast of Denver, has been shaped mainly by the timeless rhythms of raising cattle.
On Wednesday morning, after news of the virus in Simla had broken, a resident was asked what had changed on the town’s lone paved street in the 29 years she had lived there. She looked west toward the snow-dusted tangle of lawn mowers outside MT Small Engine Repair, then east, where a troop of wild turkeys was languidly crossing the main street in front of the entirely empty Coach-Lite Motel, and said, “Nothing.”
That stayed pretty much true when the virus arrived in the United States early in the year. Many of the roughly 600 residents of Simla went on with life assuming that, like most things that sweep the country, the pandemic would pass them by.
“When the virus first started in the spring, it was calving season and we were too busy to pay it much attention,” Don Bailey, a retired biology teacher who now runs Black Angus cattle on a ranch outside town. “We were out checking the herd five or six times a day, and you don’t have to wear a mask when you are out with the cows.”
Summer passed with almost no cases in the county, and community life went on with little change. The 4-H members showed their prize sheep and cattle at the county fair, school stayed in session and the old-timers still met for coffee each morning at Simla’s lone breakfast spot, the Country Corner Cafe.
“We went ahead and canceled a supper we have with friends every Wednesday, but otherwise things have generally stayed the same,” Bailey, 71, said. Even with the pandemic, he kept open the one-man antique saddle museum he has built in an outbuilding on his spread — though the trickle of visitors would hardly break most social distancing regulations.
The town’s feeling of isolation from the global problem changed late this fall when a second wave of infections swept across Colorado and hit Simla and surrounding Elbert County particularly hard, sending it into the state’s “severe risk” threat level, where it remains today. Soon nearly everyone in this tightknit community knew someone who was sick.
“I have a friend in the ICU right now,” said Cené Kurtchi, 71, who runs the cafe with her husband, Michael. “There are a lot of people in town who are sick. They’ll say it’s just the flu or bronchitis, but it’s 26 miles to the closest place where you can get a test.”
The response to the virus is shaped not only by geography but also by politics. President Donald Trump won 74% of the vote here in November. Signs supporting him still sprout on nearly every block. One on the fence of a quiet side street read: “SAVE FREEDOM, VOTE TRUMP.”
In a pandemic in which precautions have become political, many residents refuse to wear masks. On Wednesday about a quarter of the shoppers going into the Simla Food Store had their faces uncovered, despite being only half a block from the nursing home where the entire patient population recently tested positive and the mutant virus surfaced.
Kurtchi shook her head when discussing the lack of masks. Some of her longtime neighbors have called for a boycott of the cafe because she and her husband require masks.
On Wednesday, television news crews gathered in front of the modest, one-story nursing home while cleaning crews in hazmat suits discreetly passed in and out through a back door where the strong scent of cleaning products wafted into an alley.
The state sent a team to the nursing home Tuesday to collect new specimens from the residents and staff members. Based on the samples tested so far, Herlihy said, it does not appear that the variant is circulating in the facility, but more samples were being tested Wednesday.
The National Guard soldier confirmed to have the variant is isolating at home in Arapahoe County, in the suburbs of Denver, and the one with the suspected case is isolating at a hotel in the town of Limon to the east, Herlihy said.
In Simla’s lone craft shop, on a dirt road where the only visitors were a half-dozen local cats lounging in the winter sun outside the front door, the owner, Carla Tracy, had just gotten off the phone with a friend who had told her the new variant had come to their town.
“My gosh, this itty-bitty town most people can’t even find on a map,” she said. “And we thought we wouldn’t have much trouble with the virus. Then it hit us. Just goes to show you it’s everywhere.”

LONDON — Approval of a trade deal between Britain and the European Union was hurried through the British Parliament in just a day Wednesday, a decisive but rushed conclusion to a long Brexit story that has divided Britons and convulsed their politics for more than four years.
The lawmakers, recalled from their vacations for the task, approved an agreement laid down in more than 1,200 pages of dense legal text that will shape the relationship between Britain and continental Europe for decades to come and prompt the biggest change in the country’s trading ties in recent history.
Despite the absence of time for scrutiny, the ease with which the pact passed through the House of Commons was in stark contrast to many knife-edge votes held before last year’s general election when Parliament was gridlocked over Brexit. Whereas in 2019, British lawmakers spent months rejecting every option offered to them, on Wednesday they agreed in a matter of hours to the trade deal struck last week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The House of Commons overwhelmingly endorsed the post-Brexit pact by 521-73 and then, late on Wednesday, the House of Lords, Parliament’s second chamber, concluded the ratification.
That was a moment of victory for Johnson, vindicating his election promise to “get Brexit done” at the end of 11 months of tortuous negotiation characterized by brinkmanship and bluster on both sides of the Channel. The agreement, which comes into force with the new year, provides tariff-free access for Britain to European markets but a much more remote relationship with the European Union.
At that point, Britain will leave the European Union’s single market and customs union, severing the economic integration with the bloc forged in recent decades as part of a huge trading area. Britain formally quit the bloc’s political structures in January but opted to remain under its economic rules until the end of the year, pending a trade agreement.
Conservative lawmakers, including a caucus of hard-line Brexit supporters, have rallied behind the deal struck by Johnson, who won a landslide general election victory in December 2019 after promising a relatively distant economic relationship with the bloc and the prioritizing of national sovereignty. Almost all Conservative lawmakers voted in favor Wednesday.
Even the opposition Labour Party ordered its lawmakers to support the agreement on the basis that it is better than nothing, although more than 30 refused to support an accord that creates new barriers to trade with European nations.
Critics note that Johnson’s deal secures little for Britain’s important services sector and means added bureaucracy in the form of millions of additional customs declarations for British businesses exporting to continental Europe.
But Johnson achieved his political objective by increasing the country’s ability to exert its sovereignty and make decisions without being restricted by EU institutions such as its Court of Justice.
“Having taken back control of our money, our borders, our laws and our waters by leaving the European Union on Jan. 31, we now seize this moment to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbors based on free trade and friendly cooperation,” Johnson said as he opened the debate in Parliament.
Some lawmakers are angry at the speed with which they were asked to make a decision on Brexit — a policy that was intended to restore power to the British Parliament.
But Wednesday, Parliament was effectively presented with a take-it-or-leave-it choice. Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader, described Johnson’s agreement as a “thin deal” with many flaws but added that “a thin deal is better than no deal.”
Voting against it would lead to a chaotic rupture with the bloc at the end of the week, while supporting the deal would provide a basis on which to build a better relationship, he added.
The agreement has received provisional approval from the European Union, ahead of a vote that is expected in the European Parliament next month, and the accord was signed by Johnson on Wednesday afternoon
.
It has many critics, however. Representatives of trawler fleets have accused Johnson of caving in to the European Union over fishing rights, and business leaders fret about the additional costs and administrative burdens resulting from the deal, and by the fact that little was achieved for the services sector, which accounts for about four-fifths of the British economy.
While the European Union exports more goods to Britain than it imports, the reverse is true with services.
Among those who said they would support the deal, but with reservations, was Theresa May, the former prime minister who lost her job after failing, on several occasions, to persuade Parliament to support her plan to extract Britain from the bloc.
May attacked the Labour Party for opposing her blueprint from 2019 and pointed to gaps in Johnson’s agreement.
“We have a deal in trade that benefits the EU, but not a deal in services which would have benefited the U.K.,” she said.
Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party’s lawmakers in Britain’s Parliament, said the agreement would mean “mountains of more bureaucracy” for exporters. In Edinburgh, Scotland’s Parliament voted to withhold its consent from the document though it does not have the legal powers to prevent the government in London from proceeding.
But Brexit supporters in London praised the prime minister, focusing on sovereignty rather than economics.
William Cash, a Conservative lawmaker who has spent his career opposing European integration, described the deal as a “true turning point in our history” and said that Johnson had “saved our democracy.”

LONDON — Just before 3 p.m. on Wednesday, British lawmakers voted to ratify the Brexit trade agreement with the European Union, drawing a symbolic end to a debate that has sundered the country for more than four years.
Minutes later, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, rose in Parliament to announce that the government would put three-quarters of the population of England into the strictest level of lockdown, as a new variant of the coronavirus rampages across the country. The government also delayed the reopening of secondary schools in January.
It was a dizzying day of contrasts in Britain on Wednesday — a country propelling itself into a post-Brexit future, even as it remained in the grip of a pandemic that has recently entered a frightening new phase, exulting in a newly authorized British-made vaccine while racing to vaccinate its people against the virus.
The 521-73 vote came after a rushed, single day of debate, just a day before the agreement is scheduled to come into force. No sooner had the House of Commons approved the deal and sent it to the House of Lords, which ratified it later in the day, than attention swung back to the increasingly desperate attempts to curb the virus. Even on the pandemic, however, the news was mixed.
Earlier Wednesday, British regulators approved a second vaccine, developed in labs at Oxford University and manufactured by AstraZeneca, which officials said gave hope for an end to the plague of infections. Hancock hailed it as a prized example of British scientific achievement but warned that it would not spare the country several more difficult weeks before the doses become widely available.
“Today is a day of mixed emotions,” Hancock said, understating the head-spinning events that unfolded with every hour.
For Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the penultimate day of 2020 summed up a year of unending turbulence. It began in January with Britain’s formal departure from the EU — a moment of triumph for a leader who won a landslide election victory by promising to “Get Brexit done” — but quickly slid into crisis, as Johnson repeatedly reversed himself in dealing with the coronavirus after being hospitalized himself.
The decision to delay the reopening of most secondary schools and colleges in England for two weeks, until Jan. 18, represented yet another reversal, since the government had vowed to keep schools open regardless of what else it shut down. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said most primary schools would open on schedule on Jan. 4.
Public health experts generally backed the government’s action, although some said schools should be closed altogether or delayed for two weeks to reassess the trajectory of infections, which have soared since the emergence last month of a more rapidly transmissible variant of the virus.
“The numbers are too high now,” said Devi Sridhar, head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh.
Britain reported 50,023 new cases Wednesday, and 981 deaths, the highest number of fatalities since April. All told, the country has recorded 72,548 deaths from the virus, the highest number in Europe.
The government estimated that 60% of the new cases were from the variant, which has spread to other countries in Europe and was detected this week in Colorado. The sudden surge in cases has upended the government’s plan to keep schools open as it began a massive rollout of vaccines.
The new rules will greatly expand, starting Thursday, the areas of England under the highest tier level of restrictions, Tier 4, closing nonessential businesses, prohibiting mixing between households and telling people they should generally stay at home. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which set their own rules, have similar limits in place.
Speaking at an end-of-day news conference, Johnson balanced his enthusiasm about the new vaccine, which he has seized on as emblematic of an enterprising post-Brexit Britain, with a sober recognition that the country remained in deep crisis. He declined to rule out further changes in schools, which had been, until now, one of the only areas where the government had stuck to its guns for several months.
“My emotions, I suppose, are mixture of frustration, plus optimism, equals grim determination,” Johnson said.
It was a stark contrast from the confident prime minister who opened the debate on the trade deal in the morning by extolling it as a way to “take back control of our money, our borders, our laws and our waters.”
“We now seize this moment,” he said, “to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbors based on free trade and friendly cooperation.”
Despite the lack of time for scrutiny, the ease with which the agreement passed through Parliament was a departure from the many knife-edge votes held before last year’s election, when the House of Commons was gridlocked over Brexit.
Conservative lawmakers, including a caucus of hard-line Brexit supporters, rallied behind Johnson. His success in defusing the Brexiteer fringe of his party was notable, given that rifts over the EU have vexed the party for decades and Britain made substantial concessions to Brussels in the talks.
William Cash, a Conservative lawmaker who has spent his career opposing European integration, described the deal as a “true turning point in our history” and said Johnson had “saved our democracy.”
Even the opposition Labour Party ordered its lawmakers to support the agreement on the basis that it was better than nothing, although more than 30 refused to vote for an agreement that creates new barriers to trade with European nations.
Critics note that Johnson’s deal secures little for Britain’s services sector and means added bureaucracy for British businesses exporting to continental Europe that will have to make millions of additional customs declarations.
Former Prime Minister Theresa May noted that lawmakers spent months rejecting every previous attempt to broker a trade deal with the European Union. On Wednesday, lawmakers approved a deal in a few hours that May said was not as good as the proposals drawn up last year by her government.
Still, Johnson achieved his political objective by increasing the country’s ability to exert its sovereignty and make decisions without being restricted by EU institutions like its Court of Justice.
Some have pointed to the swift approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine, as well as the Pfizer vaccine a few weeks ago, as a testament to that new freedom, though Britain gave those approvals while still bound by EU rules. Those rules permit all member states to approve vaccines before the bloc’s health regulator during a pandemic, but only Britain has done so.
Britain, analysts said, would have felt more pressure not to get ahead of the EU had it still been a member.
The trade agreement has no shortage of critics. Fishing workers have accused Johnson of capitulating to the EU over fishing rights. Business leaders worry about the bureaucratic burdens resulting from the deal, and that it does little for the services sector, which accounts for about four-fifths of the British economy.
Johnson, however, dismissed suggestions that the new arrangements would cause headaches for British companies.
“From the point of view of U.K. exporters, for instance, they’ll now have the advantage that they’ll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world,” he said in an interview with the BBC, glossing over the fact that millions of new customs forms that were not required while Britain was part of the European trading bloc will have to be completed.
Opponents of Brexit, Johnson said, often warned that Britain could not diverge from the EU’s rules and still trade freely with the bloc — in other words, it could not have its cake and eat it, too.
“That has turned out not to be true,” the prime minister said. “I want you to see that this is a cakist treaty.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The woman was clearly in distress, sitting on her front porch with a pair of unloaded pistols beside her when the police arrived in August of last year. The weapons belonged to her boyfriend, Anthony Warner, she told the officers, and she wanted them gone. And, she added, Warner was building bombs inside the RV parked at his house.
The police traveled there and knocked on his door, where there was no answer. They followed up for about a week. But they had no legal basis to search his home, the police said this week, and his lawyer prevented officers from looking inside the vehicle.
Sixteen months later, that RV was packed with explosives when, the authorities said, Warner drove it into downtown Nashville early on Christmas morning intent on destruction.
Critics assailed police officials on Wednesday, contending that the authorities could have been more persistent in investigating the tip and possibly could have intervened before Warner carried out the attack that damaged dozens of buildings, disrupted phone and internet connections across the region and unsettled Nashville.
“If someone had broken into that RV, they could have stopped the destruction,” said Zulfat Suara, a member of the Nashville Metro Council.
Police officials argued this week that they had taken that investigation about as far as they could. The evidence was not there to obtain a search warrant or investigate Warner further, officials said.
“Legally, there was nothing else that could have been done,” Chief John Drake of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said in a news conference on Wednesday. “Maybe we could have followed up more,” he added. “Hindsight is 20/20.”
Investigators are still searching for what might have motivated Warner, 63, to carry out the bombing. Three people were injured, and Warner’s remains were found in the blast’s wreckage.
Soon after the bombing, law enforcement officials said Warner had not had their attention before. “He was not on our radar,” David B. Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said Monday.
The authorities also released Warner’s criminal history: It included just one arrest, for a marijuana possession charge in 1978, when he was 21. Since then, Drake said Wednesday, Warner’s record had been “squeaky clean.”
But a police incident report surfaced on Tuesday in articles by The Tennessean and WTVF-TV, a Nashville station, that showed that Warner’s girlfriend had told the authorities of his bomb-making last year.
The woman’s lawyer called the police to her Nashville home on Aug. 21, 2019, saying that she was in distress, possibly suicidal, and that she had firearms, according to a police statement released Tuesday.
The lawyer, Raymond Throckmorton III, told officers that Warner “frequently talks about the military and bomb making,” according to the incident report. The report also said that Throckmorton told officers “that he believes that the suspect knows what he is doing and is capable of making a bomb.” The lawyer also said he did not believe that Warner was violent, according to police officials.
The officers knocked on the door of Warner’s two-bedroom duplex in the Antioch area of Nashville but “did not receive an answer,” according to the report. The RV used in the bombing was parked behind a fence. The police “saw no evidence of a crime and had no authority to enter his home or fenced property,” a department spokesman said.
According to a statement from police officials, Throckmorton told the police that he also represented Warner and later said that he would “not allow his client to permit a visual inspection of the RV.”
Throckmorton would not take questions from a reporter who knocked on his door on Wednesday morning. He said he had just recovered from COVID-19 and had spent months in a hospital this year from a stroke. His doctor had told him he could not afford for his blood pressure to get any higher, he said.
“I’ve already made all the statements I can make,” he said.
A lawyer for Throckmorton, Jim Roberts, said that he denied standing in the way of investigators. “He wanted them to search the home,” Roberts said. “Throckmorton followed up with police to make sure they had gone over there.”
Roberts said Throckmorton did not represent Warner at the time of the police investigation and had only provided legal services for a previous real estate transaction.
The incident report, dated Aug. 21, noted that the officers who responded to the call had notified their superiors within the Police Department. The police said they had forwarded the incident report and Warner’s information to the FBI, which said Tuesday that it and the Defense Department found no records on Warner after receiving a request from the police on Aug. 22.
Drake told reporters on Wednesday that he did not learn of the report until Sunday night. “I wanted to know what happened,” he said. “I wanted to know: What did the officers do, what was the follow-up investigation, what all do we know?”
He said that officers did not try to contact Warner after the first week of attempts, and that he was unsure if the initial case was considered open.
The rebuke by critics extended beyond the Police Department’s initial handling of the tip to what they saw as a failure to relay the information to the public earlier.
They argued that in other instances, such as in police shootings, the department moved quickly to release criminal histories about the people involved. Critics also raised concerns about race, questioning whether the investigation into Warner, a white man, was being handled differently.
“If his name had been Mohammed or Jamaal, would they have kicked the doors down?” said Suara, who, in 2019, became the first Muslim person elected to the Nashville Metro Council. She added that it reflected a broader problem in law enforcement — “not just a Nashville one.”
Bob Mendes, another council member, argued that the delay in speaking up about the prior inquiry, even as law enforcement officials held regular news conferences over several days, was “pretty intentional.”
“It feels disingenuous,” Mendes said. “In this situation, the public is entitled to a complete answer.”

Robert Jones Jr. Is Son of Baldwin, and More

In his 1985 essay “Here Be Dragons,” James Baldwin wrote: “At bottom, what I had learned was that the male desire for a male roams everywhere, avid, desperate, unimaginably lonely.” America’s attitudes toward sexuality, he added, are tragically, inextricably linked with its “ideals” of hyper-masculinity and racialized violence.
A few years later, a gay Black freshman at Brooklyn College named Robert Jones Jr. read that essay and felt a sense of relief. Here was the clearest statement of Black homosexuality and gender fluidity he had ever encountered in writing.
Out on Jan. 5, his debut novel, “The Prophets,” is in many ways a culmination of the homage he’s been paying to Baldwin ever since. At heart a love story, it centers on Samuel and Isaiah, two enslaved young men on a cotton plantation in antebellum Mississippi, and the consequences of their relationship for everyone else in their world, both Black and white.
In college and grad school, Jones read widely from the literature of the African diaspora. He struggled to find in it any instances of genuine attraction between Black men.
“Even when you get to the Harlem Renaissance, you have these Black queer writers writing very surreptitiously, very quietly about queerness, in between the lines,” he said in a video interview in November from the Bedford-Stuyvesant home he shares with his husband, Adrian Techeira, a lawyer, and their cat, Baldwin. “It’s not until you get to Wallace Thurman, and then eventually James Baldwin, that it’s more open.”
Before that, the passages Jones did find — in Harriet Jacobs’ “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,” in Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” — all involved Black men being assaulted by white ones. “And I thought, OK,” he said, “but what about love?”
Morrison said that “If there’s a book you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.” The book Jones wanted to read, then wrote, dared to suggest not only that Black same-sex love exists, but that it has always existed.
“The Prophets” — with its passion between men, with its flashbacks to the African continent where a bisexual female king is confronted with a white slave trader’s violent misogyny — took 13 years to complete and publish, in part because Jones was afraid. “I had no template, and I knew the opposition I was going to face,” he said. “There’s going to be a lot of pushback, because toxic masculinity is tied very deeply into this idea that homosexuality is the result of trauma.”
It frustrates him that there are still influential voices in the Black community saying that homosexuality is not natural, that it is a white conspiracy to further subjugate Black men. In this view, “you can only be a man if you are strong, dominant, heterosexual, cisgender,” he said. “And if you are not any of those things you are a white supremacist’s tool, being used to break up the Black family, to emasculate the Black man.”
Beneath Jones’ stately demeanor, his disarming humility and sense of humor, there is anger and sadness: at the injustices committed both then and now, to Africans and to African Americans and to those who love whomever white men have told them not to.
In an effort to understand and combat those injustices, in 2008 Jones started the blog Son of Baldwin, a place for discussions of race, sexuality, gender and disability. Conversations he’s had with women and with brown and Indigenous and African people have complicated his ideas around oppression and privilege. “Yes, I am Black and queer,” he said, “but I am also male, educated, American. My job is to sit with that dissonance, and then do something about it.”
One post in particular — a YouTube video of a 2013 panel discussion on sexuality — gave Jones the proof he needed to feel that the novel he’d been working on was legitimate.
In the video, British journalist Esther Armah explains that her Ghanaian father and great-grandfather always told her Africans had the same attitude toward sexuality that they had toward land: “There were just no boundaries.” Those came later, she said, and they were inherently political.
“If you said to my great-grandparents, ‘What is homosexuality?,’ they wouldn’t understand what you meant,” Armah continued. “It’s just love.”
“That was pivotal,” Jones said. “It gave me permission to believe and understand what I had known intuitively. But now I have evidence.”
Son of Baldwin helped Jones — who worked in the communications department at Brooklyn College for 10 years — make crucial connections in publishing. In 2016, author Kiese Laymon, who followed both Son of Baldwin and Jones on Facebook for years, realized they were the same person. “I was like, wait wait wait, hold up, you’re Son of Baldwin?” Laymon said. “It was like when you find out who the superhero is.”
Laymon read his manuscript and immediately brought it to literary agent PJ Mark. “I just knew that whatever he was working on was going to be fresh,” Laymon said. “But I did not think it was going to be, like, epically fresh. He created a new American book.”
Mark signed Jones, then sold “The Prophets” to Sally Kim, the editor-in-chief at Putnam who also edited Kiley Reid’s bestselling debut novel, “Such a Fun Age,” published in 2019. Mark said Jones was the first author he’d ever worked with who’d requested an in-person meeting before sending him pages.
“I think he felt vulnerable about releasing this book into the world,” Mark said.
There wasn’t just the public reaction Jones had to consider, there was also his own past. “I grew up in a house that was on my mother’s side Nation of Islam and on my father’s side Southern Baptist,” Jones said. “Where does a Black queer child fit into either of those territories?”
He came of age in 1980s Brooklyn, on the border of Gravesend and Bensonhurst, terrified. Of God, but also of the white kids who’d chase him and his Black peers home from school with bats and chains. He wasn’t far away from where Yusef Hawkins was killed by a white mob in 1989.
“People often talk about the South and their sundown towns,” Jones said. “I always tell them, in the North they don’t call them sundown towns, because they would do it in broad daylight.”
Nor did he feel safe to be himself even within his own family, who told him not to be gay, that homosexuality was a sin. “I had no role models to tell me what is the next step for a boy like me,” he said.
His mother, Joan Jones, was “considered the black sheep of the family because she bucked all the patriarchal norms,” he said, and “claimed atheism early on.” But her father, Alfred Benjamin, raised in Depression-era Hell’s Kitchen by parents who’d immigrated from St. Kitts, later joined the Nation of Islam, and in Jones’ words, “had very stringent ideas of what a man is supposed to be.” Jones and his grandfather never said they loved each other; they were only “as close as patriarchal masculinity allows men to be,” the author said.
But eventually something within him overrode the self-doubt. “There were these voices,” he said, “which I am attributing to the ancestral voice, that made me uncomfortable with that fear, and kept waking me up in the middle of the night to do it. And so I wrote it.”
Karen Maeda Allman, a bookseller at Elliott Bay Book Company in Seattle who identifies as multiracial and lesbian, called the result “the book we’ve been waiting for” — and she’s been in the industry for more than 30 years. “People like me knew being gay is not a new thing,” she said. “And yet where are the stories?”
There will be some people, Allman said, who “won’t want to go there.” She hopes they pick it up anyway. After all, as Laymon put it, “it’s one of those books that can change the world.”
Jones knows this kind of change is possible, because he’s seen it. One day in 2002, after he hadn’t seen Benjamin in more than a decade, he got a call from his 85-year-old grandfather out of the blue. “He goes, ‘Listen,’” Jones recalled. “‘I don’t exactly understand your lifestyle, but you are my grandson, and I love you.’” Benjamin died 11 years later.
“People can change,” Jones said. “That’s what it told me. It might take their entire lifetime, but people can change.”

Latin America has long been hostile terrain for abortion rights advocates, even in recent decades as legal abortion became accessible in most of Europe, North America and other parts of the world.
But a grassroots feminist movement claimed a victory in Argentina on Wednesday when the Senate legalized abortion in a surprisingly resounding vote — making Argentina the first large country in Latin America to take that step.
Here are some of the forces behind the push for change in Argentina, and some of the questions it raises.
Why Is This Happening Now?
The women’s rights movement has taken on new urgency across Latin America in the past few years, nowhere more so than in Argentina.
A movement that sprang up in 2015 over the murders of women, including the gruesome killings of a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old, grew over the years into a broad national campaign for women’s rights — called Ni Una Menos, or not one woman fewer. Making abortion legal became its primary political goal, driven largely by young activists who have become well-organized and vocal, staging repeated demonstrations.
The #MeToo movement that erupted in the United States in 2017 and spread worldwide has added fuel to those efforts.
In some countries, like Mexico, the primary focus has been on violence against women. But a state-by-state effort in Mexico to make legal abortions more accessible there has also gained ground, with the state of Oaxaca last year becoming the second, after Mexico City, to legalize the procedure.
Rising secularism in Argentina and many other countries, particularly among the young, has also lowered barriers for liberal causes.
An important factor in Argentina was the election last year of President Alberto Fernández, one of the most socially liberal leaders Latin America has had. He has campaigned for abortion rights, gender equality and gay and transgender rights, and last month he legalized home cultivation of marijuana for medical use.
What Are Abortion Laws Like in the Rest of Latin America?
About two dozen countries around the world have laws that not only prohibit abortion but also do not make any exceptions, according to groups that closely monitor access to abortion.
Those countries, primarily in the Americas and Africa, include Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and Suriname. The ban has been enforced with zeal, with women whose pregnancies don’t end in the birth of a healthy baby sometimes falling under suspicion, and those convicted of having abortions sentenced to decades in prison.
From Mexico to Chile, a predominantly Roman Catholic region, most countries outlaw abortion, even early in pregnancy, but make exceptions when pregnancy endangers a woman’s life.
Some countries also allow abortions, up to a certain point in gestation, when the pregnancies result from rape or incest, or when there are serious fetal abnormalities. Chile joined those countries in 2017, when it rolled back one of the world’s strictest abortion bans.
Paraguay drew international attention when a pregnant 10-year-old said to have been raped by her stepfather could not have an abortion because her life was not in danger. The case led to calls for the conservative government to liberalize the law, but it was not changed.
Across Latin America, only three countries have legalized abortion for any reason early in pregnancy; all three are small and are outliers in other important ways, as well.
Cuba, ruled by the Communist Party for more than 60 years, legalized abortion in the 1960s. Guyana, a former British colony with a large non-Christian, South Asian population, took that step in the 1990s. And Uruguay, where about 40% of people report having no religious affiliation, did so in 2012.
What is the Role of Religion?
Historically, more than 90% of the people in Latin America were Catholic, and the church, stolidly opposed to abortion, exerted a powerful influence over not just religious beliefs but also governments and ethical and social norms.
But the church’s grasp has been weakening steadily since the 1970s, and by 2014, fewer than 70% of Latin Americans called themselves Catholic, according to the Pew Research Center.
Sexual abuse scandals that have rocked the church have hit as hard in Latin America as in many other parts of the world, driving some people away from the church and weakening its moral authority. A growing number of people who still identify as Catholic, particularly the young, are not observant and feel comfortable going against the church’s teachings.
But evangelical Protestants, who often take a more conservative line on social issues than many Catholics do, are increasing in numbers and now make up about one-fifth of Latin Americans. That helps explain why Central America, where evangelical churches are strongest, has some of the strictest abortion laws.
At the same time, the number of people who have no religious affiliation, and tend to be liberal on social issues, has also grown, although their ranks remain much smaller than the evangelical population.
Though it is the homeland of Pope Francis, the first pontiff from the Americas, Argentina is one of the most secular countries in Latin America. It is unusual in that surveys show that people with no religion outnumber evangelicals.
Will the Movement Spread Beyond Argentina?
The debate in Argentina has drawn tremendous attention in Latin America and is sure to prompt discussion of abortion in other countries.
Recent efforts to ease access to abortions — successful in Argentina, Chile and the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and unsuccessful in El Salvador, Brazil, and Colombia — show a region grappling with shifting social, cultural and political changes.
The push to change has often come from grassroots movements. Leftist presidents who took power in Latin America over the past two decades have shown little or no interest in changing abortion laws. They include Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, and Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.
Bolivia’s leftist government decriminalized early-term abortion in 2017 for “students, adolescents or girls” — and then repealed the change weeks later.
Fernández, of Argentina, a leftist who made access to abortion one of his top priorities, represents a new generation and a change from his predecessors.

In a year in which COVID-19 caused more than 1.7 million deaths worldwide, sports competitions took place amid much debate over their necessity and the wisdom of their proceeding during a global health crisis. Did any good come from them?
As these personal stories from The New York Times staff and contributors attest, in small ways and momentous ones, sports in 2020 offered some perfectly timed reminders of what it means to be human right now.
When LeBron James brought the Champagne celebration
It was nearing 11 p.m. on Oct. 11, the final night of the NBA’s extended residence at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida, when I joined a small group of reporters outside the Los Angeles Lakers’ locker room.
The Lakers had just defeated the Miami Heat to win another NBA championship — the franchise’s 17th — but it was their first with LeBron James as the team’s centerpiece, and there was no question that this particular title run was unique for other reasons.
The league had spent about four months playing out the remainder of the 2019-20 season inside its celebrated bubble at the theme park. After four months of isolation, daily coronavirus testing and games in empty arenas, the Lakers emerged triumphant.
Outside the locker room on that final night, we could hear the sounds of celebration coming from within — music and singing and cheers. After a few minutes, James appeared. Wearing goggles to go with his commemorative T-shirt and hat, he brandished a bottle of Champagne that he proceeded to spray on the reporters in his immediate vicinity. Since he could not share his excitement with any fans, it seemed he had to settle for doing it with us.
— SCOTT CACCIOLA
When a wrong turn gave us hope
As a dabbler in the sport of triathlon, I know full well that lots of unexpected things happen on the swim-bike-run course. The waves in the swim choppier than advertised. Hills steeper than what you trained for. Never enough water stations on the run.
And, of course, the wrong turn.
So I could certainly relate to British triathlete James Teagle, who veered off course in the final moments of the Santander Triathlon in Spain in September.
He was poised to claim third place, and then he wasn’t. Spanish triathlete Diego Méntrida overtook him. And then he didn’t.
Right at the finish line, true sport happened. Méntrida looked back and paused. In my imagination, he looked back on the whole dreadful year and decided: "Enough. Can we not have a good thing?" And then he did a good thing and let Teagle step past him, for the third-place spot.
Later, Méntrida said he was just being a good sport.
“This is something my parents and my club taught me since I was a child,” Méntrida wrote on Instagram. “In my view it should be a normal thing to do.’’
But that little bit of normal, in a year full of the abnormal, reminded me and others that, yes humanity, we can and will get back on course.

When U.S. Open tennis players became fans
The U.S. Open tennis championships were among the first major international sports events held in the United States after the start of the pandemic. There were no paying spectators, but there were fans.
Whenever a firecracker of a match broke out at Arthur Ashe Stadium, or even on one of the field courts during the first week, other players began to appear in the stands.
Sometimes they cheered on their countrymen. Sometimes Novak Djokovic, or Dominic Thiem, or Sofia Kenin, or Naomi Osaka, would emerge from a luxury suite to catch a few games of Serena Williams grinding once more. Kenin, in particular, seemed to watch for hours and hours, match after match.

When sled dogs raced … home
It was a story about the pandemic. It was a story about an antique airplane. And inevitably, it was a story about dogs.
Thomas Waerner of Norway won the nearly 1,000-mile Iditarod sled dog race in Alaska in March. But his odyssey was just beginning, as travel became increasingly complicated because of the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. Because of border security rules and flight cancellations, especially for cargo planes, Waerner realized: “I can get home, but I can’t get home with my dogs. And I won’t leave them.”
After two months of being stuck in Alaska, he found a novel solution. He learned of an aerospace museum in Norway that hoped to obtain an old plane from an air cargo company based in Alaska. Waerner's sponsors would chip in to help fund the journey, but only if Waerner and his 16 dogs could hitch a ride in a 1960s-era DC-6B airplane. Their 20-hour flight in the unpressurized, noisy cabin led to a nine-hour drive back home.
“It’s the same as for me and you,” Waerner said of his dogs’ homecoming. “It’s nice for them to be in their own bed.”
— VICTOR MATHER
When Michael Jordan took that personally
The perfectly timed release of “The Last Dance” in late March — right as we entered lockdown — was lifesaving. I watched it more than once and laughed and cried. Being transported to those heady Three-peat days — and that wild-hearted Bulls starting roster — reminded me of my ’90s Chicagoland childhood and kept the reality of the outside world at bay.
— VALERY UPSON
Dennis Rodman in the MJ doc :)
Seeing how Dennis Rodman could get up to all his shenanigans — that bender in Vegas — without anyone knowing where he was? Definitely a highlight. And one that would be totally impossible today. Maybe everything but M.J. was my favorite part. He didn’t exactly change anyone’s opinion; he just sort of solidified it.
— NATHAN REESE
When synchronized swimmers trained COVID-free
The USA Artistic Swimming National Team, which in March will compete for a spot at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, spent 76 days training virtually at the beginning of the pandemic.
The swimmers returned to in-person training June 17 and have spent the past six months training eight hours a day, six days a week. They do not operate in a bubble, and they train in proximity to one another, both on land and in the water. But they have not had a single coronavirus case in those six months, according to Adam Andrasko of USA Artistic Swimming.
USA Artistic Swimming has not qualified to send a team, which does a routine with up to eight swimmers, to the Olympics since 2008. It sent only duets in 2012 and 2016 but hopes to send both a team and a duet to Tokyo next summer.
— GILLIAN A. BRASSIL
When the NFL almost went full Vegas
I was in awe of the potential for chaos from the moment I heard about it: The 2020 NFL draft would be set in the fountain of a Las Vegas hotel. Drafted players would be shuttled to a huge, water-locked stage in boats. What could go wrong?
A lot of things.
Moments of drama like these help me, a person who doesn’t watch sports, understand what draws others to the spectacle. Beyond the extreme violence, spectacle has always been a part of the NFL — an element of professional sports that those of us who don’t know what those yellow football flags mean can latch on to. Here is to a lost cultural flash point for those of us who look at sports culture from afar, occasionally peeking in when the noise is loud enough.
And here is to the many, many lost memes, perhaps the biggest casualty of them all.
— JAMAL JORDAN
When Oskar Lindblom returned to the ice
The roar of the crowd was artificial, but the emotion was real when Philadelphia Flyers forward Oskar Lindblom returned to the ice in September after nearly a year spent battling a rare cancer.
Lindblom, 24, learned in November 2019 that he had Ewing’s sarcoma and was ruled out for the season. But the pause across sports, due to the coronavirus pandemic, allowed him to return for the final portion of the season. He had completed his treatments during the suspension of play.
While noise was piped into the fan-less arena in Toronto during the NHL postseason, the officials on the ice applauded and the players — including the opposing Islanders — tapped their sticks in appreciation of Lindblom’s journey back for Game 6 of the second round.
“He’s a true warrior. I know our team supported him every step along the way,” Philadelphia center Kevin Hayes said. “Just to see him in the locker room before we went on the ice was something special.”
— ANDREW KNOLL
When Hayley Wickenheiser challenged the IOC
Hayley Wickenheiser, a four-time Olympic gold medalist in hockey for Canada, was an emergency-room physician in training in March. She could see the distress on doctors’ and nurses’ faces doing her rotation through hospitals. As a member of the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission, Wickhenheiser had to make a choice: Sit in silence as plans for the Summer Olympics continued or speak up about the pandemic’s ravages in order to protect athletes.
The country’s most decorated hockey player opted to discourage Team Canada from going through with Olympic participation as planned.
“This crisis is bigger than even the Olympics,” Wickenheiser wrote on Twitter on March 17. “I think the IOC insisting this will move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity.”
Wickenheiser had several conversations with the Canadian Olympic Committee, which announced five days after her post that it would not send the country’s athletes to Tokyo in 2020 and pressed the IOC toward its eventual decision: postponing the games to the following summer.

When Clayton Kershaw (finally) went all the way
For years, October haunted the greatest pitcher of this generation. Nine times, Clayton Kershaw had poured himself into the effort of taking his team all the way. Nine times, he had come up short.
That changed in 2020. Six years after his third and most recent Cy Young Award, Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to their first World Series title since 1988, the year he was born. In his 10th postseason, everything finally came together with a six-game triumph over the Tampa Bay Rays.
Kershaw now has a winning record in the postseason (13-12), plus a winning record in the World Series (3-2) — and, in a twist, he got to clinch the title in his hometown. The pandemic shifted the World Series to a neutral site for the first time ever: Arlington, Texas, just 20 miles or so from Kershaw’s high school in Dallas. After the final out, he beamed as he spotted his family and friends among the limited fans in attendance.
“It’s just overwhelming to see how much people care about you,” Kershaw said, “and how they want you to have success and reach your dreams.”
— TYLER KEPNER
When a soccer bubble burst
My 9-year-old daughter can tell you her best sports moment of 2020, and it happens to be mine, too: One Saturday morning in mid-October, she played team soccer for the first time in seven months.
The pandemic had kept her from playing with her travel team since its winter season ended in March. Although she had tried to hide it, we could tell that she was sick of backyard drills and juggling the ball in our living room. She was sick of meeting with her coaches on Zoom and sending them videos of the moves she was practicing.
When in-person school was canceled this fall, some risk on the soccer field became risk that was worthwhile, particularly for our sporty, gregarious little girl with no siblings. We crossed our fingers and signed her up for a tryout with a team that was getting together for drills, but not to play matches.
It took only a few minutes for me to know that our decision had been the right one. I saw her eyes squint and knew she was smiling. And then I heard her laugh. It was the sound of happiness.
— JULIET MACUR
When Tommie Smith passed the torch
Tommie Smith, the Olympic gold medalist who was all but banned from track and field after his protest of racial injustice at the Mexico City Games in 1968, doesn’t often speak publicly these days. Now 76, he seems more content to work behind the scenes with the next generation fighting to end police brutality and institutional racism.
But in June, not long after the death of George Floyd set off nationwide protests, Smith felt compelled to address the country’s latest wakeup call. Speaking from his home outside Atlanta, Smith offered much needed context. He was heartened that so many people — including prominent athletes like LeBron James and Patrick Mahomes — were speaking out.
The key, he said, is assuring that when the media moves on and the protesters leave the streets, the harder work of getting people to vote and lobbying for new laws continues.
“Getting young folks involved and voting will change the course of what America is,” he said.

BERLIN — When director Paul Greengrass was gearing up to make his new film, “News of the World,” about a Civil War veteran in 1870s Texas who escorts an orphaned girl to her relatives across the state, he was anticipating one major challenge.
“This is the first film I made with a child actor at the heart of it,” he said recently by phone.
The casting would be difficult on multiple levels, he realized. Although the character is on-screen for much of the movie, she has only a few lines of dialogue. Tom Hanks had already signed on as the lead, so she would have to go “toe to toe” with a superstar, Greengrass said. “It was a very, very hard ask.”
One of the first children he saw during the casting in 2019, however, was Helena Zengel, a then 11-year-old from Berlin with a tomboyish energy and platinum hair.
“She was the only person I really had to look at,” he said. “It was the easiest decision in the film.”
“News of the World,” which opened Dec. 25 in theaters in the United States and Canada, and will be available on Netflix in other countries from February, is an international breakthrough for Zengel, who has already become one of the most talked-about actors — let alone child actors — to emerge in Germany in recent years.
She garnered widespread praise last year for her portrayal of a semi-feral 9-year-old in the movie “System Crasher,” which went on to be Germany’s official submission to the Academy Awards. That performance won her best actress this spring at the Lolas, Germany’s equivalent of the Oscars, making her the youngest recipient of that prize.
In “News of the World,” Zengel’s character, Johanna Leonberger, is left orphaned after her German parents are violently murdered on their farm when she is 4. Taken in and raised by the Kiowa tribe, she is later removed by soldiers, and a traveling veteran, played by Hanks, agrees to bring her to a surviving aunt and uncle.
Zengel has received strong reviews for her performance, with critics praising her ability to imbue her defiant and alienated character with a sense of warmth and intelligence, and for channeling the emotional horrors of Johanna’s back story in near silence. Most of her lines are in Kiowa, a language she had to learn for the part.
Speaking via Zoom recently, Zengel was far gigglier and chattier — which is to say, far more like a regular 12-year-old — than her recent roles might suggest. She said that, like most children in Germany, she had spent most of this year at home, and that she was currently quarantined because classmates had tested positive for the coronavirus.
Before being cast in the film, she said, she had never heard of Hanks.
“I think I’d seen the ‘Da Vinci Code’ before, but I didn’t know who he was,” she said. “I thought it was just some actor.”
In an email, Hanks praised Zengel’s skill of performing “with no buildup, no apprehension and no self-consciousness,” and said he wished he had “her same ease, her simplicity.”
Zengel said she had never taken an acting class, “because I’m not sure if there was much for me to learn.”
“I stand in front of the camera, I know what I want, and I do it,” she said, matter-of-factly.
This focus and willpower, her mother, Anne Zengel, explained, has been her daughter’s hallmark ever since she was a toddler. Her earliest forays into acting, at age 4, had emerged largely out of parental frustration, she said, because her daughter had “three times as much intensity” as other children and would act out if she was denied something she wanted.
“She had to function in society, so we had to figure out how to redirect her energy,” she said.
She enrolled Helena in ice-skating classes and encouraged her to try acting. After a few small roles in German TV crime shows, as a bank robber’s daughter or a girl who falls from a bridge, she eventually landed a lead role in a German art-house film, “Dark Blue Girl,” at age 7.
“At some point, the thing happened that I hoped would happen,” her mother said. “She was actually valued for being so intense.”
In 2017, Zengel caught the attention of Nora Fingscheidt, the German director of “System Crasher,” a harrowing drama centered on a girl named Benni who is abused as a baby and abandoned by her mother, and who later lashes out at her caregivers and the society around her. The movie included a number of upsetting scenes, including of violence between children.
In an interview, Fingscheidt said she needed a child actor who could convey Benni’s often terrifying physicality, while shouldering the psychological burden of the part.
She was struck by Zengel’s “cinematographic quality, with almost translucent white skin, white hair that make her look like an angel, but with an ambivalence that is fascinating,” she said. During the child actor’s audition, in which she was asked to improvise a scene in which she “freaks out” by screaming and throwing things, Fingscheidt said that she was drawn in by the way her “eyes sparkled when I told her she could behave as badly as she wanted.”
To help Zengel distinguish herself from her traumatized character, Fingscheidt said, the two would mime a little scene once shooting was over, with the director holding her hand like a shower head and the child actor pretending to wash underneath it, to indicate her transition back to herself. Zengel also wrote a journal, to help her process her feelings, the director added.
Zengel said the experience of making “System Crasher” helped her prepare for her role as Johanna, which she conceded was “not as extreme.”
Now Zengel is confronting the strange reality of international fame while being stuck at home, finishing seventh grade. This fall, Variety magazine selected her as one of its “actors to watch,” and she said she had received offers for other roles in recent months, but that she was waiting until the pandemic subsided before making any decisions.
She said that she was open to moving to the United States, although her mother said she was intent on her daughter having a normal childhood, and that she was comforted by Germany’s comparatively low-key celebrity culture.
“The thing about acting is that you just need to do it, and as long as you’re happy with it, then you’re doing it right,” Zengel said. “Also, it’s very fun to run around and scream.”

In most cities this New Year’s Eve, there will be no roaring crowds, no gatherings for fireworks shows and, let’s hope, no strangers kissing at midnight. But, after a year punctuated by disease, unemployment and racial unrest, people around the world, in different circumstances than usual, will still raise a glass and toast the start of 2021.
Muted Celebrations in Big Cities
Even in countries where coronavirus cases are low, like Australia, local governments have gone back and forth, making plans and then canceling them again, as they try to balance keeping people safe with allowing them to let loose after a difficult year.
In Sydney, authorities tightened restrictions in recent days after an increase in locally transmitted cases. Parties of up to 10 guests are allowed in parts of the city, but residents are being encouraged to watch the seven-minute fireworks show over the Sydney Harbor Bridge on TV. A viewing party for frontline workers was canceled.
The fireworks display over Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong was also canceled, along with the Lunar New Year parade in February, according to The South China Morning Post.
In London, the annual fireworks display along the Thames River has been canceled, but Big Ben, which has been silent while undergoing renovation, will chime at midnight. The city’s residents are under England’s strictest lockdown measures, which are being extended Thursday to cover the majority of the country’s population. Under those rules, people can leave home only for certain activities, such as exercise and grocery shopping.
Edinburgh’s Hogmanay celebrations, which typically involve processions, fireworks and singing, will be held online.
In Paris, composer-performer Jean-Michel Jarre will host a free, virtual livestreamed concert, called “Welcome to the Other Side,” from a studio near Notre Dame Cathedral. France and Italy are among several countries in Europe that have imposed curfews during the pandemic to prevent large gatherings at night.
Federal and state leaders in Germany banned the sale of fireworks, as the government tries to limit gatherings.
In Rio de Janeiro, where revelers usually wear white and flock to the beach, authorities will block beach access to prevent crowds from gathering.
And in New York, for the first time in decades, Times Square will be closed to most members of the public. Only dozens of selected frontline workers and their families will be permitted near the stage, where performers will include Gloria Gaynor, who will sing her hit “I Will Survive.”
Will the Ball Still Drop at Midnight in Times Square?
Yes. While there will be no rowdy crowds, the descending crystal ball will still count down the final seconds of the year.
The ball first dropped in 1907, when hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks over the newly built New York Times building. The tradition has happened nearly every year since, aside from 1942-43 and 1943-44, when lights were turned off as a precaution against air raids during World War II.
Thousands of revelers still gathered those years, even if the celebrations were less rowdy than usual.
“There was a note of sluggishness, an absence of real gayety,” Meyer Berger wrote in a front-page article in The Times on Jan. 1, 1943. “The restless thousands lacked zest. War somehow laid its hand on the celebration and tended to mute it.”
New Year’s Eve in an Earlier Pandemic
In 1918, a deadly pandemic swept the world, but the front page of The Times on Jan. 1, 1919, barely mentioned it, other than a small advertisement for lozenges to “ward off influenza!”
The headlines instead were dominated by the end of World War I.
On New Year’s Eve, “Times Square was crowded,” according to The Times, although it was not as loud as the celebrations after the end of the war less than two months earlier.
“Men in uniform were lined up, leaning against buildings on both sides of Broadway, watching critically to see whether New Year’s Eve in the heart of New York City was an event which deserved its reputation.”
Will the Night Look Normal Anywhere?
In New Zealand, the fireworks show and parties will go on as usual in Auckland, one of the first major cities to ring in 2021.
“Thanks to the incredible efforts of all New Zealanders to eliminate COVID-19, we’re in the fortunate position of being able to live our lives relatively normally,” Mayor Phil Goff said this month. “That’s worth celebrating, and this year’s spectacular display will be a perfect opportunity for Aucklanders to do that.”
I’ll Be Home. How Should I Celebrate?
There are plenty of virtual events happening, some of which require tickets.
Tomorrowland, a Belgian music festival franchise, is hosting a party with performers including David Guetta, French DJ and producer. Steve Aoki, DJ, musician and music producer, will be headlining an event streamed by Los Angeles’ Grand Park. Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will be broadcasting live from Times Square starting at 8 p.m. Eastern on CNN.
If you never liked New Year’s Eve to begin with, this is the year to watch a bit of TV or listen to some music, go to sleep before midnight and revel in the fact that you’re probably not missing anything.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Some years, I have to dig deep to come up with worthy honorees for the Good Tech Awards, my annual column that honors what I consider the most humane and altruistic tech projects of the year.
Not in 2020, though. This year, technology did more for us than ever — helping us work from home, set up remote schools, communicate with our loved ones, organize for racial justice, protect the integrity of an election and keep the economy running during a pandemic. And all over the world, technologists stepped up to help solve critical problems and keep us safe.
Plenty of large tech companies gave money to COVID-19 relief efforts, anti-racism groups and other philanthropic causes. Others donated personal protective equipment from their corporate stockpiles or built apps for contact tracing and other critical pandemic tasks.
But there were less-heralded tech contributions that made a real difference this year, and the people behind them deserve credit. So let’s give thanks to a few of the technologists who stepped up in 2020.
To U.S. Digital Response, for Pandemic-proofing Our Infrastructure
In March, as COVID-19 began spreading across the country, a group of tech workers assembled in Slack rooms and on Zoom calls to figure out how they could use their tech expertise to help with the crisis. The result was the U.S. Digital Response, now a network of more than 6,000 coders, data scientists and researchers who are helping local and state governments respond to COVID-19.
So far, the group — which is led by Raylene Yung, a former Facebook and Stripe executive, and includes volunteers from most of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies — has taken on pro bono projects in dozens of states. It helped Pennsylvania’s Health Department set up an online data dashboard to track the number of available hospital beds and ventilators. It helped Seattle health officials set up an online testing hub and rebuilt a Kansas Department of Labor website that was used to file for unemployment benefits.
Ideally, cities and states would have enough money and technical expertise to do these things themselves. But until that happens, we are lucky that the USDR is stepping in to fill the gaps.
To Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, for Helping Put Out the Fires
Because of climate change, we are probably in for many more wildfires like the ones that burned through the West Coast this summer, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. But in future years, we might be better equipped to deal with them thanks to tools like those made by Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, three startups that are trying to modernize the firefighter’s outdated arsenal.
Perimeter, a small startup in the Bay Area, makes collaborative mapping and data-sharing software for emergency workers. Its founder, Bailey Farren, is the 24-year-old daughter of a retired fire captain and a paramedic. After she and her family were forced to evacuate during the 2017 Tubbs fire, she saw the need for a better communication system than the two-way radios and paper maps that emergency workers often used. Perimeter’s app, which allows fire departments to share real-time evacuation routes and safety updates, is being tested in California cities including Palo Alto and Petaluma, and the company plans to expand to other states soon.
Technosylva, another California startup, makes predictive modeling software that allows fire departments to calculate where a fire is heading, how fast it is moving and what weather patterns might affect its path. Its software is used in nine states and helped the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection predict the trajectory of wildfires this year, saving valuable time for those trying to extinguish the blazes.
Ignis, created by a Nebraska company, Drone Amplified, is used for “prescribed burns” — small fires purposely set in the path of a larger wildfire to steal its fuel. The system attaches to a drone and drops small incendiaries, known as “dragon eggs,” from a safe height at a much lower cost and personal risk than a helicopter. Ignis was used to battle fires in Colorado, California and Oregon this year and recently struck a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service.
To Our Data Bodies and Data for Black Lives, for Fueling Tech’s Racial Reckoning
When George Floyd was killed in May, lots of Silicon Valley tech companies raced to voice their support for racial justice. But many of those companies have continued to make products that put Black communities at risk — whether it is through amplifying misinformation, deploying biased artificial intelligence or perpetuating racism in their workforces.
This year, I have been more impressed by community-based efforts I have seen to support Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist movements using the tools of technology to hold institutions accountable. One of these efforts, Our Data Bodies, is an education project run by researchers and organizers in Los Angeles; Detroit; Charlotte, North Carolina; and other cities. It has worked to teach communities of color how their personal data is collected and used by tech firms and government agencies. This year, it hosted virtual trainings for community organizers to teach them how to fight potentially harmful technologies like facial recognition.
Another effort, Data for Black Lives, is a group of technologists and activists led by Yeshimabeit Milner that is using the tools of data science to empower Black communities. This year, the group compiled state-level data about the impact of COVID-19 on Black people, and it is in the early stages of putting together a nationwide database of technologies used by police departments, with evidence of how those technologies disproportionately harm Black people.
To Frontline Foods, for Feeding Our Health Care Heroes
Last spring, when hospitals were filling up with COVID-19 patients and restaurants were struggling to survive, Frank Barbieri and Ryan Sarver, two San Francisco tech veterans, and their friend Sydney Gressel, a nurse in the medical system of the University of California, San Francisco, came up with the idea of connecting hungry front-line health workers with local restaurants that badly needed more business. They began raising money and soliciting help from their networks in the tech community to send restaurant meals to health workers, and Frontline Foods was born.
Today, Frontline Foods is part of World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit started by chef José Andrés. It has raised more than $10 million, has hundreds of volunteers throughout the country coordinating meal drop-offs using tools like Slack and AirTable, and has served more than 500,000 meals to hospitals and clinics while keeping many struggling restaurants busy and afloat.
To Jackbox Games, for Livening Up My Quarantine
I have always been a gamer, but 2020 was the year I needed games to escape the stressful and depressing reality of pandemic life. And of all the games I played, the simple, party-style games with friends and family over Zoom gave me the most joy. Many were made by Jackbox Games.
Jackbox is best known for its “party packs” of games you can play remotely with groups. (I am partial to Quiplash, in which you compete to come up with funny responses to prompts like “The worst thing to hear during a massage.”) The company’s pandemic-fueled boom — it has more than doubled its user base this year — may fade when we can all go outside and see our friends in person again. But it has been invaluable for my sanity this year.
To the Scientists Developing COVID-19 Vaccines, for Getting Us Back to Normal
The most important innovation of the year, by a mile, was not really “technology” in the conventional, Silicon Valley sense of the word. But make no mistake: The scientists at Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, the National Institutes of Health, and other pharmaceutical companies and research labs whose work led to the first approved COVID-19 vaccines are innovators of the highest order, and they probably did more to alleviate human suffering this year than all the app developers and hardware-makers in the world combined.
These scientists — and the teams that supported them — worked under enormous pressure and crushing deadlines to develop a new kind of mRNA vaccine for the coronavirus, guide it through clinical trials and get it out to the public in record time. The vaccines are a true triumph of science, and because of these people’s hard work, hundreds of millions of Americans will get to spend some or most of 2021 hugging their relatives, reopening their businesses, traveling safely and doing all of the socially undistant things that give us meaning and joy.

NEW YORK — Every December, the eyes of the world are drawn to New York City, where a glittering crystal ball in midtown Manhattan marks a communal chance for a new beginning. Hundreds of thousands assemble in person; millions more watch on television, pausing for a moment to join an annual ritual.
With some excitement and anticipation, they turn their eyes to Times Square and begin counting along, starting at …
Ten.
In March, as the pandemic swept through New York City, the groups in charge of the New Year’s Eve ball drop in Times Square realized that things were unlikely to proceed as planned.
Broadway, an industry at the heart of Times Square’s appeal, was shutting down for months. Large gatherings had been banned indefinitely, and several major city events had already been scrapped. Rumors were flying in text messages and on Twitter that officials might lock down the city.
Organizers knew that canceling the festivities would be devastating. New Year’s Eve in Times Square has become a symbol of a booming and vibrant New York City and has been at the center of the holiday for decades.
Nine …
… months before this year’s celebration, it looked as if that collective ritual, one of the few that remain in an increasingly segmented society, might be threatened.
Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said organizers were determined to lower the ball from its perch above the city. They also knew that crowds would flock to the area as they had for more than a century, whether they planned a celebration or not.
What remained unclear was whether and how the event’s producers would adapt the night’s other customs — the performances, the crowds and the confetti — to the reality of the pandemic.
“We knew that we had to be prepared for a crowd no matter what,” Tompkins said. “And then it was just a question of ‘Oh my God, how are we going to do this?’ ”
Over months of planning, an answer emerged. This year, for the first time in decades, Times Square will be closed to the public on New Year’s Eve. Only production workers and dozens of selected frontline workers and their families will be permitted near the stage.
On Wednesday, police officials urged the public to stay home.
“There are absolutely no spectators allowed in Times Square,” Chief Terence A. Monahan, the top uniformed member, said at a news conference.
“Don’t even attempt to come down there and watch it,” he added.
As it does every year, the city will close streets in the area, and police officers will operate checkpoints to prevent access. But instead of letting in visitors in drips, all uninvited guests will be turned away, with pedestrians limited starting at 3 p.m. Thursday.
Monahan said the Police Department would have 80% fewer officers in Times Square than on a normal New Year’s Eve.
“Anyone that starts to gather, they’re going to be told to move along,” he said. “We are not going to allow people to stand on the street corner and stare up.”
Eight-
by-8-foot pens will be spaced out at socially distant intervals on the streets. They will hold around 40 workers who kept the city and country running safely and smoothly in the year’s darkest hours and who have been invited to bring their families along to celebrate.
On the guest list are a pediatrician at Elmhurst Hospital, a public hospital that was overwhelmed by the pandemic; a pizza delivery driver who became ill with the coronavirus; and Ronald Colbert, a Staten Island Ferry operator who will be attending his 40th Times Square ball drop.
“I am just so honored and happy,” said Colbert, 66, who worked through the pandemic. “The elements of the excitement that Times Square offers — I get to share that again.”
Seven(th) …
Avenue will not be packed with people trying to catch a glimpse of the outdoor concert, which will be staged according to state and industry guidelines for safe media productions.
This year’s musical guests include Gloria Gaynor singing “I Will Survive,” a disco classic resurfaced as a pandemic anthem, as well as performances by Jennifer Lopez, Billy Porter and Cyndi Lauper.
Six …
feet apart will remain the rule of thumb for the television workers who will broadcast Times Square’s billboards across the country. For those who remain stuck at home, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” will still rock on ABC. In a year without party banter, Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will again offer their New Year’s Eve buddy comedy act on CNN.
The TV networks will project the image of a Times Square transformed by the pandemic, one without the throngs of revelers in glittering gear who wait in the cold for hours to take part in a national spectacle.
Still, Tompkins and Jeff Straus, president of Countdown Entertainment, which coproduces the Times Square event, both said it was important to them that an audience of some kind be present if circumstances allowed.
“There’s an energy that you get from watching other people being happy,” Straus said.
During the spring, when the pandemic ravaged New York City, photos of an eerily vacant Times Square became a grim meme. The deserted plaza became an enduring image of the crisis and a visual shorthand for the devastating circumstances the virus had wrought.
With 2020 closing and the calendar resetting, both men hoped they could provide a fresh start and a new narrative for one of the world’s most famous intersections.
“We want to show a city with a heartbeat,” Straus said. “And a city that’s alive.”
Five …
months ago, in July, Straus and Tompkins got the first hint that a celebration resembling those years past would be possible.
Times Square has been home to major New Year’s Eve festivities since as early as 1904, when hundreds of thousands gathered in midtown Manhattan to watch fireworks light up the newly built New York Times Building, now known as One Times Square.
The ball was first dropped in 1907. Since then, it has been lowered on New Year’s Eve nearly every year, with breaks only in 1942 and 1943 because of World War II-related “dimouts” that required lights to be shut off as a protection against air attacks.
But even without the ball to watch, massive crowds still gathered at Times Square for more muted celebrations described in The Times as having a “weird quality” in the first year but “gayer” and “greater” the next.
“So much of the energy comes from the hordes of people,” said Tompkins, who has been involved with the ball drop since 2002. “And so there will definitely be a different energy in Times Square.”
Still, that there would be energy at all was hardly guaranteed. Though organizers continued to plan, they nervously watched as a number of similarly large events were canceled by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Four …
days into July, however, the city worked with Macy’s to reconfigure its annual fireworks extravaganza.
For Straus and Tompkins, it was a clear signal that city officials were determined to preserve New York City traditions while keeping people safely at home.
Three …
other events also helped prove that an altered New Year’s Eve was feasible, Straus said.
The MTV Video Music Awards offered a template for musical performances. The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade showed audiences welcoming a scaled-down tradition, and the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting proved large-scale events could take place safely even amid a surge in the pandemic.
Those watching the New Year’s Eve ceremonies this year, whether on television or through the official online webcast, should expect a more intimate viewing experience, Straus said. (People seeking something more immersive can also download an app that uses augmented reality to bring Times Square home.)
Two …
blocks around Times Square will be used for this year’s celebration, a much smaller footprint than usual. That diminished scale will likely be clear on camera, Straus said. The sweeping shots showing a blocks-long street party will be axed. Close-ups won’t show smiles, Straus said, because faces will be covered.
“We want to show a physically distanced Times Square,” Straus said. "We want to show a Times Square that is wearing masks.”
For the first time in 26 years, Straus will not be in Times Square, showered by confetti when the clock strikes midnight.
In a break from tradition, he will watch on TV along with much of the country as it counts down the end of a brutal year and looks to make a fresh start in the next …

New Train Hall Opens at Penn Station, Echoing Building’s Former Glory

NEW YORK — For more than a half-century, New Yorkers have trudged through the crammed platforms, dark hallways and oppressively low ceilings of Pennsylvania Station, the busiest and perhaps most miserable train hub in North America.
Entombed beneath Madison Square Garden, the station served 650,000 riders each weekday before the pandemic, or three times the number it was built to handle.
But as more commuters return to Penn Station next year, they will be welcomed by a new, $1.6 billion train hall complete with more than an acre of glass skylights, art installations and 92-foot-high ceilings that Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who championed the project, has likened to the majestic Grand Central Terminal.
After nearly three years of construction, the new Moynihan Train Hall, in the James A. Farley Post Office building across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station, will open to the public Jan. 1 as a waiting room for Amtrak and Long Island Rail Road passengers.
For decades, the huge undertaking was considered an absolution of sorts for one of the city’s greatest sins: the demolition in the 1960s of the original Penn Station building, an awe-inspiring structure that was a stately gateway to the country’s economic powerhouse.
The destruction of the station was a turning point in New York’s civic life. It prompted a fierce backlash among defenders of the city’s architectural heritage, the creation of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and renewed efforts to protect Grand Central Terminal.
That the project has been completed during a period when the city was brought to a standstill is a hopeful reminder that the bustle of midtown Manhattan will return, Cuomo said.
The train hall “sends a clear message to the world that while we suffered greatly as a result of this once-in-a-century health crisis, the pandemic did not stop us from dreaming big and building for the future,” he added.
The project has its detractors, who fault state officials for not going far enough in reimagining Penn Station. These critics note that the Moynihan Train Hall will serve only some of the passengers who use Penn Station, ignoring the needs of subway riders.
For nearly 30 years, elected leaders have debated transforming the Farley building from a post office to an extension of Penn Station — an idea first proposed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was known for his innovative, if not always realistic, solutions to urban ills.
The Farley building, Moynihan argued, offered an obvious solution to Penn Station’s overcrowding: Commuter train tracks ran beneath the large post office, which was no longer a busy mail hub but still had a grandeur that echoed the original Penn Station’s. That building was demolished starting in 1963 as the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. went bankrupt.
At least five versions of Moynihan’s original plan later, Cuomo broke ground for the project in 2017. Two major private developers, Related Cos. and Vornado, contributed $630 million in exchange for a 99-year lease on much of the century-old Farley building; the other $970 million came from public sources.
The train hall is one of several major infrastructure projects that Cuomo has spearheaded as he seeks to make such initiatives a hallmark of his tenure.
Still, only passengers who use Amtrak or the Long Island Rail Road — which account for 30,000 and 230,000 of Penn Station’s 650,000 daily riders — will have access to trains directly from the Moynihan hall, which is atop platforms for both.
The station’s six subway lines run along Eighth and Seventh avenues and Avenue of the Americas — a good distance from the new train hall. That leaves subway riders, who tend to be less affluent than Amtrak users, to the bowels of Penn Station.
“By opening Moynihan, it’s basically like opening the first-class lounge at the airport,” said Vishaan Chakrabarti, who founded Practice for Architecture and Urbanism, a New York architecture firm, and proposed a radical plan to move Madison Square Garden and open up Penn Station in 2016.
“Moynihan is a really good phase one; it’s the appetizer,” Chakrabarti said. “But the main station in the subbasement of the Garden is the entree.”
The new hall also does not solve Penn Station’s fundamental problem: a lack of capacity.
In recent years, growing ridership on the commuter rail and subway lines that serve the station has clogged platforms and passageways with bottlenecks.
While the new hall will relieve some of the strain by moving the designated waiting area for all Amtrak trains out of Penn Station, additional trains, tracks and platforms are needed to truly thin the station’s crowds.
To address the station’s limited capacity, elected officials have proposed two major infrastructure projects — known as Gateway and Penn South — that would require years of construction and many billions of dollars of investment.
The Gateway project, which would fix the deteriorating rail tunnels under the Hudson River and double the rail capacity into and out of Penn Station, needs federal financing and approval. The plans have been mired in a political standoff between President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders for the past four years.
In January 2020, Cuomo introduced plans for the Penn South project, under which the state would acquire the city block south of Penn Station and build eight new train tracks. The expansion would allow the transit hub to accommodate 175,000 more riders.
Neither project has gotten off the ground, although elected officials are hopeful that they will move forward under President-elect Joe Biden, an enthusiastic supporter of Amtrak and major infrastructure projects.
Still, even before the projects are complete, the 255,000-square-foot Moynihan hall could help reinvigorate the surrounding neighborhood, which has long been considered a poor cousin to the area near Grand Central Terminal.
Already, there are signs of revival. Apple, Amazon and Google have all leased office space in the area, turning it into an emerging tech corridor. In August, Facebook joined their ranks and agreed to lease all of the 730,000-square-foot office space in the Farley building.
As some of the tech companies’ employees and other midtown office workers return to commuting next year, elected officials and transit experts hope the new train hall could help coax them back onto public transit and breathe life back into the heart of the city.
“The timing of this couldn’t possibly be better,” said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, a planning group. “Right now is a time when we need to bring people back to the city and show how transit and public spaces are safe. Moynihan does just that.”

U.K. Parliament Set to Approve Post-Brexit Trade Deal

LONDON — Approval of a trade deal between Britain and the European Union was being hurried through the British Parliament in just a day Wednesday, a rushed conclusion to a Brexit saga that has divided Britons and convulsed their politics for more than four years.
The House of Commons overwhelmingly endorsed the Brexit trade deal by 521 votes to 73 sending it to the House of Lords, Parliament’s second chamber, where ratification is also expected later in the day.
The lawmakers, recalled from their vacations for the task, approved the deal after considering more than 1,200 pages of dense legal text that will shape the relationship between Britain and continental Europe for decades to come and prompt the biggest change in the country’s trading ties in recent history.
Despite the absence of time for scrutiny, the ease with which the agreement passed through the House of Commons was in stark contrast to many knife-edge votes held before 2019’s general election when Parliament was gridlocked over Brexit.
The trade agreement, struck by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Dec. 24, came after 11 months of tortuous negotiation and provides tariff-free access for Britain to European markets. It is due to come into force Friday.
At that point, Britain will leave the European Union’s single market and customs union, severing the economic integration with the bloc forged in recent decades as part of a huge trading area. Britain formally quit the bloc’s political structures in January but opted to remain under its economic rules until the end of the year, pending a trade agreement.
Conservative lawmakers, including a caucus of hard-line Brexit supporters, have rallied behind the deal struck by Johnson, who won a landslide general election victory in December 2019 after promising a relatively distant economic relationship with the bloc and the prioritizing of national sovereignty.
Even the opposition Labour Party ordered its lawmakers to support the agreement on the basis that it is better than nothing, although several said they would refuse to vote for an agreement that creates new barriers to trade with European nations.
Critics note that Johnson’s deal secures little for Britain’s important services sector and means added bureaucracy for British businesses exporting to continental Europe that will have to make millions of additional customs declarations.
But Johnson achieved his political objective by increasing the country’s ability to exert its sovereignty and make decisions without being restricted by EU institutions such as its Court of Justice.
“Having taken back control of our money, our borders, our laws and our waters by leaving the European Union on Jan. 31, we now seize this moment to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbors based on free trade and friendly cooperation,” Johnson said as he opened the debate in Parliament.
Some lawmakers are angry at the speed with which they were asked to make a decision on Brexit — a policy that was intended to restore power to the British Parliament.
But Wednesday, Parliament was effectively presented with a take-it-or-leave-it choice. Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader, described Johnson’s agreement as a “thin deal” with many flaws but added that “a thin deal is better than no deal.”
Voting against it would lead to a chaotic rupture with the bloc at the end of the week, while supporting the agreement would provide a basis on which to build a better relationship, he added.
The agreement has received provisional approval from the European Union, and a vote is expected in the European Parliament next month. The accord was signed by Johnson on Wednesday afternoon, so a move by Parliament not to approve the document would plunge the country into legal limbo.
Providing that it is approved by the House of Lords, the process is expected to be completed around midnight.
The agreement has many critics. Representatives of trawler fleets have accused Johnson of caving in to the European Union over fishing rights, and business leaders fret about the additional costs and administrative burdens resulting from the deal, and by the fact that little was achieved for the services sector, which accounts for about four-fifths of the British economy.
While the European Union exports more goods to Britain than it imports, the reverse is true with services.
Among those who said they would support the deal, but with reservations, was Theresa May, the former prime minister who lost her job after failing, on several occasions, to persuade Parliament to support her plan to extract Britain from the bloc.
May attacked the Labour Party for opposing her blueprint from 2019 and pointed to gaps in Johnson’s agreement.
“We have a deal in trade that benefits the EU, but not a deal in services which would have benefited the U.K.,” she said.
Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party’s lawmakers in Britain’s Parliament, said the agreement would mean “mountains of more bureaucracy” for exporters.
But Brexit supporters praised the prime minister, focusing on sovereignty rather than economics.
William Cash, a Conservative lawmaker who has spent his career opposing European integration, described the deal as a “true turning point in our history” and said that Johnson had “saved our democracy.”

LONDON — Britain on Wednesday became the first country to give emergency authorization to the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, clearing the path for a cheap and easy-to-store shot that much of the world will rely on to help end the pandemic.
In a bold departure from prevailing strategies around the world, the British government also decided to begin giving as many people as possible a first vaccine dose, rather than holding back supplies for quick second shots, greatly expanding the number of people who will be inoculated.
That decision put Britain at the vanguard of a far-reaching and uncertain experiment in speeding up vaccinations, one that some scientists believe will curb the suffering wrought by a pandemic that has been killing hundreds of people each day in Britain and thousands more around the world.
The global effort to accelerate vaccinations, coming as a new, more contagious variant of the virus has emerged in Britain, gathered steam on Wednesday as China said clinical trial results showed high efficacy for one of its vaccine candidates, an announcement that sent positive signals about the global rollout of Chinese vaccines but was short on crucial details.
The effects of delaying second doses as a way of giving more people the partial protection of a single dose are not fully known. Britain, believed by experts to be the first country to undertake such a plan, will also delay second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which has been in use in the country for several weeks and has been shown in clinical trials to have considerable efficacy after a single dose.
Some participants in the clinical trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine were given the two doses several months apart. British regulators said on Wednesday that the first dose of the vaccine had 70% efficacy in protecting against COVID-19 in the period between that shot taking effect and a second shot being administered, though those figures held for a limited subset of trial participants and have not been published.
Together, the two moves by Britain — authorizing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and lengthening the gap between doses — offered the clearest signal yet of how countries still in the grip of the virus might hasten the pace of vaccination programs.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca shot is poised to become the world’s dominant form of inoculation. At $3 to $4 a dose, it is a fraction of the cost of some other vaccines. It can be also shipped and stored in normal refrigerators for six months, rather than in the ultracold freezers required by vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, making it easier to administer to people in poorer and harder-to-reach areas.
“This is very good news for the world — it makes a global approach to a global pandemic much easier,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Of the decision to delay the second doses, he said, “In a pandemic, it will be better to get more people some level of protection than to have all of the people being vaccinated get full protection.”
Instead of administering the two shots of the coronavirus vaccines within a month as was originally planned, clinicians in Britain will wait as long as 12 weeks to give people second doses, the government said. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said people would start receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine early next week.
For Britain, where hospitals are overwhelmed by a deluge of cases of a new, more contagious variant of the virus, the decision by its drug regulator offered some hope of a reprieve. The health service is preparing to soon vaccinate 1 million people per week at makeshift sites in soccer stadiums and racecourses.
When given in two full-strength doses, AstraZeneca’s vaccine showed 62% efficacy in clinical trials — considerably lower than the roughly 95% efficacy achieved by Pfizer and Moderna’s shots. For reasons that scientists do not yet understand, AstraZeneca’s vaccine showed 90% efficacy in a smaller group of volunteers who were given a half-strength initial dose.
No one who received the vaccine in the clinical trials developed severe COVID-19 or was hospitalized.
British regulators authorized the vaccine at two full-strength doses, saying that the more promising results from the other regimen were not borne out by a full analysis. They cautioned that the promising results for efficacy after a single dose of the vaccine held only in a limited number of trial participants.
In recent days, the Oxford scientists who developed the vaccine have voiced some support for delaying second doses. Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said in a radio interview on Monday that it made “a lot of sense to get started with as many people as possible” by delaying the second dose.
Britain’s health service must now figure out how to persuade people to take a vaccine that appears less effective than other available shots, but that nevertheless could hasten the end of the pandemic.
The authorization relied on data from late-stage clinical trials in Britain and Brazil. India’s drug regulator is also expected to decide soon whether to authorize the vaccine, which is being manufactured there by a local vaccine producer, the Serum Institute.
A decision is further off in the United States, where the Food and Drug Administration is waiting for data from a separate clinical trial. The study was halted in September and delayed for nearly seven weeks — much longer than in other countries — as regulators investigated whether an illness in a participant in Britain was related to the vaccine. American regulators ultimately allowed the trial to proceed.
Vaccinations have so far been proceeding slowly in many countries, but China and Russia announced on Wednesday what they described as positive developments for inoculations they had developed and that are already in widespread use.
China said that an early analysis of Phase 3 trials of one of its vaccine candidates, which is already in use in the country, showed it had an efficacy rate of 79%. If supported, the results would bolster officials’ claims that China’s vaccine candidates are safe and effective.
Russia also secured a vote of confidence in the safety of its Sputnik V vaccine, with Belarus and Argentina this week becoming the first countries outside Russia to begin injecting it on a large scale. Sputnik V has been dogged by criticism since President Vladimir Putin announced in August that the vaccine was ready for use even though clinical trials had not been completed.
AstraZeneca has set more ambitious manufacturing targets than other Western vaccine makers, saying that it expects to be able to make up to 3 billion doses next year. At two doses per person, that would be enough to inoculate nearly 1 in 5 people worldwide. The company has pledged to make it available at cost around the world until at least July 2021 and in poorer countries in perpetuity.
But the company has also been dogged by communication blunders that have damaged its relationship with U.S. regulators and raised doubts about whether the vaccine will stand up to intense public and scientific scrutiny. Those blunders have set back the vaccine’s timeline in the United States, where key FDA officials were stunned to learn of the pause in its clinical trials in September not from AstraZeneca, but from the media.
These setbacks have not dampened enthusiasm in Britain for the country’s leading homegrown vaccine, one that analysts have said could right the course of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s careening tenure if rolled out quickly.
Having ordered 100 million doses, 40 million of which are supposed to be available by March, Britain has made the AstraZeneca shot the linchpin of its vaccination strategy. Since authorizing Pfizer’s vaccine on Dec. 2, Britain has used it to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of people. But the country has struggled to administer it beyond hospitals and doctor’s offices, leaving some of its highest-priority recipients, like nursing home residents, still vulnerable.

Texto completo: Two and a half hours after being injected with a COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Taneisha Wilson was hit with the worst headache of her life.
In her home office in Cranston, Rhode Island, Wilson, 36, an emergency physician with a constitution she calls "horse-like," laid her head down on the desk. Fighting a wave of nausea, she let out an involuntary groan loud enough to be heard by her husband in a room down the hall.
"Are you OK, babe?" he called.
"It felt like I got smacked," Wilson recalled.
That is not how most people who get the vaccine feel afterward, but reactions like Wilson's were not uncommon in the clinical trial results of the two COVID vaccines now being distributed across the country.
Pfizer, the company that makes the one she received, reported that some 13% of recipients ages 18 to 55 had a bad headache after the first dose. About 16% of those who received the other vaccine, made by Moderna, in a late-stage trial had a reaction strong enough to prevent them from going about their daily routine.
As tens of millions of Americans await their turn for a shot, many are hungering for details about what to expect. So, at the request of friends, colleagues and reporters, some people like Wilson who were in the vanguard of the biggest vaccination program in U.S. history are beginning to offer their personal accounts.
The New York Times interviewed several dozen of the newly vaccinated in the days afterward. They recounted a wide spectrum of responses, from no reaction at all - "Can't even tell I had the shot," said a hospital worker in Iowa City, Iowa - to symptoms like uncontrolled shivering and "brain fog." A nurse assistant in Glendora, California, wondered whether the fever he ran was a side effect of the vaccine or a sign that he had been infected by one of his COVID patients.
And there was a dizzying variety of sore arms. Some likened the pain to that from a flu shot; for others, it was considerably worse.
Like nearly every vaccine recipient who spoke to The Times for this article, Wilson stressed that she had no regrets about getting the shot, despite the headache, which was gone within 36 hours. The Food and Drug Administration has found the vaccines to be safe and remarkably effective. And public health leaders say mass vaccination is the only hope for controlling the virus that is now claiming the lives of close to 3,000 Americans a day.
But in these first weeks of vaccination, there is an inescapable element of suspense.
Along with a card reminding them when to get the necessary second dose, vaccine recipients are handed information on how to report side effects to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an app called V-Safe.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both rely on a genetic technology that has never before yielded a vaccine that won regulatory approval. They are authorized for emergency use only.
Studies of their safety, including the cases of an Alaska health care worker and a Boston doctor who experienced severe allergic reactions after receiving their shots, are still underway.
And as Wilson crawled into bed at 10:30 on a weekday morning, she could not help but be "hyper-aware," she said, "that I had just been vaccinated with this novel vaccine."
As vaccines go, experts have agreed, the two being distributed now elicit more reactions than most.
At the Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown, West Virginia, Betty Shannon, 81, said some fellow residents had an upset stomach after becoming some of the nation's first seniors to receive a COVID vaccine.
Lorenzo Alfonso, 34, a nurse assistant in California, was unusually tired and achy.
But for infectious disease experts, a nation down for the count with post-vaccine malaise would be the best news in a long time. The side effects dissipate within a few days, and they are a signal, the experts say, that the vaccine is working.
"We call them 'side' effects, but it's really just an effect," said Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania vaccinologist who is a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel. "This is what your immune response does when it's responding to an infection."
The vaccines each work by prompting the body to make a particular protein that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells; neither exposes the recipient to the virus itself. The presence of that protein in the body sets off the production of new antibodies that can destroy the protein - the key to providing protection against a future invasion of the actual virus.
But the process releases substances that can cause inflammation, which can result in fever, fatigue, headache and other symptoms.
Many more participants in the vaccine trials registered discomfort after the second dose, given three or four weeks later, than after the first. That is probably because by that time, the body is already primed to attack the protein, experts said.

To improve your balance, take a hike

Texto completo: Several times a day, whether I'm indoors or out, my bone doctor's mantra reverberates in my head: "Do not fall!"
That might seem like telling the sun not to shine, but it does remind me that my balance is not what it used to be. I can no longer take for granted my ability to remain erect when moving about among a plethora of unexpected tripping hazards -- broken sidewalks, fallen branches, a dog on the loose. How can I keep from falling when I stumble?
Surely, I thought, there'd be helpful advice on the web. But after checking out dozens of postings on how I might improve my balance, I was more confused than enlightened. Most emphasized improving core and leg strength, which for me are already in good shape. Now what?
Then I learned of a new book with a title that echoed my bone doctor's warning: "Falling Is Not an Option: A Way to Lifelong Balance." The author, George Locker, a lifelong student of martial arts and teacher of tai chi, adapted the lessons of these ancient arts into an approach he has trademarked as "Postural Retraining."
The goal is stability by increasing one's downward force, and the examples Locker gave of surfers, skaters and skiers made perfect sense to me.
I can easily recall my stable posture when I skated on ice or pavement or skied on water or snow: a semi squat with knees and ankles bent. Although I no longer attempt these sports at age 79, my ability to remain balanced and stable is more important than ever.
As reported last year in The New York Times, between 2000 and 2016, the mortality rate from falls among those older than 75 more than doubled. Locker calls this "a medical problem without a medical solution." Rare is the doctor who prescribes postures and movements that enhance balance and stability. Yet, these are health- and life-saving abilities that can be improved regardless of a person's age by strengthening the body's postural muscles.
But unlike building up arm or leg muscles, increasing the strength of postural muscles to improve balance is not something visible. It's internal, something the body, not the mind, must learn to do, like learning how to balance on a bicycle.
"Balance," Locker wrote, "is not a skill," and it "is not attained by aptitude, memory or repetition." In an interview, he said, "Balance is not about moving, thinking about it, being athletic or strong." Nor is it subject to willful control. Rather, it is something the body learns to do automatically by engaging the postural muscles. Given the amount of sitting most of us do these days, "the postural muscles literally forget how to maintain balance, even on steady, level surfaces," he wrote.
No weights or machines are needed to strengthen postural muscles. Rather, the body's own weight is engaged, as in skating when, with bent knee and ankle, the body's weight is transferred from the back leg to the front leg, or in paddle boarding, when body weight is evenly distributed between bent legs.
As Locker, now 70, explained, "The exercises in Postural Retraining use the body's own weight to prompt the postural muscles to balance the body." The exercises are isometric; there is no movement. Rather, postural muscles are tensed and the tension is sustained as long as possible, which builds the strength of both muscles and bones.
While I'd normally be highly skeptical of such advice from a nonprofessional without a degree in physical therapy, kinesiology, rehabilitation medicine or athletic training, one paragraph in Locker's book won me over:
"Walking on an even surface is not weight-bearing," at least not as Locker defines it, because it does not train postural muscles. "The knee tends to lock when the foot contacts the ground, and the foot does not remain on the ground for more than a moment. Therefore walking, while wonderful and healthy, does not improve balance. Walking on a rocky Adirondack trail, where both legs are constantly bent to maintain balance, is weight-bearing."
I spent most of last summer in the lower Catskills, where I trekked with my dog on uneven paths over rocks and roots for an hour or more every other morning. During the first two weeks of July, I felt very unsteady and fell twice. But I became more secure with each outing, and by summer's end, my balance and stability had noticeably improved. Even when jostled by a dog while standing on a rocky surface, I easily remained stable and erect.
While many people are not in a position to train their postural muscles by hiking in the woods, Locker describes exercises that people can do safely at home using their own bodies for equipment. Basically, the feet learn to be more firmly connected to the ground while the body weight moves within a base of support.
"In tai chi," Locker noted, "we don't move to achieve balance; first we balance, then we move." Balance is not subject to conscious control, but it can be enhanced by use and diminished by disuse, he explained. "The key to balance and stability in humans is the ability to create downward force in excess of body weight. Thus, neither a statue nor a surfer standing stiff as a statue can remain upright on a surfboard."
A sample lesson: You've likely heard advice to improve balance by standing on one leg when brushing your teeth. A far better plan is to bend the knee and ankle of the leg you're standing on to engage the postural muscles. At the same time, the pelvic muscles remain relaxed.
Another simple exercise involves standing straight with thigh and buttocks muscles relaxed, then bending knees and ankles as if you're about to sit on a high stool. Keep the spine straight and pelvis relaxed. Hold this position for as long as you can, increasing the time gradually as your postural muscles get stronger, up to 15 minutes.
The ultimate goal, Locker said, is to achieve "a tremendous connection to the ground so that when you get pushed, instead of lifting up your shoulders and falling forward, your knees and ankles bend and the body naturally pushes into the ground."

Texto completo: In some ways, it makes perfect sense that the future of free speech on the internet could turn on the cases of a couple of high school cheerleaders.
Young people take it as their self-appointed duty to test boundaries, and the internet offers an abundance of boundaries to test.
In January the Supreme Court will consider whether to hear the case of one boundary-tester, a Pennsylvania cheerleader, suspended from her school's cheerleading squad for obscene gestures and F-bombs recorded and broadcast on Snapchat.
Meanwhile outside court, Jimmy Galligan, a mixed-race college freshman in Virginia, ignited a separate internet furor over his lack of remorse for releasing a 4-year-old video showing a white classmate, Mimi Groves, now 19, using the N-word -- even though the release has resulted in her withdrawing from her dream college this year.
In the video, taken as she was celebrating her new temporary driver's permit, she declares excitedly to the camera, "I can drive, (N-word)," as if she was imitating a Black rap star.
Yes, as everyone should know by now, the word that starts with an "N" and rhymes with "trigger" should never be uttered, especially by someone who is not Black -- and, just to be clear, if I had my way as a Black father, it would not be gratuitously uttered by Black people either.
Yet, like any other forbidden fruit, some people just can't resist having a taste, even if only to see if they can get away with it.
After Groves shared the three-second clip with her friends, it was spotted by Galligan, now 18, who told The New York Times in a story about racial tensions at Heritage High School in Leesburg, Virginia, "I wanted to get her where she would understand the severity of that word."
She undoubtedly got that message when the controversy stirred a backlash on the web that led to her withdrawal from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where she had joined the cheer team, which was the reigning national champion.
Now we have a backlash in conservative punditry and social networks against Galligan, the university and the political right's longtime nemesis, The New York Times, for reporting a story that allegedly takes the side of Galligan. I'm trying not to do that, even though I can easily identify with how isolated a student of color can feel in a mostly white high school, since I, too, went through it.
Forgotten in a lot of that piling on is the central issue: How much responsibility do schools have to make sure students of all colors can have their complaints heard and acted upon?
And did the university give a fair hearing to Groves' pleas that the three-second video, in which the N-word was not directed at anyone in particular, did not fairly represent who she is now?
Compared with the Virginia students, the Supreme Court's Pennsylvania case sounds almost simple. The cheerleader known in pleadings as "B.L." was punished for an image of her with raised middle fingers and text that included four F-bombs, all of it expressed in anger while shopping with friends after she failed to make the varsity cheerleading squad.
Although Snapchat's snaps are famously ephemeral, B.L.'s selfie was preserved in a screenshot by another student and wound up in the hands of school coaches, according to court filings. The school suspended the student from cheerleading for a year, saying the punishment was needed to "avoid chaos" and maintain a "teamlike environment."
Her attorneys argued and an appeals court agreed that she could not be punished for what she said outside of school grounds. Now it's the Supreme Court's turn to give the final word, if it so desires. But the underlying issues aren't going away any faster than some students might wish their ill-advised Snapchats would.
I am not too coldhearted to appreciate the momentous importance that rejection from a cheering squad, among other setbacks, can hold on a student's life. But, as we parents have had to warn our kids since the dawn of the social media age, always presume that whatever you put on the internet will stay there forever -- and, sooner or later, it might find its way directly to those whom you least want to see it.

Texto completo: Two and a half hours after being injected with a COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Taneisha Wilson was hit with the worst headache of her life.
In her home office in Cranston, Rhode Island, Wilson, 36, an emergency physician with a constitution she calls "horse-like," laid her head down on the desk. Fighting a wave of nausea, she let out an involuntary groan loud enough to be heard by her husband in a room down the hall.
"Are you OK, babe?" he called.
"It felt like I got smacked," Wilson recalled.
That is not how most people who get the vaccine feel afterward, but reactions like Wilson's were not uncommon in the clinical trial results of the two COVID vaccines now being distributed across the country.
Pfizer, the company that makes the one she received, reported that some 13% of recipients ages 18 to 55 had a bad headache after the first dose. About 16% of those who received the other vaccine, made by Moderna, in a late-stage trial had a reaction strong enough to prevent them from going about their daily routine.
As tens of millions of Americans await their turn for a shot, many are hungering for details about what to expect. So, at the request of friends, colleagues and reporters, some people like Wilson who were in the vanguard of the biggest vaccination program in U.S. history are beginning to offer their personal accounts.
The New York Times interviewed several dozen of the newly vaccinated in the days afterward. They recounted a wide spectrum of responses, from no reaction at all -- "Can't even tell I had the shot," said a hospital worker in Iowa City, Iowa -- to symptoms like uncontrolled shivering and "brain fog." A nurse assistant in Glendora, California, wondered whether the fever he ran was a side effect of the vaccine or a sign that he had been infected by one of his COVID patients.
And there was a dizzying variety of sore arms. Some likened the pain to that from a flu shot; for others, it was considerably worse.
Like nearly every vaccine recipient who spoke to The Times for this article, Wilson stressed that she had no regrets about getting the shot, despite the headache, which was gone within 36 hours. The Food and Drug Administration has found the vaccines to be safe and remarkably effective. And public health leaders say mass vaccination is the only hope for controlling the virus that is now claiming the lives of close to 3,000 Americans a day.
But in these first weeks of vaccination, there is an inescapable element of suspense.
Along with a card reminding them when to get the necessary second dose, vaccine recipients are handed information on how to report side effects to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an app called V-Safe.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both rely on a genetic technology that has never before yielded a vaccine that won regulatory approval. They are authorized for emergency use only. Studies of their safety, including the cases of an Alaska health care worker and a Boston doctor who experienced severe allergic reactions after receiving their shots, are still underway.
And as Wilson crawled into bed at 10:30 on a weekday morning, she could not help but be "hyper-aware," she said, "that I had just been vaccinated with this novel vaccine."
As vaccines go, experts have agreed, the two being distributed now elicit more reactions than most.
At the Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown, West Virginia, Betty Shannon, 81, said some fellow residents had an upset stomach after becoming some of the nation's first seniors to receive a COVID vaccine.
Lorenzo Alfonso, 34, a nurse assistant in California, was unusually tired and achy.
But for infectious disease experts, a nation down for the count with post-vaccine malaise would be the best news in a long time. The side effects dissipate within a few days, and they are a signal, the experts say, that the vaccine is working.
"We call them 'side' effects, but it's really just an effect," said Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania vaccinologist who is a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel. "This is what your immune response does when it's responding to an infection."
The vaccines each work by prompting the body to make a particular protein that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells; neither exposes the recipient to the virus itself. The presence of that protein in the body sets off the production of new antibodies that can destroy the protein -- the key to providing protection against a future invasion of the actual virus.
But the process releases substances that can cause inflammation, which can result in fever, fatigue, headache and other symptoms.
Many more participants in the vaccine trials registered discomfort after the second dose, given three or four weeks later, than after the first. That is probably because by that time, the body is already primed to attack the protein, experts said.

Rebook or cancel your trip? Would-be travelers spend hours dealing with refunds; others simply move dates

Texto completo: A 50th birthday, 50 new places: That was Allison Andrews' plan for the year.
Her roster included a dog-sledding adventure in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in March, a trip to Spain in April and May, and a Bahamas cruise with a former college roommate in June.
She got as far as Switzerland, in mid-March, before boomeranging home to Mooresville, North Carolina.
"I couldn't 'Eat, Pray, Love' this - I have a kid, I have a job and I had already planned out a lot in order to get good deals," said Andrews. "I just spent weeks just canceling stuff."
With the pandemic foiling her yearlong bonanza, Andrews has ostensibly spent more time this year disentangling herself from her trips than actually taking them. In doing so, she has earned a rightful place in a club of "cancelers" - those would-be travelers who have spent hours on hold, learning the ins and outs of refund policies.
This is a large cohort, according to multiple data sources. In a November survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers by Suzy, a market research platform, 60% of respondents said they have canceled at least one trip because of COVID-19. At Hosteeva, a vacation-rental company, around 22% of bookings were canceled from February through mid-November (up from 5% during the same period last year).
To be sure, these would-be travelers realize they are lucky to be dealing with refunds while so many Americans face job losses or grieve for family members.
Major adjustments by the operators
Travel companies have traditionally been able to predict busy and quiet periods. Not so in this year. Since March, waves of cancellations have reverberated - sometimes with little notice - because of rising infection rates, travel restrictions, and state and local rules.
"There were cancellations in the beginning - March and April were huge," said Hana Pevny, who owns the Waldo Emerson Inn, a boutique inn in Kennebunkport, Maine. "Then in May and June, people who had already made summer plans realized they couldn't execute on them. And now, with COVID cases rising again, it's like I was fully booked for Christmas one day and had to process $3,000 in cancellations the next."
From March to June, Dave Karraker had 26 cancellations between his two Airbnb properties: a country house in Sonoma, California, and an efficiency apartment at his home in San Francisco.
"First it was because Sonoma County prohibited vacation rentals," said Karraker. "As that eased up, the cancellations continued from folks not wanting to risk traveling across the country or around the world."
When state restrictions were lifted in June, the Sonoma house got a rush of new bookings, all from people within a 60-mile radius. It was rented solidly through New Year's until recently, when California announced sweeping new travel restrictions. Karraker said he expects another wave of cancellations.
The experience has given him a broader perspective on how to handle cancellations.
"No one doesn't want to go on a vacation to wine country, so if they need to adjust their reservation because of the pandemic, we completely understand," he said. "We are all in this together, so you should demonstrate compassion and caring every chance you get."
The value of rebooking
From January to October, the 11 largest U.S. airlines issued $11.75 billion in cash refunds, according to Airlines for America, a trade group. That's an 86% year-over-year increase from the $6.3 billion issued in 2019.
But plenty of travelers got vouchers and chose to rebook instead.
In March, Megan Stribling, 37, received a voucher - which she was told was a "one-time change" - from American Airlines when she canceled her May anniversary trip to St. John. A couple of months later, with numbers looking marginally better, she used the voucher to rebook the trip for November: another "one-time change," she was again told. With infection rates iffy again in October, she called back a third time and held her breath, hoping for another "one-time change" that would push the trip to May 2021.
"The new 'No Change Fees' policy had been announced, but I wasn't sure if our flight would count," said Stribling. "But it was super easy and they were very accommodating."
Wendy Patrick, 52, also had a relatively easy time bowing out of the year's planned three cruises: The cruise lines did the canceling. Most ships have been docked since March, a no-sail order by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. Although that order was lifted in October, most cruise companies are still working through their health and safety protocols and won't sail again until well into next year.
Yet for Patrick, who lives in San Diego, those canceled sailings presented not a loss, but an opportunity.
When a Princess Cruises voyage in October was canceled, Patrick rebooked using a special offer. Among its perks: Princess matched her deposit in the form of a future cruise credit, industry "currency" that can be applied toward the balance of the fare, onboard items or future sailings.
Because cruise cancellation policies are more flexible than ever, thanks to the pandemic, Patrick sees little downside in having several sailings on the horizon for next year.
"If you don't grab cabins while they are hot, you will be left out on the dock - as the ships will be full in no time," she said. "We want to go anchors-aweigh the second we can get that vaccine."
'Just pick a date sometime in the future'
Andrews, of the 50-for-50 plan, originally canceled in March through July, holding out hope that a fall trip to Greece would be doable. (It wasn't.) She canceled a large family Thanksgiving gathering in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in May. In September, she was hit with a short-lived burst of optimism.
"As the pandemic dragged on we thought, well, maybe we should look to see what's available now because everyone was getting stir-crazy," she recalled. "Then we decided: Nope, not safe."
That folder system gained a new purpose: tracking Andrews' domestic and closer-to-home travels, which she has been chronicling on Milemarker 50, her aptly named blog.
Stribling, who moved her St. John trip twice (so far), also has a good- natured outlook: "I told our Airbnb host that we didn't want a refund," she said. "We just said, 'Can we move our dates again?' And she was like, 'Yep, just pick a date sometime in the future. And let's cross our fingers.'"

Hot Seat Awaits Haaland

Texto completo: Her nomination as secretary of the interior is historic, but as the first Native cabinet member, she would have to strike a delicate balance.
Within minutes of the announcement that President-elect Joe Biden had nominated Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico as interior secretary, Native social media was celebrating. People in our community who have met Ms. Haaland began posting photos of her at Native events throughout Indian Country; one of my friends wrote, "Our auntie has done it!"
The jubilation is warranted, because Ms. Haaland, a citizen of Laguna Pueblo, one of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes, would be the first Native American to head the Department of the Interior, indeed the first Native American to serve in the cabinet at all. But there is no question that if Ms. Haaland is confirmed, her seat at the table would be a very hot seat indeed.
Native representation is good, but the community will want her to deliver on expectations. And right now, expectations are stratospheric. In the Native community, many assume that Ms. Haaland will be our warrior, righting centuries of federal wrongs against our people and our tribes, especially those inflicted by the Interior Department, which oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
But Ms. Haaland would need to calibrate a delicate balance between her populist identity as a champion of Native rights and tribal sovereignty and her new role defending the interests of the federal system. One of the first two Native women to be elected to Congress, Ms. Haaland is a remarkable trailblazer, but as anyone who has done it will affirm, breaking new trail, especially as one climbs upward, is riddled with potential mishap.
Ms. Haaland would not be the first Native American to serve in the upper echelons of a presidential administration. Charles Curtis, Herbert Hoover's running mate in 1928, was Native and even spoke fluent Kaw, which he learned at his grandmother's knee. Curtis, though, is not admired as a role model, but instead derided as a reactionary assimilationist who promoted policies that significantly harmed Natives. The Curtis Act of 1898, which he introduced as a member of the House, broke up tribal lands, weakened tribal governments and abolished tribal courts.
Nearly 100 years after Curtis's election, many of the tensions between the federal government and our tribal communities that existed then still persist. While 1970s-style occupations have largely disappeared, many Natives view them as necessary acts of civil disobedience necessary to oppose longstanding, obsolete and abusive policies governing the relationship between tribes and the Department of the Interior, particularly in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
These days we are more likely to see Native lawyers filing lawsuits in federal courts than Natives occupying federal property, yet the fundamental conflicts are the same.
The battle over the right of Native tribes to hunt bison in wildlife access corridors adjacent to Yellowstone National Park is one example. Some non-Native wildlife conservationists and park preservationists oppose the hunting while the tribes argue that it is necessary to preserve cultural practices and provide food to tribal members. How Ms. Haaland will reconcile her Native-centered beliefs and actions with the mandates and duties of her new position leading a department that oversees the National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management will be closely watched.
Native opinion is not monolithic on any issue, but the community largely remains resistant to colonization, assimilation norms and centrist compromises. If she deviates too much from our community's heroic perception of her, some may brand her as a "Hangs-Around-the-Fort Indian," another Curtis-style assimilationist, a sellout.
But the Native community must also have realistic expectations. We must grant Ms. Haaland wide latitude as she navigates the land mines she would face in her new role. She is sure to occasionally falter -- and when she does our community will hold her accountable, that's a certainty. However, the Native community must exercise patience, especially as she finds her footing in the early days, and I think we will. We all very much want her to succeed.
But as time passes, if Ms. Haaland consistently makes major steps that sacrifice Native concerns and tribal sovereignty for the goals of the administration and the Department of the Interior's mandates, the criticism from our community will be swift and sure. The legacy of Charles Curtis should be a cautionary tale. At most, Ms. Haaland will serve eight years under a Biden administration, but she will be Native her whole life.

Texto completo: Readers respond to an editorial urging changes to the current system.
To the Editor:
The suggestions for pardon reform in "How to Repair the Pardon Process" (editorial, Dec. 24) don't mention the most important change to the pardon power absent a constitutional amendment: The Supreme Court should rule that the president lacks the power to pardon a person not convicted.
That change alone would go far to reduce pardon abuses. Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter's pardon of the Vietnam draft evaders, Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich, and any pardons President Trump might issue to members of his administration or his family for any as yet uncharged crimes -- all should be void.
A pardon is a remedy granted only after a person has been convicted. That limitation on pardons is logical -- people cannot be forgiven for crimes they have not been convicted of.
Michael J. Broyde
Atlanta
The writer is a professor at Emory University School of Law.
To the Editor:
When listing the limits to the "vast" presidential pardon power, you write, "Some constitutional scholars say" that presidents "may not pardon themselves."
This view is held not only by some constitutional scholars. Nearly 50 years ago, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel had occasion to examine the extent of the pardon power. In its memorandum opinion it concluded, "Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the president cannot pardon himself."
The opinion is dated Aug. 5, 1974. Four days later, the president of the United States resigned his office.
Will President Trump try to do what even Richard Nixon did not dare to attempt?
William A. Shapiro
Albany, N.Y.
The writer is a lawyer.
To the Editor:
I agree that the time is right to press for changes. What I found disappointing was referencing Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon as an example of a president "exploiting mercy for dubious reasons."
It was an unpopular decision at the time, one that Ford made at the beginning of his (unexpected) presidency. He knew he would be facing the voters in 1976, yet he made this very courageous move, explaining later, in his autobiography, that he wasn't motivated by sympathy for Nixon, but that it was the "country's health at home and around the world" that worried him.
Senator Edward Kennedy recognized this in his remarks when Ford was presented with the Profile in Courage Award in 2001. "I was one who spoke out against his action then. But time has a way of clarifying past events, and now we see that President Ford was right. His courage and dedication to our country made it possible for us to begin the process of healing."
Ford's courageous decision does not deserve to be included when discussing this current president.
Burton Dicht
Somerset, N.J.
To the Editor:
Donald Trump's abuse of the pardon power is indeed over the top. It's a travesty of justice.
We should amend our Constitution to remove the power entirely from the president and the executive branch -- the branch that is supposed to enforce our laws, not blow them away.
If we must have a pardon power, place it in Congress, with pardons subject to a vote of approval by at least two-thirds of each house, a system more appropriate to a democracy.
Jane Langseth
Colts Neck, N.J.
To the Editor:
There is no need to agonize over the pardons recently bestowed on members of the exiting president's inner circle. While a pardon clearly has benefits to the recipients, the past actions of Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, among others, remain public knowledge and will follow them to their respective graves. The stain is indelible, neither diluted nor erased by a pardon from someone who shares their misguided values.

Texto completo: The year's best, worst and weirdest political players.
This year was a soul-crushing hellscape of a dumpster fire. For sanity's sake, large chunks of it should be repressed as soon as possible.
The rolling crises did, however, have a clarifying effect on the political scene. Some players rose to meet the moment. Others sank, and there was no bottom. This sorting should be remembered, especially as many of these public eminences begin scurrying to rehabilitate their brands. Their 2020 achievements, such as they were, should be memorialized with superlatives that capture who they revealed themselves to be. Think high school yearbook distinctions, only with real-world implications.
Don't look for President Trump on this list. In a class by himself, he was deemed ineligible for consideration. The competition would have been grossly unfair with such a dominant force. As for the rest of the swamp ...
Most Committed Bootlicker
Senator Lindsey Graham
This was a hotly contested category, but at the end of the day, no one could outdo the South Carolina Republican.
Most Inauthentic
Senator Kelly Loeffler
Talk about a total makeover: The Georgia Republican, appointed to her seat last December, morphed from posh, moderate, mainstream suburban-mom bait to bomb-throwing, ball-cap-wearing, right-wing culture warrior faster than you can say "political opportunism."
Class Clown
Rudy Giuliani
The early Trump years had already shifted Rudy's identity from America's Mayor to the president's unhinged apparatchik. But 2020 was when he totally lost the thread, devolving into numerous cautionary tales and internet memes. There was his runny hair dye. (Or was it mascara?) The time he "tucked in his shirt" for Borat's daughter. The Four Seasons Total Landscaping news conference held near a porn shop and a crematory. The fart. (Go on. Google it.) 2021 can't come soon enough.
Dreamiest
Dr. Anthony Fauci
Back in January, who could have predicted that one of the year's biggest heartthrobs would be an 80-year-old government immunologist?
Angstiest
Senator Susan Collins
Whatever the occasion, the Maine Republican can be counted on to express her deep yet meaningless concern.
Cutest Couple
Nancy Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin
The House speaker and the Treasury secretary spent so much time and energy hammering out Covid relief deals. Most marriages don't require that much work.
Most Disappointing
Representative Elise Stefanik
Since her 2014 election, the New York Republican had pitched herself as the sane, moderate future of her party, with a special focus on improving its reputation with women. So it's been particularly galling to watch her carry water for the most antidemocratic, misogynistic president in memory.
Most Disappointed
Senator Elizabeth Warren
After so much promise and so many plans, the Massachusetts Democrat didn't win even the progressive wing of her party, which went for Uncle Bernie.
Largest Invertebrate
Basically the entire Senate Republican conference
Most Likely to Sell His Soul for More Power
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell
Kidding, of course. He made that transaction ages ago.
Biggest Tease
John Bolton, former national security adviser
All that bragging about insider secrets just to hawk a book. He should have testified in the House's impeachment inquiry.
Most Likely to Succeed
Pete Buttigieg
If anyone can make Infrastructure Week really happen, it will be President-elect Joe Biden's overachieving, wonk-chic pick to head the Transportation Department.
Most Likely to Stage a Failed Coup Attempt
Representative Louie Gohmert
Suing Vice President Mike Pence in a convoluted, last-ditch effort to overturn the election results and keep Mr. Trump in office? That's some next-level sycophancy.
Best Napper
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross
Most Likely to End Up on 'Dancing With the Stars'
Kimberly Guilfoyle
Warning: Might not be suitable for children.
Most Clutch Player
Representative Jim Clyburn
It is barely an exaggeration to say that Mr. Biden owes his presidency to the well-timed endorsement from the dean of South Carolina Democratic politics.
Most Likely to Be the Next 'Tiger King'
Representative Matt Gaetz
With or without his gas mask, the Trump wannabe is the ultimate Florida Man.
Most Persistent
Joe Biden
It took a once-in-a-century pandemic and the most appalling incumbent in history, but he finally won the office he'd been eyeing for more than three decades.
Most Obviously Auditioning to Be a Fox News Host
A tossup.
Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, has the edge when it comes to execution, but Jenna Ellis, one of the president's lawyers, gets points for trying so hard.
Most Likely to Be a Character on 'Succession'
Steven Mnuchin
This hopefully will not conflict with his true calling as the next Bond villain.
Most Corrupt
A 20-to-30-way tie
With this administration, the category was impossible to whittle down.
Best Team Player
Senator Bernie Sanders
The Vermont lefty may be shouty and crabby, but he recognized that unifying Democratic voters swiftly and with minimal squabbling was key to saving the nation from a second Trump term.
Most Degraded
Mike Pence
It was bad enough when he was on track to be remembered for his dead-on imitation of flypaper. But now, after four years of thankless obsequiousness, he's being dragged into Trumpworld's crackpot crusade to overturn the election results. The Constitution tasks the vice president with presiding over Congress's counting of the Electoral College votes. MAGA types are pressuring him to hand Mr. Trump the win. The V.P. is looking at a rough January.
Biggest Threat to American Democracy
Attorney General Bill Barr
This is what happens when the nation's top law enforcement official puts his boss's individual interests above the rule of law.
In for the Rudest Awakening
Javanka
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have had loads of fun playing at government and diplomacy while shielded from any real accountability. Post-presidency, their lives will likely get more complicated -- socially, politically and perhaps even legally.

Texto completo: The claim: Vladimir Putin made an anti-Muslim speech in 2013
Recently, a post on Facebook from 2013 about Russian President Vladimir Putin has had a resurgence in popularity.
The post claims to contain the text of a speech that Putin made on Aug. 4, 2013, to the Russian parliament. The purported speech centers on Muslims and their place in Russia.
The post also claims that Putin received a "five minute standing ovation" after he finished the speech.
The author of the post has not responded to a request from USA TODAY for comment.
Fact check: Quote about democracy misattributed to Thomas Jefferson
The fake speech has circulated on the internet since 2013
The speech appears to have been fabricated. There is no record that Putin has ever made such remarks about minorities or Muslims.
The fake speech has circulated on the internet in multiple forms since 2013. It was previously debunked by Snopes and PolitiFact.
Some versions contain different dates, another indicator the information is false.
In 2014, for example, a chain email claimed the speech was made on Feb. 4, 2013, rather than Aug. 4, 2013.
Both dates are inaccurate — an official website with transcripts of all remarks by Putin contains no speeches on either date.
The most similar comments that Putin has made to the fabricated speech were at a meeting of the Board of the Federal Migration Service in January 2012.
Among other topics, he spoke about the issue of the "adaptation of guest workers," per an official transcript.
"We must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society, learn Russian and, of course, respect our culture and traditions and abide by Russian law," Putin said. "In this regard, I believe that the decision to make learning the Russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded."
"This should be mandatory for all guest workers regardless of their future employment," he added.
Fact check: 'Greatest danger to American freedom' quote misattributed to Thomas Jefferson
Islam is the second largest religion in Russia
Islam is the second largest religion in Russia after Orthodox Christianity. The Muslim population is around 20 million, per the Moscow Times.
Islam is also recognized as one of four "traditional" religions in Russia, according to a report from the U.S. State Department.
Though the nation's constitution protects religious freedom, authorities are permitted to punish individuals for acts of alleged religious extremism. In 2019, the majority of individuals imprisoned for their religious beliefs were Muslim, per the report.
Putin himself has spoken positively about Islam, according to the Moscow Times.
"Islam and Orthodox Christianity, just like other world religions, are based on fundamental humanistic values that are of enduring importance — on mercy and love for one’s near, justice and respect for human beings," he said in 2019.
In 2016, while responding to a question about the Islamic State, he also said “I would prefer Islam not be mentioned in vain alongside terrorism,” per the New York Times.
Fact check: Thomas Jefferson quote on free press, 'words of a tyrant,' is fake

A racial slur, a viral video, and a reckoning

Texto completo: LEESBURG, Va. - Jimmy Galligan was in history class last school year when his phone buzzed with a message. Once he clicked on it, he found a three-second video of a white classmate looking into the camera and uttering an anti-Black racial slur.
The slur, he said, was regularly hurled in classrooms and hallways throughout his years in the Loudoun County school district. He had brought the issue up to teachers and administrators, but, much to his anger and frustration, his complaints had gone nowhere.
So he held on to the video, which was sent to him by a friend, and made a decision that would ricochet across Leesburg, Virginia, a town named for an ancestor of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and whose school system had fought an order to desegregate for more than a decade after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling.
"I wanted to get her where she would understand the severity of that word," Galligan, 18, whose mother is Black and father is white, said of the classmate who uttered the slur, Mimi Groves. He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right.
Groves had originally sent the video, in which she looked into the camera and said, "I can drive," followed by the slur, to a friend on Snapchat in 2016, when she was a freshman and had just gotten her learner's permit. It later circulated among some students at Heritage High School, which she and Galligan attended, but did not cause much of a stir.
Galligan had not seen the video before receiving it last school year, when he and Groves were seniors. By then, she was a varsity cheer captain who dreamed of attending the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, whose cheer team was the reigning national champion. When she made the team in May, her parents celebrated with a cake and orange balloons, the university's official color.
The next month, as protests were sweeping the nation after the police killing of George Floyd, Groves, in a public Instagram post, urged people to "protest, donate, sign a petition, rally, do something" in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
"You have the audacity to post this, after saying the N-word," responded someone whom Groves said she did not know.
Her alarm at the stranger's comment turned to panic as friends began calling, directing her to the source of a brewing social media furor. Galligan, who had waited until Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon. Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer.
By that June evening, about a week after Floyd's killing, teenagers across the country had begun leveraging social media to call out their peers for racist behavior. Some students set up anonymous pages on Instagram devoted to holding classmates accountable, including in Loudoun County.
The consequences were swift. Over the next two days, Groves was removed from the university's cheer team. She then withdrew from the school under pressure from admissions officials, who told her they had received hundreds of emails and phone calls from outraged alumni, students and the public.
"They're angry, and they want to see some action," an admissions official told Groves and her family, according to a recording of the emotional call reviewed by The New York Times.
Groves was among many incoming freshmen across the country whose admissions offers were revoked by at least a dozen universities after videos emerged on social media of them using racist language.
In one sense, the public shaming of Groves underscores the power of social media to hold people of all ages accountable, with consequences at times including harassment and both online and real-world "cancellation."
But the story behind the backlash also reveals a more complex portrait of behavior that for generations had gone unchecked in schools in one of the nation's wealthiest counties, where Black students said they had long been subjected to ridicule. "Go pick cotton," some said they were told in class by white students.
Hostile environment
Leesburg, the county seat of Loudoun County, lies just across the Potomac River from Maryland, about an hour's drive from Washington. It was the site of an early Civil War battle, and slave auctions were once held on the courthouse grounds, where a statue of a Confederate soldier stood for more than a century until it was removed in July.
The Loudoun County suburbs are among the wealthiest in the nation, and the schools consistently rank among the top in the state. Last fall, according to the Virginia Department of Education, the student body at Heritage High was about half white, 20% Hispanic, 14% Asian American and 8% Black, with another 6% of mixed race.
In interviews, current and former students of color described an environment rife with racial insensitivity, including casual uses of slurs.
A report commissioned last year by the school district documented a pattern of school leaders ignoring the widespread use of racial slurs by students and teachers, fostering a "growing sense of despair" among students of color, some of whom faced disproportionate disciplinary measures compared with white students.
"It is shocking the extent to which students report the use of the N-word as the prevailing concern," the report said. School system employees also had a low level of racial consciousness and racial literacy," while a lack of repercussions for hurtful language forced students into a "hostile learning environment," it said.
In the wake of the report's publication, the district in August released a plan to combat systemic racism. The move was followed by a formal apology in September for the district's history of segregation.
Heritage High School officials did not respond to interview requests.
Relentless backlash
Groves said the video began as a private Snapchat message to a friend. "At the time, I didn't understand the severity of the word or the history and context behind it because I was so young," she said in a recent interview, adding that the slur was in all the songs we listened to, and I'm not using that as an excuse."
Groves, who just turned 19, lives with her parents and two siblings in River Creek, a predominantly white and affluent gated community built around a golf course. On a recent day, she sat outside on the deck with her mother, Marsha Groves, who described how the entire family had struggled with the consequences of the very public shaming.
Once the video went viral, the backlash was swift and relentless. A photograph of Groves, captioned with a racial slur, also began circulating online, but she and her parents say someone else wrote it to further tarnish her reputation. On social media, people tagged the University of Tennessee and its cheer team, demanding her admission be rescinded. Some threatened her with physical violence if she came to the university campus. The next day, local media outlets in Virginia and Tennessee published articles about the uproar.
The day after the video went viral, Groves tried to defend herself in tense calls with the university. But the athletics department swiftly removed Groves from the cheer team. And then came the call in which admissions officials began trying to persuade her to withdraw, saying they feared she would not feel comfortable on campus.
The university declined to comment about Groves beyond a statement it issued on Twitter in June, in which officials said they took seriously complaints about racist behavior.
Groves' parents, who said their daughter was being targeted by a social media "mob" for a mistake she made as an adolescent, urged university officials to assess her character by speaking with her high school and cheer coaches. Instead, admissions officials gave her an ultimatum: withdraw or the university would rescind her offer of admission.
"We just needed it to stop, so we withdrew her," said her mother said, adding that the entire experience had "vaporized" 12 years of her daughter's hard work. "They rushed to judgment, and unfortunately it's going to affect her for the rest of her life."
Since the racial reckoning of the summer, many white teenagers, when posting dance videos to social media, no longer sing along with the slur in rap songs. Instead, they raise a finger to pursed lips. "Small things like that really do make a difference," Galligan said.

Texto completo: Well, here we are: The end of this most unusual, painful and newsy year.
It’s a time for reflection, so we wanted to look back at those only-in-Utah stories — the pieces that went viral or that speak to the essence of this state. Good, bad, hilarious, and tragic: Let’s look back at some of the “most Utah” stories of 2020.

Utah governor stops distribution of risqué state-themed condoms, created to raise awareness of HIV — by Erin Alberty
Way back in January, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered state health officials to stop distributing condoms with suggestive Utah-themed packaging because he didn’t approve of the use of sexual innuendo in the taxpayer-funded campaign. The wrappers riffed on various Utah memes, with labels such as “Greatest Sex on Earth,” “SL,UT,” and “This is the Place” over a drawing of a bed. [Read the full story here.]

Sen. Mitt Romney downs BYU chocolate milk as impeachment trial drags on — by Thomas Burr
Romney — who continues to make this annual list because of his eating habits — went viral in January. For background: Senators were only allowed to drink either water or milk during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Romney, being the rebel he is, spiced things up a bit by bringing his own Utah-made chocolate milk to sip on. [Read the full story here.]

Uintah County becomes a ‘sanctuary county’ — for guns — by Taylor Stevens
Utah is a big Second Amendment state. One county, in particular, is so fond of the right to bear arms that its commission voted unanimously to become a “sanctuary county” for firearms. That means that Uintah County’s government won’t recognize or enforce some federal or state regulations that restrict a person’s ability to own a gun. Members of Uintah County’s three-member commission said it’s a precautionary measure — in case the tides in red Utah turn blue or a future president or Congress enacts gun control measures they perceive as violating the Constitution.

Earthquake anxiety? Utah Emergency Management says calm down and take action — by Scott D. Pierce
On top of early pandemic panic, Utahns were forced to deal with another kind of anxiety. The Utah Division of Emergency Management took to social media in March to reassure people rattled by the magnitude 5.7 earthquake — and all the aftershocks. The office offered a series of facts intending to soothe locals, including the almost reassuring fact that “most buildings” and “99.9%” of Utahns would survive a magnitude 7 earthquake — Utah’s “worst case scenario.” [Read the full story here.]

Utah health officials issue stern rebuke after hundreds greet LDS missionaries at airport in defiance of coronavirus warnings — by Erin Alberty
If you’ve ever flown into the Salt Lake City International Airport, you’ve likely seen the excited group of people waving flags and “Welcome home!” signs for their returned LDS missionaries. This past March, however, airport officials told families that only two people could greet each missionary that was flying home because of the coronavirus, and they had to wait at their cars. That didn’t happen. Instead, hundreds of people gathered with balloons and signs in the short-term parking garage, heedless of health officials’ pleas to avoid crowds larger than 10.

Feds warn boaters, swimmers to stay out of potash canals on Bonneville Salt Flats — by Brian Maffly
Utah is known for its world-class outdoor recreation, but officials had to step in when locals and out-of-town visitors flocked to the Bonneville Salt Flats in June. Thrill-seekers were playing in canals and ponds used by Intrepid Potash to extract valuable minerals, prompting warnings from the Bureau of Land Management and various state agencies to keep out — even though the land is largely public. And the canals were objectively beautiful. [Read the full story here.]

In separate rallies, Utahns protest mask mandate and demand in-person classes — by Courtney Tanner
Way back in July, a group of angry Utahns packed into the Utah County Commission’s small boardroom to express frustration with online schooling and mask mandates. They wore “Trump 2020” hats and carried little American flags, and every time someone said “freedom” or “constitutional rights” the whole room cheered. Almost no one wore a mask; those who did had them pulled under their chins. [Read the full story here.]

Utah ranked worst state for women’s equality three years in a row — by Becky Jacobs
In August, Utah was named the worst state for women’s equality — again. It was the third year in a row the state earned the title. To make matters worse, Utah continues to lag far behind the state ranked 49th — Idaho. “It’s not shocking” to see Utah in last place, again, said Susan Madsen, founder and director of the Utah Women and Leadership Project at Utah State University, “but it’s a bit disappointing.” [Read the full story here.]

How I sent a tweet that unintentionally raised $50,000 for charity — by Andy Larsen
Utah’s known as one of the most charitable states. Those who live here proved it in November when Tribune reporter Andy Larsen posted a tweet asking for suggestions on where to donate the nearly $166 in change his mom found in his childhood coin jar. So many people responded with offers to add their own donations that, by the next day, he had nearly $50,000 to donate. And thus the Exclamation Point Aid Brigade was born.

It might be gone, but the monolith highlighted Utah’s role as a world-class venue for land art — by Brian Maffly
The mysterious monolith was the gift that kept giving in 2020. In late November, biologists doing a bighorn sheep survey for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources spotted the shining structure from a helicopter. They posted photos and hordes of people immediately flocked to the remote alcove in San Juan County to take pictures. Within a few days, however, four men from Moab removed the monolith and presented it to BLM officials. While short-lived, it joins the ranks of other famous works of land art in Utah — like The Spiral Jetty and The Sun Tunnels. [Read the full story here.]

Paris Hilton traveled to Utah this year to raise awareness about a topic unique to the state: its so-called “troubled teen industry.” Child and disability advocates are currently investigating what they see as inadequate oversight and Utah’s history of lax regulation that has helped fuel the state’s residential treatment centers.

Paul Krugman: 2020 was the year that Reaganism finally died

Texto completo: Maybe it was the visuals that did it. It’s hard to know what aspects of reality make it into Donald Trump’s ever-shrinking bubble — and I’m happy to say that after Jan. 20 we won’t have to care about what goes on in his not-at-all beautiful mind — but it’s possible that he became aware of how he looked, playing golf as millions of desperate families lost their unemployment benefits.
Whatever the reason, on Sunday he finally signed an economic relief bill that will, among other things, extend those benefits for a few months. And it wasn’t just the unemployed who breathed a sigh of relief. Stock market futures — which are not a measure of economic success, but still — rose. Goldman Sachs marked up its forecast of economic growth in 2021.
So this year is closing out with a second demonstration of the lesson we should have learned in the spring: In times of crisis, government aid to people in distress is a good thing, not just for those getting help, but for the nation as a whole. Or to put it a bit differently, 2020 was the year Reaganism died.
What I mean by Reaganism goes beyond voodoo economics, the claim that tax cuts have magical power and can solve all problems. After all, nobody believes in that claim aside from a handful of charlatans and cranks, plus the entire Republican Party.
No, I mean something broader — the belief that aid to those in need always backfires, that the only way to improve ordinary people’s lives is to make the rich richer and wait for the benefits to trickle down. This belief was encapsulated in Ronald Reagan’s famous dictum that the most terrifying words in English are “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.”
Well, in 2020 the government was there to help — and help it did.
True, there were some people who advocated trickle-down policies even in the face of a pandemic. Trump repeatedly pushed for payroll tax cuts, which by definition would do nothing to directly help the jobless, even attempting (unsuccessfully) to slash tax collections through executive action.
Oh, and the new recovery package does include a multibillion-dollar tax break for business meals, as if three-martini lunches were the answer to a pandemic depression.
Reagan-style hostility to helping people in need also persisted. There were some politicians and economists who kept insisting, in the teeth of the evidence, that aid to unemployed workers was actually causing unemployment, by making workers unwilling to accept job offers.
Overall, however — and somewhat shockingly — U.S. economic policy actually responded fairly well to the real needs of a nation forced into lockdown by a deadly virus. Aid to the unemployed and business loans that were forgiven if they were used to maintain payrolls limited the suffering. Direct checks sent to most adults weren’t the best targeted policy ever, but they boosted personal incomes.
All this big-government intervention worked. Despite a lockdown that temporarily eliminated 22 million jobs, poverty actually fell while the assistance lasted.
And there was no visible downside. As I’ve already suggested, there was no indication that helping the unemployed deterred workers from taking jobs when they became available. Most notably, the employment surge from April to July, in which 9 million Americans went back to work, took place while enhanced benefits were still in effect.
Nor did huge government borrowing have the dire consequences deficit scolds always predict. Interest rates stayed low, while inflation remained quiescent.
So the government was there to help, and it really did. The only problem was that it cut off help too soon. Extraordinary aid should have continued as long as the coronavirus was still rampant — a fact implicitly acknowledged by bipartisan willingness to enact a second rescue package, and Trump’s grudging eventual willingness to sign that legislation.
Indeed, some of the aid we provided in 2020 should continue even after we have widespread vaccination. What we should have learned last spring is that adequately funded government programs can greatly reduce poverty. Why forget that lesson as soon as the pandemic is over?
Now, when I say that Reaganism died in 2020 I don’t mean that the usual suspects will stop making the usual arguments. Voodoo economics is too deeply embedded in the modern GOP — and too useful to billionaire donors seeking tax cuts — to be banished by inconvenient facts.
Opposition to helping the unemployed and the poor was never evidence-based; it was always rooted in a mix of elitism and racial hostility. So we’ll still keep hearing about the miraculous power of tax cuts and the evils of the welfare state.
But while Reaganism will still be out there, it will now, even more than before, be zombie Reaganism — a doctrine that should have been killed by its encounter with reality, even if it’s still shambling along, eating politicians’ brains.
For the lesson of 2020 is that in a crisis, and to some extent even in calmer times, the government can do a lot to improve people’s lives. And what we should fear most is a government that refuses to do its job.

Texto completo: Other than getting Joe Biden elected, there's nothing the national media worked harder on this year than finding random white people to call racist. The most famous example being the St. Louis couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey.
But if there are any heroes of 2020, it's them.
The McCloskeys are, right now, in a legal battle after they were ridiculously charged this summer with unlawful use of a weapon. The two had stood on their own property, armed with guns, to ward off a mob of Black Lives Matter protesters who had broken into their gated community.
To understand how frivolous and obviously political the charges against the McCloskeys are, consider that the circuit attorney who brought them, Democrat Kim Gardner, has since been removed from the case by a judge after Gardner was caught using them in fundraising emails for her reelection campaign. In other words, Gardner was using her coming fight with the McCloskeys — she hadn't even brought the charges yet — to help fund her race.
What exactly are the McCloskeys guilty of — declining to lay down and tell the Black Lives Matter people, "Come take us"? The incident took place in June when violent riots were breaking out all over the country, the "defund the police" movement was gaining steam, and elected leaders were literally telling police to stop arresting looters and vandals.
The McCloskeys sensed a threat when they saw the mob coming their direction, as anyone would. The message was made clear this year: When the mob comes for you, you might very well be on your own.
When loud peaceful protests were taking place outside of Democratic Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot's home, she installed a 24-hour police presence nearby, citing the need after receiving death threats. Those police display guns to protect Lightfoot. The McCloskeys displayed guns to protect themselves.
Despite the media calling the McCloskeys racist, which usually works in shutting innocent people up, the couple has fought back. They spoke at the Republican National Convention in support of President Trump, delivering the best speech of the entire event.
"What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you," said Patricia. Her husband nailed it when he said that the riots were not about "racial justice" at all. "They want to walk the halls of Congress," he said. "They want to take over. They want power. This is Joe Biden’s party."
It was the truest thing said all year.
Reporting, as it relates to the McCloskeys, has been predictably stupid. Here's from a New York Times report in October: "The couple’s confrontation with protesters came as Mr. Trump, playing on racist fears, baselessly warned that the unrest in American cities following the police killing of George Floyd would spread to the suburbs."
And here's from a report in that same paper just one month prior: "The marches in Portland are increasingly moving to residential and largely white neighborhoods, where demonstrators with bullhorns shout for people to come 'out of your house and into the street' and demonstrate their support. ... These more aggressive protests target ordinary people going about their lives, especially those who decline to demonstrate allegiance to the cause."
The New York Times itself had reported on "aggressive protests" that "target ordinary people going about their lives." But the paper, along with the rest of the national media, hated the McCloskeys, so the New York Times thereafter mocked the idea that such protests "would spread to the suburbs."
Through it all, the McCloskeys are still fighting. They're the most honorable people of 2020.

Authorities executed a search warrant Friday evening, July 10, 2020, at the St. Louis mansion owned by the McCloskey's, a white couple whose armed defense of their home during a racial injustice protest last month made national headlines. said. Joel Schwartz, who is now representing the couple, confirmed on Saturday that a search warrant was served, and that the gun Mark McCloskey was seen holding during last month's protest was seized.

Universities can't be trusted to shape the future of the country

Texto completo: American universities pride themselves on being the gateway to professional opportunities, as evidenced by just how much they are charging for tuition. But these institutions and the spineless individuals in charge of them should not be trusted with shaping the future of our country.
This is one of the many takeaways from the New York Times report on the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, forcing a newly enrolled student off of the cheerleading squad and pressuring her to withdraw her application. This came after a former classmate decided to teach her a lesson, posting a three-second video that included her using the N-word as a freshman.
There are plenty of villains here, from the 18-year-old vengeance poster to the New York Times treating it as a glowing act of racial justice. But the University of Tennessee proudly declares that its mission is to “move forward the frontiers of human knowledge and enrich and elevate the citizens of the state of Tennessee, the nation, and the world.” The university’s commitment is so strong that it is willing to condemn a prospective student over a three-second video from when she was 15.
If the University of Tennessee folding in the face of a social media mob sounds familiar, that’s because it isn't the first university to do so this year. The New York Times previously reported on the “national accounting” of universities doing the same this past summer. From Cornell to Xavier to Clemson, universities that pride themselves on molding the future of the country through their credentialing have bowed to Twitter mobs and online petitions to run students from their respective campuses.
Many of the ways our universities run are ridiculous, from unnecessary general education classes to the ever-increasing cost. But all of these stem from the outsized importance our society has given to going to college, fueled by the insistence of employers that prospective job applicants hold a bachelor’s degree.
Universities have shown that they can’t reliably rein in the “cancel culture” excesses of students. Many, like the University of Tennessee, are now endorsing it, forcing out students for things they did when they were 15 no matter how contrite they are.
As Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said, “We need to stop forcing kids into believing a traditional four-year degree is the only pathway to success.” This is not just because there are clearly other pathways, such as apprenticeships, but because universities have shown that they can’t be trusted to shape the future, no matter how highly they hold themselves.

Texto completo: The claim: New York Post published a cover and staff editorial urging President Donald Trump to accept defeat
On Oct. 26, the New York Post endorsed President Donald Trump's bid for reelection.
The cover of the tabloid that announced the choice was emblazoned with a photo of Trump and the words, "Make America great again, again."
On Dec. 28, another cover of the New York Post dedicated to Trump appeared online, posted to Instagram by accounts like PoliAlert and Breaking 911. This cover, though, had a very different message: "Mr. President... STOP THE INSANITY. You have lost the election — here's how to save your legacy."
PoliAlert and Breaking 911 have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.
Fact check: No, Joe Biden's brother-in-law does not own Dominion Voting Systems
Both the cover and editorial are real
Both the cover and staff editorial that are critical of Trump are real, published by the New York Post on Dec. 27.
The tabloid, owned by Rupert Murdoch, published the front page online along with a copy of the editorial, which ran under the headline, "The Post says: Give it up, Mr. President — for your sake and the nation’s."
The scathing editorial instructed Trump to "end this dark charade" and accused him of "cheering for an undemocratic coup" by encouraging Republicans to reject the results of the presidential contest.
"You had every right to investigate the election. But let’s be clear: Those efforts have found nothing," the editorial read.
It also took aim at his allies, including lawyer Sidney Powell, whom it called "a crazy person," and Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general – who it said committed acts "tantamount to treason" by suggesting Trump should institute martial law rather than accept the electoral results and leave office peacefully.
Instead of disputing his loss, the editorial encouraged Trump to focus on the upcoming runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will decide control of the Senate.
"Securing the Senate means securing your legacy. You should use your considerable charm and influence to support the Georgia candidates, mobilizing your voters for them," the editorial read. "Focus on their success, not your own grievances, as we head into the final week."
Fact check: Rev. Warnock sermon on 'whiteness' condemns racism, does not call for anti-white bigotry
The editorial concluded with the following warning for Trump, a quote that PoliAlert also included in its post on Instagram:
"If you insist on spending your final days in office threatening to burn it all down, that will be how you are remembered. Not as a revolutionary, but as the anarchist holding the match."
The New York Post has long bolstered Trump — both while he became a celebrity in New York City and early in the primaries in 2016, per the New York Times.
Still, its tone has shifted since it became clear that President-elect Joe Biden had clinched a victory. For example, on Nov. 7, the New York Post issued a staff editorial that instructed Trump to "stop the ‘stolen election’ rhetoric."
"Where Trump won several key states by razor-thin margins to take the White House in 2016, Biden seems to have done the same this year. It undermines faith in democracy, and faith in the nation, to push baseless conspiracies. Get Rudy Giuliani off TV. Ask for the recounts you are entitled to, wish Biden well, and look to the future," it read. "If Trump persists in wild talk to the contrary, he’ll lead his people into irrelevance and marginalize his own voice."
Fact check: Meme is missing context, potentially misleads on support for Biden, Trump and Obama
Our rating: True
Based on our research, the claim that the New York Post published a cover and staff editorial urging President Trump to accept defeat is TRUE. The items were published in print and online on Dec. 27.

2 Cleveland Police Officers Avoid Federal Charges in Killing of Tamir Rice

Two Cleveland police officers will avoid federal criminal charges for their role in the killing of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Black boy who had been carrying a pellet gun when he was shot in 2014, the Justice Department announced Tuesday, citing a lack of evidence in the high-profile case.
The announcement drew to a close a five-year federal investigation into the actions of then-Officer Timothy Loehmann and his partner, Officer Frank Garmback, one that has been criticized by Tamir’s family and government watchdogs as deeply flawed and politically influenced.
Tamir’s killing became a catalyst for the national reckoning over police brutality and racial injustice, but the federal inquiry languished under both the Obama and Trump administrations. In 2019, two career prosecutors in the Justice Department’s civil rights division were denied permission to use a grand jury to issue subpoenas for documents or witness testimony.
Justice Department officials said in a lengthy statement Tuesday that they could not establish that the officers involved in Tamir’s killing willfully violated his civil rights or that they knowingly made false statements with the intent of obstructing a federal investigation.
“This high legal standard — one of the highest standards of intent imposed by law — requires proof that the officer acted with the specific intent to do something the law forbids,” the Justice Department said. “It is not enough to show that the officer made a mistake, acted negligently, acted by accident or mistake, or even exercised bad judgment.”
The outcome of the protracted examination of the case angered the Rice family, which sued Cleveland over Tamir’s death. The city settled the case for $6 million in 2016, and Loehmann was later fired for an unrelated violation.
“It was blatantly disrespectful that I had to learn from the media that the Department of Justice had shut down the investigation, after career prosecutors recommended a grand jury be convened,” Tamir’s mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement Tuesday.
On Nov. 22, 2014, Tamir was playing with a replica of a Colt pistol, striking poses with the lifelike airsoft-style gun, which fired plastic pellets, in a local park when the officers responded to a 911 call reporting a person with a gun. What the city’s multilayered 911 system failed to relay was that the caller said that the gun was “probably fake” and that the person wielding it was “probably a juvenile.”
Loehmann, a rookie officer, shot Tamir in the abdomen from point-blank range within two seconds of the arrival of his patrol car.
In late October, The New York Times reported that the Justice Department had quietly quashed its inquiry into Tamir’s killing.
The Justice Department said Tuesday that it had analyzed a surveillance video from a nearby recreation center, but that the footage was grainy and did not shed light on what happened in the seconds before Tamir was killed.
“Although Tamir Rice’s death is tragic, the evidence does not meet these substantial evidentiary requirements,” the Justice Department said.
Subodh Chandra, a former federal prosecutor who is representing the Rice family, said Tuesday that the process had been tainted. “The Rice family has been cheated of a fair process yet again,” Chandra said in an email.
Chandra said the Justice Department had ignored the Rice family’s request for an accounting of the department’s internal discussions of the case and to make public the recommendations of the two prosecutors who requested permission to use a grand jury.
In 2015, a grand jury in Cuyahoga County decided not to charge Loehmann with any crime under state law. The decision, which was based on a recommendation by the county prosecutor, set off protests.
Henry Hilow, a lawyer for the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association who represented the two officers involved in the case, said that Tuesday’s announcement by the Justice Department was a further affirmation of the facts of the case.
“I agree with the decision of the Justice Department,” Hilow said in a voicemail message Tuesday night. “It is consistent with the findings in the investigation by the prosecutor’s office in Cuyahoga County and with all the independent investigations.”
In 2017, Loehmann was fired for lying on his employment application in 2013, a violation that came to light only after officials began investigating the officers after Tamir’s death.
A spokesperson for the Cleveland Division of Police declined to comment Tuesday night.
In August, a lawyer for a government watchdog group filed a whistleblower complaint with the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, accusing the department of mishandling the case.
The lawyer, David Z. Seide of the Government Accountability Project, who represents a person familiar with the case, said in an interview Tuesday night that the Justice Department inquiry had become so protracted that the statute of limitations for bringing civil rights or obstruction charges against the officers had already expired.
“The tragedy of this case was there was political meddling that prevented the case from being investigated,” Seide said.

Ring Out 2020 With Shots You’ll Actually Enjoy

At this point in 2020, we deserve a shot. But before you reach for the tequila and gird yourself for the next morning, adjust your definition of “shot.”
No longer just the domain of hard-hitting, one-note shooters, shots can be complex and enjoyable in both flavor and experience. And these composed shots are to be thought of as small, fast-moving cocktails that thrive in the moment, enlivening the evening — and imbibers — one round at a time.
“Taking a shot is a rewarding way to connect even from far away,” said Natasha Bermudez, the head bartender at Llama San in Manhattan, adding, “It’s celebratory and such a bartender thing to do.”
Though many bars remain closed to the public and large gatherings continue to be unsafe, the innate festivity and connection of taking shots can still translate to the home bar. And composed shots offer the option to tinker with the ABV, and layer in nuanced flavor and texture.
If you’re adding more than one spirit to your shot glass, start with the simple 50/50 formula, which Bermudez deploys regularly.
“I offer single-ingredient shots when I want to showcase the spirit,” she said, “but, for a mixed shot, I usually go for a split base of amaro and a spirit like mezcal or rum.”
You can also look to classic cocktails for inspiration: Mixed shots, like the New York Sour Shot, are built to be as complex as the established drinks they’re named for, yet taken in one swift motion.
“For people who aren’t drinking, I often send over a shot of verjus,” Bermudez said.
While you’re updating your definition of what a shot can be, reconsider what it can be served in. Of course, you can deploy that novelty 1990s Grand Canyon shot glass, but anything diminutive in size can also be put to use. Break into your grandparents’ China, pull out flea market finds, or do as Bermudez does and repurpose a ceramic or bamboo sake or shochu vessel.
Once you’ve mixed, poured and doled out your shots, take a moment to connect. “The shot isn’t just for you,” Bermudez said. “When someone serves you a shot, they’re likely taking one with you. Look in their eyes, give a cheers and don’t take the shot before everyone else.”
Lastly, don’t save a shot solely for the end of the evening. “It’s like Champagne,” Bermudez said. “You can start or end the night with it.”
As a general rule (to follow, or not), start the night with shots lower in ABV, like the Bamboo Shot, and move up in ABV as the night progresses — pacing yourself with ample water breaks.
Whenever you start pouring, embrace the remodeled, upgraded shot experience and raise a petite glass and a hearty cheers to the end of 2020.
—— Bamboo Shot
Yield: 8 shots
3 1/2 ounces fino or manzanilla sherry
3 1/2 ounces dry or bianco vermouth
3 dashes Angostura bitters
3 dashes orange bitters
2 orange peels
2 lemon peels
Very small pinch of flaky sea salt (optional)
Ice
Big green olives, such as Castelvetrano, for serving
1. To a cocktail shaker or mixing glass, add the sherry, vermouth and bitters.

The best muffins are the ones that veer into cupcake territory. Buttery, rich and occasionally glazed or iced, a muffin is intended to make eating cake acceptable for breakfast.
These crumb cake muffins do just that.
With their sour cream-laden batter, they’re about as tender and moist as cake gets. And the nubby blanket of cinnamon-scented crumbs on top is as sweet as icing, but crunchier, and easier to eat out of hand in the morning while the caffeine kicks in.
To get that cakelike texture, the batter does require an electric mixer, either hand-held or stand. Here, I use it for the reverse-creaming method, which calls for mixing the dry ingredients first, then beating in the butter before finally adding the eggs and sour cream. I find that I get a slightly lighter, finer cake that way (as opposed to the more traditional technique of creaming the butter and sugar first).
The butter does need to be well softened for the reverse-creaming method to work, so plan ahead, or be prepared to zap the butter briefly in the microwave on 50% power before you start mixing. It should be soft enough to spread easily on toast.
Then, to bump up the flavor, I mixed in a hefty dose of vanilla and a small amount of almond extract and lemon zest, just enough to brighten things without being obviously citrusy or almondy.
Next, I focused on adding more oomph to the crumbs. Instead of just melting the butter, I let it bubble and hiss until the milky foam sank to the bottom of the pot and turned as brown as a pecan. That gave the butter a deep, caramelized flavor that made the crumbs arguably the best part — and extremely tempting to nibble off the tops of all the muffins as soon as they’re cool enough to pick at.
Because I know that temptation exceedingly well, I build in a safeguard. Hidden underneath the batter is a second layer of crumbs. So, even if, say, a few crumbs disappear off the tops as you’re moving them from the pans to serving platter, your muffin recipients will not suffer their lack.
Plus, that underlying layer of crumbs fixes the problem of gobbling the tops and leaving the bottoms. With this recipe, not a crumb will remain.

RECIPE
Cinnamon Crumb Cake Muffins
Yield: 12 muffins
Total time: 1 hour
Ingredients:
For the topping:
1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)
1 1/3 cups/165 grams all-purpose flour
1/2 cup/110 grams dark brown sugar, packed
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice or cardamom
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
For the batter:
3/4 cup/180 milliliters sour cream
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour
2/3 cup/135 grams sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1-inch slices and softened
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees and line a 12-cup muffin tin with liners.
2. Make the topping: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter, then let it simmer until the foam on top falls to the bottom of the pot and turns brown, 4 to 6 minutes. It will smell nutty when it’s ready. Immediately pour butter into a small bowl to keep it from getting any browner, and let cool for 5 minutes.
3. Whisk together flour, sugar, spices and salt in a medium bowl. Pour in the brown butter and stir, pinching the mixture together, until crumbs form. Set aside.
4. Make the batter: Whisk together sour cream, eggs, vanilla, almond extract and lemon zest in a mixing bowl.
5. In a large bowl, using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a handheld electric mixer, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt until combined, about 10 seconds. Add softened butter and beat for 20 seconds to work it into the flour. Add egg mixture and continue beating until the batter is very smooth, about 1 minute.
6. Sprinkle a scant tablespoon of the topping crumbs into the bottom of each muffin liner. Spoon the batter on top of the crumbs, dividing it evenly.
7. Bake muffins for 5 minutes to firm up the tops so the crumbs don't sink into the batter. Remove muffin pan from the oven and lower heat to 350 degrees. Sprinkle the remaining crumbs on top of each muffin. Continue to bake until the muffins are springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Use an offset spatula or butter knife to lift the muffins out of the pan. Finish cooling muffins on a rack.

Howard J. Rubenstein, who softened life’s blows and polished the tarnished images of the rich, the famous and the flawed for more than 65 years in becoming New York’s preeminent public relations impresario, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
A spokeswoman, Nancy Haberman, confirmed the death. No cause was given.
In a profession often regarded with skepticism, Rubenstein, the founding chairman and president of Rubenstein Associates, was sometimes called a spin doctor, a charlatan or worse. But with a little help from his friends in the news media, he publicized the triumphs of many achievers, and when crises struck celebrities, politicians, corporations or cultural institutions, he was a fixer of choice, called in at a moment’s notice to control the damage and restore reputations.
His hundreds of clients were among the best-known names in town: Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch, the late New York Yankees owner George M. Steinbrenner III, Columbia University, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and constellations of entertainers, civic and religious leaders, and Wall Street tycoons, their signed pictures lining the walls of Rubenstein Associates in a midtown Manhattan skyscraper.
His business was lucrative. Corporate clients often paid retainers of $10,000 a month, while the largest paid $750,000 or more a year, according to senior associates of Rubenstein. He did not publicly discuss his company’s billing practices or revenues. Estimates ranged from $30 million to $75 million in revenues a year. In any case, they made Rubenstein wealthy. He was said to earn $4 million to $7 million a year.
With mild manners and a soft voice, Rubenstein was the antithesis of the swaggering press agent caricatured in films like “The Sweet Smell of Success” and denigrated in newsrooms as a “flack” or “mouthpiece.” He did not inhabit nightclubs for gossip. He lived on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park, where even in his 60s and 70s he liked to jog daily. He dined often with corporate, cultural and political leaders.
He employed hundreds of people, preached ethics in speeches and articles on public relations, and impressed clients as diplomatic and trustworthy, although some rivals accused him of using underhanded tactics. He had been a friend of every New York mayor, governor and United States senator since the 1970s, and made seamless nonpartisan transitions between Democrats and Republicans.
“It doesn’t matter who it is,” former Mayor Ed Koch once explained. “It could be Caligula.”
Indeed, with his vast contacts in government, business, the news media and the arts, Rubenstein was often more power broker than public relations man, making connections among people and institutions for mutual benefit. He advised politicians, devised corporate strategies to shape public opinion, represented real estate interests and brought leaders of business, government and unions together to make deals.
His power lay hidden in countless favors, large and small. But his most visible stock in trade was trouble — a marital fight, a star blurting a racist remark, a drunken toot. His customized rehabilitation plans often involved simple public admissions or apologies, then silence to contain the imbroglio. The task, he said, was not keeping a lid on bad publicity. It was controlling its flow, tone and volume. He cautioned against lying, although his selective “truths” favored clients: People were never fired; they left to seek new opportunities.
“When you have a crisis, you first have to ask, what’s the right thing to do and say,” he told The New York Times in 1995. “Not what kind of spin can we put on, but what’s the right thing to do. You don’t let the facts dribble out. Sometimes you do it by holding a news conference. Other times you do it with a written statement, depending on how the client feels or the ability of the client to conduct himself or herself in a tough situation.”
For sports broadcaster Marv Albert, a tough situation arose in 1997, when his dalliances with a cross-dresser and a prostitute-dominatrix were exposed by his guilty plea to a misdemeanor assault charge for biting a woman during a sexual encounter. After conferring with Rubenstein, he submitted to a news conference and a weeklong tour of the talk shows — Larry King, David Letterman, Katie Couric and Barbara Walters — elaborating his denials. Then he refused to talk about it anymore. Almost nothing new about the matter emerged, except a perception that Albert had forcefully defended himself, and after a period of withdrawal and rehabilitation, his career resumed virtually intact.
In 1996, talk-show host Kathy Lee Gifford was caught in a scandal after a human rights organization reported that child sweatshop labor in Honduras was being exploited to manufacture a clothing line in her name. The Rubenstein prescription in her case was deflection and rehabilitation. Gifford went on national television to say she was not involved in factory management processes, then called for investigations and campaigned for new laws against sweatshop conditions. She even appeared at the White House with President Bill Clinton to support initiatives against child labor abuses.
Howard Joseph Rubenstein was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 3, 1932, to Samuel and Ada (Sall) Rubenstein. His father was a police reporter for the Standard News Association, which served New York City papers, and later for The New York Herald Tribune. Howard and his sister, June, grew up in the Bensonhurst section. He graduated from Midwood High School and in 1953 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in economics.
At his mother’s urging, he applied to all the Ivy League law schools and was accepted at Harvard. But he dropped out after two months and went home, uncertain what to do. He declined his father’s idea of a copy boy’s job but was more receptive to another. Like some reporters then, his father did a little public relations work on the side, and he taught Howard how to write news releases and pitch story ideas to reporters. He also helped find his first client, the Menorah Home and Hospital for the Aged and Infirm.
Howard set up shop at the kitchen table in 1954. But after his mother refused to answer the home’s telephone with the greeting “Rubenstein Associates,” he rented an office. His next client was Vito Battista, an anti-tax Republican whose perennial quest for office eventually landed him a New York Assembly seat. Rubenstein rented a camel to plug Battista’s mayoral candidacy and draped it with a sign saying its back would be broken by another city tax.
Still drawn by the idea of being a lawyer, he took night classes at St. John’s University and earned a law degree in 1959. Through Rep. Emanuel Celler, a Brooklyn Democrat who was chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rubenstein became the panel’s assistant counsel, but quit after six months to resume his public relations career.
In 1959, he married Amy Forman. She survives him, along with three children, Roni, Richard, and Steven Rubenstein, and seven grandchildren. David, another child, died in 1971 at age 9.
Rubenstein continued to be involved in his business in recent years, but his son Steven oversaw the day-to-day running of Rubenstein, as the company is now known, as its president. Richard Rubenstein founded his own agency, Rubenstein Public Relations, in 1987.
Howard Rubenstein, nominally a Democrat, signed up a host of politicians as clients, many of them — like Abraham D. Beame, Hugh Carey and Stanley Steingut — starting careers that would lead to seats of power in City Hall, the Governor’s Mansion and the state Legislature. Through real estate contacts he recruited developers like Fred Trump (Donald’s father) and Lewis and Jack Rudin.
By the 1970s he was representing hundreds of the city’s most prominent people and organizations. He also served international celebrities, including Sarah Ferguson, the divorced Duchess of York. Occasionally he had to drop clients — notably four state agencies after Carey was elected governor in 1974, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1999 after his friend Mayor Rudy Giuliani condemned an exhibit there. In both cases he was caught in a conflict and deemed his friendship and loyalty to the officeholders to be the greater interest.
The 1990 breakup of Donald and Ivana Trump put a clash of public relations rivals on display, each with an eye on the bottom line. John Scanlon, known as an aggressive crisis manager, portrayed Ivana Trump as an integral part of the Trump business empire. Donald Trump, coached by Rubenstein, played down her responsibilities. So who won? Her settlement topped $20 million. But Donald Trump’s net worth at the time was estimated at $1.7 billion to $4 billion.
Steinbrenner, whose harsh treatment of Yankee players and managers was a publicist’s nightmare, often left Rubenstein resorting to “no comment.” Starting a decade before Steinbrenner’s death in 2010, the publicist orchestrated a tactical retreat for “the Boss.” Reporters said he was shielding an aging man from public view, but Rubenstein offered a more benign interpretation, saying Steinbrenner’s lowered profile “just comes with maturity — he just doesn’t relish publicity the way he used to.”
Another difficult client was Leona Helmsley, the hotel and real estate magnate who was convicted of income tax evasion in 1989. She became a symbol of arrogance when a former maid quoted her in testimony as saying, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Rubenstein visited Helmsley in prison, and after she died in 2007 and left $12 million to her dog, Trouble, a Maltese, prompting lawsuits and death threats against the pet, he became a spokesman for Trouble, too, as interest peaked in its life of luxury.
“The dog is being well cared for in an undisclosed location,” he said tactfully.
After Trump became president, Rubenstein distanced himself from him. “While I haven’t worked with him for more than 20 years,” he told PRWeek.com in 2017, “it was clear even back then that he was a highly astute communicator.”

The fast-growing cryptocurrency startup Coinbase has been rattled in recent months by tensions between executives and employees who said they were being treated unfairly because of their race or gender.
While management at the company has argued that the complaints were limited to a handful of employees, Coinbase’s own compensation data suggests that inequitable treatment of women and Black workers went far beyond a few disgruntled workers.
The data, recently obtained by The New York Times, indicated that women at Coinbase were paid an average of $13,000, or 8%, less than men at comparable jobs and ranks within the company, according to an analysis of the figures, which included pay details for most of Coinbase’s roughly 830 employees at the end of 2018.
The picture was also unequal for the 16 salaried Black employees in the data. They were paid $11,500, or 7%, less than all other employees in similar jobs.
The pay disparities at Coinbase appear to be much larger than those in the tech industry as a whole, and at the few other tech companies that have had to release data.
The Coinbase analysis was conducted for The Times by Alexandra Marr, an economist who has provided statistical analysis for court cases involving pay bias. When she factored in stock options for Coinbase’s employees — often an important part of pay at startups — the compensation for women and men was roughly the same while the gap between white and Black employees grew to 11%.
Nine employees included in the data confirmed the accuracy of the figures about themselves and colleagues they knew.
The pay disparities are likely to add to tensions at the San Francisco company, which is riding a boom in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It recently told regulators it intended to file for an initial public offering.
Numerous Black employees at Coinbase recently publicly complained about the discrimination they faced at the company. Several women who work at Coinbase have also complained internally about how they were hired, paid and promoted, according to company documents and five employees with knowledge of the complaints. The people would speak only on the condition they not be named because they had signed nondisclosure agreements.
The compensation analysis paints a new and detailed picture of the challenges that women and Black employees have faced at Coinbase, a startup that has taken center stage in a broader debate in Silicon Valley about how underrepresented employees are treated.
“This certainly looks like a company with a problem,” said James Finberg, the lawyer who is leading the two biggest cases on pay bias in Silicon Valley, against Oracle and Google, after reviewing the Coinbase data.
In a statement, L.J. Brock, Coinbase’s chief people officer, said the company started to conduct a comprehensive review of compensation across the company in late 2018.
“As a result of this process, we implemented a new compensation program that brought Coinbase in line with some of the world’s most respected technology companies. This program included: implementing a robust, industry standard leveling system; implementing nonnegotiable, single pay targets for base salary; and awarding equity to all roles and levels,” Brock said.
Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s chief executive, has prided himself on his management strategy and acumen, writing numerous memos on his efforts to create a “consistent culture” dedicated to growth. But his strategy has left many workers feeling shortchanged or alienated, according to current and former employees, surveys and internal documents.
The growing criticism from employees could make it harder to hire new workers at a time when Coinbase is in need of them. More than 60 employees — or 5% of the company — resigned this fall after Armstrong put in place new policies restricting employees from discussing noncompany politics and social issues during work.
The compensation details given to The Times do not go past 2018. At the time, the company had around 830 employees, the data shows. Coinbase has since grown to around 1,100 employees.
The tech industry has struggled broadly with unequal representation and pay for women. Pinterest, for example, agreed to pay $22.5 million this month to settle a suit from its former chief operating officer, accusing the company of sexism and pay discrimination.
But few companies have released detailed information about pay. Those that have, like Google and Oracle, did so in response to lawsuits brought by female employees accusing the companies of pay bias.
The data analysis from those cases suggests that Coinbase had bigger wage disparities between men and women than either Google or Oracle. At Oracle, the gap between men and women with similar backgrounds and roles was 3.9% according to analysis in the court case against the company — less than half as much as the gap at Coinbase.
“If I was running a company and I knew that my numbers looked worse than people being sued, that would worry me,” said Janice Madden, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who did the analysis in the Oracle case.
The numbers in the Google and Oracle cases controlled for factors, such as experience and education, that were not possible in the Coinbase statistics because of the limits of the data shared with The Times.
The Coinbase figures arrived at by Marr took account of the job level of all employees, as well as their status as an engineer and manager. It is possible that if the analysis took account of more factors, the pay disparity would shrink.
In the 14 job categories at Coinbase with at least three women, the average woman earned less than the average man in all but two job categories.
Black employees earned less, on average, than white employees in all but one of the eight job categories that had any Black staff members, the analysis by Marr shows.
The wage disparities are compounded by the fact that women and Black employees were concentrated in the lower-paying jobs at the company.
At Coinbase, the engineering staff was only 13% female, according to the company’s own analysis from 2018, which was obtained by The Times. This was half the industry average and lower than the number at all of the 11 companies that Coinbase considered competitors, according to the company’s internal analysis, which was shared with The Times.
Employee unhappiness over pay and culture led to several negative reviews on the career site Glassdoor that cite problems with pay and representation for women and Black employees, culminating in an overall rating of 1.1 out of 5 on diversity and inclusion.
The bad reviews led to conversations among executives, some who pushed for changes to the company’s culture, according to four former employees briefed on the conversations, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements they signed.
One of the reviews that was often discussed inside the company said the “unconscious pro-male bias is out of control” and warned women that “you’ll get paid less than your male colleagues, passed over for promotions.”
Armstrong generally ignored the recommendations of employees who spoke with him about their concerns about diversity, The Times previously reported.
Internal figures given to The Times indicate that the company’s diversity has not changed much since 2018. When the company last did an internal diversity report, in late 2019, the percentage of female and Black employees — 33% and 3% — at Coinbase was roughly the same as in 2018.
An internal document about the company’s struggles to improve diversity, from around the same time as the data, said that employees had noticed the “lack of engagement” on diversity from executives, leading to “confusion” about whether the company cared about improving the environment for minorities.
“Without senior executive engagement, diversity is considered a secondary, ‘nice to have’ rather than a priority for the organization,” the document said.
Or, as one otherwise positive review on Glassdoor put it, at around the same time: “Don’t repeat the same mistakes of the past, where women and minorities are left behind.”

It took several months for a Bay Area sculptor to shape the clay with his hands into a likeness of Breonna Taylor, which he finished with a dark brown satin glaze.
But less than two weeks after the statue memorializing Taylor was installed in a busy downtown plaza in Oakland, California, its creator, Leo Carson, said he held the broken pieces of the vandalized ceramic bust in those same hands.
The sculpture was smashed in several places late last week, drawing widespread condemnation in the community and prompting a police investigation.
The vandalism was regarded as another indignity to those still grappling with the killing of Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman and emergency room technician, by police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, during a botched drug raid in March. Taylor’s death, along with the killing of George Floyd in late May, stoked widespread protests over police brutality and racial injustice.
A plaque with Taylor’s name and the phrase “Say Her Name” was displayed on the front of the statue that was vandalized in Latham Square plaza, which is near Oakland City Hall.
“I built it to support the Black Lives Matter movement,” Carson said in an interview Monday night, “but that also makes it a target for racist aggression.”
A spokesperson for the Oakland Police Department said in an email Monday night that a police report had been filed in the matter and that the vandalism was under investigation.
Carson, 30, who is white, said he spent about $600 making the sculpture, which he placed in the plaza on Dec. 12. He chronicled the installation on Instagram, which one person warned at the time could face a backlash. “Pull that down,” the person wrote, “it’s a source of riots.”
Carson, who made trips to Home Depot and a ceramics studio while making the sculpture, said he had prepared for the possibility that the installation could be damaged.
“It was always in the back of my mind,” he said. “I just had a feeling like I had to do it anyway. It didn’t matter.”
Mayor Libby Schaff of Oakland denounced the vandalism in a Twitter post Monday.
“It’s a vicious attack against the light + justice sought in Breonna Taylor’s name,” Schaff wrote. “We will keep moving forward; Oakland will not tolerate acts of hatred.”
Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, also condemned the damage to the sculpture.
“This act of vandalism disrespects Breonna’s memory, what she represents and the work of this artist,” Greenblatt said Monday on Twitter.
Carson said that the outpouring of support from the community had been heartening and that he had raised about $8,000 on a GoFundMe page toward building a new sculpture from bronze. He said he planned to donate the remaining funds to Taylor’s family.
The three officers implicated in Taylor’s death avoided homicide charges in September, setting off a new round of protests across the nation. A grand jury in Louisville indicted one officer, who was fired, on three counts of wanton endangerment.
Carson said that someone on Instagram told him about the vandalism over the weekend.
“In that sense, it’s not surprising," he said, “but it doesn’t reflect Oakland.”
The sculptor said he quickly went to check on the sculpture so he could retrieve the broken pieces, which he said would be repaired and eventually used in the mold for the bronze sculpture.
“It gives her a sense of wholeness again,” he said.

After his university in Scotland shut down in the spring because of the coronavirus, forcing him to study online from home, Jack Boag kept up his spirits by dreaming of what awaited him in the coming academic year: a semester abroad at the University of Amsterdam.
But his hopes of participating in the European Union-wide student exchange program known as Erasmus were dashed last week after Britain and Europe finally reached a Brexit deal. As part of the announcement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Britain would withdraw from Erasmus, citing its high costs.
“For me, Erasmus was the most direct benefit of European cooperation,” said Boag, a 20-year-old history and international relations student at the University of Aberdeen. “That’s gone.”
For many young people in Britain, the decision to withdraw from Erasmus is just the most recent step in a steady erosion of such possibilities since the country voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Once able to study and work anywhere in the European Union without a visa, young Britons will now be treated like people from any other country outside the bloc when it comes to applying for educational programs — or jobs.
The withdrawal is also a blow for Britain’s vaunted universities, a powerful symbol of its soft power in Europe and around the world, and an important source of income for the country. Britain remains second only to the United States as a destination for international students, but leaving Erasmus could deter many EU students who might have used the program as a pathway to a British education.
While this may not affect renowned institutions like Oxford or Cambridge, scores of lesser-known universities could suffer a blow.
Many young people and academics had hoped that Britain would remain part of Erasmus under a status that allows the participation of nonmember states like Turkey and Norway. Johnson said in January that there was “no threat to the Erasmus scheme.
So his announcement Thursday sent shock waves through universities, angered diplomats, and upset British students and professors who have benefited from the program.
“There will be a relative loss of income for British universities, but from a diplomatic and ambassadorial point of view, the loss is invaluable,” said Seán Hand, the vice president in charge of Europe at the University of Warwick, the second-largest source of Erasmus students from Britain.
Britain’s departure from Erasmus, one of the most popular programs in the European Union, may be one of the starkest signs of its divorce from the bloc, a clear signal of its vision for its future relationship with its former partners.
“Erasmus opens people’s horizons and broadens their conceiving of the world,” said John O’Brennan, a professor of European studies at the University of Maynooth in Ireland, where he leads a European integration program financed by Erasmus. “If that’s not the embodiment of the European ideal, I don’t know what it is.”
While exchanges will still be possible between British and European universities through bilateral agreements, British students will not benefit from the monthly grants supplied by Erasmus, now officially known as Erasmus+. It will also be harder for academics and teachers to train or teach abroad.
Students and academics who have secured funds before the Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31 will be able to go abroad until the end of the 2021-22 academic year, according to Universities U.K., a representative group for the country’s academic institutions.
Since its introduction in 1987, Erasmus has sent millions of people abroad for study exchanges, work placements or traineeships. About 200,000 students participate in the program every year. Alumni often speak fondly of the experience, which they see as the most tangible form of European integration: a way to discover new cultures, study other languages, and make lifelong connections.
“Erasmus is not only the student exchange program it’s known for, it’s also embedded in how the European Union thinks about confronting unemployment and mobility,” said Paul James Cardwell, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow who participated in the program in the 1990s.
In Britain, half of the students who study abroad do so through Erasmus. For many, it has shaped personal paths and provided an accessible way to feel connected to mainland Europe.
Ben Munster, a 25-year-old British freelance writer who studied in Italy in 2015 and has since moved to Rome, called Erasmus the “purest and most vivid expression of the Schengen dream,” referring to the EU’s passport-free travel zone.
Natalia Barbour, a 22-year-old international communications student at the University of Glasgow who studied in Amsterdam for a semester, said she had wanted to participate since she was in high school. “It makes the university experience more exciting,” she said.
“Everyone wins from it, including professors,” said Mark Berry, a professor in music history at Royal Holloway University of London, who taught in the Netherlands through Erasmus in 2015. “I’d wish I had done more of that when it was still possible.”
In 2019, Britain welcomed more than 30,000 students and trainees through the program.
“So many students come to Britain and go home with a positive experience,” said Cardwell, the University of Strathclyde professor. “It’s such a strong aspect of Britain’s soft power.”
British lawmakers who supported staying in the program wrote in a report last year that opting out would disproportionately affect people from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with medical needs or disabilities.
They also warned that it would be difficult to replace it.
Under the current 2014-20 Erasmus+ program, Britain has contributed around 1.8 billion euros ($2.2 billion) and has received 1 billion euros, according to the Department for Education.
Johnson said last week that a program named after mathematician Alan Turing would replace Erasmus+ and that it would allow students “to go to the best universities in the world.” Starting in September 2021, it will provide funding for around 35,000 students to study abroad, at an annual cost of 100 million pounds. British professors and students from foreign universities would not be eligible for the program.
Britain, however, will still receive funding from the EU’s research and innovation program, Horizon 2020, of which it is the second largest recipient.
Universities U.K. welcomed the Turing program, but other experts called the move shortsighted.
“This will be felt in 20 years,” O’Brennan of the University of Maynooth said. “Britain has miscalculated what it receives from this program.”
Many universities have said they would keep close ties with Europe.
“European universities don’t want the link to be broken, for them it’s very important that their students keep coming to Britain,” said Hand, at the University of Warwick.
For British alumni of the program, the end of Erasmus marked the end of an era — one when they could not only study abroad easily, but also travel across Spain, learn to ski in Austria, or dance at a festival in Denmark.
“That’s what Erasmus is about: It taught me how to appreciate wine and cheese, how to take the time to socialize through hourslong lunches,” said Katy Jones, a 28-year-old who went to France as an Erasmus student and runs an English-language program in Lyon.
Boag, the student in Aberdeen, who is in the third year of a four-year program, said he hoped to apply to postgraduate programs in continental Europe, but that he worried about additional hurdles that have yet to be made clear.
“For Erasmus and so many other things, Brexit is a Pandora’s box,” he said. “We don’t know what’s inside yet, because we’ve just opened it.”

These Bacon and Eggs Practically Cook Themselves

There’s a way to plates of crispy bacon and sunny-side-up eggs that doesn’t demand you stand over a hot skillet and get greasy. “Frying” bacon in a hot oven, then cooking eggs on the same sheet pan, turns out a meal for four in 15 minutes and requires almost no attention.
Yes, the method is convenient, especially on a holiday morning when there are gifts to open, but its real appeal is how the evenly browned bacon and perfectly set eggs are done all at once.
Because bacon strips run long, a big batch of them cooks more uniformly on a sheet tray than in a sloping skillet, all crowded and tangled as if playing Twister. Surrounded by hot air in the oven, the fat in the bacon melts steadily and runs under and around all the slices, sizzling them from pink to brick red. As they cook, they curl enough to allow space to add eggs to the pan.
Eggs aren’t often cooked in the oven, probably because getting them right can be tricky. If eggs are baked at all, they’re often plopped into ramekins, along with cream, for some version of shirred eggs. They can be delicious, but they can risk tasting rubbery as they may toughen in dry, moderate heat.
With this sheet-pan technique, the eggs cook quickly in a very hot oven. Cracked into all that slowly rendered bacon fat, the egg whites slide like silk and start to set almost immediately. Once the pan is back in the oven, the encompassing heat finishes solidifying the whites, including that ring around the yolk that sometimes stays jiggly when heated only from below on the stovetop.
For a spread, bake sticky buns, muffins or scones, or roast potatoes, mushrooms or tomatoes before starting the bacon. They’ll cool to the just-right temperature as the eggs finish. Or toast rolls, biscuits or croissants in the oven at the same time, for breakfast sandwiches or just to swipe through that runny yolk.
In every case, you can relax and be present for all the holiday cheer — even in another room — while breakfast cooks itself.
Recipe: Crispy Oven Bacon and Eggs
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes
4 large eggs
8 bacon slices
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Toast, for serving
1. Take the eggs out of the refrigerator. Place a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 450 degrees.
2. Arrange the bacon on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer, spacing evenly. Roast in the center of the oven until the fat renders and the bacon curls, about 8 minutes. Very thin slices will cook more quickly; thick-cut ones will take longer.
3. Take the pan out of the oven and quickly flip the bacon and move to one side of the pan. Crack the eggs onto the other side, then immediately return the pan to the oven and roast until the whites are just set, the yolks are still runny and the bacon is brown and crisp, 2 to 5 minutes longer. If you prefer medium or hard egg yolks or extra-crisp bacon, cook a few minutes more, but take out the bacon before it burns.
4. Using a spatula, cut the eggs apart. Slide them off the pan and onto plates right away to stop the yolks from solidifying. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain the bacon on paper towels, then add to the plate along with toast. Serve immediately.
Tips:
Use the bacon and eggs in breakfast sandwiches: Toast split buttered rolls, with cheese on the bottom halves if you’d like, directly on another rack in the oven while the eggs cook. Then, center the eggs and bacon slices over the bottoms and sandwich with the tops.

Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, blocked an effort to hold an immediate vote to increase stimulus checks to $2,000 on Tuesday, saying instead that the Senate would “begin a process” to consider bigger payments, along with other demands issued by President Donald Trump, leaving the fate of the measure unclear as more Republicans clamored to endorse it.
McConnell did not elaborate further on how — or when — the Senate would move to consider Trump’s demands, which the president made Sunday after finally agreeing to sign a $900 billion stimulus package and government spending bill into law. Trump had held the package hostage for days, insisting that lawmakers more than triple the direct payments to $2,000 from $600, remove a legal shield for companies like YouTube and Facebook and investigate “very substantial voter fraud.”
The president relented only after Republican lawmakers persuaded him to sign the legislation, saying Sunday that he had been promised Congress would take up his demands.
McConnell’s decision to block a vote on increasing the stimulus payments came as a growing number of Republican senators voiced support for the larger checks, and as pressure mounted on the Senate to vote on the measure.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, tried to force an immediate vote on increasing the size of the checks using a procedural tactic that allows senators to advance legislation unless another senator objects. McConnell blocked the measure.
“Senate Democrats strongly support $2,000 checks. Even President Trump supports $2,000 checks,” Schumer said. “There’s one question left today: Do Senate Republicans join with the rest of America in supporting $2,000 checks?”
A growing number of Republican senators have endorsed higher stimulus payments, including Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, both Georgia lawmakers facing tight runoff elections next week, who announced Tuesday that they supported larger stimulus checks.
They joined a handful of others, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who have backed increasing the checks to $2,000. But the majority of Senate Republicans have so far remained opposed to the plan.
McConnell’s decision to link all of Trump’s demands together could doom any chance of passage. While Democrats all support larger checks, they are unlikely to endorse a hasty overhaul of the legal shield in place for social media companies, especially measures put forward by Republican senators aimed at confronting what they believe is anti-conservative bias.
Democrats are also likely to resist anything that could be seen as trying to undermine the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, as Trump has suggested. McConnell, who has privately urged his members not to object to the election results when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to ratify them, portrayed the president’s request as “exploring further ways to protect the sanctity of American ballots.” But Trump has been laser-focused on getting Congress to investigate “the very substantial voter fraud which took place,” an assertion he has repeated contrary to considerable evidence.
The House voted Monday evening to increase the size of the checks to $2,000, daring Senate Republicans to either approve the heftier sum or defy Trump. The president kept up his campaign for the measure Tuesday, demanding in a tweet “$2000 for our great people, not $600!”
The House vote, which just reached the two-thirds majority needed to pass, came a day after Trump finally signed off on a $900 billion pandemic relief package he initially denounced as a “disgrace” and refused to sign. The legislation, which passed 275-134, was supported by 44 Republican members.
In signing the relief bill Sunday night, Trump claimed in a statement that the Senate would “start the process for a vote” on legislation that would increase direct payments and pledged that “much more money is coming.”
Republican lawmakers in the House were visibly frustrated with Trump’s demand. Some of the president’s closest allies, including Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, and Jim Jordan of Ohio, voted against the measure, and Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, complained on the House floor that the proposal had been “hastily dropped on us at the last minute” and wouldn’t assist those who needed it most.
“I worry that this whopping $463 billion won’t do what’s needed, stimulate the economy or help workers get back to work,” Brady said.

NEW YORK — The first disaster in a year of perpetual crises hit the New York Police Department in March, when the virus tore through the force, killing dozens and sickening entire detective squads.
Soon, the courts ground to a halt. By June, hundreds of officers were reassigned to cover mass protests against police brutality and racism, where police and protesters sometimes clashed violently. By August, gun violence was surging. And as December drew to a close, New York's 447 homicides made 2020 the city’s bloodiest year in nearly a decade.
The hobbled criminal justice system strained to contain the rise in violent crime caused by the pandemic’s societywide upheaval.
“I can’t imagine a darker period,” Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said in a year-end briefing with reporters on Tuesday, citing the confluence of the pandemic and the protests.
The year’s crime numbers give shape to 2020’s tumult: Transit crime and grand larceny, often the stealing of laptops or iPhones of straphangers, plummeted as trains emptied out. But burglaries and car thefts spiked in a hollowed-out city. And bodegas, neighborhood staples during the throes of the pandemic, saw an increase in robberies and shootings.
By summer, the frustrations of shutdowns and economic collapse had burst onto the streets. Shootings had doubled, and most of them were concentrated in the areas hardest hit by the coronavirus and unemployment.
The increase in violence resembles trends in many big U.S. cities, where shootings and homicides have risen even as the pandemic has driven down other crimes.
“We’ve never had a year like this in policing, when you’ve had a combination of a worldwide health epidemic and a challenge to community trust,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum. “That has been a combustible mixture. And the police in many ways were not prepared.”
Shea said Tuesday that the department was caught flat-footed this summer when tens of thousands of protesters took to city streets after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. The demonstrations kicked off a national debate about policing and led many departments, including New York’s, to slice budgets and redirect funding to community programs.
“There’s things that we probably should have done years and years ago,” Shea said, noting that the department had spent the months since June retraining many patrol officers and rethinking its approach to protests.
Dozens of incidents were recorded of police officers brutalizing demonstrators, many of them peaceful, during protests. The state attorney general kicked off an investigation into the department’s aggressive enforcement. And earlier this month, a city watchdog chided police officials for being unprepared and out of touch with the current discourse about police brutality.
Police officials in New York have pointed to gang disputes as a key driver of the violence over the summer, but several bystanders were caught in the cross hairs: a 43-year-old mother, killed by a stray bullet that went through her bedroom window in Queens; a man fatally shot on a handball court in Brooklyn; a 1-year-old boy, dead after a gunman opened fire on a cookout, also in Brooklyn.
But many cases were stalled because the pandemic had forced the courts to operate virtually. Hardly any new trials were conducted, and the progress of many cases was significantly slowed.
“I think we’ve struggled a little bit because of COVID, and how courts were closed, but when things start opening up, we have a lot of great work in the hopper ready to go, to really close some of the violence that we saw in 2020,” said Rodney Harrison, the Police Department’s chief of detectives.
Combating street feuds has become a sort of routine for the police, particularly in the warmer months when turf battles and social media fights can lead to spikes in gun violence in certain neighborhoods. But officials and experts have said that something about the summer’s violence felt less predictable, and that made anticipating trends more difficult.
“I think it’s about something more, something out there about the anxiety, and the fact that a lot of our institutions are not functioning the way they usually do,” Wexler said of the violence. “If it was just New York, I think that would be one thing. But because the crime increase in homicides is widespread, I think it says something bigger about what’s going on.”
Despite the violent summer, crime numbers in the city remained well below the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, when New York saw more than 2,000 murders a year. Homicides and shootings have plummeted in recent years, even in some of the city’s most notoriously dangerous corners. Had 2020 not been such an anomaly, officials have said, that trend might have continued.
This year, as crime increased, the police solved less of it. Police Department records, for example, showed that officers solved 26.3% of serious crimes in the second quarter of the year; department figures show that 35.8% of serious crimes were solved over the same period in 2019.
“I think COVID played a role earlier in the year, where we had a significant amount of people out,” Shea said, noting that in the early days of the pandemic when many officers became sick, entire teams of detectives filled in for other squads, often in unfamiliar neighborhoods. The clearance rate improved from 26.3% later in the year, he said, but still fell well short of 2019’s level.
Critics of the police have questioned whether officers, chafed by the summer’s unrest and the national debate over law enforcement, began responding more slowly to calls. But some experts say much of the department’s low clearance rate is tied to difficulties caused by the pandemic — officers cannot interact as widely with the public, and most people, including criminals, are wearing masks.
“It’s convenient that everyone is wearing masks now,” said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. “Obviously that adds to the anonymity aspect of being a criminal.” But, he added, the factors of the pandemic and the backlash against the department — budget cuts, shorter staffing and sick colleagues — had probably hurt officers’ morale.
“Cops are kind of tiptoeing around. They’re not as proactive, they’re not as aggressive,” Herrmann said. “They’re not doing their job as well as they normally do.”
The number of hate crimes reported to the police also decreased sharply, with complaints down about 40% in 2020 after several years of steady increases. Much of the decline can be attributed to a 47% drop in reported anti-Semitic incidents.
But despite the decline, officials contended with a rise in incidents against Asian Americans that they said were linked to the pandemic. The department began tracking coronavirus-related hate crimes this year, covering incidents in which a person was targeted because of bias connected to the virus.
So far, the authorities have tracked 25 virus-related crimes this year, a large number of them involving victims of Asian descent. (The department has also recorded 21 incidents as “anti-other” incidents, some of which they say may involve virus-related anti-Asian crimes.) In August, the Police Department created an anti-Asian hate crime task force to address the increase in attacks.

Pierre Cardin, the visionary designer who clothed the elite but also transformed the business of fashion, reaching the masses by affixing his name to an outpouring of merchandise ranging from off-the-rack apparel to bath towels, has died in France. He was 98.
His death was confirmed Tuesday by the French Academy of Fine Arts. He died at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, just outside Paris, his family said, according to Agence France-Presse.
“Fashion is not enough,” Cardin once told Eugenia Sheppard, the American newspaper columnist and fashion critic. “I don’t want to be just a designer.”
He was never just that. He dressed the famous — artists, political luminaries, tastemakers and members of the haute bourgeoisie — but he was also a licensing pioneer, a merchant to the general public with his name on a cornucopia of products, none too exalted or too humble to escape his avid eye.
There were bubble dresses and aviator jumpsuits, fragrances and automobiles, ashtrays and even pickle jars. Planting his flag on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris, he proceeded to turn the country’s fashion establishment on its head, reproducing fashions for mass, ready-to-wear consumption and dealing a blow to the elitism that had governed the Parisian couture.
In a career of more than three-quarters of a century, Cardin remained a futurist.
“He had this wonderful embrace of technology and was in love with the notion of progress,” said Andrew Bolton, head curator at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
As the space age dawned, Cardin dressed men, and women, in spacesuits. In 1969, NASA commissioned him to create an interpretation of a spacesuit, a signal inspiration in his later work.
“The dresses I prefer,” he said at the time, “are those I invent for a life that does not yet exist.”
His designs were influenced by geometric shapes, often rendered in fabrics like silver foil, paper and brightly colored vinyl. The materials would shape the dominant aesthetic of the early 1960s. It was a new silhouette that “denied the body’s natural contours and somehow seemed asexual,” Bolton said.
“His ability to sculpt fabric with an architectural sensibility was his real signature,” he added.
Cardin drew inspiration from everywhere, be it the pagodas he visited in China, op art painting or automotive design.
“I’m always inspired by something outside, not by the body itself,” he told The New York Times in 1985. Clothing, he said, was meant “to give the body its shape, the way a glass gives shape to the water poured into it.”
Yet his men’s ready-to-wear designs, introduced in 1960, were decidedly more faithful to the body’s outlines. Built on narrow shoulders, high armholes and a fitted waist, they were streamlined and somewhat severe, dispensing in some cases with traditional collars in favor of the simple banded Nehru, a namesake adaptation of the style worn by the Indian prime minister.
Those suits were slow to catch on in the United States — until the Beatles appeared in knockoff versions on the Ed Sullivan television show in 1966. Nehru-mania ensued.
Cardin had laid the foundations for a global empire by the late 1950s. At a time when France was fashion’s uncontested epicenter, he was bringing his designs to Moscow, Tokyo and Beijing, doing more to erode international boundaries than any designer of the day.
In 1957, he became the first to forge business ties with Japan and within two years he was selling his fashions there. He sensed a vast, untapped market for fashionable clothing in Central Europe and Asia, and by the end of the 1960s he was offering his designs for mass production in China. In 1983, Cardin became the first French couturier to penetrate the Soviet Union: His designs were manufactured in Soviet factories and sold under the Cardin label in Cardin boutiques in Moscow.
He conceived of himself above all as a prolific ideas man, relishing his role as the overseer of a realm that encompassed clothing accessories, furniture, household products and fragrances sold through some 800 licensees in more than 140 countries on five continents.
“I wash with my own soap,” he once boasted. “I wear my own perfume, go to bed with my own sheets, have my own food products. I live on me.”
Chocolates, pens, cigarettes, frying pans, alarm clocks and cassette tapes — all bore the Cardin logo, as did shoes, lingerie, blouses, neckwear, wallets, belts and, more recently, an Android tablet. By the mid-1980s, Cardin stood at the helm of a marketing organization and network of licensees paying him royalties of 5% to 12%, a stream of income that earned him the unofficial title “the Napoleon of licensors.”
“I was born an artiste,” he told The Times in 1987, “but I am a businessman.”
Not content to preside over an omnipresent global brand, Cardin turned his rapacious attention to theaters and motels, media and even restaurants, in 1981 buying Maxim’s, once the world’s most famous restaurant, a landmark of the belle époque on the Rue Royale in Paris.
Two years later, as part of an international expansion, Maxim’s opened its first branch in Beijing, prompting Cardin to exult, with his sense of a limitless future, “If I can put a Maxim’s in Beijing, I can put a Maxim’s on the moon.”
Artistic Ambitions
Pietro Costante Cardin was born July 7, 1922, in San Biagio di Callalta, Italy, near Venice, where his parents were vacationing. He grew up in Saint-Étienne, in east-central France, where his father was a wine merchant.
Pierre’s impatience with convention asserted itself early. In his early teens he deflected his father’s efforts to induct him into the family trade. In deference to his evident artistic ambitions, his parents eventually enrolled him in architectural studies at the school of Saint-Étienne.
Cardin, who was captivated by the worlds of theater and ballet, first dreamed of acting, but was later drawn to designing costumes and sets for the stage.
In 1936, he left for Vichy. By 14, he was assisting a local tailor named Manby. Impatient to embark on a fashion career, he was 17 and preparing to head to Paris when World War II erupted, and he enlisted. During the war he took an administrative position in the French Red Cross, a job he later credited with fostering a latent talent for tallying balance sheets.
He returned to Paris in 1945, intent on establishing himself as a designer. He apprenticed at several prominent fashion houses, among them Paquin and Elsa Schiaparelli. From 1946-50, he designed coats and suits for Christian Dior. During that period he continued to indulge his passion for theater and cinema, designing costumes, based on the sketches of Christian Bérard, for the Jean Cocteau film “Beauty and the Beast.”
Toward the end of his couture apprenticeship, he alighted on an opportunity to found his own fashion house when a theatrical costumer with an attic workshop in the Madeleine neighborhood shuttered his business. Cardin moved in and began designing under his own name, buying additional floors of the building each year until he owned it in its entirety.
His first collection for the House of Cardin, established in 1950, featured suits and coats modeled in heavyweight wool with emphatic details and the geometric shapes and cutouts that were to become hallmarks of his collections. They included, most memorably, his barrel coat with an oversized wool collar in 1955 and his balloon dresses in 1959.
Defying Tradition
In 1958, Cardin was chosen as professor emeritus at Bunka Fashion College in Japan, an association that afforded him the opportunity to forge business relations with the Japanese. On returning to Paris, he created his first ready-to-wear collection, which made its debut in 1959 in the department store Le Printemps.
Cardin’s impetuous departure from couture tradition earned him the ire of his peers and expulsion from the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture Parisienne. But he remained unmoved. Arguing that French manufacturers were already copying his creations, he asked, “Why shouldn’t we run the show?” He was reinstated some years later after other designers began to recognize the potential profitability of ready-to-wear.
In 1960 he defied the Chambre Syndicale once more, designing a men’s ready-to-wear collection of slim-fitted suits. By the mid-'60s, he had elongated and slimmed down his men’s silhouette, adding low-slung trousers fitted at the waist and flared at the cuffs. Cardin, whose high-profile clients included Cecil Beaton, Yul Brynner and Gregory Peck, argued that the style “brings out the best in a man’s figure.” During that period, his space-age inflected women’s couture was widely copied, generating knockoffs around the world.
By the late ’60s, he was offering women trouser suits and maxi skirts.
“The eye is ready for it,” he told Marilyn Bender of The Times in October 1969, “now that pants have been accepted.”
Cardin’s ventures that year extended to automotive designs and home furnishings. A Simca with a Cardin-designed interior was presented at the Paris auto show. He made good on his vow to place the Cardin imprimatur on a total environment, creating a plastic modular desk that could be disassembled and then refit like a puzzle into a cube. A new chair design was made using foam rubber covered in vinyl; it changed, accordion like, from a couch to a child’s chair.
In 1970 he bought a faded Paris nightclub, Théâtre des Ambassadeurs, on the Champs-Élysées, gutting and rebuilding it and turning it into L’Espace Cardin, where he presented his fashions and showed art works, movies and contemporary plays.
He neither boasted of his protean ambitions nor apologized for them.
“I don’t play cards, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I don’t like sports,” he told Bender. “I just work. It’s marvelous. It amuses me.”
His willful, sometimes autocratic manner and gaunt good looks contributed to his magnetism. Writing in The Times, Bender described a pair of “blue eyes set above high cheekbones, thinning brown hair that curled most into the collar of his green shirt, and parenthesis lines on either side of his mouth,” all of which lent him “a melancholy air,” she wrote, “reminiscent of the late Aly Khan.”
The ever-vigilant custodian of his own legend, Cardin did nothing to dispel the notion that actress Jeanne Moreau had succumbed to his Lothario charms. Moreau herself professed her passion for Cardin to Judy Klemesrud of The Times in the fall of 1970. On meeting him at a fitting in his Paris salon in 1964, “it was love at first sight,” she recalled. “I bought every dress in his collection.”
During those years, Cardin also maintained a close relationship with Andre Oliver, his main assistant for more than 40 years, who died in Paris in 1993.
In his atelier, Cardin viewed the female body as an abstraction, a hanger of sorts.
“I think of the dress,” he announced baldly. “The woman doesn’t matter.”
He forsook his hard-edge aesthetic for a time in the 1970s, incorporating draped fabrics, pleating, quilting and asymmetrical collars and hems into his designs.
His couture collection of 1986 featured entire dresses made from billowing scarves. Bernadine Morris, the Times fashion critic at the time, deemed the collection “still quite inventive,” but dismissed its various concepts as “scattered like buckshot, so they do not come together in a comprehensive statement.” Two years later she referred to a collection of short coats with wired hems as “histrionic.”
Keeping the Name Alive
By the late 1980s and early ’90s, Cardin was revisiting his fashion archives to issue variations of 1960s space-age designs. His far-flung ventures fused the commercial and theatrical. He staged extravagant shows in Moscow’s Red Square in 1991 and a decade later in the Gobi Desert. Yet his reputation as a couturier was diminishing. By 1994, he was showing his seasonal collections primarily to a small circle of clients and journalists.
Cardin thrived nonetheless as a cultural omnivore whose eclectic interests extended from architecture to interior design and to the performance arts. As early as 1970, he told Sheppard, the fashion critic, that “I like seeing people looking at TV, seeing avant-garde plays.” Referring to choreographer Paul Taylor, he added, “I loved the Japanese marionettes from Osaka and adore the Taylor ballets.”
His miscellaneous passions also extended to the Rolling Stones and the Doors, and the geometric Vasarely paintings that inspired his prints on wool.
“If it’s little dresses people want, I can do them with my eyes closed,” he said. “But I am above all of that. My life is on an intellectual level much higher than that of La Couture.”
He produced musicals and dance, including for the Pilobolus company. At the same time, he established himself as an impresario for experimental arts groups in Paris, showing their work at L’Espace Cardin. L’Espace was the scene of Juno and Avos, a Soviet rock opera that Cardin imported to Paris in 1983.
By 1980, he had contracted licenses for matches, sardine can labels, aprons, pickle jars and clothing, establishing 500 sales outlets in France alone. He bought Maxim’s in 1981, his acquisition exciting fears among Parisians that he would exploit that fabled Gallic institution.
Through it all, Cardin remained unflappable. In the next century Maxim’s would still exist, he insisted, but “who will be remembered, Yves Saint Laurent or Pierre Cardin?” In June 2011 he celebrated his 30th anniversary as the owner of Maxim’s, which some call his second licensing empire. Products under the Maxim’s label include foie gras, Champagne and caviar.
Unlike many designers today, whose businesses are operated by global conglomerates, Cardin had no partners.
“I’m the financier, the banker and the creator,” he said. “I’ve always done what I wanted because I’ve never had a boss.”
He cautiously believed in hard assets, converting his income from licensing into land and buildings, including properties in Paris, a villa and boutique near Cannes, a palazzo in Venice and holdings in Barcelona, Milan, Rome and Brussels. He bought the castle formerly occupied by the Marquis de Sade in Lacoste, France, where he established a summer music festival. He invested in properties near Cannes, including, most memorably, the Bubble Palace, so called for its system of interconnected terra-cotta domes.
Times have changed since the international jet set flocked to Maxim’s. In 2016, he was asking roughly 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) for the rights to his licensing empire.
“If you don’t have the money, then don’t buy it,” he told a reporter for Bloomberg at the time. “Nobody’s forcing you to. I can afford to die without selling it.”
Cardin, who made his mark on the 20th century with prophetic, technologically inspired designs, lived to see his fashions reappraised. His collections served as the inspiration for designers like Gareth Pugh, Simon Porte Jacquemus, and to some degree, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel. That he remained a force in the 21st century was attested to by Lady Gaga, who once wore one of his metallic chain-mail creations on the concert stage.
Intent on keeping that name alive, Cardin returned to the fashion world with a splash in September 2011, unveiling a spring collection replete with his signature unisex astronaut-style jumpsuits, rubber jewelry and neon, architecturally inspired minidresses.
In 2014 he opened a museum in the Marais district of Paris to display his work, calling it the Past-Present-Future Museum.
In the summer of 2017, the Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island, hosted a runway show at the Breakers mansion, the 90-piece spectacular serving as an introduction to “Pierre Cardin: 70 Years of Innovation,” highlighting the designer’s most admired and recognizable work.
“His innovations are still relevant,” said Trudy Cox, the chief executive of the Preservation Society, adding that the eight-month exhibition attracted well over 100,000 visitors.
Intent on burnishing his legacy, in fall 2017 Cardin opened a new boutique on the Rue Royale next door to the original Maxim’s. The styles were familiar but rendered with a brash, contemporary spin. Metal studs lent a touch of punk to a black wool minidress; a similar look featured circular cutouts that evoked his signature futurism.
“I made this line for young people,” Cardin said at the time. “It’s quite entertaining.”
As he revisited his past couture landmarks, Cardin all the while declined to repeat himself outright. Ever venturesome, he insisted: “I design for tomorrow. I never look backward.”

In February 2019, Nijeer Parks was accused of shoplifting candy and trying to hit a police officer with a car at a Hampton Inn in Woodbridge, New Jersey. He had been identified by police using facial recognition software, even though he was 30 miles away at the time of the incident.
Parks spent 10 days in jail and paid around $5,000 to defend himself. In November 2019, the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.
Parks, 33, is now suing the police, the prosecutor and the city of Woodbridge for false arrest, false imprisonment and violation of his civil rights.
He is the third person known to be falsely arrested based on a bad facial recognition match. In all three cases, the people mistakenly identified by the technology have been Black men.
Facial recognition technology is known to have flaws. In 2019, a national study of over 100 facial recognition algorithms found that they did not work as well on Black and Asian faces. Two other Black men — Robert Williams and Michael Oliver, both of whom live in the Detroit area — were also arrested for crimes they did not commit based on bad facial recognition matches. Like Parks, Oliver filed a lawsuit against the city over the wrongful arrest.
Nathan Freed Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who believes that police should stop using face recognition technology, said the three cases demonstrate “how this technology disproportionately harms the Black community.”
“Multiple people have now come forward about being wrongfully arrested because of this flawed and privacy-invading surveillance technology,” Wessler said.
He worries that there have been other arrests and even mistaken convictions that have not been uncovered.
Law enforcement often defends the use of facial recognition, despite its flaws, by saying that it is used only as a clue in a case and will not lead directly to an arrest. But Parks’ experience is another example of an arrest based almost solely on a suggested match by the technology.
The crime
On a Saturday in January 2019, two police officers showed up at a Hampton Inn in Woodbridge, after receiving a report about a man stealing snacks from the gift shop.
The alleged shoplifter — a Black man, nearly 6 feet tall, wearing a black jacket — was visiting a Hertz office in the hotel lobby, trying to get the rental agreement for a gray Dodge Challenger extended. The officers confronted him and he apologized, according to the police report. He said he would pay for the snacks and gave the officers a Tennessee driver’s license.
When the officers checked the license, they discovered it was fraudulent. According to a police report, one of the officers spotted a “big bag of suspected marijuana” in the man’s pocket. They tried to handcuff him. That’s when the man ran, losing a shoe on the way to his rental car, police said.
As he drove off, the man hit a parked police car and a column in front of the hotel, police said. One of the officers said he had to jump out of the way to avoid getting hit. The rental car was later found abandoned in a parking lot a mile away.
The match
A detective in the Woodbridge Police Department sent the photo from the fake driver’s license to state agencies that had access to face recognition technology, according to a police report.
The next day, state investigators said they had a facial recognition match: Parks, who lived in Paterson, 30 miles away, and worked at a grocery store. The detective compared Parks’ New Jersey state ID to the fake Tennessee driver’s license and agreed it was the same person. After a Hertz employee confirmed that the Tennessee driver’s license photo was of the shoplifter, police issued a warrant for Parks’ arrest.
“I don’t think he looks like me,” Parks said. “The only thing we have in common is the beard.”
Parks’ mistaken arrest was first reported by NJ Advance Media, which said that the facial recognition app Clearview AI was used in the case, based on a claim in Parks’ lawsuit. Parks’ lawyer, Daniel Sexton, said he had inferred that Clearview AI was used, given media reports about facial recognition in New Jersey, but now believes he was mistaken.
Clearview AI is a facial recognition tool that uses billions of photos scraped from the public web, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram. Clearview AI’s founder, Hoan Ton-That, said officers affiliated with the state agencies where information was analyzed in the case, known as fusion centers, involved in the case were not using his company’s app at that time.
According to the police report, the match in this case was to a license photo, which would reside in a government database, to which Clearview AI does not currently have access. The law enforcement involved in making the match — the New York State Intelligence Center, New Jersey’s Regional Operations Intelligence Center and two state investigators — did not respond to inquiries about which facial recognition system was used.
In January, after a New York Times story about Clearview AI, New Jersey’s attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, put a moratorium on Clearview’s use by police and announced an investigation into “this product or products like it.” A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said New Jersey’s Division of Criminal Justice is still evaluating the use of facial recognition products in the state, and that the development of a policy governing their use is ongoing.
‘I was afraid.’
After police arrested Parks, he was held for 10 days at the Middlesex County Corrections Center. New Jersey’s no-bail system uses an algorithm that evaluates the defendant’s risk rather than money to determine whether a defendant can be released before trial.
A decade ago, Parks was arrested twice and incarcerated for selling drugs. He was released in 2016. The public safety assessment score he received, which would have taken his past convictions into account, was high enough that he was not released after his first hearing. His mother and fiancée hired a private attorney, who was able to get him out of jail and into a pretrial monitoring program.
His prior history with the criminal justice system is what made this incident so scary, he said, because this would have been his third felony, meaning he was at risk of a long sentence. When the prosecutor offered a plea deal, he almost took it even though he was innocent.
“I sat down with my family and discussed it,” Parks said. “I was afraid to go to trial. I knew I would get 10 years if I lost.”
Parks was able to get proof from Western Union that he had been sending money at a pharmacy in Haledon, New Jersey, more than 30 miles away, when the incident happened. At his last court hearing, he told the judge he was willing to go to trial to defend himself. But a few months later, his case was dismissed.
Robert Hubner, the chief of the Woodbridge Police Department, declined to comment on the case because of the pending lawsuit but said his department had not been served the complaint. The Middlesex County prosecutor’s office also declined to comment.
Parks’ lawsuit over the wrongful arrest does not yet ask for damages.
“I was locked up for no reason,” Parks said. “I’ve seen it happen to other people. I’ve seen it on the news. I just never thought it would happen to me. It was a very scary ordeal.”

‘I Am So Lost’: Black Homeowners Struggle to Get Insurers to Pay Claims

When a pipe burst and flooded her home in 2018, Deonne Burgess knew the cleanup would be messy. What she didn’t expect was the scrutiny from State Farm, her home insurance provider.
A claims adjuster from State Farm sought to strike as many items as possible off a list of repairs from her home in Inglewood, a predominantly Black neighborhood in Los Angeles, Burgess said. The adjuster argued that State Farm should not have to pay to replace a door that was so damaged by the flooding that it no longer closed.
Burgess, the global payroll director of the Wonderful Co., which makes packaged foods like pomegranate juice and pistachio nuts, began to think that she was being treated with extra suspicion because she is Black. She told State Farm it was unlikely that policyholders in a white neighborhood would receive the same treatment. “It was right after the Malibu fires, and what I said was: ‘No one in Malibu would have to justify things like this,’” she said.
Burgess’ assertions “are without merit,” said Roszell Gadson, a State Farm spokesman. “State Farm is committed to a diverse and inclusive environment, where all customers are treated with fairness, respect and dignity. ”
Burgess had no way of proving that her experiences with the State Farm adjuster amounted to racism. After all, the same insurer paid out an auto insurance claim for her BMW 5 Series sedan, which was also ruined by the flood; a different set of people handled it and there was not much to argue about. But Mark Young, the vendor hired by State Farm who arranged for her walls and floors to be repaired, and Leonard Redway, the plumber whom Burgess hired to fix a broken pipe, said that Burgess was being treated worse than their white customers. Both of them are also Black.
Redway said claimants in predominantly white, wealthy neighborhoods generally had a much easier time getting insurers to cover the costs of repairs. “If I were to be in 90210, it’s almost like it’s an open check,” he said, referring to the wealthy Beverly Hills ZIP code. “Sometimes the adjusters don’t even come out to look at it.”
Allegations of racism are often tough to prove, but especially so in homeowners’ insurance, where insurers have a lot of discretion and don’t always provide detailed explanations for why claims are denied. Since company representatives often verify claims and assess the credibility of a claimant through home visits, face-to-face interactions and other measures, there can be room for bias.
While claims disputes are hardly uncommon in the industry, many Black customers say they feel treated unfairly because of their race — something that Jeff Major, a Manhattan-based public adjuster who haggles with insurance companies on behalf of policyholders over their claims, has witnessed in his line of work. “You can actually see a difference between a Caucasian family and an African American, Hispanic or Asian family,” Major said. “It’s sort of known. It’s not spoken about. It’s a culture.”
A tight grip on data
Insurers keep a tight lid on their policy sales and claims data. They have long argued that the size and timing of payouts, and the neighborhoods where claims are registered and addressed, are proprietary information, and sharing that data would hurt their ability to compete. They guard it so zealously that even most regulators don’t have detailed information about how insurers assess individual claims.
Michael Barry, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, said that claims data was private because payouts were considered “losses” and revealing them would put insurers “at a competitive disadvantage to each other.”
Where data is publicly available, such as auto insurance, researchers have found that policies discriminate against Black drivers by charging them higher premiums. But homeowners’ insurance has been opaque.
It can be hard to compel insurers to part with data, partly because they are regulated by states and not the federal government. For example, federal laws that outlawed redlining for banks after the civil rights movement don’t apply equally to insurers. And as of 2014, 17 states had no bans on race-based discrimination by insurers, a group of university researchers found.
In late September, the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance, whose members include top executives from the nation’s biggest insurers, voted down a proposal to study racial bias in the industry over concerns that the study would muddy the distinction between the legitimate discretion insurers have to question claimants’ assertions and unfair bias.
Distrust and depositions
To assess the veracity of their customers’ claims, insurers send adjusters to meet face to face with claimants, giving companies wide discretion in determining the extent of the damage and which claims to label as potentially fraudulent.
“Anytime there’s a lot of discretion there’s room for that discretion to be affected by implicit or explicit bias,” said Tom Baker, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor who studied insurance payouts to victims of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Using data obtained from the victims, he found that Latino claimants faced significantly longer delays in receiving money from insurers than white claimants did.
Lisa Thompson, a Black homeowner in Toledo, Ohio, had been staying with her daughter while the roof of her home was being repaired when thieves broke into that house, stripping it bare and taking her water heater, appliances and wrenching off part of her roof. Thompson filed a claim with her insurer, Allstate.
An adjuster sent by the company accused her of orchestrating the theft, Thompson said. To pursue her claim, Allstate representatives told her, she would have to come to the offices of a law firm hired by the company for a deposition. On Dec. 9, 2019, Thompson spent nearly four hours answering questions about her employment history, her family and her time living in the house.
Allstate sent her a letter on June 8 saying it was still investigating her claim and asked for another 180 days to complete the process. Shortly afterward, it canceled her policy, saying its investigator had determined that Thompson did not actually qualify as a “resident” of her home, because she had been staying with her daughter. But Thompson only found out that her claim had been denied when The New York Times contacted Allstate in November to ask about her case. The insurer had sent the letter notifying her of the denied claim to the address where it had ruled Thompson did not live.
“We apologize for your client not receiving this correspondence,” an Allstate representative later wrote to a lawyer who is helping Thompson with her claim. Her house remains uninhabitable. She is filing a discrimination claim against Allstate with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission.
Nicholas Nottoli, an Allstate spokesman, said the claim was denied “based on facts after a thorough investigation.” He added that the company had no record of its adjuster accusing Thompson of helping the thieves and that “race is not a factor in pricing, underwriting or claim settlements.”
‘I am so lost’
Young, the vendor hired by State Farm to arrange repairs to Burgess’ home, has seen insurers lowballing other Black customers and lobbied on their behalf — even though his Los Angeles-based company, Valley Green, which specializes in fixing damaged homes, depends on insurers for business.
He fought on behalf of Langston Phillips, who almost lost his house during a fight with his insurer, Pacific Specialty. Three years ago, Phillips’ kitchen had flooded after a pipe burst, ruining portions of his three-bedroom home in Inglewood. An adjuster from Pacific Specialty determined that the company owed Phillips just over $11,000 in repair costs. Phillips’ contractor said his home needed far more extensive repairs.
Pacific Specialty asked Young to take a look. Young determined that the repairs would cost more than $33,000. A battle ensued, with Young siding with Phillips even though he had been hired by Pacific Specialty. Because of the dispute, even the sum Pacific Specialty agreed to pay Phillips reached him in increments, forcing him to move to a single hotel room with his two children while he waited for his kitchen to be rebuilt. On a particularly bad day he emailed a Pacific Specialty representative, pleading for clarity on when some of that money would arrive. “I AM SO LOST,” he wrote.
“We aim to pay claims as quickly and fairly as possible to bring the insured back to their pre-loss living standard,” said Kara Holzwarth, Pacific Specialty’s general counsel. “We find that water leak losses can be fraught with disagreement.” She said Pacific Specialty’s treatment of Phillips had nothing to do with his race.
After two years of fighting, Phillips gave up. Worried about losing the house, he moved back in and began to work weekends to pay for the repairs — replacing cabinets, flooring and plumbing — that he was doing himself. “I am bone tired,” he said.
Young, meanwhile, has noticed that most insurers are not willing to work with him. He is now suing 17 insurance companies, one by one, for discrimination, after the companies refused to add him to their vendor lists. He reached a confidential settlement in his suit against Travelers and has complaints pending against others.
“I’m the only one rattling the cages,” he said, “saying why won’t you give minority-owned vendors any work?”

The last time I set foot inside a restaurant was Wednesday, March 11. I sat alone at a narrow counter in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and ate hot, gilded pupusas off a paper plate, spooning curtido — cabbage and carrots stung by chiles and vinegar — out of a communal jar. From where I live, the subway ride took me an hour and a half each way, longer than the meal itself, but it was worth it.
The next day the mayor declared a state of emergency. Within a week, the governor had ordered restaurants to close, allowing only takeout and delivery. News came that a chef I’d talked with a month before had died of the virus. By the end of April, close to 6 million restaurant workers across the country had lost their jobs, about half the industry’s employees and more than a quarter of all Americans who had lost work. To date more than 110,000 restaurants, one out of every six in the country, have closed, and more than 2 million jobs have not yet been recovered.
I used to be a restaurant critic, writing the Hungry City column in these pages. For now, that life is gone — the least of losses in this terrible pandemic, but still I mourn. Long before I wrote about restaurants, they were shimmers I chased along the sidewalk. They led me places; they welcomed me in.
How do we come to know worlds outside our own? When I was a kid in Honolulu, we clipped coupons and mostly ate at home. So I remember it still, the faintly illicit thrill of lunch after church on Sundays, spinning the great moon of a lazy susan at Duk Kee and discovering the miracle of cornbread — was it bread? was it cake? — at Yum Yum Tree.
On rare nights, my parents met friends at Columbia Inn, a diner on Kapiolani Boulevard run by the descendants of Okinawan immigrants. That’s where I first learned luxury: maraschino cherries, the reddest red I’d ever seen.
It felt opulent, too, to be led to a table saved just for us and to eat food we’d had no part in making, borne on plates spiraled so effortlessly up the waitress’ arm, they almost looked as if they were levitating.
To my dad, who grew up above a pub in Liverpool, England, restaurants any fancier were places to fear. And for years, whenever I stepped into a gleaming dining room to the clink of wineglasses, I felt like a spy infiltrating enemy territory — another, deeper thrill.
A restaurant can be a gateway, an escape, a promise of another life.
Once I left home, restaurants were an education in the exotica of mainland America. A soup bowl made out of bread. Oozy Kentucky Derby pie with fistfuls of chocolate chips sunk into the crust. Beer lapped out of a trumpet-mouthed glass a yard long.
At times, restaurants were salvation. When I was a broke graduate student who barely knew how to cook, the one Indian place in town kept me alive. Every Sunday I would circle the all-you-eat buffet — could it really have been only $5? how did the owners survive? — scavenging rounds of charred naan and trying to eat enough to last me the whole week. Afterward I’d stumble home and lie down in a daze, so full it hurt.
Later I worked in restaurants and gained a new language, of 86ed (nixed) and marry-the-ketchup (pouring one half-empty bottle into another); of burns, slashes and fingers with the ends shorn off, held above the head to slow the bleeding on the way to the hospital; of diners who refused to tip because they didn’t “believe in it.”
I was a hostess, and not particularly good at my job — there were nights when I saw in every customer a latent tyrant — but nevertheless, at the end of the shift, the servers gave me my cut. I’ll never forget the unexpected weight of those dirty beat-up dollar bills in my hand, and the power.
I learned New York City and all its contradictions through its restaurants, trawling the cash-only hand-pulled noodle shops on Eldridge Street in Chinatown, and sneaking into Jean-Georges at lunch hour for what was then a $28 two-course prix fixe, which ended with a cart wheeled to our table carrying a jar of marshmallows, wobbly strips that the waiter snipped apart with shears and presented with silver tongs.
New York was smoke in my hair from Korean barbecue, the Bubble Yum smack of Inca Kola at a Peruvian rotisserie in the Rockaways, the line for tacos de cabeza (head) and lengua (tongue) by the chain-link fence of a transit lot in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and the long valley of the shadow of the elevated No. 7 line in Queens, where every cart had its secrets and its claim to an essential corner of the city.
It was Annisa in the West Village, where my husband and I went for New Year’s Eve like amateurs, newlyweds gawking at the edges of the high-end life; where I finally understood that food was an art form, capable of transcendence. It was Roman’s in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where the menu was different every night but always exactly what we wanted to eat, and where we had a table the servers called ours.
It was Taste of Persia NYC, a takeout counter squeezed into the window of a Flatiron district pizzeria, selling fesenjan (walnut pomegranate stew) alongside triangles of pepperoni, and Indo Java, an Indonesian grocery in Elmhurst, Queens, with a lone foldout table in the back and lunch only on Tuesdays. It was Weekender Billiard, a Bhutanese snooker hall in neighboring Woodside, where young expats in Led Zeppelin T-shirts chalked their cues between bites of ema datse: green chiles, half-gutted but still garlanded with seeds — the most dangerous part — under melted squares of white American cheese.
When I began reviewing restaurants, I traveled farther, and the city opened itself up to me. To know New York, you had to take a subway and then a bus and then walk 20 blocks into the freezing wind. I measured my life in track changes and delays.
And yes, it was the best gig, and not just because of all I ate. What is food without the story of its making; what is a city without its people?
I found my teachers at roti shops and momo trucks. They were the tamale ladies opening their coolers after Spanish Mass, and the owner of the Sri Lankan restaurant on Staten Island who chauffeured me and my friends back to the ferry terminal himself, regaling us with tales of his former life driving taxis. “I was mugged!” he said.
This was my New York: the bare-bones Nigerian storefront (now shuttered) in Morrisania, in the Bronx, with a staff of one — a woman who came out of the kitchen to deliver the food she’d just cooked, then reached out and rolled up the sleeves of my sweater, so they wouldn’t fall into the plates. And the tiny Guyanese spot (now shuttered) in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where the chef, when I told her that her restaurant would appear in The New York Times, started to cry.
She said, “I worked so hard.”
So many of the restaurants I’ve loved were precarious to begin with, held together by duct tape and will. I know that it is the height of privilege for me to say, from the safe aerie of my sheltering-at-home, that I miss them, when the people who run them are the ones suffering.
But I do miss them, and the people who make them possible, and my city.
In his recent book, “The Disappearance of Rituals: A Topology of the Present,” philosopher Byung-Chul Han writes that rituals “are to time what a home is to space: they render time habitable .” Now time sprawls, drags, does what it wants.
For me, the ritual of a meal at a restaurant was an anchor to the world, what Han calls “community without communication” — a way to belong without saying a word, subsumed in the clamor of other lives.
I didn’t know quite what to do when, a few weeks ago, a friend asked me to a new Filipino place on First Avenue. We were supposed to get takeout, then picnic in the park at a discreet distance, but it was pouring rain, so we perched uneasily at the very edge of the outdoor dining tent, wind whipping the nylon walls. A heater glowed but shed no heat.
We took turns taking off our masks to eat, and slowly I realized how familiar this was — a throwback to wintry nights clutching salty-hot Xinjiang-style skewers in foil under the Brooklyn Bridge, or unwrapping tacos in a gas-station parking lot, salsa leaking through my fingers. It was scrappy, improvisational, making do.
Mighty trucks blustered by, unseen. Cyclists barreled down within inches of the table. This was New York, life shuddering all around us, and the food kept coming.

AMSTERDAM — Many know Ulay as the man who walked into Marina Abramovic’s performance “The Artist Is Present” at the Museum of Modern Art a decade ago and brought her to tears. That two-minute encounter between the former collaborators and lovers during her three-month sit-in at the New York museum has been viewed more than 18 million times on YouTube.
Ulay, who met Abramovic in 1974, was her most important collaborator, and the two worked and lived together for a dozen years. Or, as she put it in an interview, “He was the big love story in my life.”
But Ulay, who was a conceptual photographer and a performance artist before and after his work with Abramovic, had a powerful oeuvre of his own, as a sprawling retrospective at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam attests.
A recent coronavirus lockdown in the Netherlands has forced the museum to close until at least Jan. 20, but the show, “Ulay Was Here,” is scheduled to run through April 18, and could be extended, a spokeswoman for the Stedelijk said.
The exhibition was organized in consultation with Ulay as he was dying from lymphatic cancer last year and in the first months of 2020, his widow, Lena Pislak, said in a telephone interview from their home in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
“Till the last, we were working,” she said. “He was really enjoying the process.”
Ulay died in March, at age 76, and Pislak said she and Hana Ostan Ozbolt, the director of the Ulay Foundation, worked with the Stedelijk to finish the show.
“It was a good healing process for us,” Pislak said. “He would have been so proud.”
The story of Abramovic and Ulay is a rare case in art history in which a female artist vastly eclipses her male counterpart. Today, Abramovic is world famous, while Ulay is little known. That leaves many with the impression that Ulay was only a subsidiary figure in her world.
“That’s a picture we wanted to correct,” said Hripsime Visser, a photography curator at the Stedelijk, who oversaw the exhibition of about 200 artworks. “That period of 12 years was really a collaboration between the two of them, but all the themes that were developed with Marina were themes he was already working with before he knew her.”
Born Frank Uwe Laysiepen in Germany during World War II, Ulay struggled with his identity as a German, and a man. He moved to Amsterdam in 1969 to find a more countercultural, experimental atmosphere, where he could walk the streets in half-drag — feminine on one side, masculine on the other — and create gender-bending self-portraits.
“There were different scenes here that he couldn’t find in provincial Germany, where he grew up,” Rein Wolfs, the Stedelijk’s director, said. “He found the queer scene, the trans scene, scenes asking identity questions about ‘Who am I?’ This is what you see very much reflected in his early work.”
His primary medium was photography, and his tool was a Polaroid camera, Visser explained. He explored ideas using the instant camera, making composites of Polaroid images out of male and female body parts to create hermaphroditic characters.
He found a home base for his experimental work at De Appel, a contemporary art center in Amsterdam, becoming “one of the driving forces when it came to promoting performance art and time-based media,” Wolfs said.
It was through De Appel that Ulay met Abramovic on Nov. 30, 1974, which happened to be their shared birthday. He picked her up at the airport to drive her to the gallery, where she presented a performance in which, naked, she cut the shape of a star into her stomach.
They immediately recognized each other as kindred spirits, Abramovic said.
“He finds his female side in her, so he no longer needs to question his own female side,” Visser explained.
Their work together was often centered on the interdependency and tension of intimate relationships. Abramovic said the piece that best represented their romance and collaboration was “Rest Energy,” from 1980. In that piece, Ulay holds a bow and arrow aimed at Abramovic’s heart; microphones pasted to both their chests allow the audience to hear their increasingly rapid heartbeats.
“This piece is the shortest piece we ever did, 4 minutes and 20 seconds,” she said. “It seemed like a lifetime. This is a very symbolic work for us, based on total trust. What’s important in this piece is the tension. You can only do this work with total love and trust.”
Abramovic described their period of working together as “nine years of incredible love and happiness, and three years that were very difficult.” They finished it in their signature performative way with a three-month performance-art work on the Great Wall of China, walking toward each other from opposite ends of the 13,000-mile structure. When they met in the middle, they broke up.
“Ulay Was Here” includes a scenic 15-minute excerpt from the end of the hourlong video they made to document the journey, “The Lovers: The Great Wall Walk,” closing the three-room section devoted to their collaboration. The next room starts with works from two years later, when Ulay returned to making solo work after a career pause.
In the early 1990s, Ulay returned to photographic work, to produce what he called “photograms.” For these, he would turn a gallery space into a kind of darkroom, place a piece of photosensitive paper on the floor, ask subjects to lie on the paper, and then briefly flood the room with light.
His 2012 “Sweet Water Salt Water” is a series of Polaroids of own bodily fluids, like tears and sweat, in drinking glasses. He collected them while he was undergoing treatment for lymphatic cancer, which he learned he had in 2011.
Ulay briefly recovered from cancer, Pislak said, and continued to work for a year, but then had a relapse. His final piece, “Performing Light,” presented at the Richard Saltoun gallery in London in 2019, is represented by a black-and-white “photogram” of his own frail body that ends the show.
Visser said that previous retrospectives of Ulay’s work have focused either on the collaborative period with Abramovic or exclusively on Ulay’s solo work.
“I tried to show the whole picture; to give the period with Marina the attention it deserves — which is so important for art history and performance,” Visser said. “But I hope that by showing all the other works we can show a more complex, even picture of who Ulay was.”
Although Abramovic and Ulay struggled over the years, including in a lawsuit over rights and royalties from their collaborative work, they were on good terms by the end, Abramovic said. The last time they spoke, she added, was on their shared birthday, Nov. 30, a few months before he died.
He was a “very honest, very complex, wonderful man,” she said. “You need a lifetime to understand him — you need more than one lifetime to understand him. I tried my best.”

What 2020 Was Like for People in the Retail Industry

The retail industry was in the midst of a transformation before 2020. But the onset of the pandemic accelerated that change, fundamentally reordering how and where people shop, and rippling across the broader economy.
Many stores closed for good, as chains cut physical locations or filed for bankruptcy, displacing everyone from highly paid executives to hourly workers. Amazon grew even more powerful and unavoidable as millions of people bought goods online during lockdowns. The divide between essential businesses allowed to stay open and nonessential ones forced to close drove shoppers to big-box chains like Walmart, Target and Dick’s and worsened struggling department stores’ woes. The apparel industry and a slew of malls were battered as millions of Americans stayed home and a litany of dress-up events, from proms to weddings, were canceled or postponed.
This year’s civil unrest and its thorny issues for American society also hit retailers. Businesses closed because of protests over George Floyd’s killing by a white police officer, and they reckoned with their own failings when it came to race. The challenges faced by working parents, including the cost and availability of basic child care during the pandemic, were keenly felt by women working at stores from CVS to Bloomingdale’s. And there were questions about the treatment of workers, as retailers and their backers treated employees shoddily during bankruptcies or failed to offer hazard pay or adequate notifications about workplace COVID-19 outbreaks.
Many Americans felt the effects of the retail upheaval — the industry is the second-biggest private employment sector in the United States — and some shared their experiences this year with The New York Times.
‘That’s What I Did My Whole Life’
Joyce Bonaime, 63, of Cabazon, California, has worked in retailing since the 1970s. In the past 14 months, she became one of many store employees whose lives were upended by bankruptcies — first at Barneys New York and more recently at Brooks Brothers.
Bonaime had spent about 10 years as a full-time stock coordinator for a Barneys outlet at Desert Hills Premium Outlets near her home, overseeing the shipping and receiving of designer wares, when the retailer filed for bankruptcy and liquidated late last year.
“Barneys treated people very badly at the end there,” Bonaime said. The retailer, she said, sent inconsistent messages about severance payments and the timing of store closures that limited people from finding other jobs just before the holiday shopping season.
After Barneys, Bonaime secured a full-time stockroom position at Brooks Brothers in the same outlet mall. But the pandemic forced the store to temporarily close in March, and she was furloughed. She anticipated returning once the store reopened this summer. But Bonaime’s job was terminated this month and she lost her health benefits. She is now collecting unemployment checks for the first time in her life.
When Bonaime started her career, working at shoe stores and completing a management training program at one chain, retailers had a different relationship with employees and communities, she said.
“We went through training on the bones in the foot and the muscles; we knew a lot about our industry,” she said. “We would reach out to local high schools and work with the cheerleading team and find a shoe they liked for outfits and give them a discount and make sure they had the right sizes.”
Bonaime, who is getting by right now, feels stuck. She had planned to work a few more years before retiring, but her options are limited. Businesses at the outlet mall are struggling — and it was already hard to interview last year as a woman in her 60s, she said. Amazon is hiring, but she is concerned about the risk of accidents in a warehouse.
“This pandemic just changes everything because I would have no problem getting a job otherwise,” she said. “I just don’t think there’s going to be anything in retail, and that’s what I did my whole life.”
‘I Was Collateral Damage’
Soon after the pandemic hit, Nordstrom said it would permanently close its three high-end Jeffrey boutiques, which were founded by Jeffrey Kalinsky and acquired by the retailer in 2005. Kalinsky, a Nordstrom executive who had focused on bringing designer apparel to the retailer, retired as part of the move.
The Jeffrey stores, in New York, Atlanta and Palo Alto, California, had dressed the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and even been lampooned on “Saturday Night Live.” The first location, in Atlanta, would have celebrated its 30th anniversary in August.
Kalinsky, 58, said in an interview that he was recovering from COVID-19 at the end of March when he became aware that the stores might remain shut after a temporary closure.
“It felt like I had a gun pointed at me,” he said. “The folks I always dealt with at Nordstrom were always very transparent, and I can only surmise that they were looking at how to position themselves to get through this period — and I was collateral damage.”
He had once told the Jeffrey staff that it was like the original cast in a Broadway musical, performing at an “amazing level” for customers every day. The hardest part of this year was telling employees about the closing, he said.
“That day was probably the most difficult, emotional day of my entire life,” he said. “I felt just gutted. It was indescribable.” Employees have told him that they “miss the merchandise, they miss the edit, they miss the specialness.”
His goal was for Jeffrey to carry the best merchandise but “sell it in an environment that was very democratic,” he said. “I wanted to showcase it all and wanted it all to be next to each other. I wanted the friction of Gucci next to Dries next to Comme des Garçons. I wanted to feel the tension in a good way because that, in my opinion, is how the perfect closet is.”
Kalinsky hopes to find a job designing for an American brand, saying he is not prepared to retire from retailing. He wonders if Jeffrey could have survived the pandemic by working with vendors and landlords.
“We had an impressive business, a wonderful clientele, and we would have been fine — but did we have a piggy bank for COVID? No,” he said.
A Man With a Van
Trent Griffin-Braaf started this year feeling more confident than ever. The transportation company he created to ferry guests from hotels in the Albany, New York, area to local attractions like the racetrack in Saratoga Springs was catching on.
But when the coronavirus shut down tourism, weddings and conferences, Griffin-Braaf’s passenger vans were idled and his business was in jeopardy. “We were really in a rough place,” he said.
In the late summer, his company became a carrier for Amazon and shifted to e-commerce deliveries. His team of 70 drivers and other staff include immigrants from Africa and India, workers laid off from restaurants, a struggling nail salon owner and recent college grads “just trying to figure it out” during the pandemic.
His drivers cover a 150-mile radius around Albany, including many rural areas where the number of Amazon shoppers is increasing, he said. “All you see around here is Amazon,” he said. “Come work for Amazon.”
Many of his drivers were earning 10 hours of overtime a week during the peak holiday season. “I feel blessed to be busy, because so many people aren’t right now,” he said.
Griffin-Braaf, 36, has not given up on passenger vans. He has started driving workers living in parts of Albany with limited public transportation to their jobs at distribution centers and other businesses far from bus lines.
On the weekends, he volunteers the vans to drive families to visit loved ones in upstate prisons. Griffin-Braaf, who served time in prison years ago, said that long term, he hoped to have tractor-trailers to move e-commerce packages across the country, and to offer van service in other “transportation deserts” around the state so people could get to work.
“I know how hard it is to get a job if you don’t have a car, and I have seen how hard it is when you don’t get visits in prison,” he said. “I have lived these things.”
‘We Are Glad You Are Here’
Lauren Jackson and her two sisters inadvertently chose the wrong time to open the first Black-owned beauty supply store in their hometown, Buffalo, New York: March 7, two weeks before the state ordered them to shut down.
So the sisters reopened it as an “essential business,” stocking hand sanitizers, masks and other pandemic necessities. Their store, the Hair Hive, reopened in early April, which helped them build a customer base while competitors stayed closed.
“Everything happens for a reason,” said Jackson, 28.
She and her sisters, Danielle Jackson and Brianna Lannie, had talked about opening the store for several years. It is five minutes from their childhood home on the east side of Buffalo, a predominantly Black neighborhood where their parents still live.
The sisters were initially intimidated about trying to break into the well-established industry.
“We didn’t want to tell anyone so they wouldn’t say, ‘You can’t compete with them,’” Jackson said. “We didn’t even tell our parents.”
The sisters got a loan from a family member and another from a Buffalo nonprofit. Lauren Jackson said she had watched other Black-owned businesses in her neighborhood come and go over the years, including salons, barbershops and restaurants that often closed because the younger generation didn’t want to take over after the founding family members retired. Jackson wants to break that trend.
“A lot of people come into the store because we are Black-owned,” she said. “They feel comfortable knowing we can relate with what’s going on with their hair. They tell us, ‘We are glad you are here.’”
‘Scared of What Might Be Coming’
In June, as the first wave of the coronavirus was finally coming under control in New York City, Feisal Ahmed got a call from his manager at Macy’s.
Would he like to return to his job selling luxury watches when the store in Herald Square reopened? “I am already there,” he told his boss. “Put me first in line.”
Ahmed was in his early 20s and a recent emigrant from Bangladesh when he started working at Macy’s in 1994. He met his wife in the store, was able to make a down payment on a house in Astoria, Queens, and saved up enough money to start his own laundry, which he eventually sold.
“I owe a lot to this job,” he said.
But after an initial feeling of relief and excitement to return to work after four months of lockdowns, reality set in for Ahmed. He has gone some days without selling a single watch, for which he would earn a commission.
Last week, business picked up for a few days, driven by last-minute Christmas shopping, but it was nowhere near a normal holiday pace. “The pandemic, job security — people are scared to spend money,” he said.
Still, Ahmed feels lucky. In New York City, retail jobs make up 9% of private-sector employment, and many have been slow to return. At stores selling clothing and clothing accessories, employment is down more than 40% from a year ago, according to a recent report by the state comptroller’s office.
Ahmed said that as a member of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, he had certain job protections. But he worries about what the winter will bring, as the pandemic continues to keep many shoppers away.
“Employees are scared of what might be coming,” he said.

NEW YORK — When Taniya Ria moved to the Bronx from Bangladesh in 2019, she didn’t know a word of English. Within months, Taniya, now 12, was translating for her mother, making American friends in class and getting good grades. Then the pandemic arrived.
This fall, she took classes on an iPhone from her family’s one-bedroom apartment in Parkchester, struggling to make sense of the teachers’ English through the tiny screen. Words and grammar she once knew evaporated, and so did her confidence.
“This is the hardest school year of my life,” said Taniya, who is in sixth grade. “I feel like the year is going to waste.”
While the disruptions of 2020 have threatened learning loss for nearly all students across the country, the toll has been especially severe for students who come from immigrant homes where English is rarely if ever spoken.
In-person instruction is essential for these students, according to teachers, parents and experts. Not only are they surrounded by spoken English in their classrooms, but they also learn in more subtle ways, by observing teachers’ facial expressions and other students’ responses to directions. Teachers, too, depend on nonverbal gestures to understand their students. All these things are far more difficult to perceive through a screen.
“You can’t take everything you do in an in-person context and move it online,” said Christopher Wagner, a member of the Citywide Council on English Language Learners. “So we need to figure out what does particularly work for our multilingual learners.”
And beyond the classroom, these students, known as English language learners, absorb incalculable amounts of information about syntax, slang and vocabulary by simply hanging out in hallways and playgrounds with other students — experiences that have been lost for most New York schoolchildren this year.
“For English language learners, if you’re not having those casual, informal, low-stakes opportunities to practice English, you’re really at a disadvantage,” said Sita Patel, a clinical psychology professor at Palo Alto University who studies the emotional health of immigrant youth.
Those concerns are playing out across the country. Parts of Virginia, California and Maryland are beginning to see ELL students fall more behind than their peers, according to early fall data from each school district. In Connecticut, attendance is becoming a larger issue for English learners, who were second only to homeless students in their drop in attendance in virtual and in-person classes.
In New York City, the Department of Education does not yet have estimates on learning loss for the city’s roughly 142,000 English language learner students — among the largest populations of English learners in the country. It is also not clear how many of those students opted into hybrid as opposed to full-remote learning.
The city’s Department of Education officials said they have instructed schools to prioritize English learners in deciding who will be allowed to return to full-time in-person classes — and insist they are leveraging every resource they have available to bolster remote learning.
“Whether they’re learning in-person or remote, we are committed to providing a high-quality education to our English language learners and have critical supports and services in place to meet them where they are,” said Sarah Casasnovas, a spokesperson for the Department of Education.
Still, students like Taniya are toiling under the radar and struggle to even ask for help in the new virtual setting.
During a music class, Taniya was confident she knew the answer to a question posed by her teacher, but her excitement was quickly dampened by a concern that she would mispronounce a word.
Over and over again, she silently rehearsed saying the answer. But by the time she had mustered enough courage to speak, the iPhone she was using for class froze. When it rebooted, her classmates had moved on. She was silent for the rest of the period.
“It’s hard for me to explain what I want to say correctly,” Taniya said. “And there are so many people in class, I get nervous about making a mistake.”
Educators who work with English language learners are having their own difficult times.
When Aixa Rodriguez, who teaches English learners at a Manhattan middle school, was in a classroom, she said she could intuit from her students’ posture and demeanor when they needed help. But now, her students are often on mute and off-camera.
“I don’t know if they’re engaged or not, I can’t figure out who needs to be redirected, and so my ability to be effective is hampered,” said Rodriguez, who has been teaching English learners for nearly two decades.
“I’m worried that the kids who are falling through the cracks will stop working as hard and stop pushing themselves,” she added. “They’re going to hit a point where they’re comfortable with their English and that’s it.”
Nadal Bertin worries about that himself. Now 18, he moved to New York in November 2019 from Haiti, where he taught himself English as best he could and worked hard to earn school credits that would be accepted in the United States. He is determined to graduate on time this spring.
“I have to get into college and make my family in Haiti proud,” Nadal said. “But I’m worried about my English.”
Nadal saw his English improve greatly over just a few months while immersed in the language at his high school in lower Manhattan. That’s no longer the case now that he’s in all-remote classes.
“Doing classes online, I don’t speak English very much anymore,” he said.
English language learners who need additional support for learning disabilities have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic.
When Huiyong Yu and her family came to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, from Hong Kong two years ago, her 12-year-old son struggled to learn English and did poorly in school. She felt he wasn’t getting the right support for his autism, so this year she enrolled him in a District 75 school to receive services like speech therapy. But his progress is still hampered by virtual learning, she said.
“It’s hard for both of us to understand how to use Google Drive and Google Meet,” Yu said. “Because of that, sometimes he misses the homework.”
Yu herself has been taking an online English course at University Settlement, a human services nonprofit working with immigrants in New York. After a long shift working at a senior center, she and her son work on their separate English homework. It has become a bonding activity during the pandemic.
“I just hope my son learns enough English that he can make some friends,” Yu said through a translator.
Opportunities to practice English can be even harder to find for students in immigrant neighborhoods where other languages are predominantly spoken. Even the most highly motivated students may learn a new language at a slower pace if they are not surrounded by people who speak that language, experts say.
“ELL students may lose more than other students and at a faster rate,” said Julie Sugarman, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
Sofia Green, whose family emigrated from the Dominican Republic five years ago, said her son, Sebastian, 14, was already most often speaking Spanish because that is what is spoken in his house and in his neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn. Now that he is in full-remote classes, her son is even less inclined to practice English, she said.
“I feel that he’s slowly going backward, ever since he started online learning,” Green said in Spanish. “If he learned better English, it would help me and our family. He could get a part-time job too, and that could help a lot.”
In the Bronx, Taniya also feels at a loss without the opportunities for off-the-cuff conversations with peers during lunchtime, gym period and in the hallway between classes — the times when she believes she made the most progress in learning English.
“I feel like I became more shy because I can’t really talk with other students anymore in online class,” she said. “I feel like it’s all my fault.”
Now, Taniya, who fan-girls about BTS, the K-pop group, and practices TikTok dances, rarely speaks or shows her face in class, unless it is to explain her slow internet.
When Taniya first noticed her English slipping in September, she would read to herself out loud to practice speaking, pulling from a towering stack of picture books and young adult novels piled on her dresser.
But over time, it became harder to pronounce the words and took longer to finish each chapter. Eventually, she stopped trying.

U.K. Virus Surge Surpasses Spring Peak as Lockdown Choices Loom

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
LONDON — About half of England is under the nation’s strictest lockdown measures, and people have been ordered to stay at home, but the coronavirus is still spreading at an alarming rate. Hospitals are treating more patients than at any time during the pandemic, the number of new infections has set a daily record and there is a growing debate about allowing tens of thousands of students to return to classrooms after the holiday break.
The nation’s scientists have said that an apparently more contagious variant of the virus is driving the rise in cases and, with severe restrictions already imposed on more than 48 million people, it remains unclear what other tools the government has at its disposal to get the outbreak under control.
There were 53,135 new lab-confirmed cases reported Tuesday, the highest figure yet on a single day. The National Health Service said there were now over 20,000 people in English hospitals, more than at the peak of the pandemic in April.
With the government scheduled to meet to evaluate its restrictions Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to impose another national lockdown and move students — especially older ones in colleges and secondary schools, who may be more easily infected by the new virus variant — to remote learning.
Some hope to see the daily caseload drop as the restrictions imposed on London and southern and eastern England around Christmas begin to have an effect.
But a potent combination of a new strain of the virus, an imminent return to schools and a measure that allowed people in lower-risk areas to meet indoors on Christmas Day has raised fears that worse could come in the new year.
“We are entering a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic, and we’re going to need decisive early national action to prevent a catastrophe in January and February,” Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, told the BBC.
A growing body of research supports the concern that the new virus variant may be more than 50% more contagious than the already rapidly spreading ones in widespread circulation.
And the variant continued to pop up in countries around the world despite bans on British travelers put in place by dozens of nations.
The British government has turned to a now familiar arsenal of tools to keep the variant in check, increasing restrictions on movement, shuttering businesses and limiting the number of people allowed to gather.
While officials blame the variant for the rise in cases, many of the rules are difficult to enforce on a large scale. It is also hard to know what role individual behavior may be playing.
Johnson’s handling of the pandemic has been marked by last-minute decisions and reversals, fueling public skepticism and anger, but the government has tried to hold the line on keeping schools open.
Since the summer, the government has prioritized keeping students in classrooms, even in areas that saw major outbreaks and during the country’s second national lockdown in November. After students spent the early months of the pandemic in online classes from home, Johnson in August called the reopening of schools a “moral duty” and promised that in the event of a resurgence of the virus, “the last thing we want to do is to close schools.”
Britain’s approach was similar to that of many European countries where leaders feared that closing schools once again would accentuate inequalities and would irreparably damage children’s academic and emotional development.
But as the number of coronavirus cases skyrocketed, Germany and the Netherlands have reverted to school closures. Many of Britain’s teachers are clamoring for the same.
The government had promised a staggered return for schools in January and said that it would rely on mass testing to keep the virus from spreading in schools, using the military to help.
Though some 1,500 soldiers have been put on standby to provide schools with “guidance, materials and funding they need to offer rapid testing to their staff and students from the start of term,” according to Britain’s education secretary, Gavin Williamson, most of the support will be provided remotely, through online sessions and over the phone.
Most schoolchildren will be required to swab themselves, under the supervision of a school employee or a volunteer.
“1,500 troops doing webinars probably isn’t the government response we were looking for,” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, a union, told the BBC.
The country’s two largest teaching unions — the National Education Union and the NASUWT — also criticized the last-minute nature of the mass testing plan and wrote to Johnson on Monday, asking for additional safety measures and for more time to put them in place.
The country’s scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, has recommended against allowing classrooms to reopen, according to British media reports.
The scientists said Britain’s coronavirus cases would spiral out of control unless schools closed in the new year. The scientific advisory group believes that shutting schools in January would allow infection numbers to shrink.
Even as the country’s health workers find themselves under growing pressure to treat the influx of patients, they are also being asked to speed up the most ambitious mass vaccination program in the nation’s history.
Around 200,000 people are getting their first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine every week. With the approval of a vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford expected in coming days, the number of doses available is likely to expand drastically.
There is no evidence that the vaccines are any less effective against the variant of the virus spreading in Britain, and they remain the best chance for the country to break the back of the current wave of infection.
But to meet the government’s promise to vaccinate all those older than 50 by spring, the speed of delivery would have to be 10 times as fast as it is now.
Nick Davies, an assistant professor of mathematical modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said rapid vaccination should blunt the impact of the new variant.
“Achieving 2 million vaccinations/week could substantially reduce the burden,” he wrote on Twitter. The current 200,000 a week “does not have much impact.”
That will require not just supply but also the workforce to deliver the vaccines. And that means even more pressure on health workers.
Dr. Rebecca Lewis, a surgeon working in a London hospital and the secretary of the Doctors’ Association, described how health care workers are exhausted, with little time to recuperate. Staff sickness, she said, has reached critical levels. The requirements on the use of protective gear have not yet been reviewed in light of the new strain, she said, and may be playing a part in frontline workers contracting the virus.
The country’s vaccination rollout needs to be stepped up, Lewis said Tuesday, adding that in addition to the elderly and the vulnerable, vaccinating doctors must be a priority.
Lewis said she expects worse days ahead.
“We know that mid-January is going to be awful,” she said.

CHECKING CANDIDATES' CLAIMS, ANSWERING READERS'QUESTIONS: Warnock tests Loeffler's view that she's not racist: Democrat challenges senator's association with white extremists.

Texto completo: "There is not a racist bone in my body." -- Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the Atlanta Press Club U.S. Senate debate, Dec. 6
What we found:
The Rev. Raphael Warnock and others are challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler's associations with controversial figures, as well as her criticism of the Black Lives Matters movement, as an indication she might not take racism of others seriously enough.
In their Dec. 6 debate at the Atlanta Press Club, the Democrat directly questioned her stance on racism.
"She says she is against racism and that racism has no place, but she welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview," Warnock said. "I don't think she can explain that."
Loeffler, who is running against Warnock in the January U.S. Senate runoff election in Georgia, responded: "There's not a racist bone in my body. I have worked to bring communities together my entire life."
Earlier in the debate, she said there was no place for racism in the country and that "every African American life" was important.
Warnock was pointing to Loeffler's early support of Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Congresswoman-elect of Georgia's 14th District. Prior to the November election, Loeffler campaigned with Greene and welcomed her endorsement.
"Greene has a history of peddling the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory that falsely claims President Donald Trump is secretly fighting a 'deep state' that protects sex traffickers and pedophiles -- a bizarre belief the FBI has labeled a potential domestic terrorism threat," the AJC reported.
Greene also has been criticized for offensive statements about Jews, Blacks and Muslims. Over the summer, Republican members of the U.S. House denounced her comments about Black Americans as "disgusting," "offensive," and "bigoted," The New York Times reported.
At a news conference after a November campaign stop in Cobb County, Loeffler tried to distance herself from QAnon when asked her opinion of the online group.
"I don't know anything about it," the Marietta Daily Journal reported. "I'm not a supporter or believer in it, but my focus is, look, no Georgians are asking about this. Georgians are asking about how do we create economic opportunity, how do we stand up for our rights, our freedoms in this country. That's what I'm doing. That's what Marjorie is doing."
The interview Warnock mentioned was one Loeffler gave in July with Jack Posobiec, whom PolitiFact described as an activist and a correspondent for One America News Network, a conservative cable news channel. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution described him as a "TV pundit associated with white supremacy and Nazism."
During the interview Loeffler spoke about her opposition to Black Lives Matters. At the time, the WNBA, a majority-Black league, had unveiled plans to honor women who were victims of police and racial violence, with warm-up jerseys that read, "Black Lives Matter."
Loeffler, who owns a stake in the Atlanta Dream, sent a letter to WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, calling for those plans be scrapped, the AJC reported. She said her opposition stemmed from what she perceived as Marxist ideology and calls to defund the police.
"This is an organization that seeks to destroy American principles, and I had to draw the line," Loeffler told Fox News in July. "I had to speak out for those who disagree with this movement because our country is too important."
Players across the league called for Loeffler's ouster. Ahead of an Atlanta Dream game in August, players wore "Vote Warnock" T-shirts.
"She used her enormous privilege and power as a United States senator to pick a fight with the black women on her team who know what it's like to grow up in a community where you have to have two talks with your children, one about the birds and the bees and the other about what happens if you're pulled over by police officers," Warnock said during the debate.
More recently, Loeffler's campaign disavowed a photo of her posing with Chester Doles, whom the AJC described as "a longtime white supremacist who spent decades in the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazi National Alliance." Doles also was sentenced to prison for the 1993 beating of a Black man in Maryland, the paper said.
Loeffler's campaign pushed back on any association with Doles. "Kelly had no idea who that was, and if she had she would have kicked him out immediately because we condemn in the most vociferous terms everything that he stands for," Loeffler's campaign said in a statement.
Loeffler has countered Warnock's accusations by pointing to a sermon in which he called on Americans to repent of their "worship of whiteness," a statement he signed with other church leaders calling Israel an apartheid state, as AJC Senate Watch reported.
Warnock's campaign says the "whiteness" sermon, delivered in 2016, was about spiritual priorities in the wake of the release of the 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape in which President Donald Trump is heard boasting about how easy it is to sexually harass and assault women.
Warnock spokesman Terrence Clark said that the sermon noted that "many people had tolerated then-candidate Trump's hateful comments toward people with disabilities and marginalized communities, and only expressed outrage after that tape came out," the AJC reported.
In mid-December, a coalition of more than 100 religious leaders -- mostly Black church leaders in Georgia -- signed a statement saying that Loeffler's ads critical of Warnock's sermons were a "broader attack against the Black church," the New York Times reported.
"We call on you to cease and desist your false characterizations of Reverend Warnock as 'radical' or 'socialist,' when there is nothing in his background, writings or sermons that suggests those characterizations to be true, especially when taken in full context," the statement said.
In response, Loeffler tweeted to Warnock: "No one attacked the Black church.We simply exposed your record in your own words."

Texto completo: The government promised to help -- and it did.
Maybe it was the visuals that did it. It's hard to know what aspects of reality make it into Donald Trump's ever-shrinking bubble -- and I'm happy to say that after Jan. 20 we won't have to care about what goes on in his not-at-all beautiful mind -- but it's possible that he became aware of how he looked, playing golf as millions of desperate families lost their unemployment benefits.
Whatever the reason, on Sunday he finally signed an economic relief bill that will, among other things, extend those benefits for a few months. And it wasn't just the unemployed who breathed a sigh of relief. Stock market futures -- which are not a measure of economic success, but still -- rose. Goldman Sachs marked up its forecast of economic growth in 2021.
So this year is closing out with a second demonstration of the lesson we should have learned in the spring: In times of crisis, government aid to people in distress is a good thing, not just for those getting help, but for the nation as a whole. Or to put it a bit differently, 2020 was the year Reaganism died.
What I mean by Reaganism goes beyond voodoo economics, the claim that tax cuts have magical power and can solve all problems. After all, nobody believes in that claim aside from a handful of charlatans and cranks, plus the entire Republican Party.
No, I mean something broader -- the belief that aid to those in need always backfires, that the only way to improve ordinary people's lives is to make the rich richer and wait for the benefits to trickle down. This belief was encapsulated in Ronald Reagan's famous dictum that the most terrifying words in English are "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."
Well, in 2020 the government was there to help -- and help it did.
True, there were some people who advocated trickle-down policies even in the face of a pandemic. Trump repeatedly pushed for payroll tax cuts, which by definition would do nothing to directly help the jobless, even attempting (unsuccessfully) to slash tax collections through executive action.
Oh, and the new recovery package does include a multi-billion-dollar tax break for business meals, as if three-martini lunches were the answer to a pandemic depression.
Reagan-style hostility to helping people in need also persisted. There were some politicians and economists who kept insisting, in the teeth of the evidence, that aid to unemployed workers was actually causing unemployment, by making workers unwilling to accept job offers.
Over all, however -- and somewhat shockingly -- U.S. economic policy actually responded fairly well to the real needs of a nation forced into lockdown by a deadly virus. Aid to the unemployed and business loans that were forgiven if they were used to maintain payrolls limited the suffering. Direct checks sent to most adults weren't the best targeted policy ever, but they boosted personal incomes.
All this big-government intervention worked. Despite a lockdown that temporarily eliminated 22 million jobs, poverty actually fell while the assistance lasted.
And there was no visible downside. As I've already suggested, there was no indication that helping the unemployed deterred workers from taking jobs when they became available. Most notably, the employment surge from April to July, in which nine million Americans went back to work, took place while enhanced benefits were still in effect.
Nor did huge government borrowing have the dire consequences deficit scolds always predict. Interest rates stayed low, while inflation remained quiescent.
So the government was there to help, and it really did. The only problem was that it cut off help too soon. Extraordinary aid should have continued as long as the coronavirus was still rampant -- a fact implicitly acknowledged by bipartisan willingness to enact a second rescue package, and Trump's grudging eventual willingness to sign that legislation.
Indeed, some of the aid we provided in 2020 should continue even after we have widespread vaccination. What we should have learned last spring is that adequately funded government programs can greatly reduce poverty. Why forget that lesson as soon as the pandemic is over?
Now, when I say that Reaganism died in 2020 I don't mean that the usual suspects will stop making the usual arguments. Voodoo economics is too deeply embedded in the modern G.O.P. -- and too useful to billionaire donors seeking tax cuts -- to be banished by inconvenient facts.
Opposition to helping the unemployed and the poor was never evidence-based; it was always rooted in a mix of elitism and racial hostility. So we'll still keep hearing about the miraculous power of tax cuts and the evils of the welfare state.
But while Reaganism will still be out there, it will now, even more than before, be zombie Reaganism -- a doctrine that should have been killed by its encounter with reality, even if it's still shambling along, eating politicians' brains.
For the lesson of 2020 is that in a crisis, and to some extent even in calmer times, the government can do a lot to improve people's lives. And what we should fear most is a government that refuses to do its job.

Texto completo: As a new administration looms, publishers have snapped up another crop of forthcoming Trump books by prominent journalists and pundits.
In the past four years, publishers have released more than a thousand books about Donald J. Trump. Authors have examined seemingly every facet of his persona, in works about his presidency, family, political rise, business dealings, reality-TV career and golfing habits. The body of work is so voluminous that there's even a book about all the Trump books.
What's left to parse? A lot, it seems. As his presidency comes to an end, publishers are racing to acquire news-breaking works about his final days in office, as well as comprehensive historical accounts of the Trump era, sober expositions examining how he has changed the Republican Party and the country, and gossipy insider accounts of what really went on in the White House.
"Trump doesn't want to let go of his job, and a shockingly high number of us don't want to let go of him," said Rafe Sagalyn, a literary agent at ICM. "There's going to be an amazing appetite for books about what happened, and all the OMG moments of the last four years. Books are the medium for filling in all these blanks."
In the run-up to and aftermath of the election, publishers have snapped up a new crop of Trump books by prominent journalists and pundits. Penguin Random House has emerged as one of the front-runners in the race to lock up the first definitive accounts of the Trump epoch. Shortly after the election, Penguin Press announced that it would publish the New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman's narrative of Mr. Trump's political career, tracking his rise from his real-estate development roots to the final days of his tumultuous presidency.
Penguin also acquired a new book from the Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, the co-authors of "A Very Stable Genius," published early this year. Their sequel will explore the last year of Mr. Trump's presidency, as he faced impeachment, played down the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, was hospitalized with Covid-19 and fought to overturn the results of the election. Doubleday, another Penguin Random House imprint, acquired a book that will be co-written by Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, and Susan Glasser, a writer for The New Yorker, which will analyze how Trump has changed the culture and politics of Washington.
"The books that will endure are those that shape historical perspectives about the period," said Kristine Puopolo, editorial director of nonfiction at Doubleday. "We're moving into a new phase where we are going to see Trump as history. We've seen that it is only after people leave an administration that they're open to being completely candid."
In some ways, the continued tsunami of titles is no surprise. Whenever a new president enters the White House, there's often a surge of books that analyze the previous administration, the key moments of the election and the challenges that the new president will face.
Still, there's no doubt that publishers are likely to soon face the end of a very lucrative era. Trump's presidency has been an enormous boon for the publishing industry, with breakout hits by former administration officials (John Bolton, James Comey and "Anonymous," who later revealed himself as Miles Taylor, a former official at the Department of Homeland Security), exposés by journalists (Woodward, Michael Wolff) and tell-alls from estranged confidantes and protégés (Michael Cohen, Omarosa Manigault Newman). One of the year's top-selling nonfiction books, Mary Trump's "Too Much and Never Enough," sold more than 1.3 million copies in the first week after its release; she recently sold a second book to St. Martin's about Trump's impact on the nation.
In sheer volume, Trump books dwarf works released about the previous administration during its first term: There have been more than 1,200 unique titles about Mr. Trump published in the last four years, compared to around 500 books about former President Barack Obama and his administration during his first term, according to an analysis by NPD BookScan.
Many of the factors that drove sales for earlier books about Trump might not persist after he leaves office. While Mr. Trump will likely still have a large social media platform, he'll no longer control the bully pulpit of the White House, and is unlikely to drive constant cable news coverage as he has for the past four years. Many of the most successful books about the president got a boost from news coverage after he publicly attacked and sometimes sued the authors and publishers. It's uncertain whether such outbursts will captivate cable news pundits once he is no longer in the White House.
"There's always interest in looking back at a presidential administration," said Robert B. Barnett, a Washington lawyer who has represented Mr. Woodward as well as the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bushes and other political figures. "The question will be: Which of the many books will be most appealing to readers and will break through?"
Some publishing executives remain bullish on the genre, noting that books about Trump have continued to sell well throughout his term, and have already defied predictions that readers would one day tire of him.
"The opportunity for book publishers was huge starting in 2016, and will be huge in 2020," said Ann Godoff, Penguin's president and editor in chief. "People say, 'Well, there have been too many Trump books.' I think you haven't seen anything yet, and the reason for that is the sources are going to come loose; they're going to be freer to talk."
Simon & Schuster, which published several best-selling books about Trump this year, is still investing heavily in behind-the-scenes books about the president and the 2020 election. After publishing two blockbusters by Bob Woodward, "Rage" and "Fear," Simon & Schuster plans to release Woodward's next book, which he is writing with the Washington Post reporter Robert Costa, about the final days of the Trump presidency and the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s administration.
Simon & Schuster also acquired a book by the New York Times political reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin, which will look at the 2020 election as a turning point in American politics, and an exposé by the reporter and longtime Trump chronicler David Cay Johnston about Trump's finances.
Publishers hope to capitalize on interest in President-elect Biden as well. Forthcoming books include the journalist John Heilemann's account of the 2020 election and Biden's rise to the presidency; the Atlantic staff writer Franklin Foer's look at Biden's first 100 days in office; and the Politico correspondent Ben Schreckinger's book about the Biden family's past tragedies, scandals and triumphs. For younger political junkies, there are also a handful of children's books about Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, including a picture book about the Biden family's dogs, Champ and Major.
Publishers are betting that there will be a substantial lingering appetite for Trump books, but some question just how large the market will be, and how long the public's fascination with him will last. Seismic sales for former President Barack Obama's memoir, "A Promised Land," which sold more than 3.3 million copies in its first month, might signal that interest in Trump will remain high in coming years.
Another looming question for publishers is how to navigate a potential post-presidential memoir by Mr. Trump himself. While such a book would undoubtedly be a mega-besteller, mainstream publishing companies would likely face a backlash from their writers and staff members. On top of that, some publishers might balk at a Trump memoir if the book failed to meet the company's standards for accuracy. The prospect of a memoir from Mr. Trump could prove especially fraught if he continues to argue falsely that he actually won the election.
Then again, Mr. Trump's refusal to concede -- and his hints about running in 2024 -- could help fuel interest in another round of books about the 45th president.
"It's a hard addiction to break for publishers and the public," said the literary agent Matt Latimer, co-founder of the Javelin Agency, which has represented several former administration officials. "The Trump phenomenon is never going to completely vanish. We'll be talking about Trump for the next four years."

How op-eds sparked outrage all year long

Texto completo: Joseph Epstein says he has a lot of hate mail but no regrets.
A few weeks ago, the veteran writer and former university lecturer dashed off a few hundred words for the Wall Street Journal, to which he regularly contributes guest columns. He intended to make a point about advanced degrees and the pretentiousness of titles. Epstein focused on incoming first lady Jill Biden, who holds a doctorate in education, urging her not to use the honorific "Dr." The sub-headline on his piece said it was a "fraudulent, even comic" title.
Epstein's op-ed became one of the most talked about, and most loathed, articles of the year. People took to social media to denounce it and him as misogynistic, condescending and contemptible. At last count, Epstein said he'd gotten 200 pieces of hate mail, many from women and many using sexist, homophobic or anti- Semitic slurs. Some urged him to die.
"My reaction is one of great sadness," he told The Washington Post this week, sounding more rueful than rebuked. "I'm not sorry I wrote it at all. I'm just mildly depressed about how stupid [the reaction] was. What struck me is how people are so content to put labels on you - 'you're sexist,' 'you're racist.' Well, labels aren't thoughts."
The reaction to Epstein's essay says much about his message, but it also says a few things about the form it came in, too. The uproar was another indication that op-eds - guest columns published on the page opposite a newspaper's own editorials (hence, "op-ed") still retain their power to provoke and outrage 50 years after the New York Times introduced a daily page devoted to them.
In fact, in an age in which opinion is abundant - check your Twitter or Facebook feed - some of the most controversial articles of recent vintage have been newspaper op-eds.
Op-eds in the Times and Journal this summer, for example, nearly ignited a civil war inside the two venerable news organizations.
After the Journal's famously conservative Opinion section published an op-ed by Vice President Pence in June about the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic ("We are winning the fight against the invisible enemy," he wrote, despite evidence to the contrary), the Journal's news reporters and editors seemed to have had enough. In a letter to the paper's publisher, nearly 300 newsroom staffers criticized "Opinion's lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence," citing Pence's op-ed among others.
The editorial board fired back by publishing a defiant statement that carried the sub-headline, "These pages won't wilt under cancel-culture pressure."
The Journal's editorial page editor, Paul Gigot, remained similarly unmoved by the blowback from Epstein's op-ed. In his Journal column he called the reaction "overwrought," and added, "These pages aren't going to stop publishing provocative essays merely because they offend the new administration or the political censors in the media and academe." (Gigot didn't respond to a request for comment for this article).
An op-ed sparked a similar conflagration at the Times in June. Reporters and editors took to social media to protest the publication of a column by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) that recommended using the military to respond to civil unrest. Readers also sounded off, resulting in the resignation of the paper's editorial page editor, James Bennet, and the reassignment of his deputy, James Dao.
Bennet and Dao were the editors principally responsible for ushering into publication one of the most-discussed articles of the entire Trump era - an op-ed by a "senior administration official" who described himself as part of the "resistance" to President Trump inside the White House. The column, credited to "Anonymous," prompted a brief but unsuccessful hunt within the White House for the writer's identity and a series of rage-tweets from Trump. One read simply, "TREASON?"
The modern op-ed page was created in 1970 by a New York Times editor, John B. Oakes, with the express purpose of expanding the range of opinion found on the newspaper's pages (at the Times it also became home to premium-priced quarter-page ads). Within a few years, most daily newspapers had copied the idea, regularly reserving space for columns by politicians, religious leaders, experts of various kinds and ordinary people with an interesting point of view.
Although most columns pass without much comment, the few that become part of the national conversation do so as a result of a combination of factors. The identity of the writer matters, as does his or her argument. And the medium seems to be as important as the message. Only a small handful of elite "legacy" publications - principally, the Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post - appear to have platforms big enough to create wide attention.
The three newspapers still enjoy an advantage even a large regional paper or social media platform does not: They are read by business and political elites, which makes them the first choice when a business or political elite wants to unburden him or herself on an issue.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), for example, caused a commotion - millions of page views, thousands of reader comments, cable news discussion - with an op-ed in The Post last year critiquing the president (headline: "Trump's character falls short"). A similar hubbub followed The Post's publication of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's commentary about Trump's pardon of campaign adviser Roger Stone (headline: "Roger Stone remains a convicted felon, and rightly so").
Miles Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security official who outed himself as "Anonymous" in October, said he never considered publishing his anti-Trump essay anywhere but the New York Times. In an interview, Taylor said he wrote the op-ed with the Times in mind "because it is the paper of record, and there is no publication Donald Trump despises more than the New York Times."
He added, "It was important to me to publish it in an outlet that had become a symbol for the president's attacks on the free press. His derision of the New York Times as 'fake news' and the 'enemy of the people' made it a natural place to offer up the truth about presidential misconduct."
Taylor said he continues to be harassed and threatened by Trump's supporters for his op-ed and a subsequent best-selling book on the same topic, also written anonymously. He is scorned as a hypocrite on both sides for having stayed in the Trump administration. Much like Epstein, he laments the culture that he feels this reaction represents: "We should be debating each other's ideas, not destroying each other's lives," he says.
The outrage generated by op-eds may be greater now, but it's debatable whether the range of published opinion is any more daring than when Oakes unveiled his innovation 50 years ago, said media historian Michael Socolow of the University of Maine.
Socolow cites several Times op-eds from the 1970s that would probably prompt an angry reaction, but passed without major controversy at the time. One was a 1971 piece composed of reconstructed quotes from the late Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, who urged people to die in the "international proletarian revolutionary struggle," effectively an argument for overthrowing the U.S. government. Another in 1978 defended the regime of Cambodian communist leader Pol Pot, and labeled the Times's own reporting about genocide in the southeast Asian country "a lie," "ludicrous" and a "myth." It was written by the editor of a Marxist-Leninist newspaper.
"The acceptable boundaries of discourse have changed" at the Times, Socolow says - they have become narrower. (Times acting editorial page editor Kathleen Kingsbury did not respond to a request for comment).
Nevertheless, op-eds may be an enduring form not just because they are relatively popular with readers but because they are also cost-effective. Reporting is expensive, requiring an investment in professional reporters and editors; opinions are cheap. Most publications pay nominal sums, or nothing at all, for guest submissions. This insight enabled a group led by Internet entrepreneurs Arianna Huffington and Andrew Breitbart to create Huffington Post (now HuffPost), a popular site that was sustained in its formative years by "guest" essays and other inexpensive "user-generated content."
Major news sites have also benefited from this. The Times's Opinion section produced fewer than 10 percent of all the content on the Times site, yet opinion pieces accounted for 20 percent of the stories read by Times subscribers as of late 2017, according to the Columbia Journalism Review. (More recent figures were unavailable; a Times representative didn't respond to a request for information.)
Local and regional newspapers, however, have to work harder to keep the "takes" coming, said Sewell Chan, the editor of the Los Angeles Times's editorial page. The major national papers, he says, are flooded "with fairly polished submissions." Even at a large news organization like the L.A. Times, said Chan, "a lot of work goes into soliciting op-eds, especially from local scholars and writers, and the editing time is substantial as well."
What may have changed most about op-eds over the past half-century isn't the form itself but the audience for it, he said. A half-century ago, "the middle class was stronger," and the political parties "weren't as far apart as they are now. Society, generally, was less unequal and less polarized than now."
His newspaper, he said, is among a small group of regional legacy newspapers, such as the Boston Globe, Minneapolis Star Tribune and Philadelphia Inquirer, that are locally owned and still investing in original journalism, including lively opinion pages.
"I hope regional and local papers survive the information apocalypse we're going through," Chan said. "We know that local news sources are still among the most trusted for Americans, and that trust urgently needs rebuilding. Op-eds by local professors, writers, leaders and influencers are important, and we need to preserve the forums that publish them."

Texto completo: Nearly a year into our 15 days to slow the spread, our political class still refuses to call out our supposed medical experts for repeatedly discrediting themselves with noble lie after noble lie. Finally, Sen. Marco Rubio has rightly called out Anthony Fauci for lying to the public because our ruling class believes us plebians to be too stupid to understand the actual science about the coronavirus.
Tweet
In the year since the Chinese Communist Party unleashed the novel coronavirus across the globe, we've learned an abundance about the virus that could have informed far less onerous mitigation measures. If we had known as we do now that young children are not significant vectors spreading the virus, we would have never shut down the kindergartens and elementary schools. If we had known that the outdoors, especially in direct sunlight, are orders of magnitude safer than indoors, we would have never closed off beaches and hiking trails, and city centers would have almost certainly closed off streets to allow restaurants greater capacity for outdoor dining.
The one thing we did know was likely, if not absolutely, true about was that masks could reduce the transmission of the novel coronavirus, just as they did for other serious coronaviruses such as the SARS and MERS viruses.
Even before we shut a single business, as news of the CCP welding doors in Wuhan shut and mass deaths overriding hospitals in Hubei trickled across the Pacific, public health officials could have encouraged people to wear simple cloth masks when going into crowded areas. After all, not only did we know that as with nearly all airborne respiratory diseases, masks have been effective at preventing other types of coronavirus transmission, but also that studies of much smaller microorganisms than the novel coronavirus clearly demonstrated homemade masks efficacy against transmission.
And yet, the medical expert establishment knowingly decided to lie to the public about our cheapest and easiest tool to slow coronavirus transmission. As late as March, Fauci was telling the public that they had "no reason" to wear a mask, only admitting that this was a willful and deliberate lie many months later.
"[W]e were concerned the public health community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N95 masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply," Fauci said in a June interview. "And we wanted to make sure that the people, namely, the healthcare workers, who were brave enough to put themselves in a harm way, to take care of people who you know were infected with the coronavirus and the danger of them getting infected."
Now the nation's leading epidemiology expert has confessed that he knowingly lied about the percentage of the public with coronavirus resistance required to achieve herd immunity.
"Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts," the New York Times reported on Christmas Eve. "He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks."
Although Fauci once said he believed herd immunity required around three-quarters of the public to have resistance to the coronavirus, he admitted to the New York Times that he's believed the figure to be up to 90%.
Fauci may believe that this is the only way to get the public to go along with the science, but in truth, it's why the backlash to "expert" advice has been so strong.
Almost a year into 15 days to slow the spread, and even the most benevolent of us are fed up with being lied to. Our last remaining bastion of credibility sullied theirs because of the sense that we were too stupid to follow fact-driven guidance, and we're paying for it in record coronavirus deaths.
Just imagine if this pandemic started with mass mask-wearing and limited business shutdowns akin to Taiwan? It would have prevented the community transmission that turned the virus into a national pandemic and kept the simple act of wearing a mask from becoming politicized. With more realistic standards set for social distancing and guidelines, the population would have been paced enough that perhaps tyrannical shutdowns and personal lockdown fatigues in places such as California wouldn't be driving people to socialize solely in multigenerational superspreader gatherings in cramped households.
Alas, the experts lied and people died. Rubio is just the one member of the ruling class with the stones to call a spade a spade.

In Virginia teenager N-word story, where are the adults?

Texto completo: It is one thing for maladjusted activists to behave as villains.

But what excuse is there for our institutions to do the same?

The New York Times published a grotesque report this weekend cheering an 18-year-old named Jimmy Galligan, a biracial Virginia resident who targeted a white girl for destruction after he obtained a years-old video of her using the N-word.

The white girl, Mimi Groves, used the racial slur jokingly in 2016 in reference to having just acquired her learner's permit. Groves, who was a freshman in high school at the time, said specifically in a Snapchat video, "I can drive, n-----s."

Three years later, Galligan obtained a copy of the video.

"He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right," reports the New York Times.

And by “when the time was right,” the paper of record means the aggrieved 18-year-old waited until Groves, who spent her years in high school competing successfully as a cheerleader, had been accepted into the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as a member of its prestigious cheer team.

The New York Times reports, “Mr. Galligan, who had waited until Ms. Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon. Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer."

The University of Tennessee bowed to the mob, first by removing Groves from its cheer squad and then by pressuring her into rescinding her application for enrollment. Groves, who is both contrite and embarrassed for what she said as a freshman in high school, took the hint. She withdrew her acceptance and ended up attending community college online.

Galligan, whom the New York Times treats as some sort of tortured, noble soul, believes his actions were both righteous and even heroic.

"I’m going to remind myself,” he tells the New York Times, “you started something. You taught someone a lesson.”

Galligan is outrageously misguided. That much is clear. But he is not even the most disturbing thing about this wretched story. That dubious distinction goes to both the New York Times and the University of Tennessee.

It is one thing if Galligan is a bitter, vindictive young man suffering from personal hang-ups, but what good reason does the New York Times have to run his story? What public interest is served? Are we to believe now that the private remarks of children, remarks, by the way, for which they have apologized, merit attention from the most powerful media organizations in the United States? Surely, the New York Times is not serious when it says of this incident that it paints a "complex portrait of behavior that for generations had gone unchecked in schools in one of the nation’s wealthiest counties, where Black students said they had long been subjected to ridicule." Next up, I suppose the paper will dispatch a team of reporters to investigate the mean-girl table.

And what about the University of Tennessee? It arguably looks worse than the New York Times. Groves said a bad word. She also said it years ago when she was just a teenager, and she has repented for it. Groves also never directed the word at anyone, much less in hate. She certainly did not direct anything at Galligan. Yet, the university decided anyway that the best course of action would be to remove Groves from the cheer team before eventually pressuring her into withdrawing her application.

Galligan’s personal rage is his own problem. But what is going on at the New York Times and the University of Tennessee? Whose idea was it to elevate Galligan as some sort of racial-justice hero? Likewise, does the university have a policy whereby the years-old social media activity of its applicants decides enrollment? Perhaps it is as many fear. Perhaps it is that these establishments are overrun now with activists who mirror closely the bitter resentment and sense of moral superiority embodied by Galligan's smug comments to the New York Times.

The self-anointed Torquemadas of "social justice" are on the prowl, looking for victims to punish. The only thing scarier than that is that our institutions are playing along for some reason.

Where are the adults?

Here's how 'social justice' ruins the lives of innocent people, even high school students

Texto completo: There's a story in the New York Times this week that everyone should read in order to get a full grasp of how out of control and scary the race-baiting monsters of the so-called "Social Justice movement" can be.
The article, headlined, "Slur, Surfacing on Old Video, Alters Young Lives and a Town," tells the tale of a white high school student in Virginia who saw her future as an athlete at a major university go up in smoke after one of her peers, who is biracial, shared online a years-old video of the first student casually using the N-word.
Jimmy Galligan, the black student, chillingly says at the very end of the story, "I’m going to remind myself, you started something. You taught someone a lesson.”
The New York Times frames the depressing affair in the context of our never-ending nightmare that the media have dubbed a "racial reckoning," when really it's about the havoc caused by "social justice" advocates who intimidate and harass innocent people while claiming the moral high ground.
Mimi Groves, the white student, had sent a three-second video to a friend on Snapchat, wherein Groves, after getting her learner's permit, is seen saying, "I can drive," followed by the N-word.
The video was recorded in 2016, when Groves was a high school freshman. It wasn't until three years later, when both Groves and Galligan were seniors and Groves herself was calling for racial justice for black people, that Galligan received the clip from a friend.
"He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right," the New York Times said. It wasn't until after protests for the death of George Floyd were underway that Galligan decided it was time to blow up Groves's dreams of attending the University of Tennessee, which had sent her an acceptance letter and granted her a spot on the school's cheerleading team.
"Mr. Galligan, who had waited until Ms. Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon," the story said. "Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer."
The university, in response, removed Groves from the cheer team and told her she should reconsider enrolling. She withdrew her acceptance and ended up attending an online community college.
The incident, the New York Times said, revealed a "complex portrait of behavior that for generations had gone unchecked in schools in one of the nation’s wealthiest counties, where Black students said they had long been subjected to ridicule."
Nonsense. Galligan wasn't ridiculed by Groves. He wasn't the intended recipient of the video, which he didn't even see until three years after it was recorded.
Galligan's intentions were rotten, as was revealed in the story when he describes how he confronted his father, who is white, after he had used the N-word. "A few years ago, he said his father said it aloud," the New York Times said, "prompting Mr. Galligan and his sister to quietly take him aside and explain that it was unacceptable, even when joking around."
Why couldn't Galligan have done the exact same thing for Groves? That question is also answered in the story by a black student who had defended Groves during the uproar. "We’re supposed to educate people,” she wrote on a social media post, “not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.”
That's what "social justice" advocates do — tear people down in order to feel morally superior. It's sick.
In the story, Groves is exceedingly embarrassed and apologetic for the video she sent on Snapchat. But what she did in private was not even nearly as offensive as what Galligan did to her in public.

"[W]e were concerned the public health community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N95 masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply," Fauci said in a June interview. "And we wanted to make sure that the people, namely, the healthcare workers, who were brave enough to put themselves in a harm way, to take care of people who you know were infected with the coronavirus and the danger of them getting infected."
Now the nation's leading epidemiology expert has confessed that he knowingly lied about the percentage of the public with coronavirus resistance required to achieve herd immunity.
"Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts," the New York Times reported on Christmas Eve. "He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks."
Although Fauci once said he believed herd immunity required around three-quarters of the public to have resistance to the coronavirus, he admitted to the New York Times that he's believed the figure to be up to 90%.
Fauci may believe that this is the only way to get the public to go along with the science, but in truth, it's why the backlash to "expert" advice has been so strong.
Almost a year into 15 days to slow the spread, and even the most benevolent of us are fed up with being lied to. Our last remaining bastion of credibility sullied theirs because of the sense that we were too stupid to follow fact-driven guidance, and we're paying for it in record coronavirus deaths.
Just imagine if this pandemic started with mass mask-wearing and limited business shutdowns akin to Taiwan? It would have prevented the community transmission that turned the virus into a national pandemic and kept the simple act of wearing a mask from becoming politicized. With more realistic standards set for social distancing and guidelines, the population would have been paced enough that perhaps tyrannical shutdowns and personal lockdown fatigues in places such as California wouldn't be driving people to socialize solely in multigenerational superspreader gatherings in cramped households.
Alas, the experts lied and people died. Rubio is just the one member of the ruling class with the stones to call a spade a spade.

Texto completo: It is one thing for maladjusted activists to behave as villains.

But what excuse is there for our institutions to do the same?

The New York Times published a grotesque report this weekend cheering an 18-year-old named Jimmy Galligan, a biracial Virginia resident who targeted a white girl for destruction after he obtained a years-old video of her using the N-word.

The white girl, Mimi Groves, used the racial slur jokingly in 2016 in reference to having just acquired her learner's permit. Groves, who was a freshman in high school at the time, said specifically in a private Snapchat video to a friend, "I can drive, n-----s."

Three years later, Galligan obtained a copy of the video and bided his time.

"He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right," reports the New York Times.

And by “when the time was right,” the paper of record means the aggrieved 18-year-old waited until Groves, who spent her years in high school competing successfully as a cheerleader, had been accepted into the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as a member of its prestigious cheer team.

The New York Times adds, “Mr. Galligan, who had waited until Ms. Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon. Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer."

The University of Tennessee bowed to the mob, first by removing Groves from its cheer squad and then later by pressuring her into rescinding her application for enrollment.

Groves, who is both contrite and embarrassed for what she said as a freshman in high school, took the hint. She withdrew her acceptance and ended up attending community college online.

Galligan, whom the New York Times treats as some sort of tortured, noble soul, believes his actions were both righteous and even heroic.

"I’m going to remind myself,” he tells the New York Times, “you started something. You taught someone a lesson.”

Galligan is outrageously misguided. That much is clear. But he is not even the most disturbing thing about this wretched story. That dubious distinction goes to both the New York Times and the University of Tennessee.

It is one thing if Galligan is a bitter, vindictive young man suffering from personal hang-ups, but what good reason does the New York Times have to run his story? What public interest is served? Are we to believe now that the private remarks of children, remarks, by the way, for which they have apologized, merit attention from the most powerful media institutions in the United States? Surely, the New York Times is not serious when it says of this incident that it paints a "complex portrait of behavior that for generations had gone unchecked in schools in one of the nation’s wealthiest counties, where Black students said they had long been subjected to ridicule." Next up, I suppose the New York Times will dispatch a team of reporters to investigate the mean-girl table.

And what about the University of Tennessee? It arguably looks worse than the New York Times. Groves said a bad word. She also said it years ago when she was just a teenager, and she has repented for it. Groves also never directed the word at anyone, much less in hate. She certainly did not direct anything at Galligan. Yet, the university decided anyway that the best course of action would be to remove Groves from the cheer team before eventually pressuring her into withdrawing her application.

Galligan’s personal rage is his own problem. But what is going on at the New York Times and the University of Tennessee? Whose idea was it to elevate Galligan as some sort of racial-justice hero? Likewise, does the university have a policy now whereby the years-old social media activity of its applicants decides enrollment? Or is it just as many fear, that these institutions are overrun now with like-minded activists who mirror closely the rage and sense of moral superiority embodied by Galligan's smug comments to the New York Times?
The self-anointed Torquemadas of social justice are on the prowl, looking for victims to punish, and our institutions are playing along for some reason.

Where are the adults?

DIPLOMACY, AMERICAN-STYLE

Texto completo: Who wouldn't want to be an American ambassador?
Beyond the pomp and social cachet, you get a luxury residence, six-figure salary and private school tuition for your children -- a comfortable diplomatic lifestyle bankrolled by taxpayers. For decades, presidents from both parties have quietly distributed a portion of these cushy posts (often in the touristy capitals of Europe and the Caribbean) to some of their most generous campaign donors. Although the practice is technically prohibited by law, Congress has long acquiesced.
"We're the only country in the world that does business in this way," says Dennis Jett, a retired ambassador, career foreign service officer and professor who wrote the book "American Ambassadors." "Nobody else has an open market on ambassadorships. If we really believed in capitalism, we would list these postings on eBay."
The problem, as indicated by Gordon Sondland and other donor-ambassadors during the Trump administration, is that the most loyal are often the least competent. But the practice of effectively selling ambassadorships did not start with President Donald Trump. The fact that nearly every modern president has done the same would seem to be the rare piece of evidence in support of Trump's claim that he is no more corrupt than the Washington "swamp." The incoming Biden administration now has a chance to prove him wrong.
The precise origins of ambassadorial graft are obscure, but one of the earliest examples can be found inside the original "smoke-filled room," a suite at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago, where Republican power brokers haggled into the early hours of June 12, 1920, trying to choose an agreeable presidential candidate to unite their party's deadlocked convention. They finally settled on the stately-looking junior senator from Ohio, Warren G. Harding. One of Harding's powerful backers was George Harvey, publisher and industrialist, who had engineered Woodrow Wilson's ascent to the White House. After Harding won the election, he made Harvey ambassador to the Court of St. James in London.
Ambassador Harvey wasted no time in making a fool of himself. He showed up dressed like a minister from the previous century, in satin knee breeches and silver-buckled slippers. He gave a speech at a London club questioning whether women had souls. In another speech, delivered before the Pilgrims Society, he claimed that the U.S. had fought in World War I "reluctantly and laggardly" to save its own skin. Almost immediately, Harvey was condemned on both sides of the Atlantic. Harding distanced himself from his ambassador's views.
In 1924, Congress passed the Rogers Act, an attempt to create a corps of professional career diplomats. But the temptation to reward political allies with ambassadorships has only grown.
Sondland, a hotelier who gave a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee, was made the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Unlike Harvey, who had real clout, Sondland was mainly distinguished by his willingness to give away his own money.
As ambassador, Sondland undermined his State Department colleagues by serving as a back channel during Trump's attempted shakedown of the Ukrainian government. He was also overheard conducting a sensitive conversation with the president on his personal cellphone in a Kiev restaurant, a security breach that a former CIA official called "insane."
Under Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, roughly 70% of ambassadorial posts went to Foreign Service Officers -- professionals who spent years training for such a post. The other 30% have been political appointments. Some of those are competent foreign-policy veterans; others have country expertise from working in business or the nonprofit sector; still others are chiefly qualified by their willingness to pour money into their patron's political campaign. Under Trump, the number of political appointments rose to 43%.
President Jimmy Carter had attempted to reform the system, promising a merit-based process overseen by a bipartisan screening board, and Congress made another attempt to limit political appointments with the Foreign Service Act of 1980. But the pay-for-play system continued, spurred on by campaign costs and the aspirations of the wealthy.
President-elect Joe Biden, who had a clear view of this system as the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years, now has a chance to reform it. It is unclear whether he will.
While his primary opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren vowed that no ambassadorial posts would go to donors or bundlers, Biden demurred when asked about the issue earlier this month, saying only that he would "appoint the best people possible." Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, has sponsored a bill that would require would-be ambassadors to disclose their country knowledge and language skills in detail, along with any political contributions given or bundled over the previous 10 years.
Ambassadors are responsible for hundreds of government employees and have a hand in most every aspect of American policy within the borders of their host nation. "Would you want a campaign contributor to be the captain of an aircraft carrier?" asked Jett. "Obviously not. This is a national security issue."
Beyond the inherent risk of giving such a sensitive job to anyone but the most competent candidate, the practice of nominating donors demoralizes the Foreign Service, wastes opportunities to develop future leaders and presents the world with a cynical face. It is an especially dangerous practice when Trump has been working to reframe foreign policy as a more contingent set of arrangements where there are no permanent bonds, only interests.
Perhaps there was once a time when American alliances were strong enough to withstand a few Sondlands, but that is far less true today than it was four years ago. If Biden is serious about restoring America's standing in the world, he should entrust that task to professionals.

’Cyberpunk 2077’ was supposed to be the biggest video game of the year. What happened?

Texto completo: The hype around "Cyberpunk 2077" had been building for nearly a decade.
When CD Projekt Red, the Polish studio behind the video game, announced the title in 2012, it was billed as a gripping, free-flowing saga that would immerse players in a lifelike sci-fi universe. Since then, fans have been treated to impressive teaser trailers; buy-in from celebrities including Keanu Reeves, Grimes and ASAP Rocky; and headlines heralding it as the most anticipated title of the year, if not the century.
The game is set in a dystopian future in which digital nomads navigate a high-stakes world of corporate espionage (with Reeves as their guide) and augment their bodies with high-tech weaponry. Players, especially those using next-generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft, were promised a revolutionary experience, with extensive character customization options and an expansive world to explore. Eight million people preordered copies, sight unseen, ahead of its December release.
In July 2018, as anticipation for the game neared a crescendo across Twitter, one user tweeted at the official "Cyberpunk 2077" account: “Will there be memes in the game?” The account responded: “Whole game is going to be a meme.”
The tweet was somewhat prescient — but not in the way developers had hoped.
Since the release of "Cyberpunk 2077" on Dec. 10, thousands of gamers have created viral videos featuring a multitude of glitches and bugs — many hilarious — that mar the game. They include tiny trees covering the floors of buildings, tanks falling from the sky and characters standing up, inexplicably pantsless, while riding motorcycles.
These videos depict a game that is virtually unplayable: rife with errors, populated by characters running on barely functional artificial intelligence, and largely incompatible with the older gaming consoles meant to support it. Fans are livid.
So many gamers demanded refunds from distributors this week that they overwhelmed Sony’s customer service representatives and even briefly took down one of its corporate sites. In response, Sony and Microsoft said they would offer full refunds to anyone who purchased "Cyberpunk 2077" through their online stores; Sony even pulled the title.
Cyberpunk’s rollout is one of the most visible disasters in the history of video games — a high-profile flameout in the midst of the holiday shopping season by a studio widely considered an industry darling. It shows the pitfalls gaming studios can face when building so-called Triple-A games, titles backed by years of development and hundreds of millions of dollars.
But it is also a tale that insiders said they saw coming for months, based on CD Projekt Red’s history of game development and warning signs that Cyberpunk 2077 might not live up to its sky-high expectations.
The View From Warsaw
CD Projekt Red was founded in Warsaw, Poland, in the 1990s by two high school friends, Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński, during a time of transformation and growth in the gaming industry. (CD-ROM discs were a novel innovation back then.) The two began importing games from the United States, and essentially repackaging and republishing them in Poland.
“By the time school was out we had both become truants, skipping classes to play games,” Iwiński said in an oral history of the studio.
Early employees who spoke to The New York Times described the company’s leaders as deft marketers, storytellers and artistic visionaries. They said that their enthusiasm for their games often ran ahead of their engineering and technical prowess. The employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
The company’s ambitions were astronomical early on, as were some of its failures. In the early aughts, CD Projekt Red made a play to develop The Witcher, a popular series of books by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, into an immersive video game franchise.
But the first Witcher game, released in 2007, was buggy and stuffed with more features than it could support. Former employees who worked on the game said it would take three to five minutes to load basic screens.
Employees said that during game development, there was a general attitude of building more things themselves rather than sometimes licensing other so-called “middleware” — or supporting software — from other companies with greater expertise. As a result, the developers created worse versions of features that had been perfected by other companies.
Still, the Witcher series gained the studio an early following and fan base. The studio received the most acclaim for "The Witcher 3," which won awards for its detailed universe and rich storytelling. Like earlier titles, it was buggy from the outset, frustrating players. But most fans accepted what they saw as a kind of test-and-release culture around CD Projekt Red games: a willingness to put out projects that were not yet problem-free.
Smoke and Mirrors on the Marketing Front
Then came "Cyberpunk 2077." First announced in 2012 and based loosely on a tabletop role-playing game created in 1988, the title was CD Projekt Red’s first attempt at creating a new, futuristic world.
It was to be set in Night City, a darkly dystopian megacity where humans and machines were fused together and repackaged as mercenaries, carrying out sabotage missions against evil corporations. The game would combine elements from some of sci-fi’s greatest hits: "Strange Days" meets "Blade Runner" meshed with "The Matrix."
To hammer that point home, CD Projekt Red cast a familiar famous face in the game: Reeves. At a development conference in 2019, the actor burst onto the stage in a cloud of smoke after a video revealed his character.
“Let me tell you, the feeling of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking,” Reeves said at the event. (A spokeswoman for Reeves did not respond to a request for comment.)
Inside CD Projekt Red, it was a very different story. Developers were increasingly concerned with some of the grand promises being made by management on the promotional marketing tour. Far into the game’s development, former employees said, the hyper-customizable and endlessly explorable world being sold to players was nowhere close to manifesting.
By 2019, chatter began to circulate in Polish game development circles that CD Projekt Red was way behind schedule with "Cyberpunk 2077," even with a release date set for the following April. Some saw the departure of top executives — including key board members — as major warning signs.
On Glassdoor, a site on which people can rate their previous employers, current and former CD Projekt Red workers said there was chaos behind the scenes: Office rumors spreading on Discord servers, misleading deadlines set by managers, infighting among the company’s top brass, and incompetence and poor planning leading to unnecessary “crunch,” a term for overworking employees to produce games under a tight deadline. Longtime engineering staff left the company as a result of overwork.
“The owners treat the company as a machine to earn money, and do not see employees as people but more like data in the table,” one former employee wrote on the site.
Delay, Delay, Delay
This January, CD Projekt Red tweeted that the game’s release had been delayed until Sept. 17, because there was “still work to be done.” Then, in March, the coronavirus pandemic caused CD Projekt Red to send its workforce home.
Though the company said remote work would not hurt Cyberpunk’s chances of a September release, executives eventually announced further delays. The game was pushed to Nov. 19 in order to “fix a lot of bugs.” It was the same story in October, when the game’s release date was pushed to Dec. 10, at the height of the holiday shopping season.
Inside CD Projekt Red, as executives and communications staff geared up for a wide release, the problems were evident. While developers had created a functioning game for PC users, Cyberpunk was glitchy and crashed frequently on next-generation consoles like the PlayStation 5 and the new Xbox devices. Even worse, the game barely ran on older consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Typically, game developers send early copies of new titles to reviewers with ample lead time. But CD Projekt Red kept "Cyberpunk 2077" under wraps for as long as it could. The company only shared advance copies of the PC version with gaming publications and news organizations, previewing the best possible version of "Cyberpunk" to reviewers who would post their ratings online just days before the game’s release.
For months, reviewers, including those at The New York Times, tried to obtain review copies for the new game consoles released by Sony and Microsoft this year. Stephanie Bayer, a spokeswoman for CD Projekt Red, said in a previous email correspondence that the company would “hold off sending our console codes until close to launch” so that they could “send them securely.” That never happened.
Early reviews mentioned some issues with bugs, but the impressions were largely positive. Excitement continued to build until the game was released Dec. 10.
Eager fans were thrilled to finally be playing the game for the first time. Ashley Shoate, a DJ in Northville, Michigan, said she was amazed at the detail on her PlayStation 5 and loved the ability to customize her character, literally, to the teeth.
Then came the bugs. Shoate said it was impossible for her character to complete basic tasks like running, dodging and picking up weapons. Steering a car was so challenging that she felt like she was “drunk driving.” On one mission, Shoate had to sneak up and kill an enemy with a katana.

Texto completo: The youngest victim of the 2007 massacre in Baghdad’s Nisour Square, committed by Blackwater mercenaries whom Donald Trump pardoned Tuesday, was a 9-year-old boy named Ali Kinani.
In a 2010 documentary, journalist Jeremy Scahill interviewed Ali’s father, Mohammed Hafedh Abdulrazzaq Kinani, who spoke of how he’d welcomed the U.S. invasion of his country and brought along his son to greet U.S. soldiers. “The first day the American Army entered Baghdad, I handed out juice and candy in the street to celebrate our liberation from Saddam,” said Kinani. Scahill called him “that rare personification of the neoconservative narrative about the U.S. invasion.”
On Sept. 16, 2007, Kinani was driving toward the traffic circle at Nisour Square with his sister, her children and Ali when guards from Blackwater opened fire with machine guns and grenade launchers. (Blackwater, a private security company, has since changed its name to Academi.) Ali was one of 17 people killed. According to the Washington Post, a U.S. military report found that there had been no provocation. “It was obviously excessive, it was obviously wrong,” a military official told the paper. An FBI investigator reportedly described it as the “My Lai Massacre of Iraq.”
The U.S. Embassy offered Ali’s family a $10,000 condolence payment. After initially refusing the money, they donated half of it to the family of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq. “They wanted to do that to honor and acknowledge the sacrifice of those men and women that had come over to Iraq to fight for them and free them from Saddam Hussein,” Paul Dickinson, a lawyer who represented Kinani and others in a civil suit against Blackwater, told me.
Gen. Raymond Odierno, then the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, wrote to Ali’s mother, “In the face of your family’s own personal tragedy, your act of kindness and compassion for grieving American families is truly remarkable.”
Until Tuesday, the American system worked to give Ali’s family a modicum of justice. Blackwater settled with the family. The guards were prosecuted criminally. The process was torturous, with several roadblocks, but powerful figures in the United States were determined to see it through. After a judge dismissed the charges on procedural grounds, Vice President Joe Biden promised, in a 2010 news conference in Baghdad, that there would be an appeal. “The United States is determined, determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people,” he said.
Eventually three of the Blackwater guards — Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard — were convicted of voluntary manslaughter and other charges. A fourth, Nicholas Slatten, was convicted of murder and last year sentenced to life in prison. Kinani moved to America and became a citizen, though he was back in Iraq when the BBC reached him Wednesday. Until just days ago, he’d felt that the legal system in the United States had been “very fair with me,” he said.
Then came Tuesday’s pardon spree, which included the Blackwater killers along with some Russiagate felons, corrupt ex-congressmen and others. It was perhaps not surprising that the president acted to free the mercenaries; Trump’s enthusiasm for war crimes is well known, and last year he pardoned three men accused or convicted of them. Because of Biden’s words in 2010, some conservatives called the perpetrators of the Nisour Square massacre the “Biden four,” giving Trump an extra incentive to let them go. Erik Prince, who founded Blackwater, is a close Trump ally and the brother of his education secretary, Betsy DeVos.
Neither the predictability of these pardons, however, nor our dulled capacity for shock lessens their grotesqueness. The last days of Trump’s reign have been an orgy of impunity as he hands out indulgences like party favors and rubs America’s face in his power to put his supporters beyond ordinary law. On Wednesday, Trump pardoned even more cronies, including, most egregiously, his former campaign chair Paul Manafort, a likely reward for Manafort’s help undermining Robert Mueller’s investigation. But even in this low moment, the pardons of the Blackwater killers stand out for their depravity.
They also exemplify a core tenet of Trumpism: absolute license for some and absolute submission for others. Nowhere is that truer than in Trump’s conception of the relationship between U.S. soldiers and paramilitaries and foreigners.
Last year, Trump intervened to reverse a demotion of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL special operations chief who took a celebratory photo with a corpse and was described by men under his command as “freaking evil” and “toxic.” But the president didn’t just spare Gallagher. He lionized him, and his movement made him an icon. The New York Times described Gallagher “making appearances at influential conservative gatherings and rubbing elbows with Mr. Trump’s inner circle at Mar-a-Lago.”
You could argue that Trump has simply stripped pretense from the dynamics that always drove the “war on terror.” As Spencer Ackerman wrote in The Daily Beast, “Blackwater fed from the same American logic of occupation — the same impunity — that turned even those Iraqis willing to work for the U.S. into ‘local nationals’ who had to enter dining halls on U.S. military bases through separate doorways.”
But if the approach to Iraq that preceded Trump was infested with hypocrisy, that hypocrisy at least revealed an aspiration to a humane foreign policy. That aspiration did more than flatter the sensibilities of liberals and neoconservatives. It could be leveraged to allow a man like Kinani to make demands of the country that occupied his.
Trump’s pardon, Kinani told the BBC, made him feel as if Ali, who should now be 22, had been killed again. Before, he said, he felt that no one was “above the law.” No more.
“I feel I’m nothing today. I feel I’m nothing. I lost my son, and I feel I’m nothing,” Kinani said. By all indications, the president of the United States agrees.

A standing rib roast is a celebratory choice for a crowd, but in this year of shrunken gatherings, you can go small. A gorgeous block of rib-eye with only a single, massive bone from Heritage Foods can serve four, or two with leftovers. The lush, tender beef raised in Texas is a cross between Akaushi, a Japanese Wagyu breed, and American Angus. Let it sit at room temperature for two hours, place it bone-side down in a cast-iron skillet or roasting pan and sear it at 475 degrees for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 until the internal temperature reaches 120. (It might take less time than you expect.) Let it rest out of the oven, tented with foil, for 20 minutes before carving. It will creep up to about 130 degrees for medium-rare.
— Single Bone Rib-Eye Roast, starting at $124, 2.5 to 4 pounds, heritagefoods.com.

Italy Turns to Flower Power to Help Spread Vaccine Message

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
ROME — This has been an ugly year for Italy.
The first wave of the coronavirus took the country by surprise and killed tens of thousands. The second wave somehow took the government by surprise and has killed thousands more. And Italians, desperate for the new vaccine, have struggled to get their hands on simple flu shots or to understand if they will have to be home — and stay home — for the holidays.
To brighten things up as Italians await the vaccine, the government has turned to urban planner and architect Stefano Boeri. Best known for making so-called vertical forests out of Milan skyscrapers, Boeri has sought to help his country with architectural flower power — designing 1,500 pavilions with a primrose theme where the vaccine will be distributed.
“The primrose is the first flower after the winter, it’s something even a child knows,” Boeri said in an interview, calling his vision for the building design “a strong message that everyone can understand.”
Italy has run with the proposal. On Sunday, medical workers received the first vaccinations under posters bearing the country’s official slogan for the program, “With a flower, Italy comes back to life.”
Critics have found the government’s emphasis on Milanese design a little misplaced in a pandemic.
“A clown show,” proclaimed one Italian member of the European Parliament. “Idiots,” offered a prominent commentator. “I don’t want a primrose,” protested a top Italian economist, Carlo Cottarelli. “I want an anti COVID vaccine!”
But Boeri rejects the cynicism. “Flowers are serious,” he wrote on Twitter, and in the interview he explained why the primrose was the ideal image for Italy’s vaccination program, which kicked off Sunday.
“It’s one thing to go get vaccinated in a container or in a military field hospital and it’s another to go into a luminous space in the form of a flower,” he said.
The project took root about a month ago, when Boeri received a call from Domenico Arcuri, Rome’s special commissioner for the coronavirus emergency. Arcuri explained, he said, that although hospitals and empty gyms would be the main vaccination points, there would also be a need for external, temporary pavilions to be created. The program to vaccinate at least 40 million Italians to reach herd immunity would last for at least a year and a half.
Boeri immediately agreed to help.
Like many in northern Italy, he has lost close friends and family to the coronavirus. He said that while the pandemic cast a pall over the year and the country, that made the flashes of generosity and kindness, professionalism and sacrifice shine even brighter.
“The demonstrations of generosity were beautiful,” said Boeri, adding that Italy’s vibrant volunteer sector “at times substituted the lacunae of the state.” It was in that spirit that he and his team, which took no compensation, labored. “It was the least we could do.”
He and Arcuri agreed that they needed a single, coherent image to spread the word and inspire people to roll up their sleeve.
Boeri said he and his team worked furiously over two weeks to come up with something. They sought an image, he said, that could be universally understood as positive “by a 4-year-old or an intellectual in the north or a young migrant.”
He said they excluded antagonistic images that could “promote anxiety,” like a simple graphic of a bar crossing out the spiky virus, but were also careful not to promote the notion that a vaccine would set you free. So they nixed proposals like an image of two young people wrapped in an embrace, or of a mask flying away into the uninfected ether.
When the flower idea emerged, it immediately resonated.
“We began to think that the message had to be so direct that even the pavilions should resemble flowers,” Boeri said.
The next question became which flower to choose, a complicated decision in a country where flowers are often identified with political parties.
“We entered in a madness about the relationship between politics and botany,” he said.
Boeri first thought of a daisy, but then he and his team recalled that it was affiliated with a now defunct center-left party. They dismissed an Alpine flower, which is the symbol of the nationalist League. They flirted with the idea of the yellow sunflower, but it seemed too close to the bright yellow stars of Italy’s populist Five Star Movement.
But once the primrose entered the picture, it struck them as a no-brainer.
Boeri presented the plan to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the country’s powerful health minister, Roberto Speranza. They expressed their pleasure with the “positivity of the message” and thanked him for his work, he said. But since the primrose comes in many different hues, “we discussed a little bit on the color.”
Conte liked the fuchsia chosen by Boeri, but also thought yellow would be nice, the architect said. Fuchsia was the final choice.
The government will now open bids for construction companies and publicity firms, which could make alterations. But as it stands now, the pavilions are to be built from wood and biodegradable fabric, and have airflow, waiting rooms and light. They are to be inviting hubs of inoculation.
The promotional video for the project shows flowers blooming in thousands of piazzas across the peninsula. Models of the round white pavilions, stamped from above with fuchsia flowers were imagined in the Piazza del Popolo in Rome, the Piazza del Duomo in Milan and in Trieste and Naples and elsewhere. The designs looked as if Scooby-Doo had taken a spin through Italy in a giant Mystery Machine van, losing tires along the way.
Boeri said smaller towns would have flower-branded gazebos. In any case, the primrose would mark the spot where vaccines could be found. Some have even proposed that the vaccinated should wear primrose pins to identify themselves.
“The primrose is the symbol of the vaccination,” Boeri said. “Wherever you get vaccinated, there will be a primrose.”

The party that introduced the Design Works of Bedford-Stuyvesant textile collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in October 1971 drew quite a crowd.
Ethel Kennedy was in attendance along with Babe Paley, the socialite; so were Diana Vreeland, the editor of Vogue, and Bunny Mellon, the philanthropist and horticulturalist. The guest who got the most attention that evening, as guests perused the array of textiles featuring African motifs in bold colorways, was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
“It was a very glamorous evening,” said Hermine Mariaux, 87, the homes editor for House and Garden at the time, who attended the gala and recalled the Senegalese dancers that performed. “It was the very first party like that held at The Met. Prior to then, the museum never would have engaged in commercial activities, but they agreed to it, because Design Works of Bedford-Stuyvesant was important to Jackie.”
The collection was an initiative of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., the first community development corporation to be established in the United States. The result of legislation championed by Sen. Robert Kennedy in 1966, the corporation sought to stimulate the local economy of the neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant by instituting programs for employment, education, health care and development.
In 1969, inspired by her brother-in-law’s efforts, Onassis created Design Works to help amplify the talents of artists living in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She asked her friends, D.D. and Leslie Tillett, the husband-and-wife design team behind Tillett Textiles, to collaborate. The couple’s vivid, large-scale, screen-printed fabrics — created by hand in their small Manhattan-based printing operation — were favored by top designers and influential figures, including Onassis, who used the textiles for upholstery and draperies in the living quarters of The White House.
The Tilletts had invested in communities outside the United States, said their grandson Patrick McBride, 48, who now owns and operates Tillett Textiles; Leslie died in 1992, D.D. in 2008. They taught printing and design techniques to South Korean producers of raw silk and helped bring their products to the U.S., and consulted with emerging businesses in China, Lesotho and Peru.
“Jackie suggested to my grandparents that they turn their attention to helping groups in hard-hit areas of this country and they loved the idea,” McBride said. “They were very enthusiastic about inspiring talent and design in Bedford-Stuyvesant and to teaching members of the community their intensive hand production processes.”
Etiquette expert Letitia Baldrige and Ted Kennedy’s secretary were among those solicited to fund Design Works of Bedford-Stuyvesant, according to documents in Onassis’ personal correspondence cataloged at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. The Tilletts signed on as advisers for a $1 fee. The idea was that the couple would teach their signature techniques for silk-screen design and printing to young people in Bedford-Stuyvesant who would go on to produce hand-printed fabrics for the design trade on their own.
The Tilletts did outreach to find residents who were interested in learning the craft. Carlos Ortiz was 22 and about to graduate from the Fashion Institute of Technology when a professor introduced him to Leslie Tillett.
“He went on to be a great mentor to me,” said Ortiz, now 72, who was with Design Works from its inception and soon became its chief colorist. “Leslie told me: ‘You will learn how to do it all. And he followed through. They taught me everything from design to mixing colors and pigment to printing.”’
The fabrics created by Design Works of Bedford-Stuyvesant were designed by members of the community, led by first Calister Thomas and then Sherl Nero (both now deceased), and drawn from African history, McBride said. Motifs included abstract fish scales, zebra stripes, oversize banana leaves, roosters, and cowrie shells along with bold geometric prints and stylized abstracts. “The colors were incredibly saturated,” he said.
In the 1970s, ready for a slower pace, his grandparents moved operations to Sheffield, Massachusetts, where they’ve remained. With views of the Berkshire mountain range, the Tillett screen-printing facility’s pastoral setting feels more like a small artist colony than a fabric manufacturer with clients all over the globe. McBride travels between there and New York City; his mother, Kathleen Tillett, who works in the business alongside him, lives on the property full-time.
The library there contains more than 900 patterns designed by the Tilletts dating back to the 1940s, including several created in collaboration with Design Works. “There are a lot of stories in those hundreds of patterns,” McBride said. “I felt like the Design Works story was one that needed to be told.”
McBride’s way of telling the tale now is to reintroduce the fabrics from the collaboration of Tillett and Design Works, with a portion of the profits to be donated to the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club. Four patterns in three colorways have recently become available to the trade. Tote bags, throw pillows and face masks in the patterns may be ordered through the company Instagram account. “We’ll release other patterns from Design Works gradually,” said McBride, noting that the fabrics are made of Belgian linen, which is more modern and luxurious than what was available during the 1970s.
“There has been a resurgence of using vibrant, rich colors in interiors,” he said. “People are feeling excited about color. Releasing these fabrics in their original saturated rich, tones is authentic to history and lends itself to what’s going on in the design world today.”
Before it shut down in 1978, Design Works was housed in a five-story building in Bedford-Stuyvesant with a ground-floor boutique. In addition to decorative fabrics, the initiative also produced ready-to-wear fashion, stoneware and jewelry in limited quantities. The textiles, which were distributed by Connaissance Fabrics throughout the country, however, became the prime focus.
“It was a vertical operation, we designed, mixed colors, printed and cured the fabric on site, and handled shipping. It was rare for all of that to happen in one location back then,” said Ortiz, who will bring his own collection to market next spring.
Onassis incorporated Design Works fabrics into the Fifth Avenue apartment she shared with her husband, Aristotle. The rooms were featured in the November 1971 issue of House Beautiful. In a photo of the library, the sofa is upholstered in Fish Head Plaid, an abstract of crisscross floral and polka dot motifs that strikes a whimsical note among the French antiques, a rare needlepoint rug and 19th century volumes in the floor-to-ceiling bookcases.
Mariaux also used textiles from Design Works in her Manhattan apartment during the early 1970s. “I loved the patterns. They were pretty dramatic for the time. My favorite was a natural canvas ground-cloth printed with espresso brown cowrie shells,” she said.
“The collection was very well received, not just because people really wanted to support the community of Bedford-Stuyvesant — which they did — but because the fabrics Design Works created were especially unique and beautiful,” Mariaux said. “It’s nice to know they will be available once again.”

The $900 billion pandemic relief package that President Donald Trump belatedly signed Sunday night gained steam Monday as an issue in the Georgia Senate runoffs, with the two Republican incumbents seeking to ride the tail winds of the stimulus bill and claim credit for helping to bring aid to the state.
“Help is on the way,” Sen. Kelly Loeffler tweeted Monday morning, applauding the stimulus package with its billions of dollars for vaccine distribution, schools and other beneficiaries, and a $600 payment to millions of Americans. She and her fellow incumbent, David Perdue, released a statement Sunday night thanking the president for finally approving the stimulus funds, avoiding the fact that Trump plunged the fate of the bill into turmoil last week by calling it “a disgrace” and demanding that direct payments be increased to $2,000.
At the same time, the two Democratic candidates — Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock — on Monday criticized the Republican-led Senate for dragging its feet for months on the bill. They called the $600 payments too small and seized on the president’s call for larger payments to bolster their position.
“David Perdue does not care about us, and $600 is a joke,” Ossoff told several hundred people at an outdoor get-out-the-vote rally with Warnock in DeKalb County, one of the suburban Atlanta counties that has become increasingly diverse over the past decade.
“You send me and Reverend Warnock to the Senate and we will put money in your pocket,” Ossoff said. He faces Perdue in the runoff, while Warnock is challenging Loeffler.
Perdue has been running ads attacking Ossoff for calling the $600 relief checks “a joke” even though the president had also called them far too small. Ossoff wrote on Twitter that Perdue hadn’t even favored a first round of direct payments last spring.
With Election Day in Georgia just over a week away, Trump’s initial refusal to sign the stimulus package had put Loeffler and Perdue in a delicate position. Both had supported the measure that passed with a $600 direct payment, but both are strong supporters of Trump and risked angering him if they publicly broke with him on the need to sign the bill.
“The president continues to put both incumbent Republican senators in difficult places during a very hotly contested Senate runoff,” said Bill Crane, a longtime Republican political operative and analyst in Georgia.
Despite the confusion, the president tweeted Sunday that he would make a final campaign appearance on behalf of the two senators in Dalton, Georgia, a carpet manufacturing hub in the north, on the eve of the election. The two races have drawn national attention and a record influx of money because of their potentially pivotal roles in determining the balance of power in the Senate.
If both Ossoff and Warnock win, there will be a 50-to-50 split, with control of the chamber shifting to the Democrats because of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ ability to break ties.
The fate of the two senators in the unusual dual runoff may come down to turnout in Dalton and the rest of northwestern Georgia, a conservative area where Trump won 70% or more of the vote in most counties. His decision to visit the region, where he remains popular, appeared to be aimed at a last-minute effort to motivate Republican voters.
The election seemed to be headed for a record turnout in a runoff, with 2.1 million Georgians having already cast ballots either at early voting sites or by mail-in ballots. The heaviest turnout has been in Democratic areas around Atlanta.
Crane said he saw advantages for the Democrats in early voting, voter enthusiasm and money. “The Democrats are killing in mail voting,” Crane said, also noting that 76,000 new voters had registered since the November election, according to an analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
“That again speaks to enthusiasm and would play to the Democratic side,” he said.
Republicans have expressed concern that Trump’s repeated complaints about “rigged elections” — a false claim he has made to explain his loss to Joe Biden — will discourage voters in their party from turning out for the Senate runoffs. Crane said the message from far-right commentators about voter fraud had endured in the state, with some Georgians confused about whether their vote will count. “Georgia is still conflicted about ‘should we vote at all,’ ” he said.
With early voting continuing through December, the campaigns of Warnock and Ossoff focused Monday on encouraging voters to cast ballots. Their drive-in event, held in the parking lot of a Baptist church, featured performances by several rappers, including Shelley FKA DRAM, J.I.D, Tokyo Jetz and BRS Kash.
Ossoff, who runs a documentary production company, and Warnock, the pastor of a historic Atlanta church, encouraged their supporters to head to early voting sites or submit their ballots in drop boxes. “The whole country is watching Georgia voters to see what we will do at this historic moment,” Ossoff said.
Both Ossoff and Warnock — as well as Democrats on Capitol Hill — viewed the stimulus checks as a winning issue and had seized on both the smaller payments and the president’s opposition to the stimulus package in an effort to boost their chances in Georgia. On Monday, hours before the House of Representatives voted to advance the $2,000 stimulus checks demanded by Trump, Ossoff tweeted, “@Perduesenate, when will you commit to $2,000 relief checks for Georgians?"

This year, many Americans left the places where it was still possible to encounter one another. White-collar workers stopped going downtown, past homeless encampments and to lunch counters with minimum-wage staff. The well-off stopped riding public transit, where in some cities they once sat alongside commuting students and custodial workers. Diners stopped eating in restaurants, where their tips formed the wages of the people who served them.
Americans also stopped broadly sharing libraries, movie theaters, train stations and public school classrooms, the spaces that still created common experience in increasingly unequal communities. Even the DMV, with its cross-section of life in a single room, wasn’t that anymore.
Instead, people who could afford it retreated into smaller, more secure worlds during the pandemic. And that has made it harder to see all the inequality that worsened this year: the unemployment that soared even as the stock market did, the eviction threats that grew as home prices hit new highs.
In another way, however, the inequality already present in the economy became more visible than ever this year. With delivery services, restaurant couriers and personal shopping apps, low-wage workers were now — in far larger numbers — coming right to the doorstep of the well-off. Standing there in masks, their economic precarity was exposed.
“What these apps do is force people who live stable lives to confront the instability of working-class lives — very directly and for their own benefit,” said Louis Hyman, an economic historian at Cornell. “Before these apps, it was easy to pretend that wasn’t really happening,” he said of the yawning gaps in the economy. “There were ways to imagine those delivery people were not emblematic of anything.”
We never thought too much about the Domino’s delivery drivers, he said. They were just high school kids. Until, by the 2000s, they were not.
Historians are watching this moment with a fraught question: Will there emerge a broader demand for structural reforms to address inequality, or a further retreat by the affluent from its problems? Recessions, they say, can clarify where the economy is heading. The companies and industries that prosper during them often anticipate how society will change in the years to come.
The advertising industry grew during the Great Depression, as companies fought for scarce consumer dollars and sold escapism in alcohol, tobacco and entertainment. The ad industry anticipated the American consumer culture of the postwar era. Accounting firms and banks boomed, too, out of the New Deal-era regulation that came from the Depression.
Later, the recession of the early 1990s presaged the downsizing and outsourcing of even middle-class jobs, and the rise of consulting firms to manage that shift. And out of the wreckage of the foreclosure crisis, institutional investors foresaw a new market for single-family rental homes.
Today, the companies that are thriving — some with eye-popping IPOs — have harnessed both the particular circumstances of social distancing and the longer-term trends of a society pulling apart. These companies enable you to hold a meeting without visiting the office, to buy a home without glad-handing a real estate agent, to eat restaurant meals without entering a restaurant, to enjoy entertainment without theaters, to shop without retail.
They “remind us of a long historical process of social fragmentation that is now more obvious than ever,” said David Kennedy, a Stanford historian who has written extensively about the Great Depression. “It seems to me that what they reveal is how easy it is, and how big a market there is, in our society for the kinds of services that keep us distanced from one another.”
There is a tension, though, between the isolation of the well-off and the visible dependence of many of their conveniences on low-wage labor. Kennedy is deeply pessimistic that real change will emerge from it. The Great Depression created pain more broadly across the economy and lasted a decade, opening a larger political window for reform.
“It’s been a very long time since people across the income spectrum felt that acting in the collective interest was going to be more beneficial than acting in individual interests,” said Margaret O’Mara, a historian at the University of Washington.
In Seattle around her, people were already starting to broach these questions before the pandemic. Young tech workers were enthusiastic early adopters of food delivery services and apps like Uber and Lyft. And there was already a clear dissonance, she said, between the experience of gig workers and the spiraling housing prices and gleaming new construction tied to Seattle’s tech boom.
That was before it became awkwardly clear that the gig workers were now risking their health, too.
Back in the spring, Harvard historian Lizabeth Cohen wrote an article for The Atlantic expressing hope that, as in the New Deal era, America could respond to economic calamity by transforming itself into a more equitable society. It was early in the pandemic, when everyone was still celebrating the economy’s new heroes: the grocery store clerks, delivery workers, janitors and front-line nurses. That was before the pandemic became fully politicized, before the tech IPOs and before Congress allowed unemployment aid to expire.
As the pandemic has dragged on, and as the gap has widened in how Americans experience it, Cohen has grown less sure that lessons of empathy and unity from the Great Depression can apply today. We are farther apart now than even six months ago, let alone before the pandemic.
“Just think about the pathways and where they took you — you went in and got coffee in a place where you saw people who were being paid by the hour, not by the month,” Cohen said. Those small moments vanished. Within the middle-class neighborhoods and second-home retreats where remote workers withdrew, there were no homeless people on the sidewalk.
“It seems there were fewer and fewer of those interactions, but they really were important for just expanding the social world you live in,” she said. “Maybe that’s the scariest dimension of this. The opportunities to interact with people who are not like yourself have shrunk.”
Hyman, however, is still optimistic, pointing out that there’s something powerful in how visible inequality becomes when a worker drops off a customer’s Whole Foods order.
“ That’s partially what made the industrial economy a better economy: images of children working in factories, the desperate poor of the 1930s,” he said. “Visibility is a good thing, that people are forced to confront it.”
His argument isn’t that consumers should feel bad about ordering takeout, or having their groceries delivered. It’s not the services that are the problem, he said; it’s the insecurity and low wages that come with doing that work in an economy that offers few opportunities to build wealth and limited access to benefits. Factory work wasn’t all that great, either. What we romanticize about it are the livable wages and benefits it provided for a time.
“The story of the 1930s is not making the jobs of the 1920s work better,” he said. “It’s creating new systems for the industrial workforce.”
After the pandemic, it’s likely some restaurant and retail jobs won’t come back. And those who did them may join the growing ranks of logistics workers: people who move things around warehouses, or move passengers around cities, or move packages and takeout around your neighborhood. That is a very different kind of workforce, in need of new systems.

Dr. H. Jack Geiger, who ran away to Harlem as a teenager and emerged a lifelong civil rights activist, helping to bring medical care and services to impoverished regions and to start two anti-war doctors groups that shared in Nobel Peace Prizes, died on Monday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 95.
His death was confirmed by David Shadrack Smith, his stepson.
Geiger was a leading proponent of “social medicine,” the idea that doctors should use their expertise and moral authority not just to treat illness but also to change the conditions that made people sick in the first place: poverty, hunger, discrimination, joblessness and lack of education.
“Jack redefined what it meant to be a physician,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the founding director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and the co-founder of the Children’s Health Fund. He added, by email, “He felt it was our right and responsibility as doctors to ‘treat’ hunger, poverty and disparities in health care, as directly and openly as we treat pneumonia or appendicitis.”
The social order, not medical services, determines health, Geiger said in “Out in the Rural,” a short documentary film made in 1970 about the first community health center in Mississippi. “I’ve never seen any use in what I call the Schweitzer bit,” he added, referring to the humanitarian Dr. Albert Schweitzer, “which is the idea that you stand around in whatever circumstances laying hands on people in the traditional medical way, waiting until they’re sick, curing them and then sending them back unchanged into an environment that overwhelmingly determines that they’re going to get sick.”
In the 1960s, Geiger was a co-founder, with Dr. Count Gibson, of community health centers in South Boston and in Mound Bayou, in the Mississippi Delta. They provided desperately needed health care but also food, sanitation, education, jobs and social services — what Geiger called “a road out” of poverty. The centers inspired a national network of clinics that now number more than 1,300 and serve about 28 million low-income patients at more than 9,000 sites.
“I don’t know if some of the Mississippi white power structure cares about dead Black babies or not,” Geiger said in the film, about the first center in Mississippi. “But if they don’t, even they can’t afford to say so publicly. We have been able to enter and to do things under the general umbrella of health that would have been much harder to do if we’d said we were here for economic development or for social change per se.”
Geiger was a founding member of two advocacy groups, Physicians for Social Responsibility, which shared the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to end the nuclear arms race, and Physicians for Human Rights, which shared the 1997 prize for working to ban land mines.
He rallied doctors in the Cold War era to speak out against what he saw as a myth being promoted by the government, that nuclear war could be survivable. On the contrary, he insisted, hospitals would be quickly overwhelmed, and even victims with treatable injuries would perish.
Drawing physicians out of the clinic and into the political fray “was a really signal event,” said Dr. Robert Gould, a pathologist in San Francisco and president of the Bay Area chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
In an email for this obituary sent in 2012, Geiger said he was driven in part by an outrage over injustice.
“I’ve been angry,” he wrote, “seeing terribly burned children in Iraq after the first Gulf War, or interviewing torture victims in the West Bank, or listening to Newt Gingrich say ghetto kids should learn to be part-time janitors and clean toilets (in another country, they called that Bantu Education). So anger doesn’t vanish, but is replaced by a determination to do something.”
Home Was a Way Station
Herman J. Geiger was born on Nov. 11, 1925, in Manhattan. (It was unclear what the J. stood for, but he was mostly called Jack throughout his life.) His father, Jacob, born in Vienna, was a physician; his mother, Virginia (Loewenstein) Geiger, who came from a village in central Germany, was a microbiologist. Both parents, who were Jewish, had emigrated to the United States as children. Geiger grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and their home was often a way station for relatives fleeing the Nazis.
“The last to appear were some cousins from my mother’s birthplace, Kirtorf,” Geiger said in the email. “When they got their visas to come to the U.S., they said, the Nazi authorities were furious. On the night before their departure, the authorities ordered all their neighbors to go out at twilight and stone their house. The neighbors all dutifully gathered — and threw loaves of bread instead.”
That story, Geiger said, taught him not to stereotype.
He skipped so many grades in the city’s public schools that he graduated from Townsend Harris High School (then in Manhattan, now in Queens) at 14. Too young to start college, he learned typing and shorthand and went to work as a copy boy for The New York Times. He also began hanging out at jazz joints, listening to Billie Holiday, Art Tatum and Fats Waller. His parents were often beside themselves, waiting up for him and sometimes even calling the bars to ask if “Jackie” was there.
Jack soon ran away from home and turned up, suitcase in hand, in Harlem’s Sugar Hill section on the doorstep of Canada Lee, a Black actor whom he had seen on Broadway and had gotten to know after talking his way backstage. Lee, once a teenage runaway himself, let young Jack sleep on the couch — after consulting with his parents — and though Jack sometimes returned home, he spent most of the next year in Harlem.
The year was 1940, and Lee’s home was a hub for writers, actors and musicians — Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Orson Welles, Paul Robeson, Billy Strayhorn, William Saroyan. The Black guests told harrowing stories of racism, and Harlem was seething over the mistreatment of Black troops at military bases in the South. Jack Geiger took it all in.
In 1941, with a loan from Lee, he began studying at the University of Wisconsin. He worked nights at a newspaper, The Madison Capitol Times. Because Madison had a curfew for anyone under 18, he said, “I am probably the only police reporter in history who had to get a special pass to be out at night.”
In 1943, after meeting James Farmer, the founder of the Congress of Racial Equality, Geiger started a chapter of the group in Madison. It was the height of World War II, and after turning 18 that year he left school to enlist in the merchant marine, which he chose because it was not racially segregated.
Rabble Rouser for Justice
Discharged in 1947, Geiger enrolled as a premed student at the University of Chicago. He discovered racial discrimination there — Black patients being excluded from certain hospitals, qualified Black students being rejected by the medical school. He fought the policies for three years and ultimately helped organize a 1,000-strong faculty and student protest strike — an activity virtually unheard of in that era.
He paid a price for his rabble-rousing. The American Medical Association wrote to medical schools warning of his “extracurricular activities.” No school would take him. He had, in effect, been blackballed.
Geiger went back to journalism for the next five years, as a science and medicine editor for the International News Service (later part of United Press International). It was, he said, “a gorgeous education” that let him read journals, attend conferences, interview researchers and, significantly, meet deans whom he could lobby to let him into medical school. In 1954, at 29, he was admitted to what is now Case Western Reserve University’s medical school in Cleveland.
During his last year at Case Western, he traveled to South Africa and worked with two physicians who were setting up a health center in an impoverished, disease-ridden region of the country called Pholela, which was then a Zulu reserve. A key to the center’s success was that local people — its own patients — worked there and helped run it.
For five months Geiger took care of patients, visiting thatch huts and cattle kraals, meeting traditional healers and seeing the huge improvements — pit latrines, vegetable gardens, children’s feeding programs — that the health center had brought to the region.
“I learned a little Zulu, including the three oral clicks in that language, which always made me drool, to the hilarity of my African teachers,” he wrote in a chapter he contributed to the 2013 book “Comrades in Health.”
Geiger’s time in Africa made him want a career in international health. He trained in internal medicine at Boston City Hospital and in epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
In the “freedom summer” of 1964, he traveled to Mississippi to help care for the civil rights workers who were pouring into the Deep South to campaign for voting rights. The next year, he organized medical care for the people who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.
“I took a long look around,” Geiger recalled of his first visit to Mississippi. He saw conditions much like those in South Africa: families living in shacks with no clean drinking water, toilets or sewers; sky-high rates of malnutrition, illness, infant death and illiteracy; few or no opportunities for residents to better themselves and escape. He did not have to travel to Africa to find people in trouble, he realized.
A Clinic in Mound Bayou
Under President Lyndon Johnson, the war on poverty had begun, and the Office of Economic Opportunity had been created to pay for projects to help the poor. Sponsored by Tufts University and armed with grants from the opportunity office, Geiger, Gibson, Dr. John Hatch and others set up a health center in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a small, poor Black town where most people were former cotton sharecroppers whose way of life had been wiped out by mechanization.
The center was a copy of the Pholela project. The clinic, which opened in 1967, treated the sick but also used its grant money to dig wells and privies and set up a library, farm cooperative, office of education, high school equivalency program and other social services.
The clinic “prescribed” food for families with malnourished children — to be purchased from Black-owned groceries — and the bills were paid out of the center’s pharmacy budget.
The governor complained, and a federal official was sent to Mound Bayou to scold Geiger for misusing pharmacy funds, which, the official said, were meant to cover drugs to treat disease.
“Yeah,” Geiger replied, “well, the last time I looked in my medical textbooks, they said the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.”
The official, he said, “shut up and went back to Washington.”
Geiger helped found Physicians for Social Responsibility in 1961. The group argued that official predictions of the effects of nuclear war minimized the number of casualties and the extent of the destruction it would cause. At the group’s public meetings, Geiger’s job was “the bombing run” — offering a detailed account of what a 1-megaton nuclear bomb would do to the city in which the meeting was being held.
He had a resonant voice and a crisp, forceful delivery. His presentations left audiences stunned, according to a colleague in the group, Dr. Ira Helfand.
Geiger was a co-author of one of the first articles to look at the medical costs of nuclear war. The article, in The New England Journal of Medicine, predicted the fate of Boston in a nuclear strike — 2 million dead, a half-million injured and fewer than 10,000 hospital beds left in the entire state of Massachusetts. Doctors must “explore a new area of preventive medicine, the prevention of thermonuclear war,” the article said.
It was published in May 1962 — five months before the Cuban missile crisis, which took the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war.
Geiger’s marriage in 1951 to Mary Battle, an administrator and executive assistant in health care, ended in divorce in 1968. They had no children. (Battle died in a car accident in 1977.) In 1982, he married Nicole Schupf, a neuroscientist, public health researcher and professor at Columbia University.
In addition to his wife and his stepson, Smith, Geiger is survived by two stepgrandsons. An older sister, Ruth Ann, a schoolteacher, died in 1986.
In 1978, Geiger became a professor of community medicine at the City University of New York Medical School at City College of New York.
In his final years, which were marked by bladder cancer, lung cancer and blindness from glaucoma, he continued to write book chapters, articles and editorials and to give talks.
To the end he was an impassioned advocate for civil rights. In an essay published in 2016 by Physicians for Human Rights, he called for more action to fight the lead-poisoning of the water supply in Flint, Michigan, and to hold accountable the officials responsible for it.
With characteristic bluntness, he ascribed the contamination to “a contemptuous disregard for the health of people of color, especially if they are poor.”

Two and a half hours after being injected with a COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Taneisha Wilson was hit with the worst headache of her life.
In her home office in Cranston, Rhode Island, Wilson, 36, an emergency physician with a constitution she calls “horse-like,” laid her head down on the desk. Fighting a wave of nausea, she let out an involuntary groan loud enough to be heard by her husband in a room down the hall.
“Are you OK, babe?” he called.
“It felt like I got smacked,” Wilson recalled in an interview.
That is not how most people who get the vaccine feel afterward, but reactions like Wilson’s were not uncommon in the clinical trial results of the two COVID vaccines now being distributed across the country. Pfizer, the company that makes the one she received, reported that some 13% of recipients ages 18 to 55 had a bad headache after the first dose. About 16% of those who received the other vaccine, made by Moderna, in a late-stage trial had a reaction strong enough to prevent them from going about their daily routine.
As tens of millions of Americans await their turn for a shot, many are hungering for details about what to expect. So, at the request of friends, colleagues and reporters, some people like Wilson who were in the vanguard of the biggest vaccination program in U.S. history are beginning to offer their personal accounts.
The New York Times interviewed several dozen of the newly vaccinated in the days afterward. They recounted a wide spectrum of responses, from no reaction at all — “Can’t even tell I had the shot,” said a hospital worker in Iowa City, Iowa — to symptoms like uncontrolled shivering and “brain fog.” A nurse assistant in Glendora, California, wondered whether the fever he ran was a side effect of the vaccine or a sign that he had been infected by one of his COVID patients.
And there was a dizzying variety of sore arms. Some likened the pain to that from a flu shot; for others, it was considerably worse.
Like nearly every vaccine recipient who spoke to The Times for this article, Wilson stressed that she had no regrets about getting the shot, despite the headache, which was gone within 36 hours. The Food and Drug Administration has found the vaccines to be safe and remarkably effective. And public health leaders say mass vaccination is the only hope for controlling the virus that is now claiming the lives of close to 3,000 Americans a day.
But in these first weeks of vaccination, there is an inescapable element of suspense.
Along with a card reminding them when to get the necessary second dose, vaccine recipients are handed information on how to report side effects to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an app called V-Safe.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both rely on a genetic technology that has never before yielded a vaccine that won regulatory approval. They are authorized for emergency use only. Studies of their safety, including the cases of an Alaska health care worker and a Boston doctor who experienced severe allergic reactions after receiving their shots, are still underway.
And as Wilson crawled into bed at 10:30 on a weekday morning, she could not help but be “hyper-aware,” she said, “that I had just been vaccinated with this novel vaccine.”
Navigating a Brain Fog
As vaccines go, experts have agreed, the two being distributed now elicit more reactions than most.
At the Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown, West Virginia, Betty Shannon, 81, said some fellow residents had an upset stomach after becoming some of the nation’s first seniors to receive a COVID vaccine.
Lorenzo Alfonso, 34, a nurse assistant in California, was unusually tired and achy.
Delayna Frint, a nurse in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, said her arm was so sore after the shot that in order to hang intravenous therapy bags, she had to lower the stands.
But for infectious disease experts, a nation down for the count with post-vaccine malaise would be the best news in a long time. The side effects dissipate within a few days, and they are a signal, the experts say, that the vaccine is working.
“We call them ‘side’ effects, but it’s really just an effect,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania vaccinologist who is a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel. “This is what your immune response does when it’s responding to an infection.”
The vaccines each work by prompting the body to make a particular protein that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells; neither exposes the recipient to the virus itself. The presence of that protein in the body sets off the production of new antibodies that can destroy the protein — the key to providing protection against a future invasion of the actual virus. But the process also releases substances that can cause inflammation, which can result in fever, fatigue, headache and other symptoms.
Many more participants in the vaccine trials registered discomfort after the second dose, given three or four weeks later, than after the first. That is probably because by that time, the body is already primed to attack the protein, experts said.
Most of the reactions experienced by the 1.9 million Americans who received a vaccine this month had already been seen among the roughly 35,000 people who were vaccinated in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials. But experts expect new ones to appear: “If it’s a one-in-a-million thing, you need a million to see even one,” said Dr. Peter Doshi, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.
Some may be mild allergic reactions, like the “body-wide itching” and “mild, small hives along forearm” that Dr. Megan Hajjar of Farmington, Connecticut, described in a Facebook post with a video clip. Or they may be more severe, like the handful of cases of anaphylaxis that the CDC has already identified.
And others may simply be more intense versions of what the trials called “fatigue.” Alyson MacGregor, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University and an accomplished home chef, said she spent the day after her vaccination in a mental fog that turned her attempt at the most basic of meals into an inedible blob.
“I can’t believe I messed up ramen,” she told her husband that night.
She felt, she said, as if “there was a cloud over me, following me around.”
Debating Disclosure
The first several million doses of both vaccines are earmarked for health care workers and for nursing home residents who are at elevated risk of dying from COVID-19 if they become infected.
Public health leaders have estimated that more than 200 million Americans will need to be vaccinated to effectively prevent the virus from spreading. In polls, a substantial fraction have expressed hesitancy about receiving COVID vaccinations. And some front-line health workers have wrestled with whether discussing their own side effects might deter others from getting vaccinated.
“I do worry — is it going to encourage someone to have second thoughts?” said Dr. Matthew Harris, 38, an emergency medicine doctor in Great Neck, New York.
Harris was up all night with a fever, shivering underneath a blanket, after receiving the first shot. He had joint pain in his wrists and shoulders that lasted into the next day.
But he had already published a post on Facebook about receiving his shot. It had been an especially emotional moment for him, nine months to the day after he was hospitalized with a severe case of COVID and did not know whether he would survive to see his wife and two young children again.
“Please,” one nonmedical friend commented on his vaccination post, “let us know what the experience is like!!!”
So the next day, he posted about his reaction, with the hashtag #stillworthit.
“Everyone has read, ‘This is the light at the end of the tunnel,’” Harris said in an interview. “But are people going to feel great 100% of the time after this vaccine? No. And if we’re not honest with them, how can we expect them to trust us?”
Dr. Sylvia Owusu-Ansah, an emergency physician in Pittsburgh, has also opted to chronicle her vaccine side effects on Facebook. She is African American, and at the livestreamed inoculation earlier this month, she told reporters that she “wanted to share with my community that it is OK.” Distrust of the vaccine is particularly high among Black Americans, because of a history of mistreatment of Black people by the medical establishment.
In the name of transparency, Owusu-Ansah recorded “mild muscle aches and pains with left arm soreness” on day one and “nasal congestion, mild headache” on days three through five — pointedly beginning her posts with “I AM STILL HERE!”
Another Dose
Forty-eight hours after Wilson’s post-vaccine headache sent her to bed, she returned to her job in the emergency room at a hospital. Like many hospitals around the nation, its intensive care unit was crowded with COVID cases. On one recent shift, Wilson said, there were 12 patients in the critical care bay and only one bed available in the ICU to take them.
“These are people having strokes, myocardial infarction that need catheterization,” she recalled. “You have to understand the reality.”
That time, Wilson said, it wasn’t a vaccine side effect that made her feel as if she was going to throw up.
She is scheduled for her second dose of the vaccine next month.

Did You Miss Out on Vacation This Year? You’re Not Alone

In a typical year, New York employees of the magazine publisher Condé Nast must use their vacation days before late December or lose them — a common policy across corporate America.
But early this month, the company sent employees an email saying they could carry up to five vacation days into next year, an apparent acknowledgment that many scrimped on days off amid the long hours and travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic. “The carry-over will be automatic, and there is nothing further you need to do,” the email said.
Condé Nast was not alone in scrambling to make end-of-year arrangements for vacation-deprived workers. Some employers, however, have been less accommodating.
“It’s a big issue we’re seeing now — competing requests for time off over the next two weeks,” said Allan S. Bloom, an employment lawyer at Proskauer in New York. “Clients are struggling to figure it out.”
Bloom and other lawyers and human resources experts said there was no clear pattern in how employers were handling the challenge.
Many companies that already allow employees to carry vacation days into the next year — like Goldman Sachs (generally up to 10) and Spotify (generally up to 10) — have not felt the need to change their policies.
The same is true for some companies that pay workers for their unused vacation days.
Neither General Motors nor Ford, whose hourly workers can cash out unused vacation days at the end of the year, is making changes this year.
But many workers may find themselves unable to take vacations that they postponed: Salaried workers at both automakers ordinarily lose unused vacation days at the end of the year without compensation.
Other companies have taken steps that could defuse a potential human resources headache and, they say, benefit their workforces in difficult times.
Bank of America, which normally requires its U.S. employees to take all their vacation before the end of the year, said in June that it would allow them to push up to five days into the first quarter of 2021.
Citigroup has typically allowed its U.S. employees to carry vacation days into the first quarter of the next year, but in July it added an inducement: Employees receive an extra vacation day next year if they use all of their 2020 vacation time this year.
Smaller companies have made similar modifications.
Latshaw Drilling, an oil service company based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, typically allows office workers to roll over up to three weeks of vacation time. In December, Latshaw told its office employees that it would buy up to one week of unused time beyond that amount, which they would have otherwise lost.
“Since this year was so crazy and people were afraid to travel, we made a one-time change,” said Trent Latshaw, the company’s founder and president.
Several experts said a philosophical question loomed over vacation benefits: Is the point to ensure that workers take time off? Or are vacation days simply an alternative form of compensation that workers can use as they see fit, whether to relax away from the job, to supplement their income or to drag around with them until the end of time, as a monument to their productivity?
An employer’s policies can reflect its views on this question: For all their drawbacks, use-it-or-lose-it rules can help ensure that workers take time off, said Jackie Reinberg, who heads the absence and disability practice of the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson. By contrast, rollover and cash-out options imply that vacation is an asset they are entitled to control.
Still, for many workers, the issue during the pandemic is not unused vacation days so much as insufficient vacation days. Jonathan Williams, communications director for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400, which represents grocery store workers in Mid-Atlantic states, said workers had sometimes been forced to draw down their reserves of paid time off if they were asked to quarantine a second time after a possible coronavirus exposure. Only the first quarantine is typically covered by the employer, Williams said.
And some employees have difficulty taking advantage of the generous vacation policies their companies offer.
A Target spokeswoman said the company had increased the vacation days that both hourly and salaried workers could roll over into the next year, based on the employee’s role and tenure. But according to Adam Ryan, who works for Target in Christiansburg, Virginia, many employees struggle to qualify for benefits like vacation days.
Ryan said in a text message that he had been with the company for three years but typically averaged less than 20 hours a week. “That way I don’t get any vacation or paid sick days, no real benefits of any kind,” he said.
The Target spokeswoman said employees could pick up more hours under its holiday staffing arrangement.
Several union officials, employers and human-resources experts said financial considerations drove many decisions about vacation policies during the pandemic. Toyota normally allows hourly and many salaried employees in the United States to cash out up to two weeks of unused vacation days. This year, the company lowered the cap to one week, a change that a spokeswoman said was intended to help avert layoffs.
The considerations become even more complicated for days that workers push into future years. According to Reinberg, allowing workers to roll over days can create a pile of liabilities owed to workers that many employers are loath to carry on their books.
A union official at Reuters said the news organization cited accounting concerns in sticking with its use-it-or-lose-it policy this year. The union had pleaded for leniency, noting that its contract allows management to approve a rollover of vacation days in “exceptional circumstances.”
“If this year has not been exceptional, I don’t know what the hell has been,” said the union official, Dan Grebler, an editor who is chair of the workers’ bargaining unit at Reuters. “The response was: ‘No, we can’t do that. There would be complicated bookkeeping involved.’”
Grebler said Reuters had begun urging workers to take days off this calendar year around the same time it had rebuffed him.
A Reuters spokeswoman said that “our policy for U.S. employees for some years has not allowed for unused vacation days to be rolled over” and that “employees have been regularly reminded since the first half of this year.”
Unionized employees at The New York Times, such as reporters, are encouraged to use vacation days during the year in which they accrue the days but can generally carry them over until March 1 of the next year. Days they do not use by that point are paid out in cash. A company spokeswoman said the policy had not changed this year.
By both law and custom, many Americans have come to see vacation days more as compensation than as a mandate to take time off.
In a survey by Willis Towers Watson in April, more than half of employers that made or planned to make changes to their vacation benefits said they were doing so because they didn’t expect workers to use all their days. About one-third that planned changes said the benefit had become too costly.
A few states, like California and Montana, essentially codify the property-right view of vacation by outlawing use-it-or-lose-it policies. (Companies with use-it-or-lose-it or strict rollover policies must exempt workers in those states.)
Such laws protect workers from effectively being deprived of vacation days that are difficult to use during the year only to have them expire at year’s end. But these laws may also subtly discourage vacations by making them easier to redeem for money or put off indefinitely.
“To me as an advocate, you should be able by law to keep unused vacation time,” said Peter Romer-Friedman, an employment lawyer at Gupta Wessler. “But I’m not sure that creates a good incentive.”
To that end, a number of companies, many in the tech industry, have seized on the pandemic as an opportunity to make sure their workers are decompressing.
In the spring, the software company GitLab responded to a significant rise in hours put in by its more than 1,000 workers with so-called friends-and-family days, in which the company shuts down to discourage people from logging in. Google, Slack and the software company Cloudera have started similar policies — none of which count against workers’ paid days off.
Automattic, the maker of the website-building tool WordPress.com, has gone even further, encouraging employees who work together to coordinate their vacations as a way to eliminate friction that discourages breaks.
“We’ve been experimenting with entire teams taking time off simultaneously,” Lori McLeese, the company’s head of human resources, wrote in an email. “We’re hoping that this may reduce the amount of ‘catch up’ work employees typically return to after taking a vacation, making their transition back less stressful or overwhelming.”

They gather every year, except for this cruel one, in the village where they are immortal. The men on the stage in Cooperstown, New York, at the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, brought joy to millions. We look at them and see endless summer.
Yet life goes on for them after the final out, and only their feats live forever. The further they get from the field, the stronger their sense of mortality.
“It’s kind of bittersweet, because each year you sit there and you look around and you say to yourself, ‘Who’s not going to be here next year?’” Ozzie Smith said recently. “And it happens so quickly. When you first go in, you see all these people and you don’t think in those terms: ‘When is this person going to leave this earth?’ This year was a real tough one.”
Smith, the virtuoso shortstop, spoke by phone this month before the departure of yet another grand old man of the game. On Sunday we learned that Phil Niekro, the greatest knuckleball pitcher in baseball history, had died of cancer the day before at age 81. Niekro joined Al Kaline, Tom Seaver, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, Whitey Ford and Joe Morgan in a grim lineup of greats we lost in 2020.
They all overlapped for one season — 1967 — and Niekro played the most recently, in 1987, with Cleveland, Toronto and, for a final cameo, the Atlanta Braves, his primary team. He was 48 years old then, his fifth year in a row as the game’s oldest player.
Defying age, of course, is part of the magic of the knuckleball. Hoyt Wilhelm, the other knuckler with a plaque in Cooperstown, retired at 49. Charlie Hough was 46, Tim Wakefield 45, R.A. Dickey 42. The majors’ oldest player this season was a designated hitter, Albert Pujols, who is 40. On a related note, the knuckleball is essentially extinct.
The website FanGraphs, which tracks every pitch, counted only three pitchers who threw the knuckleball in 2020: Erik Kratz, Todd Frazier and Bryan Holaday, position players moonlighting as pitchers at the end of blowouts. The idea that his pitch would survive only as a joke must have dismayed Niekro.
“Phil and Charlie and Wake, they all would share how important it is to perpetuate the craft,” Dickey, who won the 2012 National League Cy Young Award while with the New York Mets, said by phone Sunday. “We know how hard it is to do it, how rare it is to do it — and it’s so hard to evaluate. It’s hard to catch it, it’s hard to coach it. It’s hard to predict what it’s going to be.”
Niekro learned the pitch he used through 24 major league seasons from his father, also named Phil, a sandlot pitcher in Ohio who turned to it after hurting his arm. It worked so well for young Phil in pickup games with neighborhood kids — including John Havlicek, the future NBA Hall of Famer — that he never saw the need for other pitches.
“I didn’t know there were knuckleball pitchers in the big leagues,” Niekro said a few years ago. “I didn’t even know what a knuckleball was. It was just something that I had fun with, playing catch with my dad.”
Jim Bouton, the author of “Ball Four,” loved telling the story of meeting Niekro in Kearny, Nebraska, in 1959, when they were both 20 years old and just starting their pro careers. Bouton noticed Niekro practicing his knuckleball in the outfield before a game, and the pitch was dancing.
Bouton threw several pitches, including a knuckleball, and asked Niekro what else he threw. Nothing else, Niekro replied, and Bouton felt pity for him. By 1963, Bouton was winning 21 games for the Yankees and starting in the World Series, while Niekro had still not surfaced in the majors.
“I remembered him and I thought, ‘Oh, that poor kid, he’s still in the minor leagues and I don’t know how he hangs on, because I’m on my way to the Hall of Fame,’” Bouton said, a few years before his death in 2019. “Well, guess what? That poor kid, limited to one pitch — he’s in the Hall of Fame now. It’s a good reminder for me of the tortoise and the hare.”
Niekro was 27 before he reached the majors for good, in August 1966, but his mastery of that one pitch gave him a staggering kind of durability. He had just 31 victories by his 30th birthday, and 287 thereafter. He logged more than 1,000 innings from 1977 through 1979, when he averaged 19 wins and 19 losses per season.
He chafed in 1982 when a couple of other future Hall of Famers — Manager Joe Torre and Gibson, his pitching coach — reduced his workload.
“I didn’t coach him; he was too old to coach,” Gibson said with a laugh in 2015. “Right before we got there, he’d be winning 19 or so, but also losing 19. So what we did, we would get into the sixth or seventh inning and we’d see him not pitching so well and we’d take him out. Oh, it would tick him off!
“The first year we got there, he was 17-4 but he was mad at us because we were taking him out. We wouldn’t leave him in there long enough to get whacked around, because in the seventh or eighth inning, he started getting pretty tired — and because he was throwing a knuckleball, he figured he could just go ahead and pitch nine innings. But that knuckleball doesn’t knuckle, either, when you get tired.”
Niekro would finish with 5,404 innings, fourth on the career list behind Cy Young, Pud Galvin and Walter Johnson, who were all born in the 19th century. But while the knuckleball is easier on the arm — the pitcher is trying to kill spin, not impart it — no other practitioners approached Niekro’s innings total.
The knuckleball only looks like an everyman pitch; it actually takes superhuman patience and persistence. Mastering it, Niekro would tell aspirants, requires complete fidelity.
“My advice to them is take your fastball, curveball and slider and forget about ’em — flush ’em down the toilet,” he said. “You’re going to be a knuckleball pitcher. That’s all we’re going to throw.”
For decades after Niekro’s retirement, the pitch wobbled but endured; someone was always throwing it, from Hough to Tom Candiotti to Wakefield to Dickey, with others mixed in. In 2019, though, it surfaced for just 12 forgettable innings by Steven Wright and Ryan Feierabend. And in 2020 it was gone.
Now Niekro is gone, too, and while his pitch might return, there will never be another pitcher quite like him.
“He had a presence that just transcended what you encounter every day in the clubhouse,” Dickey said. “Supernatural, that’s what he was for me — that supernatural representation of what the pitch could become.”

The tagged photo section on the Instagram page for Parade, an underwear startup founded in fall 2019, shows a surfeit of images of young women modeling brightly colored briefs and bikinis. Many of them pose in studio apartments, stretched out on velvet couches and propped up on dressers. Some press against vinyl shower curtains, donning the neon underwear in mirror selfies. All of them look effortless.
It is not unusual these days for a brand to take over social media like this — seemingly overnight and all at once, in nonprofessional photos posted by nonprofessional models. But these campaigns nearly always leave viewers wondering: Where did this start?
For Mariah Williams, 21, it was a direct message from Parade’s Instagram account, offering her free samples. When the products arrived, she took the day off from her job as a barbershop receptionist to curate a photo shoot to show off her new burnt-orange underwear; in the photo she posted, a bamboo planter sits next to her bottom half, and her face is just out of the frame.
“Taking these pictures really made me feel good about myself and my body. Especially with seasonal depression, I was in a mood,” she said.
Williams, who has only 2,000 followers on Instagram, is one of more than 6,000 women and nonbinary Instagrammers who received messages from Parade offering free gifts, ideally in exchange for social posts.
In addition to mailing samples, the company also sent along digital mood boards and a Google Drive of creative direction, in the hopes that the recipients would use it as inspiration for their own posts. The gift boxes yielded hundreds of posts across social media and drove interest in Parade’s products.
The pandemic has been devastating for the fashion industry. But not for underwear. Those sales have had a steady uptick since the beginning of the pandemic. According to Allied Market Research, the lingerie industry is estimated to be worth $325 billion by 2025.
Parade was founded in 2019, just months before the U.S. economy shut down in March, by Cami Téllez and Jack Defuria, two friends in their early 20s. As most fashion companies struggled to keep afloat, Parade sold over 700,000 pairs of underwear and brought in $10 million in revenue, according to a company representative.
Téllez, the startup’s CEO, attributes that success to the strength of the brand’s image.
“Parade has been able to create a groundswell, a cultural zeitgeist. I think that we’re changing the way a whole generation of women see themselves, and I think that’s why we’ve been so successful,” she said. Parade estimates that 1 in 8 customers posts a picture of themselves in the underwear.
Parade is one of many brands that have eschewed paid influencer campaigns in favor of sending products to people who have smaller and more dedicated followings, and often aren’t influencers at all.
“They’re just reaching out to normal people who have followers they actually know in real life,” Williams said.
“Working with micro-influencers is part of our DNA,” Téllez said. “Unlike brands of underwear past, we don’t think you need to have hundreds of thousands of followers or be a supermodel to share your underwear story.”
Gifting programs, which offer free product in exchange for posts, have also become more common. But the tactic has sparked discussions about unpaid labor. “As a small influencer, especially as a Black and brown influencer, we often get used and not paid,” Williams said. She has since reached out to Parade about receiving commission in exchange for promoting a discount code.
Rhea Woods, the head of influencer strategy at Praytell Agency, encourages brands to offer compensation to influencers, no matter how small their following. “It is very standard to pay those folks several hundred dollars,” she said. “That shocks brands. But at the same time, we’re asking for rights to their name, image and likeness,” Woods said.
Because of its far reach, Parade’s campaign took on a second life, sparking an online conversation about who received sponsorships. One Twitter user posted: “Is it just me or does Parade Underwear feel like a Pyramid Scheme?” Another tweeted: “Why didn’t Parade send me underwear am I ugly or something”
“I think those tweets if anything, speak to how wide ranging our brand has become,” Téllez said.
Dana Donnelly, a 25-year-old comedian and writer with 128,500 followers, posted an image of her Parade underwear in September, but after a few months she saw the brand target smaller and smaller accounts, and she became more skeptical. She questioned if the entire Parade marketing campaign foundation was founded on stoking feelings of exclusion. “I can’t tell what their objective is besides making the girls they’re sending it to feel cool and the girls they’re not sending it to feel uncool,” she said. “It’s almost like high school mean-girl marketing.”
Yamini Nambimadom, 22, who received a sponsorship, described it as “guerrilla marketing campaign, where you watch your friends promote something and you would want to try it.” Nambimadom does not consider herself an influencer and had never been approached by a brand before but was intrigued by Parade’s campaign. “There’s a social psychology of wanting to be a part of something,” she said. (Nambimadom has cheekily added “Recipient of Parade Underwear” to her Twitter bio.)
When asked about how people were selected to be included in the campaign, Téllez said: “There are hundreds of psychographics” (i.e., many factors she would not name).
In early December, Parade released a collaboration with Juicy Couture. The accompanying campaign featured women donning underwear with “JUICY” written across the rear in rhinestones. “I think that most women in America have some sort of emotional connection to Juicy because it was one of the very first self-expression brands,” Téllez said. (For what it’s worth, the company made its name on $150 tracksuits.)
Gab Landrum, 28, an artist who posted about Parade, became critical of the brand after the Juicy collaboration. “It didn’t seem to be about normal people anymore.”
Landrum, who takes nongendered pronouns, noted that in the most recent revival of the Black Lives Matter movement, many brands advantageously adopted progressive slogans but rarely invest in meaningful representation.
“You can scroll back to Parade’s Instagram page in March and see the shift in skin tone. And a few months goes by, and they go back to being very thin, mostly white, with very sparse representation of Black and heavy people,” they said.
Landrum said that because younger consumers are increasingly politically aware, brands have learned to lean into causes. Parade recently told customers it would donate $1 to Feeding America for every post that featured their underwear with the hashtag #ParadeTogether and five friends tagged.
“We really believe in having a Technicolor view on inclusivity as a whole,” Téllez said. (When asked if the employees of Parade reflect that commitment to diversity, the chief executive declined to comment.)
Because of the popularity of the company’s Instagram campaign, Donnelly joked that soon enough everyone would be an influencer. In her own Parade post, she is kneeling in crimson red underwear, gazing toward the viewer and almost smiling.
“I’ve been influenced!” one of the comments reads.

After the Vaccine: Sore Arm, Yes. Headache, Maybe. Regrets, No.

Two and a half hours after being injected with a COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Taneisha Wilson was hit with the worst headache of her life.
In her home office in Cranston, Rhode Island, Wilson, 38, an emergency physician with a constitution she calls “horse-like,” laid her head down on the desk. Fighting a wave of nausea, she let out an involuntary groan loud enough to be heard by her husband in a room down the hall.
“Are you OK, babe?” he called.
“It felt like I got smacked,” Wilson recalled in an interview.
That is not how most people who get the vaccine feel afterward, but reactions like Wilson’s were not uncommon in the clinical trial results of the two COVID vaccines now being distributed across the country. Pfizer, the company that makes the one she received, reported that some 13% of recipients ages 18 to 55 had a bad headache after the first dose. About 16% of those who received the other vaccine, made by Moderna, in a late-stage trial had a reaction strong enough to prevent them from going about their daily routine.
As tens of millions of Americans await their turn for a shot, many are hungering for details about what to expect. So, at the request of friends, colleagues and reporters, some people like Wilson who were in the vanguard of the biggest vaccination program in U.S. history are beginning to offer their personal accounts.
The New York Times interviewed several dozen of the newly vaccinated in the days afterward. They recounted a wide spectrum of responses, from no reaction at all — “Can’t even tell I had the shot,” said a hospital worker in Iowa City, Iowa — to symptoms like uncontrolled shivering and “brain fog.” A nurse assistant in Glendora, California, wondered whether the fever he ran was a side effect of the vaccine or a sign that he had been infected by one of his COVID patients.
And there was a dizzying variety of sore arms. Some likened the pain to that from a flu shot; for others, it was considerably worse.
Like nearly every vaccine recipient who spoke to The Times for this article, Wilson stressed that she had no regrets about getting the shot, despite the headache, which was gone within 36 hours. The Food and Drug Administration has found the vaccines to be safe and remarkably effective. And public health leaders say mass vaccination is the only hope for controlling the virus that is now claiming the lives of close to 3,000 Americans a day.
But in these first weeks of vaccination, there is an inescapable element of suspense.
Along with a card reminding them when to get the necessary second dose, vaccine recipients are handed information on how to report side effects to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an app called V-Safe.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both rely on a genetic technology that has never before yielded a vaccine that won regulatory approval. They are authorized for emergency use only. Studies of their safety, including the cases of an Alaska health care worker and a Boston doctor who experienced severe allergic reactions after receiving their shots, are still underway.
And as Wilson crawled into bed at 10:30 on a weekday morning, she could not help but be “hyper-aware,” she said, “that I had just been vaccinated with this novel vaccine.”
Navigating a Brain Fog
As vaccines go, experts have agreed, the two being distributed now elicit more reactions than most.
At the Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown, West Virginia, Betty Shannon, 81, said some fellow residents had an upset stomach after becoming some of the nation’s first seniors to receive a COVID vaccine.
Lorenzo Alfonso, 34, a nurse assistant in California, was unusually tired and achy.
Delayna Frint, a nurse in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, said her arm was so sore after the shot that in order to hang intravenous therapy bags, she had to lower the stands.
But for infectious disease experts, a nation down for the count with post-vaccine malaise would be the best news in a long time. The side effects dissipate within a few days, and they are a signal, the experts say, that the vaccine is working.
“We call them ‘side’ effects, but it’s really just an effect,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania vaccinologist who is a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel. “This is what your immune response does when it’s responding to an infection.”
The vaccines each work by prompting the body to make a particular protein that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells; neither exposes the recipient to the virus itself. The presence of that protein in the body sets off the production of new antibodies that can destroy the protein — the key to providing protection against a future invasion of the actual virus. But the process also releases substances that can cause inflammation, which can result in fever, fatigue, headache and other symptoms.
Many more participants in the vaccine trials registered discomfort after the second dose, given three or four weeks later, than after the first. That is probably because by that time, the body is already primed to attack the protein, experts said.
Most of the reactions experienced by the 1.9 million Americans who received a vaccine this month had already been seen among the roughly 35,000 people who were vaccinated in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials. But experts expect new ones to appear: “If it’s a one-in-a-million thing, you need a million to see even one,” said Dr. Peter Doshi, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.
Some may be mild allergic reactions, like the “body-wide itching” and “mild, small hives along forearm” that Dr. Megan Hajjar of Farmington, Connecticut, described in a Facebook post with a video clip. Or they may be more severe, like the handful of cases of anaphylaxis that the CDC has already identified.
And others may simply be more intense versions of what the trials called “fatigue.” Alyson MacGregor, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University and an accomplished home chef, said she spent the day after her vaccination in a mental fog that turned her attempt at the most basic of meals into an inedible blob.
“I can’t believe I messed up ramen,” she told her husband that night.
She felt, she said, as if “there was a cloud over me, following me around.”
Debating Disclosure
The first several million doses of both vaccines are earmarked for health care workers and for nursing home residents who are at elevated risk of dying from COVID-19 if they become infected.
Public health leaders have estimated that more than 200 million Americans will need to be vaccinated to effectively prevent the virus from spreading. In polls, a substantial fraction have expressed hesitancy about receiving COVID vaccinations. And some front-line health workers have wrestled with whether discussing their own side effects might deter others from getting vaccinated.
“I do worry — is it going to encourage someone to have second thoughts?” said Dr. Matthew Harris, 38, an emergency medicine doctor in Great Neck, New York.
Harris was up all night with a fever, shivering underneath a blanket, after receiving the first shot. He had joint pain in his wrists and shoulders that lasted into the next day.
But he had already published a post on Facebook about receiving his shot. It had been an especially emotional moment for him, nine months to the day after he was hospitalized with a severe case of COVID and did not know whether he would survive to see his wife and two young children again.
“Please,” one nonmedical friend commented on his vaccination post, “let us know what the experience is like!!!”
So the next day, he posted about his reaction, with the hashtag #stillworthit.
“Everyone has read, ‘This is the light at the end of the tunnel,’” Harris said in an interview. “But are people going to feel great 100% of the time after this vaccine? No. And if we’re not honest with them, how can we expect them to trust us?”
Dr. Sylvia Owusu-Ansah, an emergency physician in Pittsburgh, has also opted to chronicle her vaccine side effects on Facebook. She is African American, and at the livestreamed inoculation earlier this month, she told reporters that she “wanted to share with my community that it is OK.” Distrust of the vaccine is particularly high among Black Americans, because of a history of mistreatment of Black people by the medical establishment.
In the name of transparency, Owusu-Ansah recorded “mild muscle aches and pains with left arm soreness” on day one and “nasal congestion, mild headache” on days three through five — pointedly beginning her posts with “I AM STILL HERE!”
Another Dose
Forty-eight hours after Wilson’s post-vaccine headache sent her to bed, she returned to her job in the emergency room at a hospital. Like many hospitals around the nation, its intensive care unit was crowded with COVID cases. On one recent shift, Wilson said, there were 12 patients in the critical care bay and only one bed available in the ICU to take them.
“These are people having strokes, myocardial infarction that need catheterization,” she recalled. “You have to understand the reality.”
That time, Wilson said, it wasn’t a vaccine side effect that made her feel as if she was going to throw up.
She is scheduled for her second dose of the vaccine next month.

30 sleep habits from around the world Sleep: Majority of

Resumen: Research shows that sleep impacts stress hormones and growth, bolsters the immune system, helps regulate our breathing and blood pressure, and improves our cardiovascular health. A long-term lack of sleep may mean missing out on these benefits, and can put you at greater risk for serious medical conditions ranging from stroke to seizures — not to mention shortening your life expectancy.

If there’s one thing everyone in the world has in common, it’s sleep. At some point during each 24-hour period, we shut our eyes, quiet our minds, and recharge our bodies. While scientists are still researching the ins and outs of how sleep works, we know this core function brings about a slew of benefits for our mental and physical health.
Research shows that sleep impacts stress hormones and growth, bolsters the immune system, helps regulate our breathing and blood pressure, and improves our cardiovascular health. A long-term lack of sleep may mean missing out on these benefits, and can put you at greater risk for serious medical conditions ranging from stroke to seizures — not to mention shortening your life expectancy.
Beyond the health benefits and the essential nature of sleep for all humans, catching some z’s can look very different from person to person and culture to culture. At bedtime, American millennials might tuck themselves into a set of bamboo sheets atop a memory-foam mattress they ordered online. Their Japanese counterparts, however, may roll out a traditional tatami mat and pile it up with a shikibuton (a kind of thin cotton mattress) and kakefuton (duvet stuffed with silk fibers) before resting their heads on a buckwheat hull pillow.

We also read reports from news outlets including Fodor’s, The New York Times, NPR, Healthline, Thrillist, Refinery29 and the BBC, searching out all the ways people get their 40 winks.
Keep reading to discover 30 sleep habits from around the world, from midday siestas and napping at the office to elevating beds with bricks and drifting off in a hammock.
Spain: Take a siesta in the afternoon Spain has long practiced the tradition of the siesta — a two-hour break reserved for sleeping and recharging around noon. The convention has spread to many other places with hot climates, particularly Latin American countries.
South Korea: Turn fans off before bedtime Despite the hot, humid weather of summer, you won’t find many older South Koreans cooling off with an electric fan while they sleep. Some in that generation believe in the old wives’ tale of "fan death," a South Korean superstition that warns that you may die if you fall asleep next to an electric fan.
United States: Snuggle up next to a pet A 2020 survey from Stonyfield Organic found 74% of American dog owners share the couch or bed with their pets. Science shows snuggling up with a pet boosts oxytocin, lowers stress levels, and can even help prevent nightmares for those with PTSD.
Afghanistan: Bedrooms are for more than just sleep While many people in Western countries reset their beds in the morning, many in Afghanistan do so at night. That’s because Afghans use their bedrooms for many other purposes during the day. After waking, blankets get folded and mattresses pushed to the side to open the room up for daytime use.
Guatemala: Worry dolls promote stress-free sleep Parents in Guatemala often place a small handmade toy known as a "worry doll" under their children’s pillows at bedtime. Legend has it that these colorful dolls soothe worries that creep up at night, when there’s little else left to distract the mind, and help kids get a good night’s rest.
Japan: Workers nap in the office It’s not uncommon to see an office worker in Japan take a nap in the middle of the workday, according to a report from The New York Times. Rather than being seen as a sign of laziness, office naps are viewed as indicators of having worked especially hard.
France: Babies sleep through the night at 10 weeks French babies are known to sleep through the night as early as 10 weeks old, according to Pamela Druckerman, author of "Bringing Up Bebe." She attributes this phenomenon to a technique called "the pause," in which parents wait before rushing in to soothe a crying baby in order to see if the infant can connect his or her two-hour sleep cycles on their own.
Scandinavia: Babies nap outside in winter Many Nordic and Scandinavian parents don’t think twice about putting their babies outside in their carriage for an afternoon nap. Alfresco naps continue all year round — even in winter, when temperatures in cities like Stockholm regularly plummet to 23 degrees Fahrenheit.
Mexico: Prayers come before sleep A 2013 survey from the National Sleep Foundation found that 62% of Mexicans pray or meditate before bedtime. The figure was 15 percentage points higher than the number of Americans who do the same thing.
Botswana: Sleep isn’t scheduled Forager groups in Botswana don’t have set sleeping and waking times. Instead, they drift off whenever they feel like it, whether it’s in the middle of the day or late at night, according to anthropologist Carol Worthman.
Australia: Groups sleep together Members of Indigenous groups in Australia have a "marked cultural preference" for co-sleeping, according to anthropologist Yasmine Musharbash. They often lay out their beds in row-like patterns called yuntas, with the most vulnerable people (like kids) in the middle and adults at the ends.
UK: Sleeping without clothes A 2018 poll from Furniture Choice found that 23% of Brits choose to sleep without clothes. Catching some z’s without clothes is associated with health benefits like better sleep, clearer skin and even improved male fertility.
Germany: Couples use separate duvets Sleeping with a blanket hog? Make like German couples and get a separate duvet for each person. The sleeping tradition is also found in Austria and Scandinavia, and has inspired product launches from IKEA.
Italy: Workers get long lunch breaks for naps Like the Spanish siesta, Italians have their own midday nap known as a "riposo." It usually starts just after lunchtime and lasts for two to four hours.
China: No mirrors allowed near the bed The Chinese practice of feng shui discourages people from placing mirrors opposite the bed. The philosophy is that mirrors can bounce energy across a room, which can interfere with peaceful rest.
South Africa: Elevate your bed with bricks Some Indigenous groups in South Africa elevate their beds using bricks. Keeping your bed high off the ground supposedly helps protect you from the tokoloshe, a mythical creature that possesses its victims.
Brazil: Town retains preindustrial sleep habits The community in Baependi, Brazil, has been shown to be one of the few remaining groups of people on Earth with preindustrial sleeping habits. People there tend to go to sleep at 9:20 p.m. and wake at 6:30 a.m.
Finland: Babies snooze in cardboard boxes The Finnish government sends expectant mothers a box full of supplies, like sheets and toys, for their babies. The cardboard boxes can double as cribs for newborns.
Belgium: Earliest bedtime in the world A 2014 study of 8,070 people around the world revealed that Belgium women tend to have the earliest bedtimes. On average, they go to sleep around 10:30 p.m.
Switzerland: Newborns sleep in hammocks Newborns in Switzerland are typically placed in a hÃ¤ngematten, a type of hammock, for sleep. The idea is that the hammock’s rocking imitates the swaying they experienced in the womb, creating a soothing effect.
Egypt: Sleep in two phases Polyphasic sleep, which involves two or more phases of sleep (rather than one extended period of rest) throughout a 24-hour period, is not uncommon in Egypt. People there tend to sleep about six hours in the evening and about two hours in the afternoon.
Canada: Inuits snuggle up to stay warm Cuddling with people on both sides when you’re getting ready for bed is common in Inuit communities in Northern Canada. Snuggling up helps people stay warm in their igloos.
South India: Women tie hair up before sleep In South India, many women make sure not to fall asleep with their hair down. Legend dictates hair should be tied up before bed in order for a woman to avoid becoming possessed.
Sub-Saharan Africa: Sleep under a net to stop bug bites Many people in countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Senegal, sleep beneath mosquito nets. The nets help prevent the spread of malaria from mosquito bites.
Argentina: Kids get a late bedtime Bedtime doesn’t usually come along until 10 p.m. or later for kids in Argentina, according to Sara Harkness, a professor at the University of Connecticut. Parents use their kids’ extra waking hours to focus "on the social aspects of child development."
Singapore: Sleep doesn’t last as long as elsewhere A 2016 study that tracked smartphone data from 20 countries found that people in Singapore have the shortest sleep duration. On average, they sleep about 7 hours and 24 minutes.
Slovakia: World’s best sleep quality People in Slovakia have the best average sleep quality in the world, according to 2014-2015 data from 941,300 people who use the app Sleep Cycle. Malaysians, on the other hand, had the worst average sleep quality out of 50 countries.
Norway: ‘Midnight Sun’ keeps people up late It can still be light out late at night in northern Norway during the spring. The "Midnight Sun," as the phenomenon is called, keeps people up late, and it’s not uncommon to see people sipping coffee or even hiking at midnight.
Indonesia: Stress induces instant sleep Some people on the Indonesian island of Bali have developed a technique called "fear sleep." When they’re stressed out, they can instantly fall asleep, according to the anthropologist Worthman.
Outer space: Astronauts sleep in restraints When it’s time to go to bed on the space station, astronauts crawl into their own private sleeping quarters and strap themselves into special sleeping bags so they won’t float around. Everything from the lighting and temperature to the noise and carbon dioxide levels is carefully regulated to promote optimal sleep.

On Fox, Lou Dobbs debunks himself

Texto completo: Two news organizations issued corrections recently. One was The New York Times. The other was Fox Business.
One concerned an honest mistake. The Times admitted to having been scammed by the subject of one of its podcast series. Fox Business did not admit to anything but instead ran an interview that directly contradicted some — actually a small fraction — of the false, hysterical and malevolent conspiracy theories about election fraud the network has been pushing.
If you were watching "Lou Dobbs Tonight" on Dec. 18, you saw something jarring — a dose of reality. Dobbs has been peddling outright disinformation for a very long time. Before he moved to Fox, he was a fixture on CNN, where he reported, falsely, that immigrants were causing a huge spike of leprosy cases.
Dobbs has a perhaps sincere, but nonetheless maniacal, fear and hatred of immigrants. He pumped out baseless allegations that the LDS church was purposely violating immigration laws to smuggle Mexicans into the country, and said that one-third of prison inmates were illegal aliens (not even close).
But nothing has topped his recent fulminations about the election. When Attorney General William Barr said he had not seen evidence of voter fraud significant enough to affect the outcome of the election, Dobbs sailed off the rationality cliff altogether. "For the attorney general to make that statement, he is either a liar or a fool or both," said Dobbs. "He may be, perhaps, compromised."
So, the Dec. 18 segment must have taken some of Dobbs' 300,000 or so viewers by surprise. It was a pretaped interview with Edward Perez, of the Open Source Election Technology Institute. Someone (not Dobbs) asked Perez questions about vote fraud such as "Have you seen any evidence of Smartmatic sending U.S. votes to be tabulated in foreign countries?" Perez had not.
Fox Business has not had a sudden attack of conscience. No, this uncharacteristic moment of candor was in response to a 20-page demand letter from lawyers for Smartmatic, one of the companies Dobbs and other Fox figures have been slandering as tools of the "deep state," a cat's paw for a dead Venezuelan dictator, and so forth.
Smartmatic is credibly threatening to sue Fox. It makes for bracing reading, a point by point refutation of everything Dobbs and his colleagues have been spewing for weeks. "All these statements and implications are false and defamatory," the letter says.
The reason this is no ordinary Fox News lie is that Smartmatic is not a public figure. Since New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964, it has been pretty much impossible to defame a public figure in the United States. Plaintiffs must show not just that the news story was wrong, but that it showed "reckless disregard for the truth or falsity" of the content. Though this policy permits the public square to be saturated with lies, it is considered worth the price to maintain uninhibited debate about matters of public importance.
The standard for private persons, or in this case companies, is different. There is no public purpose to be served by letting a newspaper falsely report without fear of a libel suit that Mr. Joe Smith is an embezzler. Most state laws require a plaintiff to show mere negligence on the part of a news organization or other defendant. The plaintiff must also show damages, namely that the defamatory content harms its capacity to do business. Smartmatic's business is running elections. They may have a strong case.
So, Fox is taking the precaution of issuing these "clarifications" — not just on "Lou Dobbs Tonight" but also on other Fox shows.
So much for Exhibit A. Here's Exhibit B. The New York Times issued a retraction of its award-winning series "Caliphate," which featured interviews with a Canadian named Shehroze Chaudhry, who claimed to have joined ISIS and to have committed crimes in Syria. On Sept. 25, 2019, Canadian police arrested Chaudhry and charged him with perpetrating a terror hoax. In a podcast mea culpa, Times executive editor Dean Baquet acknowledged the error, admitting that the story should have been better fact-checked.
Probed by host Michael Barbaro about why the Times failed its own standards in this case, Baquet admitted that "confirmation bias" played a role. The Times returned the Peabody Award the series had received.
In short, the paper did the right thing.
There is a yawning chasm between the Times and Fox News (and its imitators at OANN and Newsmax, who have also been named by Smartmatic's attorneys).
For all its faults and biases, the Times is in the news business. It holds itself to standards and acknowledges error. Fox et al are propagandists and provocateurs. Who was harmed by the Times's error? Only the Times itself. ISIS certainly has no reputation to damage, and Chaudhry is not an injured party. He appears to be a scam artist.
Who was harmed by the Fox crowd's lies? An individual company sure, but also faith in democracy itself. Most people assume that where there's smoke, there's fire. Subjected to a deluge of disinformation from Donald Trump and his enablers, millions of Americans have had their confidence in the most basic institution of democracy — free and fair elections — badly shaken.
The lawyer-extracted corrections are welcome, but they cannot begin to undo the damage these pernicious liars have perpetrated.

Texto completo: Ola Salem's body was found in a Staten Island park last year. Her father said she had talked about being followed on the highway.
When Ola Salem's body was discovered in a park on Staten Island in October 2019, her friends and relatives were left grasping for an explanation.
Ms. Salem, 25, was known as a dedicated advocate at the domestic violence shelter for Muslim women and children where she volunteered, and suspicion in local media focused on her husband, with whom the police said she had a tumultuous relationship.
Her father offered another theory: Kabary Salem told The New York Times that his daughter had shared stories of being followed by someone on the highway.
But authorities now say that tip was a lie intended to misdirect investigators, and it was Mr. Salem who killed his daughter, dragged her body into Bloomingdale Park and covered it with branches. Mr. Salem, 52, appeared virtually in court this week to face a seven-count indictment, with charges including murder, strangulation and concealment of a human corpse.
He pleaded not guilty, court records show. A lawyer for Mr. Salem could not be reached for comment this week.
Officials said that despite Mr. Salem's statements to reporters, he had been considered a suspect in his daughter's death.
"Throughout the course of this tragic case, we had never lost hope that the alleged killer would be arrested and charged," Michael E. McMahon, the Staten Island district attorney said in a statement. "We will continue to work tirelessly to hold this defendant accountable."
The charges followed a yearlong investigation into a killing that perplexed many of those who knew Ms. Salem. Her friends said that they were rattled by the news of her father's arrest.
Last year, on Oct. 23, Ms. Salem had been in Pennsylvania with her father, a former professional boxer who had competed at the Olympics, officials said.
Later that evening or early the next day, Mr. Salem strangled his daughter, according to the indictment. Officials said he then drove to Staten Island, dragged her body to Bloomingdale Park in the Prince's Bay neighborhood and covered her with branches and leaves. Afterward, they said, he traveled back to Pennsylvania and later fled the country.
Key to the investigation was the discovery this year that Mr. Salem had rented a car from Avis on Oct. 22, a law enforcement official familiar with the case said.
Previously, Mr. Salem had told investigators that he had driven his daughter home to New York in their family car. Investigators also found his daughter's phone in the family car, the official said, and Mr. Salem told them she had forgotten it when he dropped her off.
In reality, the official said, detectives discovered that Mr. Salem used the rental car to travel extensively on Staten Island, including a brief stop in the park near where his daughter's body was found. He was arrested in Kuwait in December with the assistance of the State Department and Interpol and quarantined before being extradited back to New York.
Prosecutors did not provide a potential motive for the killing.
But relationships between Ms. Salem and close relatives appeared to have been fraught for some time.
At the time of her death, Ms. Salem's family had an active order of protection against her, according to the law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.
Mr. Salem, who had also worked as a driver, was a boxer on Egypt's Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. He was known as "The Egyptian Magician" and held a mixed reputation among fans and other fighters, gaining notoriety in 1999 when an opponent whom he had repeatedly head-butted during a match lost consciousness and died after brain surgery. He retired from the sport six years later.
On a now-defunct Instagram account, Mr. Salem posted a picture of himself and his daughter in March with the caption, "I miss you and love you rip my love." After Ms. Salem's death, Mr. Salem was quoted in a New York Times story saying that his daughter "always said somebody would follow her" when she was driving and that he hoped to receive clarity.
"I want to know what happened to her, what is the reason for that -- but no one tells me -- I am just waiting," he said at the time. He is set to appear back in court on Feb. 5.
Members of Ms. Salem's family declined to comment further when reached on Wednesday, saying they were still processing the news.
As a teenager, Ms. Salem, who grew up in Coney Island, was an active member of the Muslim American Society Youth Center in South Brooklyn. Friends said she enjoyed boxing like her father, led religious discussions at Kingsborough Community College on weekends and was known for her caring spirit and protective disposition at the Asiyah Women's Center, a domestic violence shelter where she volunteered for night shifts.
Dania Darwish, the co-founder of the shelter and friend for more than a decade, said her stomach turns when she encounters reminders of Ms. Salem's death. She added that she hopes "justice is served."
Ms. Darwish recalled the last days of Ramadan, when she and Ms. Salem would dance and sing, exchange laughs and envision their lives in the future. As she was opening the shelter in Brooklyn, Ms. Darwish said she reached out to Ms. Salem for help, knowing that her friend had a "way of making people feel safe" and comfortable.
"People would be so traumatized coming to us, and she just had this relaxed spirit and calming presence," Ms. Darwish said. "She just made people immediately laugh at something even though they were having the worst days of their lives."
Ms. Salem was known to be outspoken. When she was 17, she made headlines after a visit to Playland Park, an amusement park in Rye, N.Y., on a youth trip to mark the end of Ramadan. When Ms. Salem was told by employees she could not join her younger sister on a ride because of her hijab, she asked to speak with management.
The issue escalated, and a small melee broke out. "I said, 'It's not my headgear. It's my religion,"' Ms. Salem told The Times.
For Ms. Darwish, the killing of her friend -- who fiercely defended other women -- remains a devastating loss.
"There are women who were experiencing domestic violence and left situations where they could've gotten murdered. She was the reason they felt safe enough to leave," she said. "I wish our community did more to protect her in the way she protected them."

Texto completo: A young man in Virginia says he has no regrets over waiting to release a video he saved of a high school classmate using the N-word when she was 15, which ultimately resulted in her not attending her dream college this year.
“I wanted to get her where she would understand the severity of that word,” Jimmy Galligan, who is 18 and biracial, told the New York Times of his former high school classmate, Mimi Groves, who is 19 and white. Both attended Heritage High School in Leesburg, Virginia.
“He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right,” the New York Times reported of why he didn't release the video when he first saw it last year.
He released it this summer when protests and riots spread across the country following the death of George Floyd. It was also after Groves had been accepted to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where she was slated to compete on the school’s cheer team.
“The next month, as protests were sweeping the nation after the police killing of George Floyd, Ms. Groves, in a public Instagram post, urged people to ‘protest, donate, sign a petition, rally, do something’ in support of the Black Lives Matter movement,” the New York Times reported.
Groves realized that the video of her saying “I can drive, [N-word]” was public after she was met with condemnation from a stranger on social media for supporting the BLM movement while also previously using racist language.
“Her alarm at the stranger’s comment turned to panic as friends began calling, directing her to the source of a brewing social media furor. Mr. Galligan, who had waited until Ms. Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon. Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer,” the New York Times reported.
The video’s circulation ultimately ended with Groves giving up her acceptance to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as well as losing her spot on the school’s cheer team.
Galligan told the New York Times that he didn’t regret releasing the video, saying, “If I never posted that video, nothing would have ever happened.”
“I’m going to remind myself, you started something,” he added. “You taught someone a lesson.”
The story, however, has sparked the ire of some who say that cancel culture has gone too far, with an American Conservative opinion piece calling Galligan “an example of the kind of moral monsters this culture of ours has created.”
“We will always live in a society that is in need of moral reform. We are human. But it is a monstrous society that doesn’t offer a way for people to turn from their sins and failings, and find forgiveness and restoration,” the op-ed added.
Others agreed with the op-ed’s sentiment, with some taking to Twitter to voice their opinions.

Groves added in the interview that she regrets using the word, saying she was too young to understand its history.
“At the time, I didn’t understand the severity of the word, or the history and context behind it because I was so young,” she said of the video, adding that “it honestly disgusts me that those words would come out of my mouth.”
