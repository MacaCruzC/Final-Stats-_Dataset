Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Just weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to white Republicans.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died in August.
It reveals that Hofeller "played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' " and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller's role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.
Furman was one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year.
The letter drew on information discovered on Hofeller's hard drives, which were found by Hofeller's estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina.
The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census "would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats" and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers' letter to Furman.
The evidence, first reported by The New York Times, contradicts testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' expert adviser Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said.
The Commerce and Justice departments did not respond to questions about the new information.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in district court Thursday for "sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony" by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU.
It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU on Thursday afternoon filed a letter with the court to "respectfully inform" it of the motion filed in New York District Court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week.
The letter repeated the charge contained in the earlier letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census to give white Republicans an advantage in redistricting "and that Petitioners (the government) obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations."
The letter from Ho did not ask the court to take action, but it drew its attention to the new motion. The hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
"Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census," Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. "Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday's hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments."
The Supreme Court heard the case April 23.
Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.
The court, if it followed normal procedure, voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are now writing the opinion.
The ACLU also asked the district court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public.
On Thursday, Furman ordered that the government must provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday; he called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump's election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said.
"It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing," he said.
Ho said sanctions could include fines imposed on witnesses or the government, a reopening of the case or an amendment of the final judgment to account for new evidence.
The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and to determine congressional representation and redistricting. Opponents of the citizenship question have argued that it will suppress response to the survey among immigrant communities, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live.

Texto completo: The quote is attributed to President Harry Truman, and Ronald Reagan kept it on his desk: "It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit."
It is even more amazing what has been accomplished with the American economy, but Democratic presidential candidates, the media and economists such as Paul Krugman of The New York Times refuse to give President Donald Trump any credit. Recall that it was Mr. Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, who predicted that Mr. Trump's election would trigger "a global recession." One continues to wait in vain for an "I was wrong" statement from him.
The Economist, a center-left British magazine that is no fan of the Trump administration, recently published a remarkable editorial that contains gems Republicans should quote between now and the next election. They include a strong rebuke to the contention of many Democrats that "working people" are still struggling and that the improved economy continues to benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent.
The bleak picture painted by Democrats, the editorial says, "is at odds with reality." The Economist refers to a worldwide "jobs boom" and asserts that "capitalism is improving workers' lot faster than it has in years ... the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data."
Noting that U.S. unemployment at 3.6% is the lowest in 50 years, the magazine says, "Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world."
A more educated population, the matching by websites of jobs to qualified applicants, and, yes, economic stimulus efforts that helped fuel the emergence of economies from the last recession have all contributed to the American economy and many European economies.
Then there is this, which has been the gospel of conservatives for decades when it comes to welfare and its disincentive for many to find work: "... reforms to welfare programs, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work."
This has forced liberal politicians to shift their focus from the unemployed to the "quality" of jobs. British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is quoted as saying, "Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity."
"Reality begs to differ," says The Economist. "Official projections" predict that by 2026, "America will have more at-home careers than secretaries." Jobs and the skills necessary to fill them are changing, but not so rapidly that workers cannot adjust their education and training to match the new requirements. Wages are rising almost everywhere.
This is the argument that conservatives, many Republicans and the Trump administration have been making for some time. Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.
While acknowledging "The jobs boom will not last forever" and that a recession will eventually "kill it off," the editorial concludes that the economic boom "deserves a little appreciation."
It deserves more than that and would be more than appreciated if it all happened under a Democratic president. Republicans and the Trump administration should seize on this reality and promote it every day, asking voters if they want to continue with these successful policies or return to low economic growth and fewer jobs.
It is a question Democrats and their policies of higher taxes and reimposed regulations will find difficult, if not impossible, to answer.

WikiLeaks' Assange is a spy, not a journalist

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a "nonstate hostile intelligence service." Apparently Julian Assange agrees. In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an "intelligence agency" for the people.
Now, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.
The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his "thermonuclear device" -- releasing a tranche of more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables, all unredacted. According to the indictment, those cables "included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential. These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety."
The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange's decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban. The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, "We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them."
Assange's stolen classified documents didn't just find their way to the Taliban; the indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered "a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization al-Qaida in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks" as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.
Indeed, Assange's disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his "Gitmo files "which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him. One of Assange's stolen documents -- the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida's captured operational commander -- revealed that Faraj had "reported on al-Qaida's methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means"; that he had "received a letter from UBL's designated courier" who was "the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan"; and that "in mid-2003, (Faraj) moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar," Pakistan. The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj. Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout.
The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.
Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike "reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections." So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.
Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy. The fact that he gave stolen U.S. intelligence to al-Qaida, the Taliban, China, Iran and other adversaries via a website rather than dead-drops is irrelevant. He engaged in espionage against the United States. And he has no remorse. He once called the innocent people hurt by his disclosures "collateral damage" and admitted WikiLeaks might get "blood on our hands." Sorry, he does not get to aid and abet our enemies, put countless lives at risk and then hide behind the First Amendment. The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes.

No need to join a crowd on top

Texto completo: Last week’s Associated Press photograph of Mount Everest shows a long line of hundreds of climbers in brightly colored gear inching their way to the peak as if they were waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disney World.
"How do they get down? There’s an elevator, right?" quips Joel Schauer, 58, of Hawthorn Woods. Schauer didn’t have to share his Everest moment with hundreds of fellow climbers when he scaled the peak in 2016. He and a guide left the South Col at 25,938 feet at 7 p.m. and arrived at the summit at 6:45 a.m. by themselves.
"There were two people who turned around in front of me when I was making it to the top," Schauer remembers.
Exhausted after the last 12-hour climb, his zipper frozen by the condensation from his breathing mask in the below-zero temperatures, and with a dwindling oxygen supply at 29,029 feet, Schauer didn’t even remove his face mask for the photo of him displaying his "On The Top: Fairchild Automotive" flag from his Lake Zurich business.
"This is nice," Schauer remembers thinking during the hour he spent on top of the world before others arrived and safety became his top concern. "How long can I live here? Look around, enjoy it and get down."
More than 300 people have died climbing Everest since 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the top. So far this month, at least 11 climbers have died while scaling the world’s tallest mountain, the latest a 62-year-old Colorado attorney who had reached the peak and was starting his descent, which can be just as dangerous.
"On the way down, I was trying to suck oxygen, and there wasn’t enough there," remembers Schauer. At one point he slipped and found himself dangling from a rope. "I’m looking out at the Himalayas upside-down," he says. He somehow managed to get a grip with the crampons on his boots digging into the ice, pulled himself up and made it safely back to base camp.
A climber at crowded Everest last week told CNN about having to step over dead bodies on the path. Schauer, whose first Everest attempt in 2014 was canceled after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas, says he didn’t see any bodies during his successful climb two years later. Some critics have blamed the deaths during this climbing season, which ended this week, on the growing number of climbers. Many are unprepared, and the crowding is caused by an increase in the number of companies leading the expeditions.
"Is it hubris? Might be. Is it bad preparation? Might be. Is it the line? Might be," Schauer says, adding that changing the protocol to call for more oxygen for the trip down from the summit might help. A story in The New York Times on Wednesday says Nepalese officials are considering changes that would bar inexperienced climbers and make it more difficult to get a permit.
Whether going up or down, the process is slow and tedious and climbers have to maneuver past each other. "You have to do the Everest dance," Schauer says, describing the process of moving along the guide rope. "You unclip, move, reclip, move. You’re clipping and unclipping 10,000 times."
And when you are exhausted, dealing with the altitude, short on air, and numb from the cold, it’s difficult to improvise.
"It’s really hard to get off that line. There’s nowhere to go," Schauer says. "You’re limited to the slowest person in line."
Schauer and his wife, Kathy, parents of three grown children, Jennifer, Melissa and Jake, became grandparents a week ago with the birth of Addison Grace to Jake and Elizabeth Schauer. Earlier in the year, Joel Schauer reached another milestone when he climbed to the top of Aconcagua in Argentina, making him just the 48th person to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents and ski to both the North and South poles.
The lessons he learns from climbing about building strong teams, planning well and taking "intelligent risks" help him run his business, Schauer says. Everest will always be one of his major accomplishments, but he doesn’t see the need to climb it again. His daughter Jennifer is going to run a not-for-profit for abused girls in Kathmandu, the Nepal city where most Everest climbers embark on their adventure. But Schauer says, "you can climb an equally beautiful mountain without so many people on it."
Considering all his world-famous climbs, ask him about what he is most proud of, and Schauer breaks into a big smile.
"That’s easy," Schauer says. "My granddaughter."

King: All cultures do not contribute alike

Texto completo: At a Webster County town hall on Tuesday, Rep. Steve King said presuming all cultures are equal devalues the 'founding fathers,' and tangled with an event attendee who said King discriminated against Mexican and non-white Americans.
The Kiron Republican said, as he has before, that he cares about history and Western civilization — not race.
"If we presume that every culture is equal and has an equal amount to contribute to our civilization, then we're devaluing the contributions of the people that laid the foundation for America and that's our founding fathers," King said in Fort Dodge. "It is not about race, it's never been about race. It is about culture."
Christina Russell, a Fort Dodge resident, said that his Facebook posts suggest he represents conservatives rather than all 4th District residents — including those who don't share his views. King responded that many people like his presence on Facebook.
"There's a warning banner on there, and you should read that, I think you would never go there again, because it says 'don't go here unless you have a sense of humor,'" King said.
Russell said she disagreed with King's characterization of his Facebook posts as just a "sense of humor."
Earlier this year, he posted a Facebook meme depicting figures of made up of red states punching blue states with the caption, "Folks keep talking about another Civil War ... One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use." King later deleted the picture.
"Making fun of brown people and criminalizing them, it's not a joke, it's not a sense of humor," Russell said. "Dehumanizing the Mexican culture is not a joke."
King has repeatedly caused uproars over his comments about Western civilization, race and non-Western civilizations. Earlier this year, his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy to the New York Times, which he said were misinterpreted, caused Republican leadership to strip him of committee assignments.
On Tuesday, he said he is making progress in winning back his committee seats and fighting back against what he called a "political lynch mob."
"I've been Mr. Nice Guy about this all along and let the cooler heads take over and now ... pretty soon I'm going to start pushing," he said.

Texto completo: It's not unusual to hear House Democrats vow to "get to the bottom" of the Trump-Russia matter -- as if the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, with 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search-and-seizure warrants, and nearly 300 records of electronic communications, was somehow unable to fully probe allegations that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election.
What really concerns Democrats is that Mueller's investigation, conducted with law enforcement powers that Congress does not have, failed to establish any Trump-Russia conspiracy or coordination. And in doing so, Mueller exposed the fatal flaw of the Trump-Russia matter: It was driven entirely by the conspiracy/coordination allegation, which turned out to be false.
The backdrop of conspiracy and coordination made every Trump-Russia episode, including routine political activities, look sinister. The Trump Tower meeting looked ominous in the context of conspiracy and coordination. Donald Trump's public statements about Russia and Vladimir Putin looked incriminating. Michael Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador looked suspicious. And more.
If one believed that Trump and the Russians were conspiring or coordinating to influence the campaign, then any bit of information having anything to do with Russia and the Trump campaign looked portentous. The Russia frenzy became so intense that reputable news organizations published long stories cataloguing all known "contacts with Russians" by anyone associated with the Trump campaign.
But it all depended on conspiracy or coordination. And when Mueller was unable to establish that any such conspiracy or coordination actually occurred, suspicious-seeming events could no longer be credibly cast as suspicious. The Trump-Russia bubble deflated.
That left Democrats with the allegation that the president obstructed the investigation. Some hope that will be enough to impeach Trump, but in recent weeks, they have discovered it might be a hard sell. While it is possible to pursue an obstruction allegation without an underlying crime, impeaching the president on that basis could prove politically difficult. So Democrats vow more investigation to "get to the bottom" of the Trump-Russia matter, or perhaps find something else, entirely unrelated to Russia, to pursue against the president.
The post-Mueller debate on Capitol Hill shows just how critically important the conspiracy and coordination narrative was. Without it, everything has changed. So now that Mueller has formally closed his office and left the Justice Department, it is worth looking at how conspiracy and coordination -- often referred to by the widely-used word "collusion" -- came to dominate American politics for the last three years. Was it a hoax? Hysteria? Or simply partisanship on steroids?
In June 2016, the Washington Post reported that "Russian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee." The paper also noted that "the networks of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were also targeted by Russian spies, as were the computers of some Republican political action committees." By the beginning of summer 2016, then, it was public knowledge that the Russians were up to something.
At the same time, and especially as the Republican and Democratic conventions approached in July, Democrats began suggesting that Trump might be up to something with the Russians. Candidate Trump had expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin and indicated that if elected he would like to have better relations with Russia. Trump also vowed to press NATO countries to pay more for their own defense, a position Trump's adversaries interpreted as pro-Russian. Trump had also hired Paul Manafort, who had extensive business ties to pro-Russian candidates in Ukraine, as his campaign chairman.
In the days leading up to the Democratic convention, the Clinton campaign and its allies in the press saw Russia as a potentially valuable weapon for attacking Trump. On July 20, the New York Times' Andrew Rosenthal wrote a column headlined "Is Trump Obsessed With Putin and Russia?" Two days later, Rosenthal's Times colleague Paul Krugman wrote a piece entitled "Donald Trump, the Siberian Candidate" in which he asked, "If elected, would Donald Trump be Vladimir Putin's man in the White House?"
That same day, July 22, Wikileaks released emails from the Democratic National Committee. Two days later, on the 24th, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook went on television to claim that not only was Russia behind the hack -- that was later proven true -- but also that the Trump campaign was in league with Russia.
"Donald Trump changed the Republican platform to become what some experts would regard as pro-Russian," Mook told ABC News, referring to a just-published Washington Post story that reported, incorrectly, that Trump aides had weakened the portion of the GOP platform regarding Russia and Ukraine.
"He has praised Vladimir Putin," Mook continued. "It's troubling."
Also on July 24, the Times published a news story headlined, "As Democrats Gather, a Russian Subplot Raises Intrigue." "Even at the height of the Cold War," the paper reported, "it was hard to find a presidential campaign willing to charge that its rival was essentially secretly doing the bidding of a key American adversary. But the accusation is emerging as a theme of Mrs. Clinton's campaign."
In the next few days, there were reports that U.S. intelligence agencies had confirmed Russia's responsibility for the hack, followed by the first appearances of the c-word.
"Donald Trump said he has 'never spoken' to Vladimir Putin amid allegations that his campaign colluded with the Russian president," ABC reported on July 27.
"The Clinton campaign is basically saying that there's collusion between Trump and Russia," the New York Times' Maggie Haberman said on CNN on July 29.
The reporters did not present the allegation as fact but rather as news that Clinton people were accusing Trump of colluding with Russia. Over the next few months, the accusations grew and grew and grew.
At the same time, Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, retained the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which in turn retained the former British spy Christopher Steele to search for dirt on Trump and Russia. On June 20, 2016 Steele finished the first installment of what became known as the dossier. It was a blockbuster, alleging that Russia had been "cultivating, supporting and assisting" Trump for at least five years; that Trump had accepted "a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin"; and that Trump was the target of blackmail since Russian intelligence services taped him watching a kinky sex act with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.
According to Russian Roulette, the book by reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn, Steele sent the first installment to Fusion GPS in June 2016. Fusion, in turn, "gave Steele's reports and other research documents to Elias," according to a Washington Post account. And Elias briefed the Clinton campaign.
"We were getting briefings that were put together by the law firm with information," Mook recalled in an interview with CNN in late 2017. "So our internal team was presenting information, our lawyer was presenting information, you know, and we -- and we sort of learned things in pieces."
So as Clinton and her aides pushed the collusion narrative, with the help of an enthusiastic press, campaign officials were also being briefed on the newest, freshest allegations from Steele.
The problem, of course, was that the allegations were not true. Steele also gave his reports to the FBI, which tried to verify them "line by line," according to former FBI general counsel James Baker. It did not succeed. Nearly three years later, the Mueller report failed to corroborate any of the dossier's serious allegations. It was wrong at best, a fraud at worst.
The public did not know what was happening behind the scenes. All they heard -- if they watched cable TV -- was collusion, collusion, collusion. After the election, the allegations consumed reporting on the Trump transition and then the Trump presidency -- especially after the dossier was published in its entirety in January 2017, following the decision by the nation's top intelligence chiefs to brief President-elect Trump on parts of it.
After that, each new revelation that appeared in the press -- Flynn, Manafort, Trump Tower, Michael Cohen, all of it -- appeared in the context of collusion. Ordinary events became shady scheming against the backdrop of Trump-Russia collusion.
As that was happening, Mueller was trying and failing to establish that collusion ever occurred. From interviews with various players in the investigation, it now seems clear that by the end of 2017 Mueller knew that he could not establish conspiracy or coordination. That part of his investigation effectively ended when 2017 did.
Yet Mueller continued his probe for more than a year, mostly focusing on obstruction allegations. Collusion as a topic of investigation might have been dead and gone by that time, but the fact that the Mueller investigation was still going on kept the collusion narrative alive. And that fed the public perception that events Mueller secretly knew were not part of a collusion scheme were still in some way suspicious.
The collusion narrative became so entrenched in the minds of some commentators that even when the Mueller report was made public, with its repeated statements that "the investigation did not establish that the [Trump] campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities," some simply would not accept the verdict.
So now Democrats are promising to carry on, to find that thing -- collusion -- that Mueller could not find. At the same time, others, most notably Attorney General William Barr, have decided to find out how the whole unhappy episode started and what role the nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies played in the process. It is time to know what happened.

Texto completo: Here’s a mental exercise: If something is so abhorrent, so distasteful, so obscene that it should disappear forever, would you want people to see it so they can consciously banish it from public life? Or would you try to cover it up in hopes that it went unnoticed?
Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty is the latest member of the national news media to fail this elementary-level critical thinking test. She proudly declared in a Tuesday column not that she would expose Trump as an offensive beast, but that she would decline to quote any of his famous schoolyard taunts.
“I hereby make a pledge,” she wrote, “from this day forward, I will never again quote, repeat or otherwise dignify any of the asinine nicknames that President Trump gives his adversaries.”
Karen Tumulty.jpgThis is like when a journalist decides they’re “leaving Twitter” or “leaving New York.” and feels compelled to bare his or her soul in an essay about it. The usual answer is, who the hell asked? And who the hell cares?
It says a lot about modern political journalism when literally not doing your job is something to brag about. Journalists used to boast about not revealing their sources, or publishing something that was meant to be secret. Now they’re full of self-satisfaction in doing easy things like refusing to write or skipping important meetings.
It just goes to show that the media’s well of moral self-congratulation is both bottomless and stupid.
In November 2016, just days after the election, President-elect Donald Trump went to the New York Times newsroom to take questions from all of the paper’s writers. Is there less of a place you could imagine Trump venturing than the pit of the publication that called him racist, sexist, bigoted, and xenophobic for the previous year and a half?
That takes balls. But Times columnist Charles Blow thought himself the courageous and principled one for refusing to attend. “I will say proudly and happily that I was not present at this meeting,” he wrote. In lieu of attending the meeting, Blow’s column still reported what was said during it because he read a transcript, no doubt pleasing his colleagues who actually did the work from which he borrowed. (Such courage.)
Up until April of that same year, Blow was refusing even to print Trump’s name (it’s not confusing at all to figure out who someone is writing about when they’re being a passive-aggressive brat about names). Blow explained in a column that he had previously declined to use Trump’s name “as my own personal protest against the inexcusable and embarrassing degree to which media abetted and enabled his ascendance.”
In July 2015, the formerly influential Huffington Post news site relegated all Trump campaign coverage to its “entertainment” vertical. It’s editorial director at the time reasoned that “nobody can deny that his poll numbers are fueled by non-stop media coverage which [the media] wouldn’t give him if he weren’t a celebrity.”
Such dumb programming and editorial positions as these have continued into his presidency. CNN and MSNBC now refuse to cover any portions of Trump’s mega rallies live. Both channels in June last year even interrupted their coverage of a live White House event highlighting victims of illegal immigrant violence because it would have meant paying attention to Trump’s most effective campaign issue.
Trump literally said at the top of the event that his guests had been “overlooked” by the press. No sooner did the families of the victims begin their remarks — I kid you not — but CNN and MSNBC both turned to separate panels to discuss illegal immigrants who had been separated from their children.
Just one problem: Trump is president. The national media cannot make him disappear just because its activists — sorry, I mean journalists! — don’t like him.
What was it that Trump said about the media being the “opposition party” again? Let's make a big show of covering it up.

Wednesday Letters to the Editor: Popular vote movement is misguided

Texto completo: Popular vote movement is misguided
The National Popular Vote movement is as misguided as it can possibly be. This movement is yet another push by the Left to change election rules when they don't win. While controversial on the surface, Hillary Clinton did poll roughly 2.8 million more popular votes than Donald Trump in 2016. But when you look beneath the surface, you find the entire vote differential existed in one state, California.
The national voter turnout was a shameful 55 percent in the 2016 election. Nearly half the voters in this country failed to exercise their freedom to vote. Therefore, the call that "every vote must count" rings hollow, particularly after parsing national elections.
There are 8.6 million people in New York City alone. Four million in Los Angeles, and 2.8 million in Miami. Conversely, there are six entire states that have populations of under 1 million each. Mandating that the popular vote decide national elections will assure those in the least populated states that their votes would, in fact, not count because national elections would be determined by only three or four states. That is not what the founders planned for, or established.
The Electoral process must remain as it is, a fundamental and all important component of our Constitutional Republic.
Andrew P. Calhoun, Jr,. Savannah
2020 election chance 'to put things right'
Executive actions have taken the place of legislation.
Immigration? Executive action. Arms sales to Saudi Arabia? Executive action. Parking a naval task force off the coast of Iran? Executive action. Creating a trade war with China? Executive action.
And worst: not allowing clarity and closure to investigations involving foreign interference in elections and possible malfeasance. A new phrase: executive privilege.
In each of these cases, the president has essentially functioned as dictator in chief. It's easy to blame him. But he's doing what any self-styled dictator would do. Cede power to him, and he takes it. Republicans are not disabusing him.
Today, the president is accusing his accusers of treason. Treason for questioning his actions in office. That is not treason. That is democracy. Without the right to question government, we are a banana republic.
This unfettered power grab will not end until we the people make our collective will known. It is time, and I say this quite seriously, to march in the streets en masse. It is time we send a strong signal to Congress and the president that, as Peter Finch said in the 1976 film "Network," "We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more."
We demand a Congress that exercises its Constitutional responsibility. We demand the [resident to function as a servant of the people not as a potentate. We demand a legislative branch that actually legislates.
Our nation is broken, and it is time the people sound an alarm to fix it.
Can we wait for the 2020 election to put things right? Frankly, I'm worried we will not have time. Given a rudderless president and a spineless Congress, a lot a stupid stuff can happen between now and then.
It's time to stand up. Who will lead?

Disappointed with Memorial Day story selection
The Viewpoints story package published May 26 and honoring Memorial Day, and all that it means, was spoiled by a New York Times excerpt whining about "failed public policy" and the need to soak the rich, more.
The editorial selection, in this space, on this weekend, was badly misplaced. You would have better completed the page with an article and photo of Warriors Walk, at Fort Stewart.
Milo Moore, Savannah
Soldiers didn't have 'safe spaces'
I recently visited the Mighty Eight Air Force Museum in Pooler. The museum graphically displays what young combat crews went through during World War II. The Eighth Air Force lost 26,000, killed freeing Europe from the Nazis. I spent 30 some years working in higher education so that naturally, for me, invited a comparison of the young Americans of then to today's generation of college students.
Students now demand "safe spaces" to insulate them from the views of people who do not think as they do. I wonder where the "safe spaces" were on D-Day? Or in a B-17 engulfed by flak over Berlin?
Faculty are lectured on avoiding "microaggressions" in the classrooms. Those are verbal or behavioral indignities that even unintentional could be offensive. How about those "microaggressions" from the bullets and mortars flying over a foxhole during the Battle of the Bulge?
Professors now include "trigger warnings" in their course description to warn of uncomfortable ideas. Perhaps the broadcasts from Axis Sally of the number of Americans being killed every day should have had trigger warnings that would have let soldiers avoid hearing that insensitive news.
Those college-age Americans went marching out of safe spaces into terrifying danger to protect the free speech and the exchange of ideas being so desperately avoided on campus today. That was the greatest generation... and then there is now.

President's order may spark more lawsuits
So the Trump administration has issued an executive order enabling expatriate Cubans to sue in U.S. courts for property confiscated in the revolution. Is the next logical step another such order enabling Native Americans to sue for compensation for their confiscated property as well? Just asking.

Democrats don't want to investigate the investigators? They must have something to hide

Texto completo: Using the logic of Democrats and the media from the last two years, the only conclusion to be reached from their hysteria over Attorney General William Barr is that someone has something to hide.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., ABC’s “This Week,” April 7, 2019: “I think the main thing here is what is the president hiding?”
Chris Cuomo, CNN’s “Cuomo Prime Time,” Dec. 11, 2018: “Again, central question: Why lie if you’ve got nothing to hide?”
Ari Melber, MSNBC’s “The Beat,” June 8, 2018: “The people who obstruct investigations typically do so because they have something to hide.”
Philip Rucker, Washington Post, April 24, 2018: “Trump keeps saying he’s innocent. So why does he keep sounding like he’s guilty?”
Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Feb. 18, 2018: “My guess is what Trump is hiding has to do with money. It’s something about his financial ties to business elites tied to the Kremlin. They may own a big stake in him.”
We’ve since discovered by way of Robert Mueller, he of liberal legend, he of unlimited time and money, that if Trump is hiding anything, it was never found. They flipped Trump's personal lawyer, his "fixer," Michael Cohen, and somehow Trump's still hiding something? Trump couldn’t hide a 13-year-old affair with an aging porn actress and yet he somehow covered up a massive conspiracy involving dozens of people and one of America’s chief adversaries, all while committees in the House and Senate and the special counsel and every national news organization were hot on the trail!
Amazing.
The conclusion of Mueller’s investigation left Democrats empty-handed, and so now Trump has given his attorney general the authority to investigate and declassify material that could explain to the public how all of this happened. Barr has stated in front of Congress that the purpose of any such investigation would be to ensure that it never happens again and would likely result in new DOJ policy and safeguards against the unnecessary spying on private citizens. Excuse me, not “spying.” I meant surveillance.
Sounds reasonable, unless you’re listening to the media and Democrats who very apparently want something to remain hidden.
Aaron Blake of the Washington Post, a paper that in different circumstances actually came down on the side of transparency, said there might be a “cherry-picking of facts to create a misleading and politically expedient narrative.”
My colleague Byron York has a fantastic rundown of Democrats and anti-Trump obsessives who previously saw the great undoing of Democracy when the White House and Republican allies in Congress tried getting to the bottom of who was spying on Trump's campaign and why.
During testimony in front of Congress last month, Barr said there was reason to believe inappropriate “spying” had occurred on the Trump campaign. It’s a known fact that it happened, but rather than expose themselves as hypocrites for opposing the very type of infestation they themselves have championed, Democrats pretend there’s an issue over terminology.
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, during the hearing, asked Barr if he wanted to “rephrase,” because “the word spying could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., demanded that Barr “retract his unfounded, irresponsible claim.”
House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also called on Barr to “retract his statement immediately or produce specific evidence to back it up.”
The specific evidence is that Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser, was literally wiretapped by the FBI. The specific evidence is that ex-professor Stefan Halper was meeting with Trump aides and, unbeknownst to the campaign, relaying their conversations to the FBI. In every sense of the word, Halper was operating as a spy. Media insistence that he be referred to instead as an “informant” is a semantics game.
A Washington Post story last month said Trump and his supporters “have struggled to legitimize their accusations that the FBI conducted political spying” on the campaign, even as it went on to say that Page was “secretly surveilled” by the FBI.
It's not clear what distinction Democrats and the media are making when they urge that there's a difference between "spying" and "surveillance." If they're going to order everyone to use a different word than "spying," maybe they shouldn't have picked an exact synonym for it.
We don’t know what, if anything, Barr will find in his investigation. But why do Democrats and the news media behave as if they have something to hide?

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocsaio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and 2020 candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have apparently decided to try to ban credit cards. Sure, that's not quite what Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders actually say (they just want to stop the swindlers profiting from excessive interest charges), but that's the effect of their plan. They argue that interest rates should be capped at 15%. There's a question about exceptions, but that's what they mean. If you cap the price of something below the cost of production, then that thing vanishes. No one makes it (who desires to make a loss?) and therefore no one can have it.
It's quite similar to the Venezuelan policy on food prices. Make chicken nice and cheap with a price ceiling so no one can have any.
Interest rates are simply a price, they're just the cost of money. They work the same way as all other prices. As The Federal Reserve of New York noted when considering payday loans: “ Except for the ten to twelve million people who use them every year, just about everybody hates payday loans. “ They also pointed out that payday loans are expensive to provide. As the New York Times reported way back in 2007 (long enough surely for even Sanders to have gotten the news) thrift stores providing nonprofit payday loans still had to charge north of a 200% annual percentage rate just to break even. Thus, as the Fed says, interest rate caps abolish payday loans:
The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), a nonprofit created by a credit union and a staunch foe of payday lending, has recommended capping annual rates at 36 percent "to spring the (debt) trap." The CRL is technically correct, but only because a 36 percent cap eliminates payday loans altogether. If payday lenders earn normal profits when they charge $15 per $100 per two weeks, as the evidence suggests, they must surely lose money at $1.38 per $100 (equivalent to a 36 percent APR.) In fact, Pew Charitable Trusts (p. 20) notes that storefront payday lenders "are not found" in states with a 36 percent cap, and researchers treat a 36 percent cap as an outright ban. In view of this, "36 percenters" may want to reconsider their position, unless of course their goal is to eliminate payday loans altogether.
That reference to “normal profits” is how we can and should work out whether loan rates are “too high.” Or, in the economic jargon, are providing excess profits as a result of market power. There's an average return to capital across the country and economy. People who consistently make more than that are making those excess profits. They're either terribly, terribly, good at what they do in a non-repeatable manner or there's some regulatory barrier to people competing with them. We like that first reason and abhor that second.
Normal profits are defined as making the same sort of return on capital as can be found in those other businesses in other parts of the economy. As with payday loans, there's no evidence that credit card providers are making such excess. So, prices aren't “too high,” they simply reflect the cost of providing the service. The biggest cost is those people who never do repay what they borrow on those credit cards.
None of this is remotely controversial among those who have been bothering to pay attention. But then there's people like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. An example of their devotion to detail is the manner in which they talk about credit unions having had a 15% interest rate cap, including upon credit card balances, since 1980. Their knowledge of reality would be enhanced if they noted that it has actually been 18% since 1987. Knowing how the world works is a useful prelude, precursor, and even precondition to forming plans to change how it works.
But sighs about economic ignorance aren't enough here. They're calling this the Loan Shark Prevention Act, something it most definitely isn't. So, people who desire credit (an awful lot of Americans, given that there's about $1 trillion of this card debt out there) can't get it legally because prices have been set so low that there are no providers. What happens next? They'll go get that credit illegally, won't they? That is, this is the Loan Sharks Generation Act.
Quite why Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez wish to drive a hundred million or so Americans into the clutches of the leg breakers is uncertain. But shouldn't we be getting angry at their blatant shilling for such a despicable industry? For that is what they're doing — price controls on legal and legitimate debt, to the point of its disappearance, just produce good times for the local neighborhood knee-breaker. It's even possible to muse that this might not quite be a useful goal of public policy.

War on statistics, facts isn't slowing down

Texto completo: Don't like the numbers? Invent new numbers instead.
Or make it harder to collect trustworthy numbers next time.
Or just put the squeeze on the number crunchers themselves.
Slowly but surely, the Trump administration has been chipping away at the independence and integrity of our federal statistical agencies, whose data is critical to keeping our democracy functioning and our economy healthy. So far as we know, the administration still hasn't managed to pierce the citadel of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the independent agency that releases jobs and inflation numbers) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (the independent agency that tabulates gross domestic product). But around the edges, it's trying to compromise lots of other official government data.
Last week, The New York Times reported that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to massage the model it uses to determine how many people die of pollution. The goal is to make the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan look significantly less deadly than the current models suggest. This is also part of a broader administrative effort to downgrade official estimates of environmental harm resulting from the administration's deregulatory agenda.
It's reminiscent of another proposal the administration made this month, relating to how we measure poverty. That's also a technical, boring-sounding, deep-in-the-weeds change that most of the public won't notice.
At least, not at first.
But over time, the change would reduce the number of Americans officially counted as poor -- not because they've started earning more money but because this technical, boring-sounding change would redraw the line for who is in or out of poverty.
If you're a right-wing politician, this change would be a double win. It allows you to claim your policies have lifted families out of poverty, even if they're still struggling. It's also a backdoor way to slash spending on the safety net.
That's because the poverty threshold is used to determine eligibility for lots of safety-net services, meaning those newly defined as not-poor would also become newly defined as not-eligible for food stamps, Medicare's Part D Low-Income Subsidy program and other benefits. After 10 years, for instance, more than 300,000 children would lose comprehensive coverage through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), according to an estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
When directly manipulating official government measures isn't an option, the administration can also mess with the data-collection process.
That's precisely what's behind the Commerce Department's last-minute decision to jam a citizenship question into the 2020 Census, the constitutionally mandated enumeration of all "persons" (not just citizens) in the United States.
Immigrant and ethnic minority populations in this country already have high levels of distrust of government, thanks to xenophobic rhetoric and actions by President Trump (including, at one point, a proposed Muslim registry). Now just imagine what happens if the government suddenly demands that every household in America report the citizenship status of every occupant.
Significant population undercounts and otherwise inaccurate data can be expected to result, and the consequences of these distortions would be far-reaching. An inaccurate count would skew congressional representation and the allocation of hundreds of billions of federal dollars each year. It would also warp the many other public and private data measures that use the census as a baseline.
The Supreme Court will soon decide whether the administration's plans can proceed; three lower courts have blocked the question, on the grounds that the administration's actions violate administrative law or the Constitution.
Finally, there's the Economic Research Service, the independent statistical agency housed within the Agriculture Department.
Its researchers compile and analyze data related to crops, yes, but also poverty, food stamps, trade and climate change, among other politically sensitive issues. And right now these economists and statisticians are quitting in droves. That's because the Trump administration abruptly decided to relocate hundreds of positions. Workers were told that if they want to keep their jobs, they have until the end of September to move their families to ... a still as-yet-unnamed new city.
The relocation is, ostensibly, to save money. But it sure seems like a backdoor purge of an independent agency that has produced analyses inconvenient to the administration, including on the harms caused by Trump's trade wars and how little the 2017 GOP tax overhaul has helped small farmers.
Presumably the Trump administration has calculated that doctoring statistical models, skewing survey results and trying to strong-arm statisticians will serve its near-term political interests. In the long term, however, sowing distrust in government data only reduces the ability of policymakers, businesses and voters to make informed decisions.
Of course, maybe that was the goal all along.

Texto completo: “¡Wow, qué es eso, hombre!”, exclamó un piloto, “¡mira cómo vuela!”.
Objetos voladores no identificados (ovnis en español, ufos en inglés) fueron vistos casi a diario entre el verano de 2014 y la primavera de 2015 en los cielos de la Costa Este. Y los testigos no fueron personajes dudosos sino pilotos de élite de la Marina estadounidense , que lo reportaron a sus mandos en el Pentágono e incluso al Congreso.
“ Esas cosas estaban ahí fuera todo el dí a”, explica ahora uno de ellos, Ryan Graves, al diario The New York Times. “Mantener un avión en el aire requiere de una cantidad notable de energía; a la velocidad a la que los vimos, 12 horas en el aire son 11 horas más de las que esperaríamos”, explicó Graves.
Este piloto de cazabombarderos F/A-18, que lleva una década en la Marina, se refería a objetos no identificados de formas extrañas (uno parecía una peonza girando en contra del viento; otro parecía una pastilla contra la tos del tamaño de un avión comercial).
A veces, quedaban grabados en video. En al menos una ocasión, estuvieron a punto de colisionar en el aire contra los cazas de combate. No parece que tengan motor, pero pueden alcanzar los 30,000 pies de altura a velocidades supersónicas. Y nadie dice que sean extraterrestres , pero no siempre parece existir una explicación plausible.
Tanto Graves como otros cuatro pilotos con los que habló el citado diario insisten en que vieron esos objetos durante unas maniobras de entrenamiento con el portaviones Theodore Roosevelt sobre el cielo entre Virginia y Florida. No aportan eso sí ninguna posible explicación.
La Marina tampoco tiene una versión oficial, pero sí ha difundido este año un manual secreto sobre cómo reportar un encuentro de sus pilotos con un ovni.
En algunos casos puede tratarse de drones comerciales , explica un portavoz, Joseph Gradisher, pero en otras ocasiones “no sabemos quién está detrás, no tenemos suficiente información”.
Los avistamientos de 2015 y 2015 fueron reportados a un programa secreto poco conocido del Pentágono “para la identificación de amenazas aeroespaciales”. Su responsable, Luis Elizondo, dimitió en 2017 tras calificarlos como “una sorprendente serie de incidentes”.
Su origen extraterrestre “es tan improbable que compite con otras explicaciones también poco probables y más mundanas”, arguye Leon Golub, astrofísico del centro Harvard-Smithsonian.
Como posibles explicaciones señala a errores en los aparatos de detección de los aviones, efectos o reflejos atmosféricos, o incluso errores en los sentidos de los pilotos debidos a la abundancia de estímulos en un vuelo a alta velocidad.
“La gente lleva décadas viendo cosas extrañas desde aviones militares”, explica el piloto Ryan Graves, “ sería muy gordo que hubiera algo allí arriba”.
Su compañero Danny Accoin afirma que se cruzó en dos ocasiones con estos objetos, capaces de acelerar, frenar y volver a acelerar a velocidad supersónicas como ningún avión conocido .
La primera vez, apareció en su radar pero él no lo pudo ver. Unos días después, uno de sus misiles lo detectó como posible objetivo, y también apareció en su cámara de infrarrojos, aunque él tampoco pudo verlo .
Los pilotos especularon con la posibilidad de que pudiera tratarse de un programa secreto de aviones o drones de última generación.
Pero el hecho de que se rozara una catástrofe cuando uno de esos objetos (descrito por el piloto como una esfera con un cubo dentro) pasó junto a un avión convenció a los pilotos de que un programa así no se permitiría en una zona de maniobras por el peligro que entrañaría.
Además, los ovnis no se comportan como un avión normal. “ La velocidad no mata ”, explica Graves, “frenar o acelerar sí”. Estos objetos pasan de cero a velocidad supersónica de forma casi inmediata, y trazan curvas que van más allá de lo que un piloto podría resistir.
“Cuando la gente dice haber observado fenómenos realmente extraños, a veces vale la pena investigar en serio”, dice la astrofísica Sara Seager, pero “lo que la gente a veces no entiende sobre la ciencia es que a menudo tenemos fenómenos que siguen sin poder ser explicados ”

CHINA'S ORWELLIAN WAR ON RELIGION 'CONCENTRATION CAMPS,' ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND PERSECUTION ARE USED TO REPRESS MILLIONS

Texto completo: Let's be blunt: China is accumulating a record of Orwellian savagery toward religious people.
At times under Communist Party rule, repression of faith has eased, but now it is worsening. China is engaging in internment, monitoring or persecution of Muslims, Christians and Buddhists on a scale almost unparalleled by a major nation in three-quarters of a century.
Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch argues that China under President Xi Jinping "poses a threat to global freedoms unseen since the end of World War II."
To its credit, China has overseen extraordinary progress against poverty, illiteracy and sickness. The bittersweet result is that Chinese people of faith are more likely than several decades ago to see their children survive and go to university - but also to be detained.
China's roundup of Muslims in internment camps - which some call concentration camps - appears to be the largest such internment of people on the basis of religion since the collection of Jews for the Holocaust. Most estimates are that about 1 million Muslims have been detained in China's Xinjiang region, although the Pentagon suggests the number may be closer to 3 million.
Muslims have been ordered to eat pork or drink alcohol against their religious principles. China has also offered "free health checks" that are used to get fingerprints, photos and DNA samples for a surveillance database.
While China hasn't established camps for Christians, it has harassed congregations, closed or destroyed churches, in some areas barred children from attending services and last year detained Christians about 100,000 times, according to China Aid, a religious watchdog group.
China has tried to install monitoring cameras in churches. With China's facial recognition software, that would enable security authorities to identify who shows up at services.
The country is also experimenting with even more Orwellian technology, including a mass surveillance system and a "Social Credit System" that can create a blacklist for those who don't pay debts or who cheat on taxes, break traffic rules or attend an unofficial church.
Blacklisted individuals can be barred from buying plane or train tickets: Although the system is still being tested at the local level, last year it barred people 17.5 million times from purchasing air tickets, the government reported. It could also be used to deny people promotions or assign a ring tone to their phone warning callers that they are untrustworthy.
This system isn't focused on religious people, and some argue that it isn't as menacing as sometimes portrayed, but it's easy to see how the Social Credit System could punish faith communities - especially if integrated with a mass surveillance network. The Xinjiang mass surveillance system explicitly targets people who collect money for a mosque "with enthusiasm."
Through it all, Chinese people of faith have shown enormous courage. One Catholic bishop, James Su Zhimin, 87, has been detained by China since he led a religious procession in 1996. Counting previous detentions, he has spent a total of four decades in prisons and labor camps.
The paradox is that for half a century before the Communist revolution in 1949, Western missionaries traveled around China, operated schools and orphanages and had negligible impact on the country - yet these days missionaries are banned, ministers are persecuted and Christianity has grown prodigiously. There are tens of millions of Christians, mostly Protestants, with some estimates as high as 100 million.
Some are part of officially recognized churches that pledge loyalty to the government, but most are part of the underground church that has been the main target of the crackdown.
Tibetan Buddhists have likewise suffered brutally. Most extraordinary is the fate of the Panchen Lama, the No. 2 figure in Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama.
The previous Panchen Lama died in early 1989. Following tradition, Tibetans in 1995 chose a 6-year-old boy as the next incarnation of the Panchen Lama. Shortly afterward, the Chinese authorities kidnapped the boy and his family, and they haven't been seen since. In his place, the Chinese helped pick a different person as a rival Panchen Lama. (When the Dalai Lama dies, something similar may happen, so at that point there would be two Dalai Lamas and two Panchen Lamas.)
The true Panchen Lama, once the world's youngest political prisoner, now apparently has been detained for 24 years, along with his entire family, through reformist Chinese leaders and repressive ones.
We can't transform China, but we can apply levers like targeted sanctions on individuals and companies participating in abuses of freedom - plus we can do more to speak up for prisoners of conscience of all faiths. It's as important to push for their freedom as to seek more soybean exports.

Texto completo: A British climber who collapsed on the descent from Mount Everest's summit became the latest in a recent string of fatalities on the world's tallest peak.
Robin Haynes Fisher, 44, died Saturday when he became too weak and fainted in Everest's "death-zone," a section at the top of the mountain known for its low levels of oxygen that is fatal if climbers linger for too long.
Fisher's death is at least the eighth this climbing season on Everest, according to Reuters, and the mountain has been mired with dangerous overcrowding and delays that some have blamed for the deaths.
Because of poor weather this year, climbers have had only a few days to attempt to reach Everest's summit, CNN reported. Long lines of climbers at high altitudes have created near standstills at times.
A stunning photo taken last week showed a packed queue of climbers waiting to reach the mountain's top.
“Before you reach the summit, you have to wait and every minute counts at the height,” Krishma Poudel of Peak Promotion, a mountaineering agency in Nepal, told NBC News.
The problem is that the air on Everest's more than 29,000-foot peak has such low oxygen levels that climbers can only stay there for a short period of time.
"Once you get above about 25,000 feet, your body just can't metabolize the oxygen. Your muscles start to break down. You start to have fluid that builds up around your lungs and your brain. Your brain starts to swell. You start to lose cognition. Your decision making starts to become slow. And you start to make bad decisions," Grayson Schaffer, the editor of Outside magazine, told NPR.
"And all of this is happening in the face of, you know, each person trying to sort of reach their ultimate dream," he said.
Schaffer says the problem has gotten worse each year with more climbers attempting to make the ascent from the Nepalese side as the number of permits granted from the Chinese side has been limited.
Danduraj Ghimire, the head of Nepal's tourism department, downplayed the effect the crowds have had on the death toll. Speaking with the New York Times, he blamed the fatalities on the fewer number of good climbing days and said Nepal had no plans to limit the number of permits it grants.
"If you really want to limit the number of climbers, let’s just end all expeditions on our holy mountain," he said.
Sherpas and climbers speaking with the Times also said that a lack of experience from some climbers has exacerbated the problems. Some of the deaths this year, they said, were caused by people who could not climb up then down the peak fast enough to refill their oxygen supplies, while others should not have been on the mountain in the first place.
"You have to qualify to do the Ironman,” Alan Arnette, who writes about Everest and is a climber himself, told the Times. “But you don’t have to qualify to climb the highest mountain in the world? What’s wrong with this picture?”
However, other experienced climbers have also been among the dead this year.
Don Cash, 55, from Utah, died last week as he descended Everest's peak. For Cash, reaching the summit marked the completion of his dream: of climbing the tallest mountain on all seven continents. Yet he also collapsed on his way down the mountain.
While deaths occur every year on Mount Everest, some say the problem in 2019 is particularly concerning.
“I’ve seen traffic, but not this crazy,” Nirmal Purja, who has summited Everest four times, told the Washington Post.

Texto completo: To commemorate the 200th birthday of Rabbi Isaac M. Wise, "the architect of Reform American Judaism" is the subject of exhibits at Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion in University Heights.
The exhibit – "Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise: An American Dreamer" – has its grand opening at the American Jewish Archives on the HUC campus on Thursday, coinciding with Jewish American Heritage Month.
Also on campus, the Skirball Museum features the entire collection of bronze medals honoring members of the Jewish-American Hall of Fame, including 2019 inductee Wise, and the Klau Library has a display of editions of Wise's prayer book, "Minhag Amerika."
Together, the exhibits put Wise in context of his impact on American history.
"He was such a pioneer, a visionary," said Lisa Frankel, director of educational outreach at American Jewish Archives.
Born in Bohemia in 1819, Wise came to America with ideas to reform Judaism to be more appealing to American Jews. In Albany, New York, and then in Cincinnati, he introduced progressive reforms that reshaped Judaism in America.
Wise came to Cincinnati in 1853 to serve as rabbi of the K.K. Bene Yeshurun congregation, a lifetime appointment until his death in 1900.
He organized construction of Plum Street Temple (now known as Isaac M. Wise Temple) in 1866; founded Hebrew Union College in 1875, which also has campuses in New York, Los Angeles and Jerusalem; and established the American Israelite, a weekly Jewish newspaper still in print in Cincinnati, in 1854.
He also founded the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Central Conference of American Rabbis.
Wise's influence wasn't just on Jewish history, but on American history. "Wise felt Jewish people were an important part of the American story," Frankel said.
There's no better proof than the Jewish-American Hall of Fame, started in 1969 by Mel Wacks at the Judah L. Magnes Museum at the University of California, Berkeley.
Wise is the 50th person to be inducted, joining the likes of Albert Einstein, Barbra Streisand and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The honor is not for their accomplishments in science, politics or entertainment alone.
"So many of them saw need in our society and used their fame and wealth to give back," said Abby Schwartz, director of the Skirball Museum.
Each honoree is immortalized into a limited edition, 2-inch bronze medal. Each medal was individually designed to reflect the honoree.
"They all tell a story," Schwartz said.
Among the locals honored in the Jewish-American Hall of Fame are
Lillian Wald, born in Cincinnati, who started public health nursing services and founded Henry Street Settlement, a social services agency in Manhattan.
Adolph Ochs, also from Cincinnati and married to Wise's daughter, who turned the struggling New York Times into the nation's "newspaper of record," and coined the motto, "All the news that's fit to print."
Rabbi Alexander D. Goode, ordained at HUC, who was one of the Four Chaplains – a Methodist minister, a Dutch Reform minister, a rabbi and a Catholic priest – who gave up their life jackets and prayed together as the troop transport Dorchester was sunk by a German U-boat in 1943.

Recordings Contradict Nxivm Leader's Denials

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
In a letter and in emails, the leader of Nxivm tried to distance himself from the branding ritual that had led some members to break away from the cultlike group.
But the ceremonial branding of some women involved in Nxivm followed a script created by the leader, Keith Raniere, and a handful of select followers who had promised complete obedience to him, according to four recorded conversations introduced last week as evidence in his racketeering and sex trafficking trial.
"Do you think the person who is being branded should be completely nude and sort of held to the table like a sort of, almost, like a sacrifice?" Mr. Raniere asked the actress Allison Mack in one recording.
He went on to outline his vision for how women's bodies would be arranged before being branded: "legs spread straight, like feet being held to the side of the table, hands probably above the head, being held almost like tied down."
The women, who were referred to as "slaves," were illustrating their submission in an indelible way: Their skin was seared with a symbol that included Mr. Raniere's initials.
The recordings have offered the first contemporaneous account of how Mr. Raniere helped devise one of the group's most secret and controversial practices within Nxivm. The brandings were connected to a Nxivm subset called D.O.S. that he had repeatedly assured others he had nothing to do with.
Mr. Raniere has denied wrongdoing. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said in an email on Sunday that Mr. Raniere played a role in the creation of the subset but was not a member. "He collaborated with the first line members in the group's creation and he hoped the women would take over going forward," Mr. Agnifilo said.
In addition to showing how Mr. Raniere meticulously planned the branding ceremonies, the recordings also illustrate the hold he had over certain followers.
"The person should ask to be branded," Mr. Raniere told Ms. Mack in a recording. "She should say, 'Please brand me. It would be an honor' -- or something like that -- 'an honor I want to wear for the rest of my life."'
Ms. Mack responded by twice saying "O.K." A witness in the case, Lauren Salzman, testified that she was asked to say those very words before being branded in 2017.
Mr. Raniere's trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, which is set to enter its fourth week on Tuesday, has had no shortage of surprising, even shocking, moments. There has been testimony that Mr. Raniere had sex with an underage girl and that people within Nxivm saw him as all-knowing and practically infallible.
But the branding of women who joined a clandestine "sorority" within Nxivm, called The Vow or D.O.S., is at the heart of the Nxivm case, providing the most visible and graphic example of Mr. Raniere's control.
Mr. Raniere, 58, co-founded Nxivm (pronounced nex-ee-um) in the 1990s as a self-help organization based in a suburban town in upstate New York. He is now on trial on charges of racketeering conspiracy, identity theft, extortion, forced labor, money laundering, wire fraud and sex trafficking.
Although he presented himself as a guru-like humanitarian, prosecutors and former Nxivm members have described Mr. Raniere as a mountebank who exploited his followers.
Among them were the eight women whom Mr. Raniere recruited to join D.O.S., and who were referred to as "first line D.O.S. masters." Each recruited additional slaves, and those slaves in turn recruited others. All were supposed to be loyal to Mr. Raniere, who was called "grandmaster."
To join D.O.S., the women provided "collateral" in the form of sexually explicit photographs or other sensitive material meant to guarantee their unquestioning obedience, according to trial testimony. Some were said to have been assigned by their masters to have sex with Mr. Raniere.
Outrage over the brandings caused some Nxivm and D.O.S. members to depart and led to blog posts and news articles. Soon after word emerged that the authorities were investigating the group.
Mr. Raniere appeared to recognize that news reports about the brandings might threaten Nxivm. After a story about the branding ran in The New York Times, he emailed a draft position statement to the first line masters, according to testimony.
He wrote that women who had been branded were now being shamed by a "misogynistic strike" and added that D.O.S. "has nothing at all to do" with Nxivm, Ms. Salzman testified.
"This sorority is autonomous, separate and distinct from Nxivm, Keith Raniere and associates," the statement said, adding that he had "little knowledge or authority in the issue."
In a separate letter to Nxivm members, Mr. Raniere wrote, "I feel it is important to clarify the sorority is not part of NXIVM and that I am not associated with the group."
Ms. Salzman, who was a first line master in D.O.S., testified that Mr. Raniere came up with a plan to say that the brand was not meant to include his initials but represented the seven chakras, the four elements, or "Bar Alpha Mu" -- a combination, apparently, of a mathematical symbol and two Greek letters.
"I lied to everybody," Ms. Salzman testified about Mr. Raniere's involvement in D.O.S. "I lied to the entire community about it. I lied to the media about it."
The new recordings of Mr. Raniere's meetings with first line D.O.S. masters show his role as an architect of the group, speaking about how it should be structured, and acknowledging that the brand itself was tied to him.
"The monogram as it is right now is very directly related to my initials," Mr. Raniere said in a meeting recorded in 2016.
The group discussed how to obscure that fact, with one woman saying, "If you have a husband, and now you have this thing, I think they're going to try to figure it out."
Another woman said the brand seemed like a "cool, kind of alien symbol."
Mr. Raniere said in the conversation with Ms. Mack that the brandings could evoke a "feeling of submission," and that women should ask to be branded before being held down "so it doesn't seem like they're being coerced." He added that videotaping the brandings would provide additional collateral and that women should therefore be placed in "a more vulnerable position."
Ms. Mack said that the pain of the brandings could be seen as a symbol of the slaves' love for their masters. Mr. Raniere agreed.
"It is the love of saints," he said. "It is the love of the purest beings that walk the earth."

Texto completo: When Mena Massoud, the star of the new "Aladdin" live-action remake, got the first callback for the title role, he decided not to revisit the beloved 1992 animated original. Instead he wanted to draw inspiration from the underlying theme: a "journey of personal identity."
The cartoon does carry a well-intentioned, universal message of being true to yourself. But it has also been criticized for promoting the stereotype of "barbaric" Arabs. And though it's set in a fictional port city in Arabia, its characters were voiced by a majority white cast.
Born in Cairo and raised in Toronto, Massoud, 27, has a rosier view of the earlier movie. "My parents knew about the story of Aladdin far before the animation film. It's a folk tale that is very prevalent in Egypt," he said, adding that the movie is a "very positive depiction of where we came from."
Still, Disney needed to update the revival for woke audiences. After an open, worldwide casting call, it wound up with a diverse cast that includes the British actress Naomi Scott, who plays Jasmine and is of Indian descent, and actors with Iranian and Tunisian roots. Massoud, who had a recurring role in "Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan," won out over more than 2,000 hopefuls who auditioned for his role.
The film has received decidedly mixed reviews from critics, though in his New York Times review, A.O Scott called the casting "admirable."
In a recent phone interview, Massoud explained why he thought it was "counterproductive" to critique the story and casting process and shared his thoughts on Will Smith's blue genie. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Were you a fan of the animated "Aladdin" growing up?
Yeah, he's one of the only characters that I could relate to on a cultural level. I have two older sisters. They had it on at the house before I could even walk, so I grew up with it in my childhood in a big way.
Did you ever have any thoughts about the backlash it received for the original "Arabian Nights" lyrics and its portrayal of the characters?
No. Growing up in my family, we just celebrated that film because it was one of the few that had any representation for us. It's very pretentious to start nit-picking things when there's not a lot of representation out there anyway. You have to start somewhere.
Casting for the live-action remake took longer than expected because it was difficult to find an actor for the lead role. Were you following that process as it played out?
When I first saw the online casting [call], I was very excited. I put a tape together. I didn't have much hope because when they're getting tens of thousands of tapes from around the world, the chance of it even getting seen is very low. So we didn't hear anything back, I assumed they were going to one of the Hollywood established stars, and that was it. Four months later, I heard from my reps and I was shocked that they were still looking for someone. I put another tape together and flew to London twice to test for it.
Why do you think the parts of Aladdin and Jasmine went to relative newcomers?
From my understanding, [the producers and the director] did go out to stars at the beginning, but they just couldn't find anyone able to pull off the singing and dancing and acting. They were looking for a singer that could pull off the acting. And they came to realize over months of searching that they actually needed a really strong actor because Aladdin only really sings two songs. So I think that's when they started changing their approach.
When Disney announced that Naomi Scott would play Jasmine, some fans reacted angrily on Twitter and said the role should have gone to someone of Arab heritage.
It's a funny thing that's happening online. The Middle Easterners want "Aladdin" to be a Middle Eastern story, and the Indians want "Aladdin" to be an Indian story. The truth is, it's really a folk tale from the 1800s, and Agrabah is a fictional place that's a culmination of India and Asia and the Middle East. In fact, in the original folk tale, Aladdin was actually of Chinese descent. So what we wanted to do with this was represent as many different cultures from that part of the world as possible.
How did the filmmakers address concerns about cultural sensitivity and representation beyond casting? Did you ever feel the need to flag anything that seemed off?
They had a team of cultural advisers on set. And no, to answer your question. It's the most represented and the most respect, culturally, that I've ever felt in my career. My first professional gig was on a show called "Nikita," and I played Al Qaeda No. 2. At that time I had to take those roles because I just wanted to get my foot in the door. So I think [Disney] handled it beautifully and [this] needs to happen more in Hollywood.
What was it like working with Will Smith? How did you hold your own on set?
I've been in the industry for about 10 years, and I think if you want to work with the best directors in the world and the best performers in the world, you have to value yourself and what you have to offer. Don't get me wrong -- I was really nervous the first time I met Will. But we had a lot of time to prep and to get to know each other, so by the time we got to filming, he [was] just a co-star of mine.
What did you think of his take on the blue genie?
I honestly think he's the only one that could have played it. I think what Robin [Williams] did so well, and the reason Robin's genie is so iconic, is because he brought his whole self to the role. And Will has done the same in his rendition. He's brought his past 30 years of experience. The genie's got a little bit of "Hitch" in it; it's got a little bit of "Bad Boys" in it; a little bit of "The Pursuit of Happyness" -- it's got a little bit of everything. I think he nailed it.
You recently sent out a message to Egyptian viewers in Arabic on Twitter. Do you still have ties to the country?
Definitely. I grew up speaking Arabic at home. I've been back to Egypt a few times. I'm planning to go back again this year for the El Gouna Film Festival in September.
What's next for you?
Right after this I'm shooting a series on Hulu called "Reprisal." It's produced by Warren Littlefield and it's with Abigail Spencer and Rodrigo Santoro. It's very dark and dramatic and very different from "Aladdin."
And you'll be voicing the poet Rumi in an animated film slated for 2020.
Yes! I've actually started working on it already. It's very cool animation. It's not mainstream -- it's very artistic. I'm looking forward to seeing how that turns out.

Texto completo: NAIROBI, Kenya - Kenya's High Court on Friday upheld laws that criminalize gay sex, declining to join the handful of nations that have recently abolished a prohibition imposed by Britain during the colonial era.
The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the court, announced in a courtroom packed with activists who wanted to see the laws overturned, keeps Kenya aligned with most of Africa. Anti-gay laws and conservative cultural mores remain prevalent across most of the continent. In addition to the threat of prosecution, discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are common.
"A sad day for the rule of law and human rights," said Eric Gitari, a co-founder of the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, a Kenyan civil rights group, who was one of the petitioners in the case. He said he and others would appeal the ruling.
Tea Braun, director of the Human Dignity Trust, an international gay rights advocacy group, noted in a statement that Kenya's constitution guarantees human dignity and freedom from discrimination.
"Yet in handing down this disappointing judgment, the court has ruled that a certain sector of society is undeserving of those rights," she said.
The Kenyan ruling came on the same day, however, that Taiwan had its first same-sex weddings, which were legalized last week by the legislature.
More than 70 countries criminalize gay sex, most of them Muslim countries or former British colonies, according to advocacy groups.
In the 19th century, British colonial rulers - far more than their counterparts from other European countries - outlawed same-sex relations in dozens of colonies on multiple continents. After gaining independence, most of those nations kept the bans in place, often using a version of the Victorian language the British had left behind.
At a meeting last year of Commonwealth heads of state, Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain regretted that history, and she urged other nations to change their laws. Britain did not repeal its own law against homosexual acts in England and Wales until 1967, with similar laws repealed later in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In the United States, gay sex was illegal in 13 states until a Supreme Court ruling in 2003.
The highest courts in three nations that were once part of the British Empire have recently struck down such laws: Belize in 2016, Trinidad and Tobago in April 2017 and India last September. A court case in Botswana is pending.
But other former British colonies, particularly Uganda, have become more harsh in pursuing discrimination and punishment for gay sex.
The sections of Kenya's Penal Code upheld by the ruling on Friday make it a felony to have "carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature" or to commit "gross indecency." The maximum sentence for various offenses range from five to 21 years in prison.
The "carnal knowledge" section covers anal and oral intercourse, and in theory applies regardless of the gender of the people involved. Gay rights advocates say that it is used primarily against gay men. "Gross indecency" applies specifically to acts between men.
The justices ruled that the laws were not discriminatory, and they rejected an argument by the plaintiffs that the statutes discouraged people from seeking treatment for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Anti-gay views are strongly held by many Kenyans. Cursing and shaking his head, Raphael Kimeu, 56, a waiter at a Nairobi restaurant, said that tolerating homosexuality "is tantamount to showing disrespect to the same God who created us."

A salute to the brave men of the Lucky Herndon

Texto completo: June 6, 2019, is the 75th anniversary of the invasion of Normandy. This is the time of year that I miss my father, James Robert Whitson (1921-2015).
For most of the 70-plus years we shared together, he never stopped talking about the amazing week that initiated the end of World War II in western Europe. More than once, he said he survived D-Day because of the leadership of the captain of the USS Herndon (DD-638) and the teamwork of the men with whom he served as a torpedo man (TM1).
On the wall of the corner that served as my father's home office was a framed front page of The New York Times that announced the success of the invasion. Yellow with age, the news story included a sidebar acknowledging the role of one special ship.
Naval historians confirm the Herndon, on the front row of destroyers assigned to bombard the German guns mounted on the cliffs above Omaha Beach, was the first to open fire. Those who wagered on the odds were surprised the ship emerged unscathed.
Subsequently, war correspondents described the ship as the "Lucky Herndon."
Like many veterans, my father rarely mentioned his own individual role in serving during World War II.
Instead, he preferred to talk about his shipmates who served with him aboard the destroyer commissioned on Dec. 20,1942. When asked to describe what he did, he just said he had a job to do and kept busy for most of a week, not even remembering his birthday, which took place on D-Day plus two.
At a ship reunion in Baltimore, Md., that I attended with my parents, I learned about a special task that had fallen to my father during the first hours of the invasion. My father's shipmate told me he was supposed to be the ship's lookout but was so scared he lost his voice. "Your dad just grabbed the headphones and crawled right up to the crow's nest. He kept me from being disciplined for failing to do my duty."
I finally realized when my father talked about Rangers scaling the cliffs of Pointe Du Hoc, he actually saw those people through the binoculars he was using to report the degrees and distance of enemy fire. Apparently, the anonymous person quoted in the newspaper account who warned the officers on the Herndon's bridge of incoming German fire was my father.
On the way home from the reunion, I asked my dad why he had never mentioned his front-row seat.
"Well, that fellow joined the Navy using an altered birth certificate, so he was barely 18 the day of the invasion. I had worked the battle phones aboard my previous assignment on the USS Milwaukee, so I knew what to do and took charge. Anyone would have done that."
My father's admiration for Lt. Commander Granville Moore, who served as the Herndon's captain, never ceased. Other ships hit mines that had escaped the midnight minesweepers, but the Herndon's captain knew that moving slow and steady was less likely to stir the water and set off an orphan blast.
One of the last conversations I had with my father before he passed was a query as to the whereabouts of some of his former shipmates from the Herndon. The internet was able to help me pull up obituaries of the men he recalled despite his age-related dementia.
He slowly nodded his head as I read each name and the dates of their death. He seemed relieved by the thought that he might be soon reunited with them. He didn't want to be left behind.
Age has taken its toll on most of the ship's crew, but at least one is alive and traveling with the Herndon (Virginia) High School Marching Band to the 75th anniversary observance in France.
The town is named after noted USN Commander William Herndon, who also served as the namesake of the USS Herndon. On more than one occasion, members of the Herndon's crew visited the school and were always honored with a military salute by its Navy JROTC cadets.
Photos of individual crew members who served on D-Day, including my father, will be carried by the members of the band as they perform for dignitaries. Once again, the sailors of the "Lucky Herndon" will have a front-row seat on the beaches of Normandy.
Roxanne Frey is a University of Illinois retiree who occasionally publishes in newspapers and magazines. She was born 12 months after the invasion of D-Day. Her father wound up his nine years in the U.S. Navy as an instructor at the San Diego Naval Base School with Roxanne and her mother living in Navy dependents housing. Currently, Roxanne lives and writes in Oakland, Ill.

Texto completo: Spoiler alert! The following contains plot details from the “Game of Thrones” series finale, Season 8 Episode 6, "The Iron Throne. "
Sophie Turner has words for fans hating on the final season of "Game of Thrones. "
Speaking with The New York Times the day after Sunday's series finale, the actress who played Sansa Stark, said she wasn't shocked by the hostility, but nonetheless called out petitions against the show.
One Change. org petition, which called on HBO to remake the entire final season with "competent writers," garnered 1. 4 million signatures.
"People always have an idea in their heads of how they want a show to finish, and so when it doesn’t go to their liking, they start to speak up about it and rebel," said Turner, 23.
"The thing about 'Game of Thrones' that’s always been amazing is the fact that there’s always been crazy twists and turns, right from Season 1 with Ned’s beheading," she added. "So Daenerys becoming something of the Mad Queen – it shouldn’t be such a negative thing for fans. It’s a shock for sure, but I think it’s just because it hasn’t gone their way.
"All of these petitions and things like that – I think it’s disrespectful to the crew, and the writers, and the filmmakers who have worked tirelessly over 10 years, and for 11 months shooting the last season," she added. "Like 50-something night shoots. So many people worked so, so hard on it, and for people to just rubbish it because it’s not what they want to see is just disrespectful. "
Listen to this week's episode of USA TODAY's podcast, The Mothership, to hear our Film and TV Critic rate the "Game of Thrones" series finale.
Despite grumbling fans, the series finale, "The Iron Throne," set an HBO ratings record with a total of 19. 3 million viewers watching via cable or streaming. That broke the mark set by the 2002 series finale of the "The Sopranos," which notched 13. 4 million viewers.
'Game of Thrones' series finale recap: A disaster ending that fans didn't deserve
Kit Harington to fans mad about Daenerys: 'You’re culpable, you cheered her on'
When she spoke with the Times, she hadn't yet watched the finale, as she "truly can’t be alone to watch it. "
However, she said she "loved" how things turned out for Sansa, who won independence for the North and became its queen, calling it "kind of the perfect ending for her. ”
Turner explained, "It’s the only place that she really, truly feels safe. It’s the place that she’s the most capable of ruling. She would be a fair and loving ruler, and it’s what she’s been striving for this whole series: to go back home, to protect her home. And finally, she has that. "
'Game of Thrones': Sadly, the show never fixed its problem with women, even in the series finale
Priyanka Chopra: Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas will have a second wedding ceremony
Despite being satisfied with Sansa's fate, Turner can't help but be emotional about the show's end.
"This whole time I felt like I’ve been prepared for it, and now that it’s come to the day and it’s over, it feels horrible," she said. "And, I’m doing a press day for my new movie (the "X-Men" film "Dark Phoenix") but everyone keeps asking me about how I feel, and I just want to cry. "

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger are seeking briefings from the National Security Agency after a report that a spying tool developed by the agency and then leaked online was used to spread the ransomware that has debilitated Baltimore's computer systems.
And Council President Brandon Scott said the federal government should step in to cover some of the cost of Baltimore's recovery.
The New York Times reported Saturday that hackers used a tool known as EternalBlue to spread the ransomware through the city's systems. The Times cited anonymous security experts briefed on the case.
Ruppersberger, a Democrat whose district includes part of Baltimore, has previously raised concerns about the dangers posed by EternalBlue and other leaked tools - part of a huge cache posted online in 2017 by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers - and says more needs to be done to counter them.
"If recent media reports regarding the origins of the Baltimore ransomware attack are true, the congressman's concerns are further validated," said Jaime Lennon, a spokeswoman for Ruppersberger. "We will be seeking a full briefing from NSA regarding these reports."
While the tools have been widely linked to the U.S. spy agency, and experts and former government employees have said they appear to be authentic, U.S. officials have never acknowledged the connection.
Van Hollen, a Democrat, said in a statement that he had been in contact Saturday with Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the party's top member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and that they would seek a briefing from the NSA.
"We must ensure that the tools developed by our agencies do not make their way into the hands of bad actors," Van Hollen said.
Scott said he was calling on Gov. Larry Hogan to ask the White House for the ransomware attack to be declared a federal emergency, which would unlock funding.
"Given the new information and circumstances its even more clear that the federal government needs to have a larger role in supporting the City's recovery, including federal reimbursement for damages," Scott said.
"The fact that the root technology that enabled this attack came from our own federal government, just miles away, only adds insult to injury."
"We continue to work closely with city leaders, including leveraging both state and federal resources, to help restore affected systems," the governor's office resonded.
Lester Davis, a spokesman for Bernard C. "Jack" Young, said the Democratic mayor supported Ruppersberger's efforts to glean more information.
"The information that was included in the Times story was very troubling," Davis said.
"There's going to be a lot of speculation around this. What the mayor's going to be interested in is getting beyond speculation and hearing from the authorities that would have some insight into what actually went on."
The FBI and Secret Service have been working with the city to respond to the ransomware. An FBI spokesman did not respond Saturday to a request for comment.
Since the 2017 leak, EternalBlue has regularly been put to use by hackers from foreign countries to spread ransomware and other malicious computer code.
The leak rekindled a debate between security officials, civil libertarians and the cybersecurity industry over when spy agencies should disclose to technology companies that they have found flaws in their systems. The spy agencies can use those flaws to gather valuable intelligence about terrorists and foreign governments, but there is also a risk that criminals or rival spies find the same flaws and use them to target Americans.
In a report his office issued last year, Ruppersberger said the government needed to be prepared to take defensive steps against such leaked tools.
"The weaponization of these tools by malicious actors poses a significant risk to the U.S., our allies and the American private sector," he wrote.
Because the U.S. government has never acknowledged the connection between the Shadow Brokers leak and the NSA, there has been no public accounting of what steps the agency took to protect the powerful tools it created or whether it should have kept the weaknesses they relied on a secret.
The EternalBlue tool relies on a flaw in Microsoft software, though the company issued a patch before the leakers posted the tools online. Many systems remain vulnerable two years later, but the existence of the patch prompted some security researchers to argue Saturday that the responsibility for the Baltimore breach lies with the city.
"If an organization has substantial numbers of Windows machines that have gone 2 years without patches, then that's squarely the fault of the organization, not Eternalblue," security consultant Rob Graham wrote in a tweet.
But Jake Williams, a former NSA operative who now runs a security company, framed the argument differently.
"Should the victims have patched? Sure," he said, "But that's like me putting the gun in the hands of someone intent on killing a police officer. If the officer isn't wearing a bulletproof vest (but should have been), that doesn't absolve me of playing a role in his death."
Scott has formed a commission to review the city's computer security. He said the commission would look at what the city's IT office did to protect the network.
Scott said he wanted to learn what officials knew about the patch and whether steps were taken to install it - or if they failed to act.
"They have to be able to come up with a very good reason why they didn't do that," he said. "It's unacceptable if it was readily available and known to them."

Texto completo: ALBANY – New York would become one of the first states to outlaw racial discrimination based on natural hair and hairstyles like braids, twists and dreadlocks under a bill introduced at the state Capitol.
The proposal from state Sen. Jamaal Bailey, D-Bronx, and Assemblywoman Tremaine Wright, D-Brooklyn, would make clear employers and schools can't discriminate on the basis of someone's hairstyle if it is "historically associated with race."
Practically speaking, the bill would prevent employers and schools from requiring their black employees or students to straighten their hair or setting a dress code that prevents braids, dreadlocks or similar hairstyles.
Bailey said the bill is about ensuring "people of color and their cultural choices are protected and supported."
"Hair is a part of you," Bailey said Friday. "It's something that is innately part of your being, and being able to express yourself through your hair and how you choose to wear your hair should not be something that someone can discriminate against you for."
The bill was introduced three months after New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued guidelines preventing discrimination based on hair and a month after the California Senate approved a similar measure.
As it stands, New York state law prevents employer discrimination based on a variety of traits, including age, race, creed, sex and color.
Bill would expand definition of 'race' Wright and Bailey's bill, which was introduced Thursday, would expand the legal definition of race to include "ancestry, color, ethnic group identification and ethnic background," including any "traits historically associated with race" such as "hair texture and protective hairstyles."
Examples of "protective hairstyles" are braids, locks and twists, among others, according to the bill.
The same definition would also be added to the state Dignity For All Students act, which deals with bullying in schools.
The proposal is similar to a measure approved unanimously by the California Senate on April 22.
That measure is awaiting a vote in the California Assembly.
NYC acted in February New York City, meanwhile, took the action unilaterally.
The city Commission on Human Rights changing its guidelines in February to make clear city residents have the right to "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state," according to The New York Times.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose wife, Chirlane, is black, said his relationship with his wife, dating back to the early 1990s, "began my education on the question of hair."
"You know, she told me many, many stories of people, particularly women, being looked down on because they had natural hair, or because they had dreadlocks, or whatever it may be," de Blasio said in February. "And it's appalling to me that that ever went on, but it still goes on to this day."
De Blasio continued: "It's not acceptable. It must end, and we're going to lead the way here in New York City."
Bailey said he's hopeful his bill will get some consideration before state lawmakers end their annual session in mid-June.
"I think we can stand to learn a thing or two from the city of New York and how they apply their human-rights law," he said.

Texto completo: LONDON -- Long before their professional stars aligned, Kenneth Lonergan and Matthew Broderick took an astronomy course at the Hayden Planetarium on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
Nearly 40 years later, the best friends -- who'd met at 15 in a school up the street -- are still talking about that class, taught by a man Mr. Lonergan described as "very quiet, very sincere, very gentle."
"He kind of stuck in my mind," Mr. Lonergan, who went on to a celebrated career as a playwright and screenwriter, said. "I thought he'd be a good character in a play, and the astronomy classroom at the planetarium would be a great setting."
Mr. Broderick added: "We imagined a whole life for this teacher."
In 2009, Mr. Lonergan unveiled "The Starry Messenger," a sweetly comic drama about a middle-aged astronomy instructor, mired in the minutiae of marriage and career, who looks to the heavens for guidance. And he cast Mr. Broderick as Mark Williams, its lead.
It was to be the playwright's highly anticipated return to the stage, after a move into moviemaking that peaked with the Oscar-nominated "You Can Count on Me" but ran into legal drama over the fate of its follow-up, "Margaret."
News reports at the time warned that the New Group production was doomed -- that Mr. Lonergan was overwhelmed by his first efforts at directing his own unwieldy play, that Mr. Broderick couldn't remember his lines.
But others came to see redemption when the play opened. "If this is what a disaster looks like, bring on the apocalypse," Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, contending that Mr. Broderick had delivered "his finest, most affecting performance in years."
A decade later, "The Starry Messenger" and Mr. Broderick have arrived in the West End of London, directed by Sam Yates and co-starring Elizabeth McGovern as Mark's wife.
In separate interviews -- Mr. Broderick in London before a rehearsal in early May, and Mr. Lonergan in New York on the day of the play's first preview two weeks later -- the men discussed their friendship, their collaboration and the play's bumpy beginnings.
Here are edited excerpts from the conversations.
Matthew, this is Kenny's third play on the West End but it's your debut. Does it feel like a milestone?
BRODERICK I mean, I'm superstitious and I don't want to, you know ...
Knock wood.
BRODERICK Knock wood, exactly. [Looks around] There's no wood. [Walks to a wooden table and knocks] When you're a kid, there's something very romantic about London. I'm embarrassed to say it, but it is sort of a dream to come here and do a play.
Embarrassed?
BRODERICK Well, it sounds hokey. And it also just sets you up for, "Be careful for what you dream for, you [expletive]." And wham, I'll be smashed down to whack-a-mole. [Laughs] Don't print any of that.
Kenny, did you have Matthew in mind as Mark from the beginning?
LONERGAN No. I started writing notes for it, or making attempts at scenes in it, when I was pretty early in my mid-20s. And the character could be anywhere from his early 40s to his early 50s -- no older and no younger -- so there's no question of writing it for Matthew. But I believe that I thought at the time, "It's too bad he's not the right age because it's a really good part for him." He happens to understand what's so beautiful about astronomy itself.
What is that beauty?
LONERGAN All you've got to do is go outside at night when you're in the country and look up.
Why the play's long gestation?
LONERGAN When I first wrote the play, I was a young man, not a 40-year-old man, and I really didn't know what it was like to be in a relationship for 10 years, or to have the same job for 10 years.
How much rewriting did you do?
LONERGAN Almost none. I cut about 10 pages and I changed a few lines, a dozen maybe. And I changed half of those back. There's always a tipping point where you start to feel that everything you're doing is making it worse, not better.
Matthew, you've also appeared in Kenny's films, including "You Can Count on Me" and "Manchester by the Sea." Who takes the lead when you collaborate?
BRODERICK Gosh, that's a good question. I always let Kenny be in charge -- because I love him and I never don't agree with him. And he wrote ["The Starry Messenger"], so my first job is to get him what he wants.
LONERGAN [Laughs] I certainly have the final say over what he says in the play, and he has the final say over how he says it. But it's really much more collaborative than that.
BRODERICK Not to say we haven't had a few screaming fights over nothing that don't last. But no, we've never had a split in an endeavor, one of these plays or movies, never.
What was it like putting on the original production amid all that negativity?
LONERGAN There was a little tumult because I had never directed a play before. I was inexperienced and so our tech was not smooth. And we lost an actor late in the process. But I only found out that the play was supposed to be in trouble after I had read somewhere that it was supposedly in trouble.
Matthew, what do you think Kenny is getting at in the play with Mark's fixation on the unknowable?
BRODERICK One of the arguments is whether there's a God who has a plan, or is everything random? And why are we here? Is it possible to be here for no reason at all? And isn't it better to admit that we absolutely have no idea about it even though that's frightening?
Where do you come down on that argument?
BRODERICK I guess I'm more a science person. I don't gravitate to a literal interpretation of the Bible certainly. My sister is an Episcopal minister, and she's always saying: "You don't get it. It's faith, which you don't have." Do you want me to call her and get this worked out?
Kenny, t he Broadway revival of your play "The Waverly Gallery" recently earned two Tony nominations. Is "The Starry Messenger" headed there as well?
LONERGAN I don't think we're up to that yet. But if it's in the cards, that would be wonderful.

Sanders, No Longer the Front-Runner, Is Greeted Like One in Vermont Visit

Texto completo: MONTPELIER, Vt. -- Senator Bernie Sanders returned to his home state on Saturday for the first time since he declared in February that he was running for president again, displaying the uncompromisingly liberal defiance that many of those in the audience have been hearing for decades.
Under overcast skies, Mr. Sanders lamented big corporations, argued for "Medicare for all" and assailed fossil fuels. He also took the opportunity to emphasize his foreign policy agenda -- including his opposition to the war in Iraq and to American support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen -- while lacing his remarks with criticism for the news media even as he criticized President Trump for calling journalists "the enemy of the people."
"Recently, I have been attacked in the media because of my views, actions and votes on foreign policy issues," he said. "I make no apologies," he repeated several times.
In recent days, news outlets including The New York Times and The Washington Post have published reports about Mr. Sanders's foreign policy record in the 1980s when he was the mayor of Burlington, Vt., which included trips to Nicaragua in support of the Sandinista government, as well as to the Soviet Union.
But though people on stage before him listed his accomplishments in Vermont, he did not, preferring instead to stick largely to his typical rally script.
If his stop in Vermont's tiny capital was to be a homecoming, it also served as something of a reset for his campaign. For months, Mr. Sanders had enjoyed the status of front-runner, holding big rallies to demonstrate his strength and barely deviating from his anti-establishment message even as advisers urged him to talk more about himself.
But with the entrance last month of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. into the crowded 2020 Democratic field, Mr. Sanders is running second -- by double digits -- in most national polls. A recent survey from Morning Consult showed that the advantage for Mr. Sanders among 18- to 29-year-old voters -- his strongest voting bloc -- had slipped.
Though campaign aides are content, for now, for Mr. Sanders to sit in second place, there have also been signs of a battle to come. In the weeks since Mr. Biden entered the race, Mr. Sanders has lodged a series of broadsides against the former vice president, attacking him for his history of supporting free trade measures and for voting for the war in Iraq. Not to be outdone by Mr. Biden's retail politicking, Mr. Sanders plans to hold a series of ice cream socials in New Hampshire on Monday before making a return trip to Nevada.
He is also starting to host in-person grass-roots fund-raisers, which his campaign said would allow the senator to show appreciation for, and interact with, donors in smaller venues. Ticket prices will be tiered, according to his campaign, with the first level starting at $ 27, and the events will be open to the news media. (Though his 2016 campaign was known for its online fund-raising prowess, it held meet-and-greet fund-raisers as well.)
Mr. Sanders's appearance, before enthusiastic supporters who packed the vast lawn in front of the State House, was marked by an enduring pride in Vermont. Though he hit many of his usual themes, he also checked off the state's notable moments throughout history: participating in the underground railroad, outlawing slavery, legalizing same-sex marriage.
"Maybe we run in 2020 on a message that says, 'Cherry Garcia in every freezer,"' he said, in a nod to Ben & Jerry's ice cream, founded in Vermont, which was supplied free at the rally.
(A campaign aide said Mr. Sanders was appearing this weekend in Montpelier, not Burlington, because "it is a beautiful venue that speaks to his commitment to the state." Burlington, as it happens, is also hosting a marathon this weekend.)
There is some debate over how effective Mr. Sanders has been as a Vermont official. As Burlington's mayor, he at times faced criticism for focusing too much on foreign policy. But he also successfully turned the shores of Lake Champlain, much of which had been industrial wasteland, into a bustling, accessible waterfront -- an accomplishment his campaign highlighted in a video about his mayoralty that it released on Friday.
Among Vermonters, Mr. Sanders still engenders a strong sense of loyalty, and his presence in the state Saturday was, for many, a welcome sight.
"I believe it's the last time that we'll be able to touch him like we usually do without him belonging to the country," said Brenda Lee LeClair, 55, of Richmond. "We have to be unselfish and give him up."
Leigh Seddon, 68, of Montpelier, said he had worked with Mr. Sanders in the past and had "been a Bernie fan for a long time."
But he could not resist needling the senator's grander ambitions just a bit.
"He doesn't get a lot of time for Vermont anymore -- that's O.K.," he shrugged. "He cares about Vermont, but he has bigger things on his mind."

Texto completo: The editors and designers at The New York Times for Kids love coming together every month to brainstorm each issue -- and the more ideas the better. So it's your turn to throw ideas into the ring. Below you'll find three questions for stories we're going to run in the future. Email your ideas to us at kids@nytimes.com. You can contribute for all three or just one, so long as you get in touch! 1. What emoji do you wish you had that doesn't exist? We all have our favorite emoji. Maybe it's the face crying with laughter, because you're always letting your friends know how funny they are. Or perhaps it's the pizza that you're constantly texting to your mom when she asks what you want for dinner. Or just maybe the smiling poop is the one that feels most expressive of your life. But do you ever find yourself scrolling through all 3,019 emoji, on the hunt for the one that will best fit your message, and you just can't find what you're looking for? Tell us about it: If you could make that emoji, what would it be? 2. What's one news story you wish you understood better? There's so much happening around the world, and we can only cover so much of it in these pages. But what's an event or a movement or a person that you wish we would pay more attention to? Do you want to know more about the trade war with China? Or the fight among cities, taxis and ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft? Or how kids in Venezuela are dealing with the political upheaval in their country? Fillus in on what matters to you. 3. What object or process captivates you?

Texto completo: Dog-and-pony show The Daily Herald’s May 9 headline "Trump formally blocks report" is quite misleading. According to the New York Times, what was blocked (redacted) from Mueller’s report is: 69% dealing with ongoing investigations, 18% grand jury testimony that cannot legally be released, 8% classified material and 5% that would infringe on personal privacy rights.
The Justice Department offered 12 congressional leaders — party leaders and the heads of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees — and a staff member each the ability to view a version of the Mueller report that only contained redactions of grand jury material, which the Justice Department has argued it is prohibited by law from sharing without a court order.
While no Democrat has taken the opportunity, six Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham have taken up the offer, along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Doug Collins, Need more proof that Nadler is running a dog-and-pony show?

Nike Plans to Stop Penalizing Pregnancy

Texto completo: Responding to criticism about its treatment of its sponsored athletes who become pregnant, the sportswear giant Nike committed on Friday to ensuring that such athletes are not financially penalized.
Nike said it would waive performance-pay reductions for 12 months for athletes "who decide to have a baby," promising to add terms that reinforce this policy into the company's contracts with sponsored athletes.
In articles and videos for The New York Times opinion department over the past two weeks, current and former Nike-sponsored runners such as Alysia Montaño, Kara Goucher, Phoebe Wright and Allyson Felix recalled tough decisions they had to make when considering whether to have children and described financial penalties that Nike athletes faced if they became pregnant. (The Times maintains a strict separation between news coverage and opinion pieces.)
"We've recognized Nike, Inc., can do more, and there is an important opportunity for the sports industry collectively to evolve to better support female athletes," Sandra Carreon-John, a Nike spokeswoman, said in a statement by email on Friday.
Most endorsement contracts for runners -- which account for the majority of their income -- have specific performance thresholds for compensation. If they are not met, for any reason, sponsors may reduce an athlete's pay. There typically are not exceptions for maternity leave.
In one Times video, Montaño, a middle-distance runner who famously ran in the 2014 U.S.A. Track and Field championships while eight months pregnant, contrasted Nike's marketing strategy with its treatment of pregnant athletes.
"If we want to be an athlete and a mother, well that's just crazy," Montaño said in the video, referring to Nike's "Dream Crazier" commercial, which emphasizes female empowerment and uses a voice-over from the tennis star Serena Williams, who had her first child in September 2017. "Believe in something," Montaño says in The Times video. "Even if it means sacrificing everything, like maybe your contract, your pay."
Felix, a sprinter who has won six Olympic gold medals and is one of Nike's most visible female athletes, wrote that the company had declined to contractually guarantee that she would not be penalized if her performance dipped for a while after she became pregnant.
"If I, one of Nike's most widely marketed athletes, couldn't secure these protections, who could?" she wrote.
Felix gave birth to her first child, a daughter, last fall, and she said she felt pressure to return to track quickly even though she had needed a cesarean section because of life-threatening pre-eclampsia.
In a memo addressed to all Nike employees on Friday, Amy Montagne, a company vice president and its general manager for global properties, referred to Montaño and Felix and wrote that she was "saddened" to hear of Felix's experience with the company.
Bloomberg first reported Montagne's memo.
Montagne wrote that Nike realized last year that performance obligations had a disproportionate effect on female athletes who became pregnant and that the company began creating an official maternity policy. But, she wrote, the company had not informed its sponsored athletes of that effort.
"This has been a humbling event," Montagne wrote of the criticism, adding that the company had already begun reaching out to its sponsored female athletes to let them know of the policy changes.
The changes have come a year after The Times, based on interviews with more than 50 current and former Nike employees, reported women's complaints of being harassed, marginalized and thwarted in their careers at the company. At least 11 Nike executives, including the second most powerful man at the company, were ousted amid complaints of inappropriate behavior and the resulting investigation.

Cartas “no match” del gobierno Trump hacen que cientos de inmigrantes dejen su empleo

Texto completo: El gobierno de Donald Trump reactivó una práctica de 2012 en la que avisa a los empleadores de inmigrates cuando sus nombres y los números de seguro social no coinciden
Por esta razón cientos de trabajadores de todo el país se están viendo obligados a dejar su empleo después de que sus patrones recibieran las llamadas cartas “no match” y no pudieran demostrar su presencia legal en Estados Unidos.
El “bombardeo” de misivas o “cartas de no coincidencia”, que advierten sobre discrepancias entre los registros de la Administración de la Seguridad Social, el nombre de la persona y los números de seguro social que figuran en el Formulario W-2 de un empleado, ha provocado preocupación entre los empresarios.
Por temor a recibir sanciones federales, los empleadores han optado por hacer una “limpieza” de sus plantillas laborales.
“Estas acciones colocan a los empleadores en una situación alarmante, debido a que dependen de la mano de obra de miles de inmigrantes para que sus negocios continúen funcionando en una época de ‘high employment’ (alto empleo”) , dijo a Efe la activista y analista en inmigración Carmen Cornejo.
El dueño de una mueblería en Phoenix, Arizona, quien solicitó el anonimato, recibió dichas cartas recientemente, y ante el temor de ser penalizado por el Gobierno, buscó asesoría legal.
Su objetivo, dijo, era proceder con el despido de sus empleados indocumentados de forma digna y apegándose lo más posible a la legislación.
“Nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, nada más quería saber cuáles era mis responsabilidades; no los puedes correr abruptamente, primero tienes que darles la oportunidad de comprobar que están trabajando legalmente”, dijo el empresario a Efe.
En carne propia lo vivió Sofía Andrade, quien trabajaba en una compañía que elabora ensaladas. Andrade narró que su patrón dijo de repente a un grupo que tenían cuatro días para la comprobación de su legalidad en el trabajo y poder conservar el empleo.
“Nos avisaron en una reunión de que tenían un reporte de Inmigración y nos dijo el patrón que le pidieron la lista y el nombre de todos los trabajadores y su seguro social” , explica a Efe Andrade.
“Cerca de 40 personas tuvimos que dejar nuestros trabajos”, comentó la inmigrante, que llevaba seis meses en la compañía.
Ahora, agregó, tiene que trabajar en una fábrica de carpintera con un pago de 11 dólares la hora, bajo condiciones “muy duras” y que considera fuera de la ley.
“El trabajo es muy pesado, el jefe abusa porque a veces trabajamos jornadas de 13 horas al día y no nos las paga (…) completamente, pero me tengo que aguantar, porque no tengo papeles”, indicó Andrade.
Durante el corriente año, la administración Trump, a través de la SSA, ha estado enviando más de 570,000 “cartas de no coincidencia” a empresas en todo el país, de acuerdo con datos del New York Times.
Cornejo señaló que se ha notado el incremento en estas prácticas gubernamentales, ya que frecuentemente recibe llamadas de trabajadores que piden asesoría por los despidos, que consideran “injustificados”.
“No saben exactamente lo que está pasando. Para ellos su prioridad es cumplir con el trabajo, pero tristemente no están cumpliendo con las leyes al ser indocumentados, explicó la activista.
Cornejo mencionó que estas cartas están causando ansiedad a las empresas, principalmente a las de hostelería, agricultura y la construcción, sectores que se han visto más afectados por estas medidas impulsadas por el Gobierno.
“La verdad es que nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, aunque sean buenos empleados tienen que corroborar su información y al final la mayoría se va por voluntad propia”, sostuvo.
Cornejo detalló además que las razones de las discrepancias de dichas cartas pueden ser por cambios en los nombres conyugales y errores tipográficos en los formularios, pero que actualmente se están utilizando para escudriñar el estatus migratorio del trabajador.
La SSA suspendió el envío de estas cartas a las compañías en 2012, pero la Casa Blanca reanudó esta práctica en marzo pasado.
Los críticos dicen que la reactivación de las cartas es parte de la línea más dura de la actual Administración republicana y de sus políticas de inmigración.
“Esto es totalmente planificado, las acciones por parte del Gobierno, son deliberadas y van en aumento. No solo están haciendo su trabajo habitual, sino que el Gobierno está exigiendo un incremento en el número de casos”, matizó Cornejo.

Living in California is a 'moral choice'

Texto completo: The apparent ease of California life, Joan Didion wrote in "The White Album," is an illusion, and those who believe the illusion real live here in only the most temporary way. Didion was speaking at the time about the water crises of the late 1970s, specifically, but the truth is that the people of California have always been of pretty hearty stock. You live in a place where the very ground you stand on is, at best, temporary and you recognize that choosing to live here means choosing to live in flux, always a bag at the ready, in case you need to flee. We don't expect empathy from the lattice-work of fault lines, reason from the wild fires, decency from the sun. But we do from the people of the state and, increasingly, that means that living in California is a moral choice.
You have to want California. Now, you may need it, too. Because we'll be the place that defends your liberty, even if you don't live here. We'll be the state that sues for your rights. We'll be the state that fights for your clean air. It may be too expensive to live here; it may be too ethically taxing to live anywhere else.
When Alabama outlawed abortion last week, it was no surprise in a functional sense. Red states have been cutting into women's rights at a shocking pace since 2016, abetted as they are by a White House whose brand is cruelty. Alabama's Constitutional overreach was meant to illicit lawsuits, meant to force Supreme Court action, meant to dehumanize and scare women, to let them know that the government can and will demand control of their bodies. Before that, it was Georgia. After that, it will be Missouri. And then ... and then ... and then, the center indeed not holding, nor the south.
The obvious goal is to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but the long view is the systematic removal of human rights (not merely civil) for the most vulnerable segments of our society. We've already seen it with immigrants. We've seen it with the LGBTQ community. We've seen it in the shocking rise of white supremacy in national governance. We've seen it in the flouting of the rules of law from the highest office.
The "free-love" ethos of California may have been well-earned in the 1960s, but five decades on, the result is a state that values personal autonomy but also views our representatives as having the capacity to make life better, to embrace modernity, to fight for equality Thus, the stereotype of going west to find your dreams exists because life here isn't about tolerance as much as it is about acceptance. The distance between the two is more than semantic, it is the very fabric of empathy.
I'm not so naïve as to believe everyone in the state shares my values.But as the country tilts and shivers with the whims of conservative lawmakers, every day a new intentional horror placed upon human beings in the name of greed and public policy, I can't help but think of California as a firewall of basic decency, the last retardant before the flames reach the sea.

Texto completo: Mary-Louise Parker will return to Broadway this fall to star in "The Sound Inside," a two-character play about a professor with a difficult diagnosis and a creative writing student with a lot to say.
The play, by Adam Rapp, was first staged last summer by the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. Jesse Green, the co-chief theater critic for The New York Times, called the 90-minute, two-character drama "astonishing" and praised Ms. Parker for "a sensationally controlled performance."
Ms. Parker, in an interview, called the show "probably the most daunting thing I've ever done," and said she looked forward to continuing to develop her character through further rehearsals and performances. "I like that she's an academic, and more of an intellectual, because I haven't often gotten to enlist that part of myself," she said.
[Read the review of the Williamstown production of 'The Sound Inside' here.]
The Broadway production, like that at Williamstown, will be directed by David Cromer, who won a Tony Award last year for his direction of "The Band's Visit," and will feature Will Hochman, making his Broadway debut, as the student.
Ms. Parker has appeared in seven previous Broadway plays, most recently starring in "Heisenberg" in 2016. She won a Tony Award in 2001 for "Proof," and was also nominated in 1990 for "Prelude to a Kiss" and in 2005 for "Reckless."
Previews are to begin Sept. 14 and the play is scheduled to open Oct. 17 at Studio 54. The producers are Jeffrey Richards, Lincoln Center Theater (which commissioned the play) and Rebecca Gold.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Over the years, the hunt for the remains of the last ship known to have brought enslaved people into the United States has been fraught with a mix of tumult and hope.
There was a discovery last year of wreckage that, after much excitement and international headlines, was determined a false alarm. Hopes were raised, then dashed, then raised again -- not only among marine archaeologists, but also among the descendants of the ship's human cargo, many of whom make their homes in a tiny South Alabama community called Africatown.
Then, on Wednesday, came an announcement from the Alabama Historical Commission: Another shipwreck, one of many marooned under a muddy stretch of the Mobile River, was almost certainly the Clotilda, a wooden vessel of horrors that carried 110 Africans to the United States in 1860, more than a half-century after the importation of slaves was declared illegal.
The find, historians said, revives a story of unspeakable cruelty, but also the story of a people who somehow survived this indignity and many others like it.
The last voyage of the Clotilda, from Benin, Africa, to Mobile Bay, Ala., "represented one of the darkest eras of modern history," Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, the commission's executive director, said in a statement.
"This new discovery brings the tragedy of slavery into focus while witnessing the triumph and resilience of the human spirit in overcoming the horrific crime that led to the establishment of Africatown," she continued.
The discovery was aided by input from the Smithsonian Institution, the National Park Service, the National Geographic Society and the Slave Wrecks Project, a multinational group researching the slave trade, and comes at a moment when civil rights museums have opened across the South. African-American history is also finding powerful new expression in the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in Washington in 2016.
But the news is likely to resonate most forcefully in Africatown, a working-class community of about 2,000 people north of downtown Mobile. It was founded by people who had been transported to Alabama in the Clotilda's hull, and it was a place where African languages were spoken for decades.
More recently, the area was hit hard by paper mill closings, but there is a plan to build a welcome center and a museum, largely funded by money from a settlement with the oil giant BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.
Although it was not clear whether any of the wreckage could be restored, Councilman Levon Manzie, who represents the area, said he hoped that the ship, or parts of it, would be prominently displayed in Africatown.
"We are incredibly proud as a people and as a community that this link to our history has finally been discovered, and uncovered, and hopefully will be fully appreciated," Mr. Manzie said Wednesday evening. His dream, he said, was "to restore it to the degree that's possible and to truly tell this unique American story, this unique Mobile story, in a grand fashion."
After the Clotilda's arrival in the United States, its captain, William Foster, burned the ship in an effort to conceal evidence of the illegal smuggling trip. The Africans aboard were distributed to slave owners, according to the Alabama Historical Commission.
After the Civil War, some of the ship's survivors gathered in hopes of returning to Africa, but they were unable to do so. Instead, they founded Africatown.
Stories of the ship and its survivors were passed down from generation to generation, although doubts also lingered given the lack of physical proof.
That changed -- or so it seemed -- in January 2018, when Ben Raines, a writer and documentarian who was then a reporter for AL.com, published an article in which he said he had found the remains of a ship that appeared to be the Clotilda.
But that March, experts determined that the ship he had found was too big to be the Clotilda. The stories that followed were not so kind. "I was devastated," said Mr. Raines, the son of Howell Raines, a former executive editor of The New York Times. "I was sort of this journalistic laughingstock."
The younger Mr. Raines persisted, sure that he was on to something. He said he convinced researchers at the University of Southern Mississippi to bring a crew to the area to survey for more shipwrecks. They found many. One initially seemed like a big log pile.
Then Mr. Raines discovered a piece of lumber with square nails in it -- a telltale sign, he said, of 19th-century construction.
"Guys, we just found a ship from the 1850s," he recalled saying at the time.
The experts returned, led by James Delgado, an authority in maritime archaeology. A painstaking act of detective work followed, involving hunts for archived documents, more dives, X-ray fluorescence tests and comparisons of building materials, dimensions and stories.
"There is nothing definitive in terms of a name on a piece of wood or a bell, so what we had to rely on is a series of pieces of evidence that together would lead you to a conclusion," Dr. Delgado said Wednesday.
The pieces started to fall into place. Insurance records said the ship had white oak framing and planking of northern yellow pine. Those materials were found underwater.
The ship was listed as 86 feet long by 23 feet wide, with a 6-foot-11-inch depth of hold. Those, too, matched the dimensions of the wreck.
Among other things, the researchers found "deformed, carbonized rounded pieces of wood that come from an intense fire," Dr. Delgado said. "We brought in a forensic fire investigator. It was consistent with a fire that had burned for a while."
Many other leads checked out. And though confirmation with complete certainty is impossible, Dr. Delgado said he believes they have come close. His team wrote a report and sent it to six scientists for a peer review.
"All of them, to a one," he said, "concluded that this was likely Clotilda."
Now the focus will turn to protecting the ship, and deciding whether it can somehow be displayed. More archaeological work is also likely, potentially revealing additional elements of the long-submerged story.
For the moment, Mr. Raines said, he is feeling a good dose of vindication, and joy for Africatown.
"This," he said, "tells America their story."

Here to Help; One Thing You Can Do to Counteract Climate Change: Drive Greener

Transportation creates more greenhouse emissions than any other sector of the United States economy. That's in part because the number of cars on the roads keeps increasing.
But experts say that if all American drivers were to follow a few simple rules, those emissions would come down sharply.
"Good driving behavior can help increase the efficiency of your vehicle by between 20 and 30 percent," said Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "That's a big range, and it really puts a lot of the onus on reducing fuel emissions on the driver."
Changing your vehicle's oil regularly, inflating the tires to the recommended pressure and unloading heavy stuff from the trunk will help you optimize your car's fuel efficiency even before you get behind the wheel.
Once you hit the road, make it a smooth ride. According to the Department of Energy, aggressive driving -- things like speeding, rapid acceleration and abrupt braking -- can lower your gas mileage by up to 40 percent in stop-and-go traffic.
On the highway, the most fuel-efficient speed is usually in the range of 55 to 60 miles per hour (about 90 to 95 kilometers per hour), in part because aerodynamic drag increases significantly at higher speeds, turning cars into gas guzzlers.
Many modern vehicles have start-stop technology that turns off the engine when the car isn't moving. If you have an older car, shutting down the engine when you're not in traffic -- say, in parking lots -- is probably the best way to reduce emissions.
The Energy Department estimates that eliminating idling of personal vehicles would be the same as taking five million vehicles off the roads. That's equivalent to every car in Sweden.
To cool down on hot days, consider lowering your windows. That probably has a lower carbon footprint than using the air-conditioner when driving at low speeds. The picture is less clear at higher speeds because of drag, especially if you drive a modern car with efficient AC.
If you follow these tips, you won't need to fill up as often. But when that time comes, bear in mind that not all engines are created equal and the one in your car is optimized for a particular type of fuel. You should use it. If the manufacturer recommends regular gasoline, for example, using mid-grade or premium would be less efficient.
Finally, consider walking, biking or taking the bus when feasible. That won't always be an option. But, sometimes, it might be. Roughly 20 percent of all vehicle trips in the United States are under a mile.
"When you get into the car, the first question that you need to ask yourself is: Do I really need to drive there," Mr. Cooke said. "If everyone was to cut just 10 percent of the car trips they take, that would lead to a pretty significant reduction in emissions."

Sizing Up the Democrats on Climate
By Lisa Friedman
Democratic presidential candidates are starting to detail their climate change policies, and they all say we should treat global warming as an urgent threat.
But who is the "best" on climate change? That's subjective, of course, but a few scorecards have emerged to help primary voters who care about the issue weigh their choices.
The environmental group 350 Action has the 2020 Climate Test, which takes into consideration where candidates stand on fossil fuel development, accepting money from energy companies, and the Green New Deal. The League of Conservation Voters evaluates candidates on whether they adhere to seven policy positions, like 100 percent clean energy by 2050.
Also, Climate Advisers, a private consulting group, has come up with a ranking system based on weighted scoring in four areas: a candidate's past climate and environment policies; his or her current proposals; the extent to which the candidate uses social media to raise the issue of climate change; and willingness to refuse fossil fuel campaign money.
Those categories are then each broken down to weigh things like whether the candidate has clearly articulated that climate change would form a central part of his or her presidency, or made a compelling case for a carbon-neutral future.
Topping the list is Governor Jay Inslee of Washington, who has made climate change his central campaign issue. At the bottom: John Hickenlooper, a former governor of Colorado, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.
Nigel Purvis, the chief executive of Climate Advisers, attributed Mr. Biden's low ranking to the fact that he has not issued a climate policy and rarely uses public engagements or his substantial Twitter following to highlight the issue, but he said the system was designed to be updated as candidates' policies evolve. Mr. Biden has said he'll make his climate plan public soon.

Trump’s pardons an insult to millions of service members

Autor: THE WASHINGTON POST.

Texto completo: As Memorial Day approaches, President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the Justice Department to ready paperwork to pardon several U.S. service members accused or convicted of war crimes, including murder, attempted murder and desecration of a corpse.
Each case is distinct, but taken together, such pardons would send a message of disrespect for the laws of war and for the larger values that the United States’ fallen service members have so nobly defended.
War is hell, but there are rules, and the Defense Department maintains a 1,193-page Law of War Manual. The purposes are worth recalling: to protect combatants, noncombatants and civilians from “unnecessary suffering”; provide some basic protections to those who fall into hands of the enemy; facilitate restoration of peace; help commanders ensure the disciplined and efficient use of military forces; and preserve the “professionalism and humanity of combatants.”
Trump, in pursuit of some hazy notion of military toughness, shows little respect for these principles. On the campaign trail in 2016, he declared that “torture works” and that he would resume the use of waterboarding in interrogations. In 2015, he declared that the families of terrorists should be killed.
This month, Trump signed a full pardon for former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna of Oklahoma, who had served in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division and was convicted of unpremeditated murder. Military intelligence professionals had interrogated a man on suspicion that he was a member of al-Qaida with knowledge of a roadside bombing in which two U.S. soldiers were killed. They ordered Behenna to drive the suspect home. He took the detainee to a railroad culvert, stripped him naked, interrogated him at gunpoint and then shot him in the head and chest, saying it was self-defense.
Among those Trump is now considering for clemency, The New York Times reports, is Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher of the Navy SEALs, who is scheduled to stand trial soon on charges of shooting unarmed civilians in Iraq and killing an enemy captive with a knife.
Others, according to The Times, are believed to include a former Blackwater security contractor, Nicholas Slatten, found guilty in the 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis; Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, an Army Green Beret charged with killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; and a group of Marine Corps snipers charged with urinating on dead Taliban fighters.
Pardons in these cases would undermine discipline in the ranks, impede cooperation with citizens and fighters of other nations and insult millions of service members who have behaved honorably. They would undermine the standing of the United States as a power that believes in - and follows - the rule of law. They would not project strength but rather show weakness, corroding the “professionalism and humanity” of the armed forces.

'Game of Thrones' revealed as conservative epic

Texto completo: I loved "Game of Thrones" when it was a left-leaning political fantasy, as creator George R.R. Martin admitted when he told The New York Times -- while feeding the appetites of the beltway media collective -- that the mad boy king Joffrey was indeed the mad king Donald Trump.
I loved GoT when it was the most popular program in the blue liberal states and less so in conservative red states. The inner, hidden nerd in me (perhaps the nerd is no longer hidden) loved it even as HBO prudently herded its cash cow away from a sexist mashup of female breasts and dragons and political revenge in tights into something else again:
A epic feminist saga with strong, proud and ethical women (OK, forget Cersei) dealing with the world not as they wished it would be but as it was. And most of the men were either too narcissistically evil, stupid, venal or cowardly to do much good.
Oh, men!
But now our watch has ended.
And it's obvious that as it ended, "Game of Thrones" was not the fantasy of the socialist left that it started out as, but a reaffirmation of conservative/libertarian beliefs.
It rejected the left's cult of personality and worship of central authority that would decide what was best for us whether we liked it or not.
And it transformed itself into a show that William F. Buckley would have loved.
It revered a strong family. It celebrated the individual, going off the grid to explore the unknown. And it displayed excellent taste in costumes and an appreciation of the Scots/Irish folk ballad.
But the main thing is that GoT got rid of its mad queen -- or was that Bernie Sanders in a blond wig on the dragon? -- who was eager to burn us all to cinders for our own good and bring the survivors to her utopia.
One monarch to sit on that Iron Throne, one queen to rule them all. And what if the people had different ideas?
"They don't get to choose," says Daenerys Targaryen, sweetly, as if she were Debbie Wasserman Schultz conspiring with Hillary Clinton on how to rig a presidential nomination.
Yet I hated the ending as much as the next guy.
There were many holes in the show, from that mysterious water bottle on the ground in the Game of Thrones at Yalta conference, to the exiling of Jon Snow to the warrior monks of the Night's Watch -- with the zombies all gone, there was no longer any need of a Night's Watch.
Arya Stark, the vengeful daughter I never had, who could kill her family's enemies without a blink of an eye, went off to explore unknown waters and unknown lands. She had no real experience at sea. But she pointed her ship to the West, and that she wanted to visit the West was enough for me.
And it reinforced the human desire for liberty, particularly if the alternative is utopia at the point of a gun (or a fire-breathing dragon,) which was the way of Lenin, Stalin, Castro, Maduro and others.
All communist utopias have ended badly, with untold misery and the deaths of some 100 million people in this, our real world -- not to mention the zoo animals eaten when the food is gone.
I acknowledge I'm of the minority opinion and the Twittersphere, which leans even more leftward than mainstream media, will reject my theory that GoT was at its heart, a conservative saga. And, many Republicans have hated the show because they fear dynamic women riding dragons.
I gladly bear this cross.
When "Game of Thrones" ended this week, tens of millions of fans went stark raving mad, just as I'd predicted. And unscrupulous psych counselors were already selling their soothing bromides online to those, who, as in the 2016 election, couldn't or wouldn't accept reality.
I joined them, also refusing to accept reality. And I publicly hated on the show on "The Chicago Way" podcast, like some spoiled child.
Later, though, I sat quietly in a big comfy leather chair, lit a fine Maduro cigar and questioned my beliefs while pondering the amazing politics of this cultural phenomenon called "Game of Thrones."
It was a great show.
But thousands of cultish GoT podcasters and bloggers and writers were in a frenzy. The high priests of the church of GoT -- with their internecine feuds and conspiracies and jealousies, like high priests in any age --couldn't stand the magic ending and the loss of their power.
So they stoked the rage and anxiety of the fans for computer clicks and ratings. And many of their followers turned on the show that they had followed religiously for almost a decade, seething with rage, insisting that the "Game of Thrones" ending wasn't one they had envisioned.
They might as well have been chanting, "Not my Game of Thrones! Not my Game of Thrones!"
But Tyrion the dwarf, brilliantly played with a passable British accent by the great American actor Peter Dinklage, said it best.
"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing more powerful in the world than a good story," Tyrion said. "Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it."
Except, perhaps, network executives and producers.

Texto completo: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday ordered a review of the security of the state's elections systems.
He said he was acting in response to confirmation from the FBI that hackers managed to gain access to two Florida counties' election systems during the 2016 election. The governor and other elected officials briefed by the FBI have said no election results were compromised and it appeared as if the intruders didn't meddle with voter registration records.
DeSantis directed Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee to initiate a review of elections systems security and cybersecurity throughout the state. In light of recent information that two Florida counties experienced breaches into their elections networks in 2016, the governor wants to ensure Florida's election infrastructure at the state and local level is protected.
"Public faith in our elections is the bedrock of our democracy and we must do everything within our power to preserve the integrity of our elections systems," DeSantis said in a written statement distributed by his office. "While the breaches did not compromise the outcome of the 2016 election, nonetheless, they highlight the importance of protecting the security of our elections system."
DeSantis said he was ordering Lee to "immediately" initiate a review of the overall security, and specifically the cybersecurity, of Florida election systems.
"The Department shall develop a plan to identify and address any vulnerabilities. You are further directed to make this a top priority," DeSantis told Lee in a letter ordering the review. He didn't set a deadline.
DeSantis' posture stands in contrast with President Donald Trump, a close ally of the governor.
The New York Times reported last month that former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had tried to get the White House interested in preparing for Russian attempts to interfere in the 2020 election but was told by Trump's chief of staff not to bring the subject up in front of the president.
The Times reported that the chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, "made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory" and that the topic should be "kept below his level."
The issue has generated intense interest in Florida since last month's release of a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller reported the tantalizing detail that the FBI found Russian efforts to infiltrate Florida election offices' computer systems were successful enough that intruders were able to "gain access to the network of at least one Florida county government."
On May 14, DeSantis announced that he'd had a classified FBI briefing at which he was told two county election systems were compromised. The FBI told him and the state's congressional delegation during a classified May 16 briefing that the names of the counties couldn't be disclosed. All said the FBI should declassify the information. Broward and Palm Beach weren't among the hacked counties.
Like DeSantis, the members of Congress were told the intruders gained limited access to the systems, that election results weren't tampered with, but any activities involving voter registration records wasn't as clear.
"They have no evidence that the voter database was tampered with, but their level of confidence was unclear," U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-St. Augustine, said last week.
U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Miami-Dade/Monroe County Democrat, said, "We couldn't get with certainty the verification that the Russians actually were not able to manipulate the data that they had access to. [The FBI] found no evidence of that, but they could not say with certainty that [the Russians] did not manipulate that data."
Mucarsel-Powell said the FBI's description of the intrusion suggested "they were able to enter the garage, not able to enter the house."
The intrusions involved "spearphishing" emails from Russian intelligence to more than 120 Florida election office email accounts. That allowed the intrusion into the two counties.
The state has a history of exceedingly close elections - in 2016, Trump won the state with 49% of the vote, 1.2 percentage points ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton - so anything that could interfere with the way they are run could undermine confidence in the results.
Florida distributed more than $14.5 million in federal election security money to county supervisors of elections last year. The state also provided elections supervisors with $1.9 million in state funding to purchase and install Albert network monitoring sensors which provide round-the-clock monitoring of government technology networks to identify potential threats.
All but one county is covered with Albert sensors. The lone holdout, Palm Beach County, is expected to have the monitoring system in place by the end of June, Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link said last week.

Rogue emissions of a gas that harms the ozone layer are coming from eastern China, primarily from two heavily industrialized provinces, an international team of researchers said Wednesday.
The findings confirm what many scientists, environmental groups and policymakers had suspected after an initial study a year ago reported new global emissions of the gas, CFC-11, but could only locate the source generally as East Asia.
The new research will add to international pressure on the Chinese government to curtail the illegal use of CFC-11. It also confirms the results of several investigations, including one by The New York Times, which found evidence that factories in Shandong, one of the provinces specified in the study, were still making or using the gas to manufacture foam insulation.
CFC-11 is one of a class of compounds called chlorofluorocarbons that destroy atmospheric ozone. They are also potent greenhouse gases that contribute to atmospheric warming.
Chlorofluorocarbons were outlawed for almost all uses by the Montreal Protocol, an international pact negotiated decades ago to preserve the layer of ozone that blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Excessive amounts of some types of UV radiation can cause skin cancer and eye damage in people and are harmful to crops and other vegetation.
After the initial study last year, China denied that there were serious violations of the ban on the chemical, but also promised to eradicate any illegal production and use.
The Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment said Wednesday that it was preparing answers to questions about the new findings that The Times sent last week.
In a statement, Joyce Msuya, acting executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, which administers the Montreal Protocol, said that action on CFC-11 "is being taken by all parties at the international level and by China domestically."
"All parties appreciate the urgency to ensure the ongoing protection of the ozone layer," she added.
The declines in chlorofluorocarbon emissions under the Montreal Protocol were expected to lead to a full recovery of the ozone layer by the middle of the century. The new emissions could delay that recovery by a decade or more, scientists say.
The new study, which was published in the journal Nature, used data from monitoring sites in South Korea and Japan that analyze air samples taken every few hours. The data was fed into computer simulations that model how the atmosphere disperses pollutants.
Four independent models were used, said Sunyoung Park, a researcher at Kyungpook National University in Daegu, South Korea, and a lead author of the paper.
"All the results are consistent," she said. "It's very convincing." In addition to Shandong, the study cited Hebei Province as a primary source of the emissions.
Matt Rigby, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Bristol in Britain and another lead author, said the work benefited from using data from sites relatively close to China. Both monitoring stations are on islands that are only several hundred miles from the Chinese coast. In the 2018 study, the closest data was collected in Hawaii, 5,000 miles away.
"The atmosphere is very dispersive, it likes to mix things around quite rapidly," Dr. Rigby said. "As you get farther away, the picture gets more blurry."
After the initial findings last year, some experts had suggested some of the CFC-11 could be originating from North Korea. But the new work effectively rules that out, Dr. Rigby said. "We couldn't find a statistically significant rise in emissions," he said.
But the study does not account for the origins of all of the new emissions of CFC-11, which it estimated were between 11,000 and 17,000 metric tons a year. Some may be coming from locations that are far from monitoring sites -- areas in South America or Africa, perhaps, or even other parts of China.
"Other places, other countries, could contribute," Dr. Park said. "But we don't have the data."
Although the Montreal Protocol called for phasing out CFC-11 production and use by 2010, some emissions continued as products that use it were destroyed and the chemical was released.
CFC-11 has a lifetime of about half a century, so the emissions, combined with breakdown of the chemical, should have caused its concentration in the atmosphere to decline more rapidly every year.
But beginning in 2013, scientists noticed that the rate of decline was slowing down -- an indication that newly produced CFC-11 was entering the atmosphere.
That prompted the initial study, led by Stephen A. Montzka, an atmospheric scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Dr. Montzka contributed to the new research as well.
The Chinese authorities held to their two-pronged position -- downplaying the problem while promising a clampdown -- after that paper was released in May and after the investigations by The Times and the Environment Investigation Agency, an independent group, found evidence that CFC-11 was being used widely in China to make foam.
In a clampdown started in the second half of 2018, officials checked 1,172 businesses and found only 10 whose materials contained CFC-11, Liu Youbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Environment and Ecology, said at a news conference in October.
More recently, Chinese environmental officials continued to suggest that illegal CFC-11 production was not widespread in China and would not be enough to explain the unexpected levels of the chemical in the atmosphere.
"The Chinese government has always taken a zero tolerance attitude toward illegal activity regarding ozone depleting substances," Guo Jing, the head of the international cooperation department of the Chinese Ministry of Environment and Ecology, said in March, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency.
Avipsa Mahapatra, leader of the climate campaign at the Environment Investigation Agency, said the Chinese government had taken the CFC-11 issue very seriously.
"They have engaged with us and with the international community in a very constructive manner to ensure that they are not just treating the symptoms by clamping down a few factories, but are trying to address the systemic challenge," she said.
"However, the magnitude of emissions from this region now scientifically shown in this paper show that much remains to be done."
The monitoring stations in Japan and South Korea are part of a network of about a dozen sites, called the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment. In all, about 50 gases are measured.
Ray Weiss, an emeritus professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and co-director of the network, said monitoring like this is increasingly important as nations try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help curb global warming.
"It doesn't matter what you say you emit," Dr. Weiss said. "It's what you actually emit."

Texto completo: President Trump is expected to appoint Ken Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner who is one of the president's strongest cheerleaders on cable news, to oversee administration efforts to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration, a White House official said Wednesday.
Cuccinelli, who enjoys a reputation as a right-wing firebrand, has no immigration experience and would take responsibility for a politically explosive issue that crosses multiple federal departments and is probably key to the president's 2020 reelection chances.
He is a controversial figure among Republicans, however. Cuccinelli led an intraparty revolt during the 2016 presidential race when he tried to strip Trump of delegates at the party's national convention, even throwing his ID badge on the floor to protest Trump's nomination.

He also has few friends in Congress after leading a far-right group that backed insurgent candidates against Republican incumbents. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed to block him from any post requiring Senate confirmation.
But Cuccinelli, 50, has offered staunch support for Trump on immigration and other priority issues. The two met Monday at the White House, and a formal announcement could come this week, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the president had not made the final decision.
Cuccinelli served four years as Virginia's attorney general and lost a 2013 run for governor to Democrat Terry McAuliffe.
Trump recently pushed out the leaders at the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for most immigration policy and enforcement, in a sign of frustration at their inability to stem a dramatic surge of Central American families to the southern border.
Cuccinelli probably would report to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, but give regular briefings to Trump. His expected appointment was first reported by the New York Times.
As a state lawmaker before he was elected attorney general in 2010, Cuccinelli sponsored bills to force employees to speak English in the workplace and tried to repeal birthright citizenship, foreshadowing Trump's support for that proposed policy.
For months, Trump has considered appointing an "immigration czar" to take the lead on issues central to his political identity and his reelection bid.

Officers urge Trump to not pardon war crime suspects

Texto completo: Current and former military officers have urged the White House not to pardon service members and security contractors implicated in war crimes, warning that forgiving their offenses would send a dangerous signal to U.S. troops and potential adversaries.
Aides to President Trump have been examining high-profile war crimes cases from Iraq and Afghanistan, preparing paperwork so Trump could issue pardons during Memorial Day commemorations next week, according to two senior U.S. officials.
But the possibility that Trump could issue pardons has brought a flood of opposition from current and former high-ranking officers, who say it would encourage misconduct by showing that violations of laws prohibiting attacks on civilians and prisoners of war will be treated with leniency.

"Absent evidence of innocence or injustice, the wholesale pardon of U.S. service members accused of war crimes signals our troops and allies that we don't take the law of armed conflict seriously," retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a tweet Tuesday. He added: "Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility. Risk to us."
Among those under consideration for a pardon is Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL awaiting court-martial on charges that he shot unarmed civilians and stabbed a teenage Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017, according to one official who discussed the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Gallagher has pleaded not guilty, and commentators on Fox News have lobbied Trump to pardon him.
Other cases being examined by the White House include those of Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who is charged with killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; three Marine snipers prosecuted for urinating on the corpse of an Afghan fighter in 2011; and a former security guard for Blackwater Worldwide who was convicted of murder in December for killing unarmed Iraqis in 2007.
Other officers warned that if U.S. personnel accused of such crimes escaped punishment, civilians on foreign battlefields would be less inclined to cooperate with U.S. forces, and U.S. service members taken prisoner would be more likely to be mistreated or even killed when taken captive.
"If President Trump issues indiscriminate pardons of individuals accused -- or convicted by their fellow service members -- of war crimes, he relinquishes the United States' moral high ground and undermines the good order and discipline critical to winning on the battlefield," said retired Gen. Charles Krulak, a former commandant of the Marine Corps.
Several officials said Trump is not believed to have consulted his senior military advisors about issuing pardons. The possibility of military pardons was first reported by the New York Times.
Senior officers have not spoken out publicly about the possibility Trump could pardon accused war criminals, but many are privately outraged, according to one currently serving at the Pentagon.
"I think a lot of us would see it in the same way -- that it's just awful," he said.
The possibility of that reaction inside the military could cause Trump not to go ahead with the pardons. But the president has ignored top military officers before, and Pentagon officials who once served to check his impulses, including former Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, are no longer in the administration.
Asked about the possibility that Trump would pardon service members, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters Tuesday: "I'm not really going to speculate on any of the pardons, but I would just say we'll leave it to the White House to comment on the situation there."
Trump has repeatedly bypassed normal procedures for issuing pardons and granting clemency, seizing on cases mentioned on Fox News or those that resonate with him or his supporters. This month, he pardoned Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted of killing an Iraqi during questioning in 2008.
"We are talking about some of the most despicable war crimes. To even contemplate pardons in such cases is disgusting and dishonorable," said Raha Wala, a lawyer at Human Rights First. "It's no wonder that some of our most respected military leaders are speaking out against this, as they should."

NYT executive editor: I think most local newspapers will die within 5 years

Texto completo: New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet offered a bleak forecast for local newspapers: Most will likely be dead within the next few years.
Baquet, speaking Friday at the International News Media Association’s World Congress of News Media, said that the loss of these smaller papers is a tragic result of the evolving digital age.
“The greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news,” he told the audience. “I don’t know what the answer is. Their economic model is gone. I think most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years, except for the ones that have been bought by a local billionaire.”
“I think that everybody who cares about news — myself included, and all of you — should take this on as an issue. Because we’re going to wake up one day and there are going to be entire states with no journalism or with little tiny pockets of journalism,” said Baquet. “I’m not worried about Los Angeles and New York. I don’t know what the model is for covering the school boards in Newark, New Jersey. That makes me nervous.”
A study by the University of North Carolina found that between 2004 and 2018, nearly 1,800 newspapers shuttered. Those losses left 200 counties with no newspaper at all and about half the counties in the entire country with only one.
Since local newspapers traditionally work to hold local government institutions accountable, and research has found that as those newspapers close, government spending in those areas increases.

Texto completo: Gentrification is being blamed for New York City’s rat problem, which has spiked almost 38% in the last few years.
Rat sightings reported to the city have risen from 12,617 in 2014 to 17,353 in 2018, according to data analysis by a nonprofit group and the New York Times.
Scientists and pest control experts have blamed the problem in part on gentrification, which forces rats from their homes and onto the street.
“We’ve seen rats the size of Cleveland,” Larry Jayson, the executive director of the nonprofit Housing and Family Services of Greater New York, said. “You’re unearthing and unleashing hell on those poor people who live next door.”
New York City’s trash problems also contribute to the problem. Bobby Corrigan, one of the nation’s leading rat experts, said rats love the city’s “plastic bag waste culture.”
Tweet
Mayor Bill de Blasio declared war on rates in 2017 with a $32 million plan, but so far, it has been a losing effort.
“There is no doubt that rats have a major impact on New Yorkers’ quality of life, and this administration takes seriously our responsibility to control and mitigate their population,” Deputy Mayor of Operations Laura Anglin said.
“No New Yorker likes having rats in their community, and we are committed to continuing the work of controlling rats in all of our neighborhoods,” she said.
The rise of the rat problem has not been unique to New York City either. In the nation’s capital, D.C.’s rat problem spawned a series of articles in Washington publications complaining about the problem.
Fox News White House Correspondent John Roberts even complained that he had mistaken a massive rat on White House grounds for a squirrel.
Tweet
Last week, the Los Angeles Times blamed climate change for the increasing rat populations in cities, claiming that it could lead to the return of the bubonic plague.

Texto completo: A friend who once worked alongside me in journalism, but who long ago got smart and went to law school, thereafter to prosper, pulled up a chair. He had a question about the big national news agencies, newspapers and networks, and the president of the United States: Has Big Media lost its objectivity?
It seemed to him that essentially every pronouncement by the incumbent was met by a countervailing headline, article or broadcast. My pal's tone was anything but accusatory; reflective, I'd call it.
His specific query was hardly the first; people in my trade have been hearing it since Guttenberg invented the printing press six centuries ago, since Marconi sent wireless signals (1895, for the curious). So we are, or should be, accustomed to answering. Still, I fumbled for a moment, puzzled, given what I had always assumed was my seatmate's political DNA (he is the spawn of determined Sebastian County Democrats, admittedly an endangered species); but more, given his years in a newsroom and his subsequent, much longer time in an equally adversarial profession.
I found myself acknowledging that in some instances the national press, to include print, broadcast and cyber, had got ahead of the curve, of the facts; had pushed the envelope beyond its edge. But: in very few. And: invariably, promptly corrected.
What is in play today, I continued, was a nation fractured to an extent not seen in our lifetimes; a people much too inclined to view those with opposing opinions as not simply uninformed or misguided, but ill-intentioned, even wicked. The polls bear it out.
The causes are several, but begin with an appalling lack of civic literacy: Stop any 10 adults (or teenagers) on the street and ask them to name the three branches of government. Reflect on the social and cultural shifts sweeping not only our country but the world. Stir in millions of Americans that a sizzling (if deficit-financed) U.S. economy has bypassed and a global technological revolution has left adrift and you have a near-perfect climate of distrust of not only the media, but every institution: government, public schools, colleges and universities, business, labor — even churches.
The only thing missing from the perfect storm was a leader willing to take advantage of the unrest, who was prepared to tell his countrymen that their problems were the product of immigrants, ethnic and religious minorities, overseas speculators, judges, the bureaucracy, the military and national security apparatus, his predecessors, any potential rival — his own political party even, when it suits him. And, of course, the press. The Enemy of the People.
He stands before an adoring audience. He holds aloft a fork and calls it an apple. The crowd roars its approval. The Enemy of the People report that, well, the apple is actually a fork. "Fake News," he proclaims. The crowd roars again.
From his speeches, press conferences and, yes, his Tweets, The Washington Post, one of his favorite and most frequent targets, has kept a running total of his fabrications, mischaracterizations, hallucinations, misstatements and outright lies, beginning with his inauguration day. The documented total as of May 1: in excess of 10,000.
Over 831 days, that's an average of a dozen a day.
Politicians, all of them, bend the truth, often. We expect it, recognize it was a part of the game.
It is when they invent a truth, one that is to their liking, that serious trouble arises. As when a politician who could not distinguish a soybean from a sowbelly, or a hair drier from a rice drier, crushes markets and then demands that farmers take one for the team. As when he cannot release his tax returns because they are being audited. As when he is content with assurances from Russia's dictator.
A new aggressiveness on the part of the press? Not really. A new assertiveness? Call it inevitable, given the country's present circumstance and the awakening of its journalists.
I have yet to encounter anyone connected with Bill Clinton who believes Big Media was in the tank for him during his presidency. For those with short memories, it was the New York Times that published the first stories about a land deal called Whitewater, and, later, another Clinton's e-mail practices. Other examples abound.
Paradoxically, the harshest critics of today's establishment press, the "Lamestream Media," prefer the truths delivered by Sean, Tucker, Laura and Judge Jeanne.
In fact, Fox and similar shills that comfort and reinforce are rather akin to the mainstream media of an earlier time: an enemy of the people through its acquiescence and inertia, obligingly and unquestioningly publishing and broadcasting official claims of Communist infiltration in the U.S., indigenous revolution in Cuba, progress in Vietnam, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. That press is gone. Good.

Columnist Steve Barnes says that the "harshest critics of today's establishment press" seem to prefer getting their information from Tucker Carlson, above, and other similar Fox commentators. "In fact, Fox and similar shills that comfort and reinforce are rather akin to the mainstream media of an earlier time," Barnes writes.

Looking for justice from a moving target

Texto completo: When Alanna Ludley was looking for a company to move her belongings — including her grandmother's heirloom piano — from Abington to Hanover last fall, she found Monster Movers, which agreed to do the job for about $1,000.
Ludley asked for four men to handle the 1,000-pound piano, but Monster Movers sent only two. Though they were “very nice and respectful," the job was apparently too much for them. During the move, the upright piano sustained a deep gash at its base.
Initially, the company accepted responsibility and agreed to pay to restore the piano.
But then it ghosted her.
Ludley repeatedly called and e-mailed but got no response.
Finally, Ludley warned that unless the company immediately got in touch with her, she would file a complaint in small claims court.
Still no response.
So Ludley sued the company on Dec. 12, using in her complaint the office address in Marlborough that the company listed prominently in its e-mails with her.
What Ludley didn't realize at the time was that Monster Movers had moved out of its Marlborough office, which, intentionally or not, deprived her of the valid address she needed to collect about $600 to pay for the repair and her court filing cost.
Ludley would soon discover that the company's official corporate filing with the Massachusetts secretary of state's office gave an address in Boylston that is even more out of date than the one in Marlborough. (The company's listing with the state Department of Public Utilities, which regulates the moving industry, is also out of date.)
Later, Ludley found five more addresses for Monster Movers. She did online research, made telephone calls to abutters, and drove by some of the locations; Monster Movers was at none of them.
At a hearing in Hingham District Court on Feb. 15, Ludley received a judgment in her favor, and at a later, second hearing, was granted an “execution on money judgment" that allowed her to hire a sheriff's deputy to demand payment.
But where could the demand for payment be delivered? Two sheriffs' offices she contacted understandably expressed reluctance to take the job without a verified address.
“I had no idea what to do at that point," said Ludley, 51, a registered nurse. “I was just completely stuck."
Ludley came to me in frustration. I'm a big proponent of consumers using small claims court to redress losses in business disputes, having once won a case there myself. (The defendant in my case was an auto dealership, so there was no question where to find him; I also once obtained a settlement on the basis of threatening to take a retailer to small claims court.)
But winning a judgment is no good if you can't get it enforced.
I began my efforts by retracing Ludley's steps but with better luck. When I called the telephone number listed on the company's website saying I needed an address to send a lawsuit, I was given one different from the seven on Ludley's list. That sent me down a winding dirt road in Weymouth, where I found the company's name in tiny lettering on a dilapidated shed. I knocked, but no one answered.
I then left a detailed message for William Antonelli, the company president. He called me back and told me of a personal crisis that had sent his company into a monthslong tailspin.
He promised to pay Ludley. But, just to be safe, I suggested to Ludley that she hire a sheriff's deputy to follow my steps down that dirt road with an official demand for payment.
That stain against Alamo
It certainly sounded silly to me when Alamo Rent a Car claimed something that seems exceedingly improbable: that a customer actually decided to get her rented vehicle washed, during which Alamo claims it was damaged. The company made its claim to explain how the car had supposedly become stained with chemicals, for which it charged the two customers $1,075 in “repair costs."
The women, Caron Welch of Brewster and Robbin Wilson of Connecticut, insisted it was ridiculous to think they decided to get a rented car washed; furthermore, there were no chemical stains on the car when they returned it. They accused the company of trying to take advantage of them after Alamo accepted the returned vehicle without so much as a murmur about chemical stains.
Questioned by me, Alamo quickly agreed to return the money, which I included in my column a couple of weeks ago. But one reader pointed out to me after reading it that there's a saying in economics that goes something like this: “Never in the history of the world has anyone ever washed a rented car."
It's meant to be shorthand for the idea that people will only spend money to maintain property they own.
Larry Summers, the former Harvard president and US secretary of treasury, was once quoted in The New York Times saying it.
It makes me think even less of Alamo, if that's possible.

Texto completo: For the first year or so that President Donald Trump was in office, I thought he was just mentally ill and psychotic. He acted like no other president ever has, saying nasty, unconscionable things. Now I think he is also just pure evil.
He is threatening to collude with Ukraine to smear Joe Biden, or as Maureen Dowd of the New York Times put it: "A president who has spent two years battling accusations that he colluded with a foreign power to fix the 2016 election manages to wriggle off the hook. Just three weeks later, his lawyer unveils their 2020 plan: to collude with a foreign power to fix the election."
By the way, you can read the Mueller Report Executive Summary online, which says Trump did collude with Russia.
What amazes me is his support base, consisting of evangelicals and fundamentalist Christians, Wall Street millionaires and billionaires, rural people and farmers.
Except for the 1 percent, Trump has hurt these groups terribly. And I do not understand how Christians can support this man who abuses women, minorities, the infirm, immigrants, etc., and employs language and actions that would offend any respectable person, and lies every time he opens his mouth.
In the 2020 presidential election, Trump plans to fight as dirty as he can, which we have already seen can be very dirty indeed.
Now, he plans to get even dirtier. My God, save us from this evil.

LAWSUIT CLAIMS PRIZED TOMATOES ARE IMPOSTERS

Texto completo: They are some of the world's most prized tomatoes, beloved by chefs for their low acidity and brilliant red color, the key to great Italian sauces, the products of rich volcanic soil in the coastal fields around Mount Vesuvius.
That's the allure of San Marzano tomatoes. But a new lawsuit alleges that one of America's most popular brands of the canned tomatoes aren't true San Marzanos at all they're impostors, slapping the revered name onto lesser tomatoes to command a higher price tag.
The suit, filed by three Northern California home cooks in federal court last week, accuses the New Jersey food company Cento of "false, misleading and deceptive advertising" on cans labeled as San Marzano tomatoes. It seeks to create a class of consumers that could include thousands of people nationwide who have bought the tomatoes, claiming that those customers are entitled to relief because the tomatoes are not true San Marzanos and shoppers would not have paid a premium if they had known the truth.
Cento strongly denied the lawsuit's allegations, saying that its tomatoes are true San Marzanos and that the suit's claims are "unfounded" and "frivolous."
This isn't the first time the legitimacy of the Sam Marzano tomatoes on American grocery store shelves has been questioned. The online food magazine TASTE described the tomato variety in a 2017 article as "the fake Rolex of canned foods," citing comments from an Italian official that at most, 5 percent of the tomatoes marketed as San Marzanos in the United States were legitimate. The New York Times reported in 2015 that some companies sold American-grown tomatoes as San Marzanos, and that Italian authorities "regularly seize" cans of counterfeit tomatoes.
The reason is in part the almost mythical reputation the meaty, oblong plum tomatoes enjoy in the food world, as well as the high standards of the San Marzano title.
Think of the tomatoes like Champagne, which must come from the eponymous region in France to be worthy of the name: One of many Italian standards for San Marzanos is that they must come from a limited number of fields in one agricultural region of southwestern Italy, the Agro Sarnese-Noceino. The same variety of tomato can be grown elsewhere, but it won't be an official San Marzano.
Those standards don't apply in the United States, meaning sellers can use the widely recognized name on tomatoes that wouldn't pass muster in their homeland.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that while Cento processes the tomatoes it sells as San Marzanos from the Agro Sarnese-Noceino, many of them are actually grown outside that zone. A complaint filed in the suit claims a tool on Cento's website that allows buyers to find the field where each can of tomatoes was grown shows that some of the tomatoes were grown elsewhere in Italy's Campania region.
It also states that while Cento's distinctive yellow cans boast "certified" in bold letters, they do not bear the marking of an Italian consortium that confers the San Marzano title.
A similar lawsuit over San Marzanos was filed against Cento in federal court in New York earlier this year. That case has not yet been resolved.
A spokesman for Cento said the consortium mentioned in the California suit is not the only entity that certifies San Marzanos, and that its tomatoes are certified by a third party.
"At Cento, we take pride in the truthfulness and accuracy of our product labels," the company said in a statement. "Cento exceeds industry standards in production and has always operated with the highest integrity. Any suggestion to the contrary is absolutely false."

Texto completo: The estate of the late pop star Whitney Houston is launching a hologram tour as the centerpiece of efforts to revive the hit-maker's legacy.
"The hologram has taken precedence over everything," estate executor Pat Houston, the late singer's sister-in-law and manager, told The New York Times in an interview Monday, describing plans that include a possible Broadway musical, new branding efforts and an album of unreleased recordings.
Pat Houston said the tour - similar to those that have used laser-generated holograms to create relatively lifelike stage presences of such performers as Maria Callas, Roy Orbison and Frank Zappa - will use Whitney Houston's original band and backup singers, including Whitney's brother Gary, Pat's husband. The concert will include the six-time Grammy Award winner's hits, including "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)" and "Greatest Love of All."
"It's been quite emotional for the past seven years," Pat Houston said. "But now it's about being strategic."
Whitney Houston died Feb. 11, 2012, at age 48, of accidental drowning in a bathtub at the Beverly Hills Hilton hotel, with atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine among precipitating factors. By this time, the singer and star of such films as "The Bodyguard" (1992) and "The Preacher's Wife" (1996) had become a tabloid staple for her drug use.
"Before she passed, there was so much negativity around the name; it wasn't about the music anymore," Pat Houston said. "People had forgotten how great she was. They let all the personal things about her life outweigh why they fell in love with her in the first place."
The estate is developing the tour and other projects with the New York-based music and marketing company Primary Wave, which specializes in catalogs by older platinum-record artists including Smokey Robinson, Def Leppard, Paul Anka and Kenny Loggins. The company is acquiring 50 percent of the Houston estate's $14 million assets, including music and screen royalties and the right to Houston's name and likeness, the Times said.

Texto completo: Most Americans might not realize this, but the democratic process of having your federal government answer tough questions — live, on television — is an act of accountability fast becoming extinct.
Once upon a time, a chief spokesman for the White House or Pentagon or State Department would go before cameras every day, certainly every week, and take any and all questions about government policies impacting millions of American lives. No more.
Come Friday, it will be 67 days since White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a "daily press briefing." That's a record dry spell. And it has been nearly a year since the last, on-camera news conference by a Pentagon spokesperson. The State Department sometimes goes weeks without a "daily" briefing.
Meanwhile, news cycles keep generating vital questions: Is a New York Times report accurate that plans are being prepared to send up to 120,000 troops — a force like the one used to invade Iraq — to counter Iranian threats? Does President Donald Trump expect Americans to endure months of tumbling stocks and rising prices as his China trade war drags on? Why does he keep saying China pays billions in tariffs when American companies and consumers actually foot the bill?
To his credit, media-savvy Trump makes himself available for shouted questions as he boards the Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn or during heads-of-state meetings more than many prior presidents. And the Pentagon offers up experts on specific topics or does occasional briefings with cameras turned off.
"But access is not the same thing as transparency," says Martha Joynt Kumar, an emerita professor at Towson University who studies the history of presidential press relations as director of the White House Transition Project.
Necessary follow-up questions during Trump's blustering Q&A's are all but impossible. And the absence of regularly scheduled briefings denies reporters the chance to dig deeper into administration policy, forcing the White House to explain its plans and be openly accountable for governing decisions.
The lack of transparency is of a piece with other acts of concealment such as curtailing the release of White House visitor logs, breaking with the norm of releasing tax returns, refusing to make administration officials available for congressional oversight hearings, and denying a government watchdog the necessary metrics for judging the success or failure of the Afghanistan War.
While Trump continues to denigrate the media, journalists serve a purpose so vital the Founding Fathers forever enshrined press freedom in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
It's not possible for every American to walk into the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department to ask questions that matter to them. This is why they rely on journalists to do the asking. The least the American people can expect from the Trump administration is to do the answering.

The raid on a journalist's home is San Francisco's disgrace - and it has only gotten worse

Texto completo: San Francisco's crackdown on a journalist in an effort to uncover his source is our international shame.
From the Guardian UK to the New York Times, from LA Times to NBC News, the world has now seen that the bastion of freedom in the United States, that wonderful, weird place we call home, San Francisco, behaves no differently than President Donald Trump when it comes to press freedom.
Trump simply barred press from the White House. San Francisco police, not to be ... trumped ... took a sledgehammer to a journalist's door.
But hey, embarrassing ourselves on an international stage wasn't enough for The City That Doesn't Know How. No, no, in the face of this brazen attack on a free press, our officials decided they had to double down.
Both Mayor London Breed and SFPD Chief Bill Scott have since publicly shown tacit approval of the raid. Their first chance to defend the constitution, to defend the First Amendment, to defend our status as a bastion of progressivism, and they fell flat on their faces.
Now as I levy these critiques, let me be clear: I am not speaking on behalf of the San Francisco Examiner. And although I am vice president of the Society of Professional Journalists Northern California chapter - which has played a lead role in advocating for Carmody, and filing legal missives on his behalf - I am writing this purely in my capacity as a columnist.
Bryan Carmody, a stringer for various television news agencies for more than three decades, is, as the Columbia Journalism Review noted, an "imperfect martyr." He's known in the local journalism world to be politically right wing and sometimes aggressive, to say the least, toward his peers who he perceives as more progressive.
And his style of newsgathering in the dead of night, capturing shadowy crimes and devastating fires and delivering that raw footage and accompanying information to TV stations, has been characterized as the job of a "Nightcrawler."
It's not a flattering portrait. And neither was the coverage of Public Defender Jeff Adachi's death flattering.
But let's be clear. Carmody obtained the police report as any journalist would - through a source.
Was he paid for his own work? Yes. Of course. But even I've done the job of a stringer, for Agence France -Presse, and gathered interviews I delivered, raw, to be assembled by someone else.
Importantly, his protection under the California Shield Law is not dependent on whether or not he is granted the status of a journalist by some authority, but, rather, that he is engaged in the act of newsgathering. Enshrined in our great Golden State's constitution, that law is supposed to bar police from banging down journalist's doors to obtain their sources.
It explicitly protects them from search warrants so journalists can adequately serve the public interest.
All of which brings us back to Breed and Scott.
Mayor Breed's first statement following the incident gave tacit approval for the San Francisco Police Department's May 10 raid.
"As part of the investigation, the [police] department went through the appropriate legal process to request a search warrant, which was approved by two judges," she wrote publicly.
Appropriate. Legal. Process.
This, from the same mayor who lambasts Trump repeatedly (and rightfully) as "bigoted and hateful," and describing San Francisco as a home of resistance to his policies.
Well, sorry Mayor, but when our own police took a page out of Trump's book, you blinked.
And when pressed, hard, by San Francisco Police Commissioner John Hamasaki at a Wednesday commission meeting, SFPD Chief Bill Scott ducked, dodged and weaved like the most skittish of pugilists.
"A free society depends on a free press," Hamasaki told Scott. "When the homes of journalists are raided it doesn't matter how we feel about the underlying case, we should all be concerned."
"Can you say whether a subpoena was considered in lieu" of the search? he asked.
"Commissioner, we went through a process, an appropriate legal process," Scott answered, after some waffling.
Appropriate. Legal. Process.
He also said the department would not release the affidavit for the warrant, which would reveal whether police informed the two judges who signed those warrants that Carmody was a journalist.
That's key. Supervisor Sandra Fewer indicated earlier that they knew he was connected to media (and also bungled the matter of press freedom, herself).
As someone who sincerely sees journalism as a way to defend the morality and spirit of our home, this beautiful seven-by-seven slice of heaven by the Bay, let me say: hate the Adachi coverage all you want, and I certainly did, but this fight isn't just an attack on Carmody.
No, actually, it's an attack on all of us. All media outlets depend on the sanctity of our sources, the protection from government intrusion, to do our jobs.
Think of any story in the Bay Area you've read lately - even my own - that exposed sexual harassment in local government. Those often depend on confidential
sources who leak documents it was illegal for them to possess or share.
Remember Celeste Guap? The young woman, a minor, who was a sex worker and whom Bay Area police officers had sex with repeatedly, potentially criminally? Yeah, that depended on a leaker, too.
Many, many, many important stories were made possible by the If his rights are trampled, if they are allowed to be trampled, with no recourse, with no rebuke, with our officials standing idly by - other critical stories may be impossible to report in the future.
Perhaps that's what they want. Are you going to stand idly by too?

CALIFORNIANS CANNOT TRUST PG&amp;E; TIME TO DISBAND OR REPLACE IT

Texto completo: Cal Fire's confirmation that PG&E caused the Camp Fire the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history bolsters the case for Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature to replace or break up the felonious utility.
The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed more than 19,000 structures. In the last decade, PG&E has been directly responsible for disasters that caused 111 deaths. Northern and Central California shouldn't have to risk another 10 years with PG&E as the provider of gas and electricity.
At this point, any promises the company might make to clean up its act can't be trusted. PG&E talks a good game. But it has consistently failed to deliver.
What PG&E said >> In 2009, PG&E's widely circulated policy was: "Safety comes first, compliance comes first."
What PG&E did >> After the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion, which killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood, investigators discovered that the utility's top management had used ratepayer funds intended for maintenance to pay for executive bonuses and shareholder dividends.
What PG&E said >> In 2015, after the California Public Utilities Commission fined PG&E $1.6 billion for causing the San Bruno explosion, then-PG&E CEO Anthony Earley said, "We are deeply sorry for this tragic event and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten."
What PG&E did >> Three years later, the consulting firm Northstar conducted an exhaustive review of PG&E's overall safety performance. It found that since the San Bruno pipeline explosion in 2010, "PG&E has repeatedly stated its intention to change its safety culture.  Nevertheless, the report also finds that PG&E's overall progress is uneven across its gas and electric lines of business, and that while there are many programs under way, they do not yet add up to a consistent, robust, and accountable corporate-wide safety program."
What PG&E said >> Following the deadly 2017 Wine Country wildfires, PG&E's senior vice president of Electric Operations, Pat Hogan, said, "Our system and our mindset need to be laser-focused on working together to help prevent devastating wildfires like the ones in the North Bay in October and in Southern California in December from happening again, and in responding quickly and effectively if they do. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures."
What PG&E did >> PG&E had known for at least seven years that its electrical towers near where the Camp Fire blaze started were aging and needed to be replaced. In a 2014 email, PG&E said that "the likelihood of failed structures is high." The utility also found damage a broken hook that supports high-voltage wires and "wear" on the nearly 100-year-old transmission tower where the devastating Camp Fire would later start in the early morning of Nov. 8. But the tower was not repaired or replaced.
What PG&E said >> In November 2016, when Geisha Williams was named to replace Earley as CEO, she said: "We are  well positioned for growth with substantial infrastructure investments focused on continuing to enhance the safety and reliability of our system while enabling California's clean energy economy."
What PG&E did >> In March, U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup found that PG&E had not done enough to prevent wildfires through tree trimming and other maintenance work even while its shareholders made millions. "PG&E pumped out $4.5 billion in dividends and let the tree budget wither," Alsup said.
The governor says PG&E cannot be trusted. "They (PG&E) have simply been caught red-handed over and over again, lying, manipulating or misleading the public," Newsom told The New York Times.
We agree. The situation demands a breakup or replacement of PG&E before disaster strikes again.

A giant yellow umbrella in Chicago; Author Amy Krouse Rosenthal to be honored with public art

Texto completo: Chicago author Amy Krouse Rosenthal invited a bunch of strangers to meet her at "The Bean" in Millennium Park at 8:08 p.m. on Aug. 8, 2008.
The strangers would make something together. The strangers would recognize Rosenthal, she told them at the end of a three-minute video called "17 things I made" because she'd be holding a yellow umbrella.
"Come join me as we gather to make a cool 18th thing together," she said.
They joined her by the hundreds that night. In under an hour, they made things: A grand entrance. A friend. Someone's day. It's all captured in a seven-minute follow-up video, "The Beckoning of Lovely," which inspired a 45-minute movie, "The Beckoning of Lovely Story: From Start to Finish-ish."
Rosenthal, you may know by now, died in March 2017 from ovarian cancer. She was 51.
She wrote more than 40 books - children's books ("Little Pea," "I Wish You More" and "Duck! Rabbit!" among others) and memoirs, including "Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life," which was named a top 10 memoir of the decade by Amazon. She was a prolific speaker, frequently appearing on NPR and in Ted Talks.
She was married to Jason Rosenthal, with whom she had three children. Maybe you read her gorgeous, gut-wrenching essay in The New York Times, "You May Want to Marry My Husband," published 10 days before she died.
"I want more time with Jason," she wrote. "I want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet."
On Sunday, a new piece of public art will be unveiled in Lincoln Park's Grandmother's Garden, near the intersection of Fullerton Avenue and Stockton Drive in Chicago, in celebration of Rosenthal's life. It was commissioned by her husband. It will be a yellow glass umbrella.
"The yellow umbrella has become her legacy or her symbol," Jason Rosenthal told me Monday. "It's something that's been associated with her and her message and her work. Right away, in one form or another, I knew that's exactly what I wanted to do."
He worked with Chicago artist Susan Giles and Space Haus, a Chicago-based design and production studio to bring the umbrella to fruition. He raised private dollars. He got the blessings of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago Park District and a committee overseeing public art installations in the parks.
It took awhile.
When it's unveiled Sunday, Rosenthal said, the umbrella will stand 9 or 10 feet tall.
"It's big enough to be used by people to gather, reflect, read, take a selfie, whatever they want to do," he said.
The Rosenthal children, now 22, 24 and 26, went to school near the site where the umbrella will live, and the family spent many days playing and strolling in Lincoln Park.
"The park was pretty much our stomping grounds," Jason Rosenthal said.
Amy has been gone a little more than two years now. Jason hears from people whose lives she touched daily.
"She was so giving with her time and her resources and she meant so much to people," he said. "Her spirit was infectious. So many people continue to remind me how bright she shined."
He still receives letters and emails from all over the world about her New York Times essay.
"Not just about Amy, but about things that people have gone through in the wide category of loss," he said. "But it all comes from her talking and writing publicly about what she went through."
After she passed away, Jason Rosenthal founded the Amy Krouse Rosenthal Foundation to raise money and awareness around two causes: early detection and treatment for ovarian cancer and childhood literacy.
Another thing she's helped make: Progress.
Jason Rosenthal answered his wife's New York Times essay with an essay of his own, "My Wife Said You May Want to Marry Me," published in June 2018.
"I want more time with Amy," he wrote. "I want more time picnicking and listening to music at Millennium Park. I want more Shabbat dinners with the five of us Rosies (as we Rosenthals are referred to by our family)."
And this:
"One thing I have come to understand, though, is what a gift Amy gave me by emphasizing that I had a long life to fill with joy, happiness and love. Her edict to fill my own empty space with a new story has given me permission to make the most out of my remaining time on this planet."
Maybe a giant yellow umbrella can be a nudge for each of us to do the same.

Texto completo: If you need a Father's Day gift for a man who once pitched for a baseball team, consider your search over.
To baseball scorekeepers, "K" means a strikeout. To baseball writer Tyler Kepner of the New York Times, it's the title for his book, "K," subtitled "A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches."
Actually, it's a history -- and detailed description -- of those 10 pitches, with a chapter devoted to each, as follows: the slider, the fastball, the curveball, the knuckleball, the splitter, the screwball, the sinker, the changeup, the spitball and the cutter.
In his foreword, Kepner says the subject deserves deep study. "The pitches are the DNA of baseball, the fundamental coding of the game," he writes. "Joe Madden, the Cubs manager, says the sport could easily be called 'pitching,' because the pitcher controls everything. He is the most influential player on the field, by far, but he can't play every day. That factor, more than any other, makes baseball so interesting."
Trouble is, this book throws more insider stuff than the average baseball fan will care to deal with. Kepner goes into minute detail on such arcane matters as the placement of which finger goes where on the ball, and which way the ball's seams ought to face. When Kepner isn't writing this kind of prose himself, he's quoting others to the same effect.
Here's screwball pitcher Tug McGraw with a sample:
"What Ralph Terry had taught me was to rotate my arm in such a way as to get opposite rotation from every other breaking pitch. When you throw the baseball over the top of your head or ear, it makes just as much sense to turn your wrist inside-out. If you put a clock in front of you, you twist the ball toward three o'clock. It turns your whole arm all the way back to your shoulder. By the time you release it you lose some velocity, but the ball breaks away from a right-handed batter instead of toward him the way a curve does. The baseball will tail away from a right-handed batter, and a cutter will break into him. But this one broke away and destroyed his timing."
Huh?
To be sure, Cardinals fans will savor references to Redbird pitchers, such as Bruce Sutter and Bob Gibson:
- "Of the millions of people who have ever thrown a baseball, Sutter stands alone as the master of the split-finger. Few pitches in the game's history are as synonymous with one man as the splitter is with Sutter."
- "'I wasn't really throwing [my fastball] at them, but I don't care whether I hit them or not,' Bob Gibson says, distilling the intimidator's mind-set. 'Today they dare you to come inside, and if you do, the umpire kicks you out of the ballgame: "Oh, you're throwing at somebody!" No, I'm not throwing at him. If I threw at him, I would hit him.'"
Here and there, Kepner tosses in some humor. An example:
"As McGraw's fastball waned, he called it his Peggy Lee -- as in 'Is That All There Is?' There were variations to the fastball. And McGraw named them, too. The Bo Derek, he said, 'had a nice little tail on it.'"
But mostly, "K" strikes out as entertaining reading. Baseball buffs -- especially Cardinals fans -- who want an inside account of pitching can turn to St. Louis' own Gibson and his "Pitch by Pitch," the first-person story of his record-setting game in the 1968 World Series.
Oh, sure, Gibson's book talks about arms, shoulders, elbows, wrists and fingers. But it also brings in lots of heart, mind and soul.

A decade worth celebrating; Playhouse on Park marks its 10 year anniversary with a list of its top shows

Texto completo: If Tracy Flater, Sean Harris and Darlene Zoller's desire to create a professional theater in Connecticut had gone as originally planned, Playhouse on Park would not be celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. That milestone might instead have happened a few years later, somewhere other than Park Road - or perhaps not at all.
After a few tricky years in which the company was still "finding itself," Playhouse on Park is now a respected, well-established West Hartford arts institution offering plays, musicals, dance shows, children's theater, comedy nights, play readings, the saucy "Mama D's" cabaret revues, drama classes and more. It's found its audience - several distinct audiences, in fact, including hundreds of loyal subscribers. That's worth celebrating.
It was a decade ago that Flater, who'd been helping Zoller with her Stop/Time Dance Theater, decided that "there just weren't enough performance spaces for dance" in the area. When a developer showed her a theater space in the Collinsville section of Canton, Flater interested Zoller in starting a new company there, and Zoller in turn brought in the young New York-trained actor/director/drama teacher Harris.
"We were just beginning to build a three to five-year business plan," Flater says. In the meantime, they decided to produce a Stop/Time dance show elsewhere. "We met with Howard Hirsch, to rent his space. Then we got a call from his landlord." Hirsch's community theater institution, the Park Road Playhouse, owed back rent and its days were numbered. "The landlord thought they could rent out the space themselves, then they ended up asking us to consult. The second meeting we were called to, we were offered the space. That was April 1. We incorporated as a theater company May 1 and were in the space at the end of June. We had nothing but the $3,000 Darlene had raised for rent for Stop/Time."
The early years included a lot of confusion between Playhouse on Park and the too-similarly named Park Road Playhouse, which had occupied the 244 Park Road location from 2001-2008. "Park Road Playhouse went through bankruptcy and was evicted. We came in right after that. The transition was seamless, but the perception for some people was that we had kicked them out."
"What we decided to do," Sean Harris says, "was a 12-show professional season with world premieres, New England premieres." To make sure there was a surefire commercial hit alongside tougher sells like the break-up musical "The Last Five Years" and a medieval comedy called "Trapezium" by New York Times crossword puzzle constructor Henry Rathvon, they opened the season with Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers."
"But nobody came to see 'Lost in Yonkers,'" Harris laughs, recalling his alarm at the time. "They didn't come to see the other shows too. We did everything we ever wanted to do as a theater company. If that season was done now, people would be talking about it for years."
"We were overly ambitious, that's for sure," Zoller chimes in. "Then there was people not knowing that we were a professional theater company, not community theater anymore. They were used to coming to see people they knew in the shows."
The three co-founders learned to trust their instincts, and worked to get the community to trust them too.
When this season ends in June, with the ambitious musical "The Scottsboro Boys," Playhouse on Park will have produced 80 plays and musicals, nearly 30 shows for children and too many special events to keep track of.
Of the co-founders' shared top 10 picks, six are musicals, one is a Stop/Time dance show, three are dramas (all of which happen to contain Jewish themes) and one is an outlandish Shakespeare parody. Among the trio's "honorable mentions": "Hair," "Tuesdays with Morrie," "Red Light Winter," the technically involved mythic fantasy "Metamorphoses," "Equus," "Around the World in 80 Days," the world premiere of "Higgins in Harlem," "This is Our Youth," and "The Parkville Project," a co-production with Hartford's Bated Breath Theatre Company.
A decade in, the playhouse continues to tweak how they do things. For three weeks this summer, the space is hosting the national tour of "Spamilton," the popular "Hamilton" parody from the creator of "Forbidden Broadway." The season subscription package has been reshaped so that the Stop/Time dance shows are standalone events and not a part of the regular season. Extra matinee performances are being added to the run of each mainstage show and the playhouse's education programs have been "rebranded."
The theater has already held some 10th anniversary events, including a champagne brunch at the beginning of this seasons and "a 10th birthday party for the little ones." The celebrations culminate with a 10th anniversary gala held from 6 to 11 p.m. on June 15 in the Gershon Fox ballroom in the old G. Fox building on Main Street in Hartford. Tickets for the gala range from $250 to $5000; details are at playhouseonpark.org.

Planned growth important to city

Texto completo: Unlike other opinion pieces by Greg Kesich, "History won't stop for zoning" (May 12) appears to minimize the importance of planned growth and thoughtful preservation of Portland's history.
Kesich suggests that the proposed Munjoy Hill Historic District will unnecessarily hamper current homeowners who want to improve their property, while not protecting what many value: its historic homes and neighborhoods.
In fact, the historic district designation will provide additional leverage for homeowners throughout the Hill who seek to prevent unbridled development - demolishing perfectly fine two- and three-unit properties with affordable rents in favor of expensive multi-unit condominiums that forever change the streetscape and nature of the neighborhoods.
Kesich speaks to the need to encourage families with children to live on the Hill, yet increasingly, because of loopholes in zoning and a rush to cash in on the popularity of the Hill, new, replacement housing has done just the opposite. Most families can't afford to rent here, let alone buy. Last year, we had one trick-or-treater on Munjoy Hill while friends in Woodfords Corner had 60.
Finally, Kesich uses the proposed aquarium as an example of an idea whose time never came. I would suggest the demolition of Portland's Union Station as an alternate example. Who now doesn't wish we had preserved that fabulous landmark? If we had applied historic preservation standards then, we wouldn't be looking at the eyesore strip mall that exists in its stead.
Let's look for ways to protect what is good while promoting thoughtful development on Munjoy Hill and throughout Portland. There's no reason we can't do both.

Bowdoin equipped to aid homeless local youth
It has occurred to me that Bowdoin College has an obligation to offer assistance in addressing the youth homelessness crisis in Brunswick. My hope is that the Maine Sunday Telegram's May 12 feature article "Young and on their own" (Page A1) may compel them to do so.
Youth homelessness in Maine, and in Brunswick in particular, has been accelerating at alarming rates. To cite data used in the Telegram article, the number of homeless students in Brunswick schools has jumped from 14 to 92 since 2014, and has seen a 264 percent increase in the last three years.
Brunswick's Bowdoin College is fortunate enough to have an astounding $1.63 billion endowment whose growth has been unparalleled by the portfolios of many Ivy League schools, according to a March article in The New York Times.
In light of this article and information on youth homelessness in Brunswick, I believe it is the responsibility of Bowdoin to decide to take action on this heart-wrenching problem. As a figurehead of education in the state, improving the ability of young people to thrive as students and in life is central to Bowdoin's mission as a highly successful institution of higher learning. Even a small amount of money in the eyes of Bowdoin could create monumental changes in the lives of many students in the town that Bowdoin calls its home.

Planetary justice obstructed by Trump
At a recent meeting of the Arctic Council, a coalition of the eight countries that comprise the Arctic, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described that rapidly warming region as a "land of opportunity and abundance." He cited its untapped reserves of oil, gas, uranium, gold, fishing and rare earth minerals, which, in addition to the opening up of new shipping routes - a new Suez Canal - will create "exciting new opportunities for economic growth."
Only six months ago, Donald Trump's only response to the recently released Fourth National Climate Assessment, culminating three years' research by myriad federal agencies and mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 1990, was that he'd seen it but didn't believe it.
This president supports and reiterates the lie that climate change doesn't threaten the planet and that people have little to do with it. His reasons for doing so are obvious.
Despite his pro-life mantra, this president is overseeing a sixth extinction of species. Despite the efforts of communities throughout Maine to organize and lower carbon footprints, our commander in chief works against what community sustainability groups are working hard to do - Maine Sierra Club's climate action teams, Portland's sustainability initiatives, Mount Desert Island's A Climate to Thrive - all of whom work tirelessly to act locally and think globally.
This president has literally admitted he's exploiting the planet for all its worth and celebrates the climate change he still calls a hoax. Mike Pompeo's very words should indict Mr. Trump for obstructing planetary justice.

Conference could advance pro-child Maine policies
Your May 12 editorial, "Our View: Maine children need solid foundations" (Page D3), did an excellent job in showing how childhood success or failure carry into adulthood. Gov. Mills is well aware of this relationship, hence her reinstatement of the Children's Cabinet, meant to ensure that state government coordinates its efforts in addressing the challenges facing children and their parents. It's also meant to inform and engage the public.
Here's a bit of history the governor could draw from to advance greater public investments in children: In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt convened the first ever White House Conference on Children. Priority issues included child labor, infant mortality and orphanages.
This was the first of White House Conferences on Children that were convened in Washington, D.C., every 10 years. Each state prepared a list of the most urgent children's issues they wanted addressed nationally, which were debated by all in an attempt to form consensus. A document emerged, meant to guide the president and the Congress for the decade ahead. The last national White House conference was in 1970. I was a delegate. I recall the spirited debate among attendees, who knew their work would be taken seriously.
In 1981, then-Gov. Joseph E. Brennan hosted the first ever Blaine House Conference on Children, Youth and Families. Staffed by what was then the Department of Human Services, the conference was attended by hundreds who debated children's issues for two days, helping state government shape its priorities.
Now that the Children's Cabinet has been re-established, the governor or Cabinet should consider hosting a Blaine House Conference outlining her priorities, and to hear the priorities of delegations from each of the 16 counties.
We know much about how to produce healthy outcomes for children, but little progress is achieved if political will is lacking. A Blaine House conference could change that.

Texto completo: After eight years, "Game of Thrones" wraps up on HBO. And Jordan Peele's "Get Out" airs on FX.
What's on TV
GAME OF THRONES 10 p.m. on HBO. Eight years of wine, murder and murder come to a close Sunday night as "Game of Thrones" airs its final episode. Whether you've been following the series since Day 1 or binge-watched to catch up (or will instead spend your Sunday night reading, working, talking with loved ones or watching MULAN (1998), airing at 9:50 p.m. on Freeform), Sunday night's episode represents the end of an era for HBO and millions of viewers. But for the story at large, it's not quite the end: the book series that inspired the show, George R. R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire," still isn't over. That might make some bittersweet viewing parties a bit less bitter -- or more bitter, given many fans' penchant for stewing over the delay.
GET OUT (2017) 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. on FX. As far as "Game of Thrones" finale counterprogramming goes, a network can't do much better than "Get Out," Jordan Peele's breakout scary movie that helped redefine the horror genre in 2017. Many viewers will need no reintroduction to Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), the photographer who goes on a trip to the home of the parents of his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), and finds himself in what Manohla Dargis, in her review for The New York Times, called "a white nightmare." She called the film "an exhilaratingly smart and scary freakout."
TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (1962) 8 p.m. on TCM. You don't need to be watching Aaron Sorkin's updated Broadway adaptation to find Harper Lee's story of law and race in small-town Alabama resonant. This classic movie adaptation, released just a couple years after Lee's novel, stars Gregory Peck as the white Alabama lawyer Atticus Finch, who agrees to defend a black defendant in a sexual assault case during the Great Depression.
SUNDAY TODAY WITH WILLIE GEIST 8 a.m. on NBC. While anyone who has watched David Letterman's Netflix show has gotten used to both the beard and seeing Letterman outside the context of his longtime late-night television desk and backdrop, the setting for this interview with Willie Geist is still a bit surprising: After a brief attempt at fishing, the pair sit on two Adirondack chairs next to a river to talk about Letterman's life since 2015, when he wrapped up his 33-year career in late-night.
What's Streaming
LUNATICS Stream on Netflix. Chris Lilley, whom The Times once referred to as "the most famous Australian comedian since Barry Humphries," rose to fame in the mid-2000s with "Summer Heights High" and "We Can Be Heroes," two absurd mock-reality TV series in which Lilley played multiple characters of great variety. He does that again in this new series; he plays a fashion designer, a real estate agent and more.

Texto completo: I.M. Pei, the world-renowned Chinese-American architect, died Thursday at the age of 102.
Pei is known for his dramatic use of concrete and glass, having created some of the world's most famous buildings since the start of his career in 1948.
His most well-known buildings include the glass pyramid that serves as an entrance to the Louvre in Paris (built in 1989), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland (1995), the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston (1979) and the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar (2008).
But Pei also brought his talents to Delaware, creating the Wilmington Tower in 1971.
The structure still stands and is now known as the I.M. Pei Building. Located at 1105 N. Market St., it is the third-tallest building in Wilmington. The building is 282 feet high and has 23 floors.
"It's amazing," said Kate Bohner, who works out of the 18th floor. "We have views of Philadelphia. Floor to ceiling windows ... that to me feels like working."
Only the River Tower at Christina Landing (built in 2007) and the Chase Manhattan Centre (1988) currently surpass it. The I.M. Pei Building was never the tallest in Wilmington. That honor belonged to the Hercules Tower, at 287 feet, from 1960-1988. It was demolished in 2003.
It's unclear when the building became known as the I.M. Pei Building, but it was referred to as such even before the official name change.
When Pei made it to Delaware, his prestige was already building.
Pei was born on April 26, 1917, in Guangzhou, China. He grew up in Hong Kong and Shanghai before coming to the United States at the age of 17 for school.
After graduating from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Pei worked for New York real estate mogul William Zeckendorf for seven years before starting his own architectural firm, I.M. Pei & Associates, in 1955.
He broke through for the first time on the national stage with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, in 1967. In 1968, he completed the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse and the Des Moines Art Center.
During this time, Pei began working on what would become some of his most well-known projects, including Dallas City Hall (completed in 1977); the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; (1978) and the Kennedy Library (1979).
But back in Delaware, he also completed the Wilmington Tower, a project that started in 1963. It was a fairly typical Pei building for its time, according to the Society of Architectural Historians' Archipedia, featuring large green window panes and empty swaths of concrete on its sides.
In 2004, Thomas E. Hall and Associates completed a $7 million renovation to the building. They replaced all of the windows, painted the concrete and reconstructed the lobby. Buccini Pollin Group, who currently manages the building, took control in 2007.
Today, the building still bustles, providing 170,000 square feet of class 'A' office space. It is located near Rodney Square in Wilmington's downtown.
Pei arguably reached his apex in the 1980s with projects such as the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong and the pyramid at the Louvre.
The 70-foot pyramid famously appalled traditionalists when it was first introduced. The public eventually warmed to it as it became the second-most recognized structure in Paris.
"If there's one thing I know I didn't do wrong, it's the Louvre," Pei once said, according to The New York Times.
Pei won a litany of awards throughout his career including the Prtizker Prize, referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture, in 1983, and a lifetime achievement award from the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in 2003.
"It's hard to go somewhere where his buildings have not had an impact on the local environment," said Howard Decker, the chief curator of the National Building Museum in 2003. "As we see Modernism being re-explored by younger architects, attention is being given to Pei's work and the kind of balance he expressed and the way he peels away the unnecessary to reveal the essential."
He retired from his full-time career in 1990 but continued on a part-time basis into the early 2000s.
His wife of 72 years, Eileen, died in 2014 and his eldest son, T'ing Chung, died in 2003.
He is survived by his sons Chien Chung, known as Didi, and Li Chung, known as Sandi and his daughter, Liane.

Jerrod Carmichael is ready to get personal

Texto completo: NEW YORK - "The only thing weirder than finding out your father has a second family - is finding out that you guys are that second family."
That was how Jerrod Carmichael ended his 2017 HBO stand-up special "8"; after nearly an hour of riffs, the comedian just casually presented this idea to his audience.
"What else should we talk about?" he continued, right before the special jarringly cut to the credits.
It wasn't a grand-finale punch line Carmichael had been obviously building toward throughout the 50-plus minutes that preceded it. It lacked catharsis; as an out-of-left-field observation, it could be interpreted as the most deeply personal moment of the performance, or as an absurdist misdirect meant to tease viewers' expectations.
Maybe it was a bit of both. On Sunday evening, HBO hosted the premiere of "Home Videos," a loose half-hour of cinéma vérité documenting Carmichael's off-the-cuff chats with some of the women in his life during a visit to his hometown, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Instead of performing onstage, the comedian plays an affable investigator, interviewing his subjects about topics like beauty standards, R. Kelly, Blackness and sensitive family history.
In one conversation with his mother, Cynthia, he brings up his father's infidelity and "multiple children outside of the relationship."
"I'm not going to say the hurt and anger didn't try to build, because I'm human," Cynthia tells him. "But - maybe I suppressed some of it - but talking, and asking enough questions, I don't know. I'm pretty much content."
She adds that it's up to her husband to prove to her that he can be trusted again, and that as far as she can tell, he has.
When I sat down with Carmichael at one of his frequert New York City haunts, ABC Kitchen, on a warmish afternoon late last month, the ostensible connection between "8" and "Home Videos" was the first thing I asked him about. While crafting that closing line a couple of years ago, did he have a sense he would return to it?
"It's an emotional mountain my family has had to climb and is still climbing it in some ways" he explained. "Saying it at that point, that was as far as I was willing to go, kind of out of respect."
"Home Videos" might be his most revealing project yet; it's certainly his most intimate. Over a few days in January, Carmichael directed and shot the special on film (Paul Thomas Anderson's "Phantom Thread" was an inspiration) with one camera and a small crew in and around the homes of his mother, his sister and a family friend. Short vignettes between the segments show him playing around with his nieces in their quiet suburban neighborhood.
It's difficult to pin down what exactly "Home Videos" is supposed to be. Carmichael isn't sure either, though he described it as equal parts "investigative piece," "just videos" and a "prestige reality show."
"I didn't know what it was, but I knew the intention, and just off the intention of it (HBO) trusted me to go and make something."
'Just don't lie'
The idea was born in part out of a desire to see the Black women in his life represented on-screen in ways he hadn't seen before. He pitched the show to his family as having an "honest conversation' and prepared no questions beforehand. He had one rule for his subjects: "Just don't lie."
"'Even if you don't want to talk about something, telI me,'" he told them.
He added, "'No performance for the camera. Me and you, we're here. Let's see what happens.'"
What happens is not unlike an episode of his acclaimed but underseen family sitcom "The Carmichael Show," which ended after three seasons in 2017, or one of his stand-up routines: an ever-curious Carmichael pokes, prods and interrogates comfort zones and widely held beliefs and customs.
When he teases his older sister Valencia, their closeness and ease with one another is palpable, and it feels as if "Home Videos" is dropping in on a conversation they've had many times before.
Carmichael described their dynamic as involving a lot of passionate debate and the occasional "clash." He ribs her about her vocal defense of Black womanhood, he said, to "make sure she believes it."
"I want to kick the tires, and I want her to do the same for me," he added. "That's just what our relationship is; I love it."
Lessons for young and old
In another scene, he speaks with 11-year-old Joliet, Valencia's bookish daughter, about school, role models and whether she sees herself represented in film and TV. When he asks her to tell him the secret to being happy, she responds, in part: "You have to know what you want, not what everyone else wants."
Carmichael is taken aback. "Who the (expletive) are you?" he says, laughing.
I asked him if today's kids and teens made him feel hopeful about society's future.
"Oh, yeah," he said. "I think what black kids were to sports and entertainment, they're going to be to nuclear physics or biochemistry."
He added, "Even my hood cousin's kids sound like Tia and Tamera," referring to the Mowry twins, the precocious stars of the '90s sitcom "Sister, Sister." "I don't know how that happened. They have an awareness their parents didn't have, their aunts and uncles didn't have."
This perspective is a stark pivot from "8," where he stated his wish that black people as a collective were "further along," and which largely consisted of Carmichael's agonizing over his inability to feel for or care about, well, anything. (Including, but not limited to: animals, weddings, the "I Have a Dream" speech.)
He admits that at that time he "felt passionately about my lack of passion for certain things." Now, he said, he can better acknowledge his own feelings, particularly as they relate to Joliet.
"It's funny - with her, I would die for her. Like, actually die for her," he said. "And that's a thing that, being honest with myself, I didn't realize I felt until - just this moment you look at her like, 'Oh wow, this is incredibly powerful, what this is.'"
It's the conversation with his mother in "Home Videos," however, that most implies Carmichael is a bit more sensitive than he's seemed in the past. At one point, he asks if she finally accepts that she, a dark-skinned woman, is in fact pretty.
Didn't push too much
"She's always struggled with that," Carmichael told me. "She's a beautiful, beautiful person, and watching her not be able to come to terms with that - as a son, it breaks your heart."
When it came to his mother's relationship with his father, Carmichael said there were things he had sensed while growing up but hadn't dug into deeply. While he approached this opportunity to discuss it with his mother as if it were their "last conversation ever," he was also careful not to press the issue too much.
"I wanted to protect her from going too deep on certain things that might be too sensitive," he said.
If he held back, the conversation as it appears in "Home Videos" is still striking to watch. There's no hedging or hesitancy in Cynthia's answers to her son's potentially awkward questions about her love life and rocky marriage to his dad.
And Carmichael's statement that he's hooked up with men - an off-handed remark following his question of whether she finds other women attractive - is dropped in unexpectedly in the middle of their chat, and just as quickly left behind, in "8"-like fashion.

Texto completo: Anjelica Huston isn't apologizing after making pointed comments about some of her acting contemporaries and past relationships during a press tour for "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum."
Huston has a key role in the Keanu Reeves action movie, which premiered in Hollywood on Wednesday. She's been talking about her past while promoting the movie, making pointed jabs about Robert De Niro's acting choices and a new Diane Keaton movie in the process.
"You know we all live life, and at a certain point you have to claim your life. You know, I could apologize for a lot of things. But you know, all in all I've tried not to hurt people. Once in a while, I think maybe I'm a little politically incorrect - but that's part of who I am," Huston said.
The 67-year-old actress also commented on the size of her ex Jack Nicholson's genitalia during an interview earlier in the week. She says she's happy to keep speaking her mind - but doesn't want to be seen as a role model for younger actresses.
"Oh God, no. I don't want to be an example to anyone who, you know, who doesn't know their own mind yet," she said. "I've always known what I liked and what I didn't like and where I wanted to be. And so far, that served me pretty well."

Big-bucks bunny: A stainless steel sculpture of a rabbit by Jeff Koons has set an auction record in New York, fetching over $91 million. The sale of Koons' 1986 "Rabbit" at Christie's was the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction. The previous record was set by British artist David Hockney. His 1972 "Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)" brought in $90.3 million at Christie's last year. The New York Times says Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was the winning bidder for "Rabbit."
Shakira cleared: A Spanish court has cleared Colombian singers Shakira and Carlos Vives of a plagiarism claim after rejecting a lawsuit brought against them by a Cuban-born singer and producer. Livan Rafael Castellanos had accused Shakira and Vives of plagiarizing his 1997 song "Yo te quiero tanto" in their award-winning hit "La Bicicleta."

Texto completo: 'The Sun is Also a Star' **1/2
Teenagers need melodrama. They always have. It seems its big, sweeping emotions are somehow the only things that can match the high-stakes, hormone-enhanced teenage feelings. Director Ry Russo-Young excels at rendering those emotions with a singular sense of artfulness. In "The Sun is Also a Star," Russo-Young swirls together sun-dappled selfies, luscious skin, urban grittiness and hip-hop beats, the aesthetics perfectly matched to emotion. She creates a heady, knee-buckling mood that nearly conceals the weaknesses in story and performances.
The film is the feature adaptation of Nicola Yoon's second novel. Her first, "Everything, Everything," also went on to success as a movie adaptation, starring Amandla Stenberg and Nick Robinson in a swoony take on a Bubble Boy story. The sick teen genre is a well of deep potential with its heightened stakes and ticking clock. And in the structural sense, "The Sun is Also a Star" is also a sick teen movie -- without sickness. But the stakes are high and the clock is ticking -- on a mandatory deportation from the United States.
Yara Shahidi (of "black-ish" and "grown-ish") stars as Natasha, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants but a New Yorker through and through. The day before her family is set to be deported back to Jamaica, she makes a last-ditch attempt to change their fate by pleading their case to an immigration lawyer. She's spotted in Grand Central Station by Daniel ("Riverdale" star Charles Melton), who notices she's staring at the starry ceiling, and he interprets her "Deus Ex Machina" jacket as a sign. Daniel is a poet, a dreamer and a believer in destiny, and he takes off after her. First he saves her from a speeding BMW in Chinatown, then persuades the science-driven Natasha to spend some time doing the "36 Questions" love study from the New York Times. "Give me a day," he says, "and you'll fall in love with me."
Easy for the easy-on-the-eyes Melton to say! Shahidi and Melton both possess an otherworldly kind of beauty, and combined with Russo-Young's lush, rhythmic cinematic style, you could just watch them bop around the city for hours, all shiny hair and plush lips. But then, they open their mouths and the spell is broken. The dialogue (script by Tracy Oliver) just grinds things to a halt, with speeches that are a bit too on the nose, and too-grand declarations of love. Then again, all those things seem so profound and meaningful at that age.
As pretty as Shahidi and Melton are, they just don't share a palpable chemistry. Shahidi is undoubtedly a star, and while Melton is charming and gorgeous with a goofy puppy-dog energy, the more dramatic moments demonstrate the upper limitations of his range. Shahidi's few short scenes with immigration lawyer John Leguizamo are far more riveting.
That's somewhat covered up by Russo-Young's impressive filmmaking. A New York City native, she captures the arresting energy of the city while imbuing the film with a sense of lyricism and grace, as if the streets are sprinkled with magical fairy dust. The world looks the way it feels when you're falling in love, like everything is at its best, and everything makes sense. When you're looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn't seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has lots of student loan debt and received a $75,000 advance for his political memoir, according to a financial document he filed this week.
Those details were part of an annual personal financial disclosure form that candidates must submit within 30 days of filing a president candidacy, which Buttigieg officially announced April 14. IndyStar obtained the document through a records request Wednesday, the day after he filed the form.
Buttigieg, of course, lists his occupation as mayor of South Bend. His annual income for running the state's fourth-largest city is $149,725, according to the document.
That puts him among the highest-paid mayors in Indiana, likely the highest. While the state doesn't keep a list of mayoral salaries by city, IndyStar has reported Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard will make $148,786 in 2019; Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson, $142,000; and Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness, $135,174.
Buttigieg also plays the stock market. He, and his husband, Chasten, have invested as much as $50,000 in Apple, and up to $15,000 in Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Income on those was between $2,702 and $6,000.
Buttigieg also disclosed somewhere between $4,004 and $62,000 in various other stock funds and listed income of $2,702 to $6,800. Much has been made of Buttigieg's education. After all, he graduated from Harvard and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford.
The document revealed some detail about the price. He listed student loans, somewhere between $140,004 and $360,000 over the next 25 years. The interest rates range from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.
A campaign spokesman said the loans include Chasten Buttigieg's education. He has a master's from DePaul University and a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin.
And about that book deal. The disclosure form includes an attachment that notes Buttigieg agreed to a $75,000 advance from Liveright Publishing Corp., June 15, 2017, on his New York Times-bestselling political memoir, "Shortest Way Home." His working title, abandoned at some point along the way, was "Letters from Flyover Country."
That's not to be confused with an essay he wrote shortly after the 2016 presidential election, "A Letter from Flyover Country," which focused on how Democrats could succeed in Middle America.
He also has the opportunity to make royalties on his book based on sales, but it's unclear when those kick in.
He's received $3,000 for an audio version through Recorded Books Inc. It's unclear how much more, if any, he might make on that portion of the deal.
The disclosure also notes he's on the boards of the South Bend Symphony Orchestra, with which he's known to play piano, the South Bend Education Foundation, Veterans Community Connections and Accelerate Indiana Municipalities, which is Indiana's city and towns advocacy group. He lists no income from those volunteer positions.
The form notes his husband, Chasten, left his job at Montessori Academy in Mishawaka in January, and continues to work part-time at the South Bend Civic Theatre. No income data is provided.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The United States and allies have been arguing about whether Iran is stepping up threats against American forces in the Middle East – or responding to threats from the Trump administration.
U.S. officials told The New York Times they escalated their warnings to Iran because of intelligence showing photographs of missiles loaded onto small boats in the Persian Gulf.
"Overhead imagery showed fully assembled missiles, stoking fears that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps would fire them at United States naval ships," the Times reported.
The Times noted that Europeans and some congressional lawmakers said "Iran's moves might mostly be defensive against what Tehran believes are provocative acts by Washington."
Last week, CNN reported that Iran loaded ballistic missiles on boats.
The U.S. sent B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf. Wednesday, the State Department ordered nonemergency staff out of Iraq because of the tensions.
This week, U.S. and British officials publicly disputed whether Iran is more of a threat than it has been. British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, the No. 2 officer in the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, in Syria and Iraq, said the Iran threat is no greater than it was months ago.
The Pentagon pushed back. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said Ghika was wrong and his comments "run counter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from U.S. and allies."
Lawmakers fear the tensions could lead to military conflict.
Democrats have been particularly critical of national security adviser John Bolton, who has made no secret of his desire to seek regime change in Iran.
"We should do everything possible to prevent an unnecessary war, beginning with immediately reopening diplomatic channels and toning down the rhetoric," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
At the White House Thursday, President Donald Trump responded to a question about whether his administration is marching the United States into a war with Iran with "I hope not." He has played down the potential for military action, saying he would respond only to some kind of attack. Asked earlier in the week about a report that Bolton and other officials discussed sending 120,000 troops to the region, Trump said, "Hopefully, we're not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that."

Grassley: US tariffs 'propelled Hitler'

Texto completo: Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley on Wednesday blamed a 1930 tariff law for bringing about the Great Depression, the rise of Adolf Hitler and World War II.
"As I like to tell the president when he says he likes tariffs, I try to remind him that Smoot-Hawley brought about the Great Depression, brought about Adolf Hitler, brought about World War II, brought about 60 million people losing their lives as a result of it," Grassley said. He was speaking to the National Association of Farm Broadcasting about tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.
Trump last week said he would hike tariffs to 25% on $200billion in Chinese imports after trade negotiations stalled. Chinese officials said in return it would raise tariffs up to 25% on $60billion in U.S. goods. Trump's administration also seeks to place tariffs on another $325billion in Chinese goods.
Grassley said on Wednesday that the United States then reduced its tariffs and that poverty has dropped worldwide since the end of World War II.
"I like to tell the president that globalism has helped everybody. Freeing up trade has helped everybody," Grassley said.
The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which President Herbert Hoover signed in 1930, raised tariffs on a variety of products. The U.S. Senate's website describes the law as "among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history" and said that the United States' trading partners retaliated with their own tariffs, worsening the Great Depression.
Grassley has been making similar comments about the Smoot-Hawley Act for years.
In 2019, Grassley said of Hoover, a fellow Iowa Republican: "He signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff bill, and the United States became protectionist, the world became protectionist. It shut down world trade and probably contributed more than any other decision to the Great Depression becoming worldwide. And the Great Depression is a part of the reason that Hitler rose to power and we lost 60 million people in World War II."
In 2016, Grassley also warned Trump's tariffs could be damaging, again citing the Smoot-Hawley Act.
"You shot down international trade because we protect, other countries protect. Then you have a deep depression. And then you have Hitler come to power. And then you have 60 million people murdered as a result of World War II. We don't want to go down that route again," Grassley told The New York Times that year.

Federal Rule Could Displace 2,800 Immigrant Families

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Margarita knows what it's like to not have a home.
She bounced from shelter to shelter in New York City, just her and her two children, for nearly a decade. Although her children were born in the United States, Margarita, 48, is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, and her status has added to the family's struggle to gain a foothold in the city, where she works as a housekeeper.
But in August, they qualified for an affordable public housing apartment in the Bronx.
"It felt like justice after everything we had gone through," Margarita, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she was a victim of domestic violence, said.
Soon, they could lose it all again.
The Trump administration proposed a rule last month that would prohibit families from obtaining subsidized housing, including apartments operated by the New York City Housing Authority, if any family member is undocumented.
"There is an affordable housing crisis in this country, and we need to make certain our scarce public resources help those who are legally entitled to it," Ben Carson, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said in a statement.
The proposed rule would target, and likely displace, about 2,800 immigrant families in New York City who live in public housing or receive rental subsidies from the federal government, according to data provided to The New York Times by the city.
In total, about 11,400 people in the city could be evicted from their homes, almost half of them children. Nationwide, more than 108,000 people -- mostly in California, Texas and New York -- would be affected, according to internal analysis from HUD.
A housing shortage and a homeless crisis
In proposing the change, the federal government expanded its crackdown on illegal immigration to the realm of housing assistance, throwing into uncertainty the fate of thousands of families.
It also opened another front in the Trump administration's multifaceted clash with New York, which includes battles over immigration, climate change and even the president's tax returns.
Federal housing officials have said the rule would help prioritize low-income U.S. citizens and curb waiting lists for public housing with waits of more than two years on average, according to HUD.
More than 4.2 million people nationwide are on waiting lists for housing vouchers and public housing. And there are about 180,000 people on the waiting list for public housing in New York City, which runs the country's largest public housing stock.
But experts said the new policy would mostly displace thousands of children who are citizens, exacerbate homelessness and increase costs for both the federal government and the city.
"It's going to be expensive to New York City because we have a right to shelter and they're going to have to shelter families at a time when we have a huge homeless crisis," said Judith Goldiner, head of the Legal Aid Society's civil reform unit.
Undocumented immigrants currently are not allowed to receive federal housing subsidies, but the rules allow families of mixed immigration status to live in subsidized housing as long as one family member -- a child who is a citizen, for example -- is a legal resident.
Under the proposed rule, more than 25,000 mixed status families nationwide would no longer be able to live in subsidized housing. Family members who are in the country legally would be allowed to stay in their home, but entire families would likely vacate their homes to avoid being separated, the HUD analysis found.
As a result, more than 55,000 children who are residents or citizens could be displaced nationwide, about 4,900 of them in New York City.
"This is what cruelty looks like -- throwing children out in the street. We will fight the President tooth and nail to protect our people," Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. A spokesman for the mayor added that the city could explore legal options against the rule, were it to be finalized.
"We've always lost more than we've won"
For Margarita and her children, ages 14 and 15, that may mean going back to a shelter.
"There was a time when my children were mad at me because they said they were going through everything we've been through because of me and my limitation of not having documents," Margarita said in Spanish.
Margarita overstayed her tourist visa in the United States 17 years ago after traveling from Mexico City, where she left behind two girls and a husband who, she said, abused her.
Despite having multiple university degrees in Mexico, she found only jobs cleaning apartments in New York City. She also volunteers helping victims of domestic violence in her spare time.
She eventually had a son and a daughter with another man, but he also abused her, she said. The city's department of child services intervened when that brutality also reached her children.
"They noticed we were living in that cycle of violence," Margarita said.
In 2008, the city placed Margarita and her children in a shelter for victims of domestic violence, and so began the family's odyssey navigating the city's labyrinthine system. Margarita's immigration status limited and affected the programs they qualified for.
The family has lived in four shelters across the city. In between, they had two stints in private apartments. Margarita is in the process of getting approved for a U visa, which is designed for victims of crime and abuse.
Not only have they been evicted in the past, but the family has lost all of their belongings twice, once because of a basement fire and another time after being evacuated from a shelter that had a gas leak.
"The impact of transitioning between shelters," she said, "is not just an issue of housing. It's emotional, psychological."
"That's our life," Margarita said, adding, "We've always lost more than we've won."
But their fortunes began to change, however briefly, when they moved into a two-bedroom public housing apartment last year.
City versus President
The proposed rule is not yet in effect. It is undergoing a mandatory public comment stage that ends on July 9.
The New York City congressional delegation wrote a letter last week to Mr. Carson, calling the proposal "disturbing."
Housing subsidies are currently prorated based on the number of eligible residents, which means mixed-status families typically receive lower subsidies and pay higher rents than households where all members are eligible.
"I don't think it's fully understood these are families that are paying their share," said Ms. Goldiner.
The federal government would need to provide higher subsidies to the new families replacing mixed-status households, a move that could cost HUD at least $ 193 million and force it to redirect resources, the HUD analysis found.
Families with members who are not lawful residents could be evicted after 18 months.
Bracing for the worst
Margarita and her children were ecstatic when they moved into their new apartment in the Marble Hill Houses in the Bronx.
"It was beautiful," Margarita said. "All freshly painted. Very spacious."
It was also spartan, but they decorated with used furniture from generous neighbors. Rent is about $ 660, which Margarita pays from her salary cleaning an apartment in Manhattan, but she said she broke her knee recently and that has diminished her productivity.
Like the rest of the city's public housing, their apartment has been subject to leaks that have led to cracks in the ceiling. But it's better than what they had before, Margarita said.
"What do I do? Pack my bags and leave? Or do I stay and fight for what I've lived for?"
Edgar Sandoval contributed reporting.

Art Market Snubs the Merely Rich

Texto completo: The art market has a 0.01 percent problem. That much was apparent on Wednesday at the contemporary auction at Christie's in New York, where a stainless steel rabbit by Jeff Koons sold for $ 91 million, setting a record price for work by a living artist. If it seems as if these sorts of records seem to be set much more often these days, it's because they are -- just last fall a David Hockney painting sold for $ 90.3 million, the previous record for a living artist.
Art collecting has always been an exclusive activity, but the world of contemporary art, in particular, has become dominated in recent years not by the 1 percent -- the millionaires -- but by the super-wealthy billionaires of the 0.01 percent.
This growing inequality threatens to upend how the market works. The small and midsize galleries that have long supported and nurtured unknown artists are finding it difficult to survive in the winner-take-all economy of contemporary art, meaning the next Andy Warhol or Donald Judd, who rose through the ranks of the gallery system, might never be discovered.
The art market reflects and magnifies trends in the larger economy. Recovering even faster than G.D.P., annual sales in the American market have more than doubled since the global financial crisis. According to a 2019 report published by Art Basel and UBS, in 2018 art sales reached nearly $ 30 billion, compared with just over $ 12 billion in 2009.
But these numbers mask a serious problem: A small number of large galleries and artists took in most of those sales. Art that cost more than $ 1 million accounted for 40 percent of the market but just 3 percent of transactions. The disparity is most severe in the contemporary market, where living artists' work is sold out of art galleries. In 2018, sales from the top 20 living artists accounted for 64 percent of the market. Bigger galleries, the top 5 percent in terms of turnover, accounted for more than 50 percent of sales. Sales at smaller galleries declined over the past few years.
Clare McAndrew, the author of the Basel/UBS report, explained that the affluent but not super-wealthy collectors -- the bankers at Goldman Sachs but not the partners -- who used to patronize the mid- and lower-tier galleries stopped buying art after the 2008 crash and did not come back after the economy bounced back. They can't afford top artists, so they would typically invest in emerging artists who are about to break through or well-established second-tier artists.
These collectors, Dr. McAndrew said, are put off by the sky-high prices at top galleries and auction houses. When they see a Hockney painting sell for $ 90 million, they assume the $ 50,000 work they can afford is not worth buying, especially if they can't flip it for a quick profit at auction.
The loss of this middle tier of collectors, along with rising rents and tougher standards for loans, means that many smaller galleries are going out of business. According to international data from Artfacts.net, in 2007 four galleries opened for every one that closed. That ratio began declining after the recession, and in 2017 more galleries closed than opened.
In the art world, small and midsize galleries serve an important function. Artists normally start at smaller galleries, where their work develops and they become known to collectors. Though galleries' motives are not always pure, they play an important role in creating the pipeline of new artists. They mentor their artists, supporting them financially, introducing them to collectors and sometimes steering their work.
Small and midsize galleries are able to nurture up-and-coming artists because their more established artists bring in sales. Relying on these few artists for most of their sales has always posed an enormous risk for smaller galleries, because the artists who find success often will no longer remain exclusive to a small gallery and seek out a bigger one. In this high-stakes market, it happens faster and more frequently: An emerging artist has an even greater incentive to move on and quickly to reap the benefits of the superstar economy. Art news is full of sought-after artists leaving their smaller galleries for the likes of David Zwirner or Gagosian.
It creates a vicious cycle where small and medium-size galleries get squeezed out. Without them, it is unclear where the new artists from future generations will come from. In a winner-take-all art market, the artists who thrive are those with the political savvy to court top galleries early in their career or brand themselves to become Instagram stars.
A market where extremely rich people pay too much for mediocre art and shut out the not-quite-as rich may not be the biggest issue in a wildly polarized economy. But art is the record of culture we leave for future generations, and it too is being warped by our unequal economy.

New York mayor de Blasio is 23rd Democrat to enter race for president

Texto completo: Bill de Blasio, the Democratic mayor of New York City, announced Thursday that he was running for president, seeking to show that his brand of urban progressive leadership can be a model for the rest of the nation.
It will be a steep challenge: He becomes the 23rd Democrat to enter the presidential race, and he does so against the counsel of many of his trusted advisers, and in the face of two centuries of history.
No sitting mayor has been elected to the presidency, and if de Blasio, 58, is to be the first, he must overcome daunting deficits in polls and fundraising.
His announcement, in a three-minute video titled “Working People First," comes after months of groundwork that has included visits to early presidential primary states, a fundraiser in Boston, and a circuslike news conference this week in the lobby of Trump Tower.
The video began with what has become the mayor's tagline this year, as he has flirted with declaring his candidacy. “There's plenty of money in this country, it's just in the wrong hands," he said, before highlighting his accomplishments as mayor and the ways that he has confronted President Trump over immigration and climate change.
“I'm a New Yorker, I've known Trump's a bully for a long time," he said.
De Blasio then appeared on ABC's “Good Morning America" with his wife, Chirlane McCray, seemingly intent on drawing the attention of Trump right out of the box, calling him “Con Don" — using Trump's tactic of coining demeaning nicknames for rivals.
It did not take long for Trump to respond on Twitter, calling de Blasio “the worst mayor" in the country.
New York Times
Trump pardoned two with ties to him and his family
President Trump on Wednesday night pardoned two prominent conservatives who had already completed their sentences.
Trump pardoned billionaire Conrad Black, who a year ago published a book called "Donald J. Trump: A president like no other." The book is more hagiography than biography. It defends Trump against charges that he is a racist, stating flatly that he is not. It hails his "very successful" foreign policy ventures. It credits his "unquenchable energy," "sheer entertainment talent," and "raw toughness." It misleadingly hails his 2016 election win by saying he won "more votes than any previous Republican candidate for president," without noting that this was mostly a function of population growth and that Trump lost the popular vote. He called Trump's win a "stunning rebuff" of the media.
The second pardon went to Patrick J. Nolan, the former Republican leader of the California state assembly. Nolan has been a prominent conservative voice for criminal justice reform since finishing his sentence and has served in prison ministry. But he, like Black, is close to the Trump family. Appearing at a White House ceremony celebrating the passage of criminal justice reform legislation, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner called Nolan "my friend," and Nolan called Kushner "just a superstar. I'm impressed with him so much."
Washington Post
Flynn described efforts to interfere with cooperation
WASHINGTON — Former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn told the special counsel's office that people connected to the Trump administration and Congress sought to influence his cooperation with the Russia investigation, and he provided a voicemail recording of one such communication, prosecutors said in a court filing made public Thursday.
Meanwhile, the judge in the case ordered that portions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that relate to Flynn be unredacted and made public by the end of the month.
Thursday's order from US District Judge Emmet Sullivan is the first time a judge is known to have directed the Justice Department to make public any portion of the report that the agency had kept secret. It could set up a conflict with Attorney General William Barr, whose team spent weeks blacking out from the report grand jury information, details of ongoing investigations, and other sensitive information.
Prosecutors revealed details about Flynn's communications in a court filing aimed at showing the extent of his cooperation with Mueller's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Flynn, a vital witness in the probe, is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts during the presidential transition period in 2016 with the-then Russian ambassador to the United States.
Prosecutors did not identify the people with whom Flynn was in touch nor did they describe the exact conversations.
But they said Flynn recounted multiple instances in which "he or his attorneys received communications from persons connected to the administration or Congress that could have affected both his willingness to cooperate and the completeness of that cooperation." Prosecutors say they were unaware of some of those instances, which took place before and after his guilty plea, until Flynn told them about them.

Trump says he wants talks with Iran, not a military showdown

Texto completo: BLAMING BOLTON: The White House disputes the narrative that national security adviser John Bolton is pushing President Trump into a military confrontation with Iran, while members of Congress still complain they haven’t seen the intelligence that sparked accelerated deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln and the dispatch of B-52 bombers to the region.
WE’VE SEEN THIS MOVIE: Democrats in Congress keep bringing up two historical precedents: the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began U.S. involvement in Vietnam in 1964 and the flawed intelligence cited as the casus belli for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
“It's just frightening how similar this roll-up to war with Iran is to what happened with the rollup to war in Iraq,” said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., on CNN yesterday. “Back then we had Dick Cheney and John Bolton pushing George W. Bush, a president who had no idea what fighting on the ground, what combat is actually like, into a disastrous war in Iraq. Today, we have John Bolton back in that same role, pushing Donald Trump, a president who dodged the draft, who lied about his feet to get out of serving in combat himself, into a war with an even more dangerous adversary.”
Moulton, a presidential candidate and former Marine infantry officer, noted the 120,000 troops in a Pentagon contingency plan is about the same number sent to Iraq in 2003. “And we're even operating under the same authorization for the use of military force that was fashioned back in 9/11 and used to get us into Iraq.”
DETERRENCE, NOT PROVOCATION: “It sounds like some of that is a little bit of the ‘blame America first’ crowd. I think us having a strong stand in the Middle East, frankly, makes armed conflict less likely,” countered Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. “So I think to actually go in with a position of strength, which I know is new in the last decade, to say, ‘If you touch us there's going to be a high cost,’ I think it actually makes military force much less likely.”
WHAT INTELLIGENCE?: Senior congressional leaders are scheduled to get a briefing later today from intelligence officials on the nature of the threats that alarmed the Pentagon.
CNN, NBC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times have all quoted sources saying that overhead imagery shows missiles loaded onto small boats in the Persian Gulf by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and orders from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sanction attacks on U.S. forces and diplomatic facilities by proxy forces.
Exactly what to make of the intelligence is “a subject of fierce debate among the White House, the Pentagon, the C.I.A. and America’s allies,” said the Times, while the Post quotes sources saying Trump is “frustrated with some of his top advisers, who he thinks could rush the United States into a military confrontation with Iran and shatter his long-standing pledge to withdraw from costly foreign wars.”
NO INFIGHTING: President Trump disputed the accounts of discord among his advisers and said he alone calls the shots.
“The Fake News Washington Post, and even more Fake News New York Times, are writing stories that there is infighting with respect to my strong policy in the Middle East. There is no infighting whatsoever,” wrote Trump in a pair of tweets. “Different opinions are expressed and I make a decisive and final decision — it is a very simple process. All sides, views, and policies are covered. I'm sure that Iran will want to talk soon.”
DEEP MISTRUST: Given the ambiguous nature of intelligence and its past misuse, many members of Congress remain deeply skeptical.
“I do not trust the president. He is a pathological liar on most everything,” Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., said on CNN yesterday, telling Brooke Baldwin he believes British Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika had it right, despite being rebuked by the United States for his Tuesday Pentagon briefing.
“What I heard is information that indicates that there is a threat, but it's the same threat that was there six months ago, a year ago, and, in fact, is less because ISIS is defeated,” said Garamendi. “Yes, there are concerns in Iraq. Do we need an aircraft carrier to deal with those? Do we need B-52 bombers? Or do we have the drumbeat of war here? Are we headed for a Gulf of Tonkin situation? I believe we may very well be in that situation.”
But in an interview that aired on CNN’s international network, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the intelligence is not being distorted. “I have to say, the intelligence that we've seen on the Senate Intelligence Committee does show a heightened threat throughout the region.”
“When I served in Iraq, one of the most deadly weapons that we faced were roadside bombs that were manufactured in Iran and then smuggled into Iraq. More than 500 American soldiers were killed at the hands of those Iranian bombs,” Cotton told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “And now, we have seen credible indications that Iran may be planning to strike either through its own forces or through its proxy forces in the region against the United States personnel or our allies in the region.”

HAPPENING TODAY: The National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service is holding two public hearings today on how to lessen the divide between the military and civilian society and how to get more young people with critical skills to consider military service.
The commission is an 11-member bipartisan body charged with taking a comprehensive look at military, national, and public service, in particular whether women should be subject to the draft. It will give its final recommendations to Congress, the president, and the public next March.
‘LIKE TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY’: The outrage was unbounded at yesterday's House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing, as the chairman of TransDigm was ripped for what the Pentagon's acquisition chief called "a disgraceful business model” that gouges taxpayers by reaping millions in excess profits.
"TransDigm's basic business model consists of identifying relatively small companies that make spare parts for the military — especially parts that no other companies make," said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., in his opening statement. "TransDigm then buys up these small companies, purchases the rights to produce their products, and then jacks up the prices. The Pentagon has to pay, knowing that they have a monopoly."
One whistleblower told committee staffers that overcharging the Pentagon was like “taking candy from a baby.”
A Department of Defense inspector general review found the excess profits ranged from 17 to more than 4,000%, or $16.1 million between January 2015 and January 2017.
The price gouging is not illegal, but that’s not the point, said Khanna in questioning Nicholas Howley, the company's executive chairman and founder.
"Your big risk is that Fox and Friends will cover this and you'll have a presidential tweet asking you to pay back the money," said Khanna. "The company is worth $1.2 billion, why not just pay back $16 million dollars?"
"We're still evaluating that," said Howley, whose company is the subject of a securities class-action lawsuit.
TRUMP TO S. KOREA: In an attempt to regain momentum in the stalled denuclearization talks with North Korea, President Trump will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Seoul next month before heading to Osaka, Japan, for the G20 summit.
“President Trump and President Moon will continue their close coordination on efforts to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” said a statement from the White House. “The two leaders will also discuss ways to strengthen the United States – Republic of Korea alliance and the friendship between our two peoples.”
The meeting comes after North Korea launched two missile tests this month, which Trump dismissed as inconsequential. “They’re short-range and I don’t consider that a breach of trust at all," Trump said in an interview with Politico. “These were short-range missiles and very standard stuff. Very standard.”
MENENDEZ SPARS OVER ARMS: Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., grew increasingly frustrated as he questioned Andrea Thompson, the State Department's point person on arms control, at yesterday’s Foreign Relations Committee hearing on arms control after the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
Menendez gasped “Oh my God” when Thompson refused to answer what she said was a hypothetical question about whether Russia could target the United States with hundreds or perhaps thousands of additional nuclear warheads.
“That is a great question for Russia, senator,” said Thompson.
“No, that is a great question for you,” Menendez shot back. “The disdain that the State Department shows when they come here, I do not appreciate.”
Menendez, along with senators Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Mark Warner, D-Va., has introduced legislation calling for a five-year extension of New START until 2026 unless the president determines Russia is in material breach of the treaty.
DEMS ATTEMPT TO CURB TRUMP’S EMERGENCY POWERS: In a tacit acknowledgment that President Trump acted within the law when he used an emergency declaration to take money from military construction accounts to fund border barrier improvements, a group of House Democrats wants to change the law.
Their bill would limit the Pentagon’s authority to repurpose funds that were designated for military construction by capping national emergency military construction at $250 million per emergency. The rules would also be changed to require additional congressional notification and a waiting period following the notification.
The bill is sponsored by Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., Adam Smith, D-Wash., and John Garamendi, D-Calif.
“The Administration’s willful abuse of power to unilaterally enact misguided policy like building a wall on the southern border is Exhibit A in this administration’s overreach,” said Gallego. “This bill will ensure that the armed services will no longer be a bottomless piggy bank for the President’s worst political impulses.”
MILITARY TO BUILD TENT CITIES: NBC News reports that the U.S. military is going to provide tents to house 7,500 migrants at six locations near the border.
“The tents will probably not be on military bases, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not the military, will be responsible for migrant detention and custodial support,” the report said, citing a statement from Pentagon spokesman Maj. Chris Mitchell. The Department of Homeland Security asked the Department of Defense to loan and erect the tents and “provide contracting support” to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “for which ICE will reimburse DOD,” Mitchell said.
NEW AF SEC: The Pentagon announced yesterday that Undersecretary of the Air Force Matthew Donovan will take over as acting secretary on June 1 when Heather Wilson resigns to become the president of the University of Texas at El Paso.
"In her two years as secretary, Heather defined the Air Force the nation needs and made incredible progress in implementing the strategy to get us there," Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said in a statement. "It is fitting that a key member of her leadership team will assume her role to keep the momentum going. Matt will do a fantastic job."

Texto completo: I.M. Pei, the versatile, globe-trotting architect who revived the Louvre with a giant glass pyramid and captured the spirit of rebellion at the multi-shaped Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, has died at age 102.
Pei's death was confirmed Thursday by Marc Diamond, a spokesman for the architect's New York firm, Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. One of Pei's sons, Li Chung Pei, told The New York Times his father had died overnight.
Pei's works ranged from the trapezoidal addition to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., to the chiseled towers of the National Center of Atmospheric Research that blend in with the reddish mountains in Boulder, Colorado.
His buildings added elegance to landscapes worldwide with their powerful geometric shapes and grand spaces. Among them are the striking steel and glass Bank of China skyscraper in Hong Kong and the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing.
His work spanned decades, starting in the late 1940s and continuing through the new millennium. Two of his last major projects, the Museum of Islamic Art, located on an artificial island just off the waterfront in Doha, Qatar, and the Macau Science Center, in China, opened in 2008 and 2009.
Pei painstakingly researched each project, studying its use and relating it to the environment. But he also was interested in architecture as art — and the effect he could create.
"At one level my goal is simply to give people pleasure in being in a space and walking around it," he said. "But I also think architecture can reach a level where it influences people to want to do something more with their lives. That is the challenge that I find most interesting."
Pei, who as a schoolboy in Shanghai was inspired by its building boom in the 1930s, immigrated to the United States and studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. He advanced from his early work of designing office buildings, low-income housing and mixed-used complexes to a worldwide collection of museums, municipal buildings and hotels.
He fell into a modernist style blending elegance and technology, creating crisp, precise buildings.
His big break was in 1964, when he was chosen over many prestigious architects, such as Louis Kahn and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, to design the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library in Boston.
At the time, Jacqueline Kennedy said all the candidates were excellent, "But Pei! He loves things to be beautiful." The two became friends.
A slight, unpretentious man, Pei developed a reputation as a skilled diplomat, persuading clients to spend the money for his grand-scale projects and working with a cast of engineers and developers.
Some of his designs were met with much controversy, such as the 71-foot (22-meter) faceted glass pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre museum in Paris. French President Francois Mitterrand, who personally selected Pei to oversee the decaying, overcrowded museum's renovation, endured a barrage of criticism when he unveiled the plan in 1984.
Many of the French vehemently opposed such a change to their symbol of their culture, once a medieval fortress and then a national palace. Some resented that Pei, a foreigner, was in charge.
But Mitterrand and his supporters prevailed and the pyramid was finished in 1989. It serves as the Louvre's entrance, and a staircase leads visitors down to a vast, light-drenched lobby featuring ticket windows, shops, restaurants, an auditorium and escalators to other parts of the vast museum.
"All through the centuries, the Louvre has undergone violent change," Pei said. "The time had to be right. I was confident because this was the right time."
Another building designed by Pei's firm — the John Hancock Tower in Boston — had a questionable future in the early 1970s when dozens of windows cracked and popped out, sending glass crashing to the sidewalks, during the time the building was under construction.
A flurry of lawsuits followed among the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., the glass manufacturer, and Pei's firm. A settlement was reached in 1981.
No challenge seemed to be too great for Pei, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which sits on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Pei, who admitted he was just catching up with the Beatles, researched the roots of rock 'n' roll and came up with an array of contrasting shapes for the museum. He topped it off with a transparent tent-like structure, which was "open — like the music," he said.
In 1988, President Reagan honored him with a National Medal of Arts. He also won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize, 1983, and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal, 1979. President George H.W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992.
Pei officially retired in 1990 but continued to work on projects. Two of his sons, Li Chung Pei and Chien Chung Pei, former members of their father's firm, formed Pei Partnership Architects in 1992. Their father's firm, previously I.M. Pei and Partners, was renamed Pei Cobb Freed & Partners.
The museum in Qatar that opened in 2008 was inspired by Islamic architectural history, especially the 9th century mosque of Ahmed ibn Tulun in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. It was established by the tiny, oil-rich nation to compete with rival Persian Gulf countries for international attention and investment.
Ieoh Ming Pei was born April 26, 1917, in Canton, China, the son of a banker. He later said, "I did not know what architecture really was in China. At that time, there was no difference between an architect, a construction man, or an engineer."
Pei came to the United States in 1935 with plans to study architecture, then return to practice in China. However, World War II and the revolution in China prevented him from coming back.
During the war, Pei worked for the National Defense Research Committee. As an "expert" in Japanese construction, his job was to determine the best way to burn down Japanese towns. "It was awful," he later said.
In 1948, New York City real estate developer William Zeckendorf hired Pei as his director of architecture. During this period, Pei worked on many large urban projects and gained experience in areas of building development, economics and construction.
Some of his early successes included the Mile High Center office building in Denver, the Kips Bay Plaza Apartments in Manhattan, and the Society Hill apartment complex in Philadelphia.
Pei established his own architectural firm in 1955, a year after he became a U.S. citizen. He remained based in New York City. Among the firm's accomplishments are the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
Pei's wife, Eileen, who he married in 1942, died in 2014. A son, T'ing Chung, died in 2003. Besides sons Chien Chung Pei and Li Chung Pei, he is survived by a daughter, Liane.

Texto completo: Cuatro activistas que han protagonizado protestas dentro de la embajada venezolana en Washington durante semanas han sido arrestados por la policía , según dijo una activista el jueves.
El lunes por la noche, las autoridades notificaron a los actividades que debían salir de la embajada por allanamiento de propiedad privada. Durante más de un mes la embajada fue el escenario de una disputa entre los activistas a favor del chavismo, dentro de la embajada, y un grupo de expatriados venezolanos fuera de las instalaciones. Cuando se dio la orden de evacuación, se reportó que tres activistas habían desalojado, pero otros cuatro permanecían ocupándola.
Medea Benjamín, cofundadora de la organización Code Pink , dijo a la agencia de noticias The Associated Press que la policía entró a la sede diplomática por la mañana para arrestar a los activistas que permanecían en ella.
Un portavoz del Departamento de Estado, que pidió no ser identificado, dijo que agentes de seguridad “arrestaron y desalojaron a personas que habían ingresado ilegalmente”.
A eso del mediodía, varias patrullas policiales abandonaban la zona. En un video colocado en redes sociales por Code Pink se ve a una de las activistas, Adrienne Pine, en el asiento trasero de una de las patrullas, afirmando que “esta es una orden ilegal”. Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, abogada de los activistas, dijo que trataba de averiguar dónde se encontraban y cuáles serían los cargos penales en su contra.
Los activistas consideran que Nicolás Maduro es el presidente legítimo de Venezuela. Pero Estados Unidos y medio centenar de países sostienen que la reelección reciente de Maduro fue fraudulenta y respaldan al presidente interino, Juan Guaidó. Code Pink se identifica como un gripo liderado por mujeres que apoya iniciativas por los derechos humanos y la paz. La ONU ha documentado graves violaciones de los derechos humanos bajo el régimen de Maduro, incluyendo “homicidios, el uso excesivo de la fuerza en contra de manifestantes, detenciones arbitrarias, malos tratos y tortura”.
El embajador designado por Guaidó, Carlos Vecchio, habia pedido ayuda a las autoridades estadounidenses para liberar la sede, que había estado vacía desde que al personal diplomático de Maaduro se le venciera la visa en abril, según reportes. El gobierno interino de Guaidó ya había tomado el control de dos sedes militares en Washington D.C. y el consulado venezolano en Nueva York.
Vecchio anunció que el jueves en la noche irá a la embajada y se dirigirá a los venezolanos que se han aglomerado en las cercanías.
Guaidó agradeció el jueves a la diáspora venezolana por “ejercer soberanía” y “recuperar nuestra embajada en Washington”, y dijo, en un breve mensaje de su cuenta de Twitter, que se inicia el “proceso de recuperación” de las sedes diplomáticas venezolanas en el mundo. “Estaremos en todos los planos de lucha por la democracia”, agregó.
Inicialmente, al menos 30 activistas entraron a la embajada, pero la cifra se redujo gradualmente. Los activistas dormían dentro de la embajada y decían que eran invitados del régimen de Nicolás Maduro y su misión era oponerse a una “intervención militar estadounidense” en Venezuela , reportó el New York Times.
La sede diplomática está sin electricidad desde la semana pasada.
El senador republicano por la Florida Marco Rubio comparó la falta de electricidad con los constantes recortes de luz que sufren los venezolanos en su día a día.
“Ahora saben lo que es la vida de las personas en Venezyela bajo Maduro”, tuiteó Rubio.

Texto completo: As Congress becomes more interested in protecting your personal data online, the companies that harvest and exploit your information increase their professions of dedication to your privacy and new ways to protect it.
But TechMan finds it hard to believe that these tech giants will voluntarily curtail the practices that allow them to rake in billions in revenue selling targeted advertising.
The two major players in the data game, Facebook and Google, have recently restated their dedication to users' privacy.
Mark Zuckerberg delivered the message at Facebook's developer conference. "The future is private," he said, adding that Facebook will focus on more intimate communications. In a Washington Post op-ed, he highlighted the need for federal privacy rules.
Google's chief Sundar Pichai said at the company's annual conference for developers, "We think privacy is for everyone. We want to do more to stay ahead of constantly evolving user expectations." In a New York Times op-ed, he also highlighted the need for federal privacy rules.
It may seem odd that these companies would encourage government regulation of their businesses, something most firms look on with the fondness of a snakebite.
But Europe recently passed a very tough privacy law, and in this country, California has formulated a strict law. Maybe the data giants think it would be better to have a consistent federal law - particularly if they could use their abundant lobbying budgets to obtain a say in how the law is written. Ya think?
Jamie Condliffe, writing in The New York Times said, "What Google and Facebook are trying to do, though, is reshape the privacy narrative. You may think privacy means keeping hold of your data; they want privacy to mean they don't hand data to others."
Google, according to the live stream from its developer' conference, will let users browse YouTube and Google Maps in "incognito mode," will allow auto-deletion of Google history after a specified time, and will make it easier to find out what the company knows about you.
It also emphasized that more powerful phones will bring along greater privacy since information can be processed "locally" (on the device) and will not have to be sent to company servers for processing - and storage.
Mr. Pichar, in his keynote, emphasized how artificial intelligence-aided processing could make personal assistants (think Hey Google) more "helpful" to consumers. In fact, "helpful" was a theme. "We are moving from a company that helps you find answers to a company that helps you get things done," the Google CEO said.
Mr. Pichar said when a user asks Google Assistant to book a car, Duplex (the AI-enhanced assistant) will pull up the reservation page and automatically start filling out the user's personal information. It navigates through the site and taps into tools like Gmail and Calendar for relevant information like travel dates.
What he did not say is that to do these things, Google must have access to all your personal information.
So in the future, tech may be more "helpful," but it may also be more invasive.

Texto completo: President Trump and some of his top aides exploded in anger over portrayals this week that key immigration and Middle East peace plans are in disarray.
Trump tweeted his anger today at the New York Times and the Washington Post which have suggested that rivals in the administration are fighting over Iran policy.
“The Fake News Washington Post, and even more Fake News New York Times, are writing stories that there is infighting with respect to my strong policy in the Middle East. There is no infighting whatsoever,” Trump said in one of two tweets.
Tweet
In his second, he continued, “....Different opinions are expressed and I make a decisive and final decision - it is a very simple process. All sides, views, and policies are covered. I’m sure that Iran will want to talk soon.”
Such fighting is typical on major policy debates. In Trump’s White House, such infighting is often portrayed as chaos.
In other past administrations, like those of former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the media has praised so-called “team of rivals” and said the infighting creates better policy. But in Trump's, and especially when top aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner is involved, as he is on immigration and Middle East policy development, internal disagreements are seen as disarray.
Tweet
Kushner has been rapped over his efforts to produce a reform plan for legal immigration in parallel with fellow top aide Stephen Miller’s focus on illegal immigration. Trump plans to announce a new immigration policy on Thursday.
For example, Kushner on Tuesday accompanied Miller to Capitol Hill to brief GOP senators on his efforts and the Post called it a mess.
It said that Miller had to bail Kushner out when he couldn’t answer questions and that Miller interrupted Kushner.
An aide, Avi Berkowitz, blasted the coverage as “nonsense” in a tweet. He wrote, “This is nonsense. Jared had the whole team present together to show the Republican senators the WH is unified on the proposal. This has been a full team effort.”
Insiders said that Miller did not “interrupt” Kushner and that Kushner invited Miller to join him to provided fuller context to the immigration plan. They have described the two as willing partners on fixing immigration policy.
They also criticized negative comments from anonymous sources and instead pointed to the on-the-record comment praising Kushner from Trump critic Sen. Mitt Romney who said, “I thought it was a very effective presentation ... it would have passed with flying colors among Republicans. But we need to get some Democrats, too.”

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network’s founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
“I don’t think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,” Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley’s other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook’s future took on new resonance last week as one of the company’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, “made a very convincing case” that no company “should have the type of power that… these tech companies have.”
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn’t endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting “a spectrum” of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That’s attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg’s vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
“Here in the Bay Area, we’ve been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete’s going to do it,” said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. “Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.”
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg’s account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests) — if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad’s original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like “a curiosity,” and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he’s used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor’s office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 — attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions — he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg’s car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he’s also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.
“What they’ve done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,” marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who’s been to the city multiple times at the mayor’s invitation. “You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you’re in San Francisco.”
Rogers, who’s hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be “literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable” about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called “political theater where very little actually got achieved.”
“What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing — which is incredibly dangerous,” Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders “need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.”
“This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips,” he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that “a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they’ve increasingly turned into Goliath.” But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions “perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,” and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley’s executives have “become very introspective” and are “really reflecting on what they wrought.”
That more diplomatic approach — and Buttigieg’s avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook — “has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,” said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who’s hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg’s refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
“He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn’t want to offend anyone powerful,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. “Take a position.”
------------
WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Support it:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else… That’s why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.”
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: “Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.”
On the fence:
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Breaking up Facebook is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told the Associated Press, saying Warren “has a very strong case to be made.”
Sen. Kamala Harris: “We have to seriously take a look at that… [Facebook] is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s got to stop.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders: “We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives — including our government. It’s time to take that power back.”
Voiced concerns about it:
Sen. Cory Booker: “I don’t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It’s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, ‘I’m going to break up you guys.’”
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke: “I’m not sure if having five more Facebooks — if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies — makes as much sense as regulating them.”

Texto completo: Michael Mueckenhausen, who owned the German street food eatery The Doner in Cape Coral, had a revelation. On a trip to California last fall, he discovered the fast casual clean-eating protein/carbohydrate/vegetable bowl craze, and when he returned to Southwest Florida he up-ended everything.
"He came back from vacation and our entire store changed," said Jennifer Haenschen, general manager of Eat Smart in Cape Coral, which replaced The Doner last November.
While The Doner focused on Turkish-inspired doner kebabs, which are hugely popular in Germany, Eat Smart's menu focuses on customizable bowls. Diners move through a salad bar-style section where a variety of fresh vegetables are on display, choosing what they like. Then they select an uncooked protein and choose a starch plus a sauce. The entire bowl is handed over to an Eat Smart chef, who prepares the dish in a wok. Et Voila — instant, healthy stir fry.
"From day one, it's been amazing," Haenschen said. "We have a lot of people that work here in the area that come in for a quick lunch. It's like fast food but it's really healthy, and there are a million options."
The protein selections include chicken, pork, beef, bacon, scallops, shrimp and tofu; the starches are wheat and white pastas, eggs noodles, lo mein, white and brown rice, cauliflower rice and quinoa; and there are a dozen sauces including teriyaki, plum sauce, barbecue and curry.
Some customers even get creative and mix the sauces together.
"We have a lot of gluten-free options, or if customers tell us they have allergies we can accommodate that," Haenschen said.
"We have options for everybody, no matter if you're a vegetarian or you just want to eat meat. And everything gets cut fresh every single day."
The bowls are stir-fried using vegetable oil, but people can request their dishes be steamed in vegetable or beef broth if they prefer. Toppings for the bowls include chia and sesame seeds and cashews.
Each bowl costs $10.50. The only extra charges are $2.50 for quinoa and $2.50 for a an optional third protein (each regular bowl comes with two choices of protein).
"You can make your bowl as full as you want. Everything in it is included," Haenschen said.
Eat Smart is an original concept and not a chain — yet. A second location is scheduled to open in Fort Myers off College Parkway in the next six months, though there are no plans for The Doner to make a reappearance.
"The Doner was more for the Germans that came here," Haenschen said. "This is something for people who actually live here and work here. It was a crazy idea but a great idea. The people here love it."

Texto completo: NEW YORK – CBS executives are defending last week's decision to renew drama "Bull," which came months after allegations surfaced about misconduct charges against star Michael Weatherly.
"We felt comfortable bringing "Bull" back on the air," CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said Wednesday.
Its fourth-season pickup came weeks after Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television, a co-producer of "Bull," quietly pulled out in protest.
By ratings standards, the renewal was a slam dunk: The legal drama features a well-known star, Michael Weatherly, who spent 13 seasons on the network's top drama "NCIS" before heading off into his own series in 2016.
But last year, news broke that Weatherly had made "disgusting" comments to "Bull" guest star Eliza in 2017. In a December New York Times report, the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" alumna said she felt "violated" by his remarks. She provided video proof and CBS quietly paid her off.
Dushku said that instead of making her a series regular as planned, producer Glenn Gordon Caron fired her out of retaliation for reporting the incident. CBS paid her a $9. 5 million settlement, equivalent to what should would have made as a series regular on a five-year contract. But in exchange, she said she was forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
CBS Investigation: Network paid Eliza Dushku $9. 5M after 'Bull' star Michael Weatherly's sexual comments
Dushku's payout was uncovered during the network-wide investigation that led to the ouster of CBS chairman-CEO Leslie Moonves over more serious sexual allegations.
"What happened was something a lot of us didn’t know about," Kahl insisted at a press briefing Wednesday to outline the network's fall schedule. "We found out when you found out. When it came time to look at (a renewal), we wanted to look at it with a fresh lens. First and foremost, we found Michael made a mistake with his comments. He owned his mistake, he was remorseful and he apologized again when (the story) came out. "
Kahl said Weatherly "agreed to training, coaching, whatever was necessary to do a good job on the set," and said CBS brass was swayed by the "totality" of his 16-year tenure at the network and said they have "never had a complaint before or after. He was upset by this and wants to make it better. I believe Michael was honest in his remorse and believe people can make a mistake and recover from that. "
In its wake, Kahl said CBS has installed "a team of HR professionals visiting sets on a regular basis; they will be very visible and very available if anybody has any complaint or concern. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Donald Trump's image as a powerful real estate tycoon helped carry him to the White House in 2016 and as he begins to campaign for re-election, a majority of Americans still believe he is a successful businessman, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll.
Until they learn about his reported $1. 17 billion in losses between 1985 and 1994, that is.
The poll found that when asked, "Generally speaking, do you think President Donald Trump has been successful or unsuccessful in business?" 54% of registered voters said he had been at least somewhat successful. Another 36% said he had been unsuccessful and 10% weren't sure.
But the numbers shifted when the respondents were told about a May 7 article in which The New York Times detailed how Trump claimed more than $1 billion in losses during the years he rose to national fame as Manhattan mogul whose name became synonymous with affluence and excess. In light of that information, voters were split on the question of whether he had been successful in business, with 43% saying he had and 42% sayign he had not.
Report: Trump avoided paying taxes for 8 years after more than $1 billion loss over a decade
More: Donald Trump cites 'write offs' and 'depreciation' for $1 billion in business losses
When asked if they thought Trump's business experience had been an asset during his time in office, 48% said it had helped while 33% said it hurt and 11% said it didn't make a difference.
On the other hand, a majority of thought his lack of political experience has been a liability. A 59% majority said his lack of experience hurt in terms of how he "had handled his responsibilities as president," while only 21% said it helped and 11% didn't think it mattered.
The Times report was based on tax information obtained from 10 years of an annual form Trump filed with the IRS. But the paper did not get a look at Trump's full tax returns from those years.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump declined to make his tax returns public, as most presidential nominees have done in recent decades. He explained that he could not share them because he was under audit but vowed to do so as soon as the audit was complete.
Trump's critics did not accept that explanation, pointing out that the IRS has no policy that a person can't share their tax returns when they are being audited. Since winning a majority in the 2018 midterm elections, House Democrats have made obtaining copies of Trump's returns a priority and last week House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal issued a subpoena for six years of the president's federal tax filings.

Forty-nine percent of registered voters said they support Democrats' effort to obtain the returns and 36% said they are against it.
Overall, the poll found Trump's job approval rating at 41%, with 56% saying they disapprove of the job he's done in office.
If the 2020 election were held today, 27% of registered voters said they would "definitely" vote to re-elect Trump and 10% said they would "probably" vote for him. But 48% said they would "definitely" vote for someone else and other 7% said they probably would.
As with other recent surveys, the Politico/Morning Consult poll found a strikingly high level of voter enthusiasm heading into the election. Seventy percent said they were "absolutely certain to vote" in their primary or caucus, while another 14% said they were "very likely" and 10% said they were "about 50-50. "
The poll was conducted from May 10-12 from 1,995 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 2%.

Texto completo: Gersson Rosas is expanding the Timberwolves’ head coaching search to outside candidates, a source confirmed to the Pioneer Press on Tuesday.
ESPN reported Tuesday that Minnesota will interview Portland assistant David Vanterpool and Miami assistant Juwan Howard. The New York Times reported the team will interview New Orleans assistant Chris Finch, and The Athletic reported the Wolves will interview Milwaukee Bucks assistant Darvin Ham.
The fact that Rosas is interviewing candidates other than interim head coach Ryan Saunders is noteworthy. Saunders was well-regarded by his players for his performance and approach down the stretch last season as he led an injury-depleted roster after being promoted when Tom Thibodeau was fired.
Players, to a man, supported Saunders staying on as the full-time coach moving forward. Saunders, son of former late Timberwolves coach and president of basketball operations Flip Saunders, also is a favorite of team owner Glen Taylor.
At Rosas’ introductory press conference last week, team CEO Ethan Casson said Saunders did “an incredible job, not just with the time in which he took over the team.”
Saunders is still in consideration for the full-time position, but Rosas has identified an intriguing list of candidates, and at least getting a look at other people falls in line with the thought that Rosas will indeed challenge everything in the Wolves’ organization.
Howard, an assistant coach in Miami since 2013, has been part of numerous head coaching searches of late. He was reportedly a candidate for the Lakers’ coaching position.
Finch worked for years in Houston with Rosas, helping instill the Rockets’ uber-efficient offensive system, and was most recently an assistant in New Orleans.
Ham and Vanterpool each serve as pivotal parts of staffs that have led their respective teams to this year’s conference finals.
Rosas has said he wants the head coach to be part of a collaborative effort.
“A little like a football model,” Rosas said. “The head coach who runs the program, an offensive coordinator, a defensive coordinator, a player development coordinator, a game plans coordinator. That’s going to be our vision.”
In Houston, while Mike D’Antoni is an offensive guru, associate coach Jeff Bzdelik is largely credited with the Rockets’ defensive success.
“We feel like there’s a lot of value in that, but we want to put people at high-end value in terms of talent, to allow them to have success here and so we can have success in the future,” Rosas said.

House Intelligence Committee investigating if Trump lawyers were involved in Michael Cohen's false statements

Texto completo: In letters sent to lawyers representing President Trump's family, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., revealed he is investigating if those attorneys were involved in the false statements made by former attorney Michael Cohen about the Trump Tower Moscow project.
“Among other things, it appears that your clients may have reviewed, shaped and edited the false statement that Cohen submitted to the committee, including causing the omission of material facts," the New York Times reported. The letters were sent in March asking for documents.
"In addition, certain of your clients may have engaged in discussions about potential pardons in an effort to deter one or more witnesses from cooperating with authorized investigations," he said.
The attorneys had rejected the request, citing attorney-client privilege, with Schiff saying he is prepared to issue subpoenas.
"Material in the Committee's possession, as well as Michael Cohen's Committee testimony and admissions to the Special Counsel's Office, raise serious, unresolved concerns about the obstruction of our Committee's investigation that we would be negligent not to pursue," Schiff said in a statement to CNN.
"If any individual is allowed to lie to our committee or encourage others to do so, hide behind inapplicable privileges, or otherwise fail to provide anything less than full cooperation, other witnesses will be emboldened to similarly obstruct, both now and in the future," he said.
Cohen went to federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., in early May to start his three-year sentence for bank fraud, lying to Congress, and illegal campaign contributions.

Relax, the New York Times' Iran report doesn't mean war

Texto completo: Don't assume a looming war based on the New York Times' report on military briefings to the White House on Iran.
Those briefings almost certainly represent standing contingency plans. Individually known as an operation plan or OPLAN, these plans are developed for potential security issues around the world. Refined as needed or directed, each OPLAN involves Pentagon war-planners and their area combatant command equivalents. The plans provide senior national security officials with understanding of how the Pentagon could deploy U.S. military forces during a crisis.
Consider, for example, if an Islamist coup somehow occurred in Pakistan or if China seized a Japanese island or if Iran fired a ballistic missile at a U.S. military base. In each case, the U.S. would need to act quickly. The OPLAN structure allows for that efficiency of effect: It provides a baseline of planning so that no one has to start from scratch in the event of a crisis.
The New York Times report indicates as much. Noting that the White House was briefed on a plan involving 120,000 U.S. forces being deployed to the Middle East, the Times thus confirmed that this wasn't an invasion plan. After all, any invasion plan for Iran would necessarily require far greater numbers. It would also require a vast military logistics train.
So, what are we looking at in the 120,000-person plan?
It's probably a theater contingency plan for Iran — a plan to provide the Pentagon's regional Central Command with a force-level boost to deter and defeat Iranian external hostile action in the region. However, there is no evidence the plan has been activated.
On the contrary, President Trump continues to offer Iran an off-ramp.

Harvard Lampoon apologizes following condemnation of Anne Frank imagery as anti-Semitic, misogynistic

Texto completo: The Harvard Lampoon, the student-run humor magazine at the Ivy League university, has apologized after imagery featured in the latest issue was condemned as anti-Semitic and misogynistic.
A recent edition included an image of Anne Frank's face placed atop the body of a bikini-clad woman. Above was the text, “Gone Before Her Time: Virtual Aging Technology Shows Us What Anne Frank Would Have Looked Like if She Hadn't Died." Below the image: “Add this to your list of reasons the Holocaust sucked."
“They crossed the line from humor into anti-Semitism," said Robert Trestan, the director of Anti-Defamation League's New England regional office, during a Tuesday phone interview.
Frank's diary is considered to be one of the most powerful Holocaust memoirs. Trestan said the Lampoon's imagery denigrates her memory.
“They're using humor as an excuse to trivialize the Holocaust, and it's deeply offensive," he said.
In addition to being anti-Semitic, the image used by the Lampoon is also misogynistic, Trestan said.
“They're creating a sexualized image of someone who died as a child in a concentration camp," he said.
In a joint Tuesday statement, the Lampoon's two copresidents and issue editor apologized “for our negligence in allowing this piece to be created for and printed in our latest issue."
“We are sorry for any harm we have caused," the statement said.
“Furthermore, we want to both affirm and emphasize that the Lampoon condemns any and all forms of anti-Semitism."
The statement continued, “Moving forward, we will approach the content of our magazine with greater care. We realize that our publishing process lacks sufficient editorial oversight, so we are going to restructure our review process for issues to prevent the publication of content like this."
The Lampoon “has heard from many whom we hurt with content from the latest issue of our magazine," according to the statement.
“We realize the extent of offense we have inflicted and understand that we must take responsibility for our actions," it read.
In a letter to the editors of the Lampoon, Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, the executive director and chaplain for Harvard Hillel, said that by producing and spreading such an imagery, those behind the publication “effectively join yourselves to the obscenity of the Nazis themselves and carry it forward."
“Your depiction of Anne Frank's face grafted to pinup imagery goes far beyond the distastefulness and provocativeness you obviously intend," he wrote. “It is the sexual violation of a child – one who, in life, was subjected to the most hideous of crimes."
Since its founding in 1876, the Lampoon has attracted and nurtured an array of literary and comedic talent, including George Santayana, John Updike, and George Plimpton; late night host Conan O'Brien; National Lampoon cofounders Henry Beard and Doug Kenney, of “Animal House" fame; Spy magazine cofounder Kurt Andersen; humorist Patricia Marx, the first woman elected to the Lampoon; and writer-producer Lisa Henson, its first female president, who now oversees the Jim Henson Co.
Messages left with Harvard University were not immediately returned on Tuesday.
The Lampoon confirmed the latest issue was published and distributed to dorms on the Cambridge campus over the weekend.
Of the latest issue, Harvard student Jacob Schwartz, a 22-year-old junior from San Antonio, said, “In terms of Jewish students, this was pretty rattling for us to see."
He added, “We want to use this as a call for people going forward to gather knowledge of what the Holocaust is and overcome the ignorance that exists within the greater community, especially during a time when we've seen anti-Semitism on the rise for the last three years."
The Anti-Defamation League's annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents recorded a total of 1,879 attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions across the country in 2018, the third-highest number of incidents in a year since the organization started tracking such data in the 1970s.
The Lampoon controversy comes weeks after The New York Times apologized for a cartoon that was criticized for being anti-Semitic. The cartoon, which was featured in the opinion section of the paper's international edition, depicted a blind President Trump, wearing a skullcap, being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was drawn as a dog on a leash with a Star of David collar.

N.Y.U. to Investigate Education School Namesake for Harassment Claims

Texto completo: N.Y.U. said on Monday that it had hired a prominent law firm to investigate whether the namesake of its school of education, Michael H. Steinhardt, had engaged in inappropriate conduct with students, faculty or staff.
The review will be headed by Joan McPhee, a lawyer who last year helped lead an investigation of Lawrence G. Nassar, a U.S.A. Gymnastics team doctor who last year was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually abusing young women. Ms. McPhee was hired by N.Y.U. as part of its response to a New York Times/ProPublica article that alleged a pattern of crude and demeaning sexual comments by Mr. Steinhardt toward women over decades.
Mr. Steinhardt, a hedge fund pioneer and philanthropist, denied many of the specifics of the allegations, saying that his behavior was always meant in jest, and never involved physical contact.
The N.Y.U. Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, the largest graduate school at the university, got its name after Mr. Steinhardt and his wife, Judy, donated $ 10 million to the school in 2001. It was the largest gift the graduate school had ever received.
The allegations, which were published in March, prompted some students to ask for the school to be renamed. The school's student body is predominantly women.
"As somebody who is graduating, I don't want to accept a diploma with this man's name on it," Beena Rachel Jacob, a 23-year-old senior in the education studies program at N.Y.U. Steinhardt, said on Monday.
After the article was published, the dean of N.Y.U. Steinhardt, Dominic Brewer, told the school's community in a statement that while the Steinhardts had been generous, "the kind of remarks and behavior recounted in the news story are out-of-step with our school's values and how we expect people to conduct themselves in this day and age."
The university, he wrote, would undertake a review of Mr. Steinhardt's interactions with N.Y.U. students, faculty and staff. Monday's announcement, which came as the academic year was ending, was the first update about the situation the school had provided.
"The only new development is the identity of the law firm that is handling the previously-announced investigation," said a lawyer for Mr. Steinhardt, Tom Clare. The firm set up a phone number and email address where people could give an account of improper behavior. Mr. Clare called that step "routine" for this kind of investigation.
Carol Anne Spreen, an associate professor of international education at Steinhardt, said that the university's response should not just depend on what may have happened on its campus.
"I know students are really upset," Ms. Spreen said. "It's about how the university gets represented out in the public. It's not just about their experiences with him."
In the article, six women said in interviews, and one said in a lawsuit, that Mr. Steinhardt asked them to have sex with him, or made sexual requests of them, while they were relying on or seeking his support. He also regularly made comments to women about their bodies and their fertility, according to the seven women and 16 other people who said they were present when Mr. Steinhardt made such comments. None of the incidents described by the women were alleged to have occurred at N.Y.U.
"As I have said before, I deeply regret cavalierly making comments in professional settings that were boorish, disrespectful and just plain dumb," Mr. Steinhardt said in a statement in response to the article.
Ms. McPhee, formerly a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and now a partner at Ropes & Gray, did not respond to a request for comment. She was one of two lawyers commissioned by the United States Olympic Committee who led a 10-month investigation into Dr. Nassar.
Several students at N.Y.U. Steinhardt said in interviews on Monday that many of their peers were appalled after hearing allegations against the school's namesake. But efforts to hold protests or write petitions failed to gain traction, the college newspaper, the Washington Square News, reported in early April.
After the couple's initial donation in 2001, Mr. Steinhardt and his wife gave $ 20 million to N.Y.U. between 2006 and 2014 to support programs and fund scholarships. Ms. Steinhardt is among the university's 61 voting board of trustee members.
Morin Mikaya, a 24-year-old who is studying for a master's degree in drama therapy, said Monday that she was encouraged by the call for people to report potential incidents of misconduct.
"I always think that these things should be done quicker," she said. "That's the thing with big universities. Everything moves slowly. There's a lot of bureaucracy. But this is a good thing."
At least one school has already responded to the allegations against Mr. Steinhardt.
Abraham Foxman, the former longtime head of the Anti-Defamation League, was asked not to give a planned graduation speech this year at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the nation's main Reform Jewish seminary, because of his remarks in support of Mr. Steinhardt in the Times/ProPublica article.
The seminary had asked Mr. Foxman for a public clarification of his remarks, "which appeared to dismiss the seriousness of sexual harassment and failed to condemn the behavior described," the college said in a statement. When Mr. Foxman declined to provide one, his invitation, which included an honorary degree, was rescinded. Mr. Foxman was traveling Monday and could not be reached for comment.
One of the women who had alleged inappropriate remarks by Mr. Steinhardt was a rabbi who had graduated from and taught at the seminary. Andrew Rehfeld, the seminary's president, said on Monday that he was proud of his students and alumni for voicing their concerns. "It is really a reflection of our values about treating every human being with dignity and respect," he said.
Edgar Sandoval contributed reporting.
This article was co-published with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha hecho, en varias ocasiones, un nexo entre la inmigración y la delincuencia, pero hay varias investigaciones que han demostrado que no existe una conexión real entre un fenómeno y otro en los Estados Unidos.
Incluso, no hay datos que permitan concluir que la inmigración de indocumentados esté relacionado con el incremento de delitos, como lo demuestra un análisis en conjunto entre The Marshall Project y The Upshot, de The New York Times.
El reporte reconoce que es complicado obtener datos sobre los indocumentados, quienes han sido objeto de pocos estudios, incluidos los relacionados con el crimen, pero señala que el Pew Research Center publicó estimaciones de poblaciones indocumentadas clasificadas por área metropolitana, que el Proyecto Marshall ha comparado con las tasas de delincuencia locales publicadas por FBI por primera vez.
Esto dio la oportunidad de un análisis más amplio de cómo la inmigración de indocumentados podría haber afectado los índices de delincuencia desde 2007.
“La mayoría de los tipos de delitos tenían una línea de tendencia casi plana, lo que indica que los cambios en las poblaciones de indocumentados tuvieron poco o ningún efecto sobre el delito en las diversas áreas metropolitanas que se examinaron”, indican las conclusiones publicadas por el Times. “El asesinato fue el único tipo de crimen que pareció mostrar un aumento, pero la diferencia fue pequeña e incierta (efectivamente cero)”.
Indica que una mayoría de las áreas registraron disminuciones tanto en delitos violentos como en aquellos que afectan contra la propiedad entre 2007 y 2016.
Nuevamente, esa disminución no tiene relación alguna sobre el aumento o decremento de la población de inmigrantes indocumentados.
El reporte señala que los indocumentados se arriesgan poco a ser detenidos, ya que “ser arrestados por cualquier motivo significaría enfrentar una eventual deportación y, para algunos, regresar a cualquier peligro o privación que hayan tratado de escapar en su país”.
Es incierto el número de indocumentados que hay en el país, por lo que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) y otras instituciones utilizan el método residual, es decir, del último estimado realizan uno nuevo. Actualmente es de 10.7 millones de indocumentados.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren wants to offer down-payment assistance to home buyers in formerly "red-lined" neighborhoods where the federal government once denied access to mortgages. Cory Booker would like to create "baby bonds" that would be worth more to children in poorer families, helping them one day to buy houses or other assets.
Both presidential candidates say their proposals would aid in narrowing the enduring Black-white wealth gap in America. But neither policy attempts to do that in the most direct way possible - by steering benefits to African Americans.
Their ideas, along with several others that scholars advocate, are facing a tricky problem today. There's growing momentum on the left to address the racial wealth gap. But the prospects for race-based policies before the Supreme Court are unpromising, and that's unlikely to change with five conservative justices.
"The court is functionally not now going to be an ally in anything here, so you do have to be careful," said Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of Georgia who has written about the racial wealth gap.
The court is unlikely to uphold baby bonds or housing programs explicitly for African Americans, even to remedy disparities created when many government benefits were explicitly for whites. Affirmative action and government contracting programs have similarly struggled to meet or skirt the court's strict scrutiny for applying benefits by race.
Proponents concerned about the wealth gap instead must come up with policies that have the effect of disproportionately building wealth for African Americans, without singling them out.
"There are ways that you can craft legislation that essentially gets at this effect," Baradaran said. "Look at how much legislation we have that gets at the opposite effect."
Policies like the mortgage interest deduction, for example, disproportionately benefit white families, who are more likely to own homes. So do tax advantages for the rich, who are more likely to be white. Even federal investments in seemingly race-neutral infrastructure like the Interstate Highway System had this effect by enabling the development of all-white suburbs in an era of legal discrimination.
Wealth-building proposals today are trying to engineer a similar if opposite outcome. That makes the details thorny.
"The first and most efficient approach is targeting relief to the people who were targeted with discrimination," said Dorothy Brown, a law professor at Emory University. "If we can't get there, then we have to go to next best."
Warren's strategy, she said, is a clever workaround. Rather than specifying African Americans, Warren's bill would target specific neighborhoods where African Americans harmed by the legacy of lending discrimination are likely to live.
Other researchers argue that a program based on neighborhoods redlined in the 1930s would be too narrow; most African Americans who buy homes aren't purchasing in such neighborhoods today (and in some cities, middle-income whites are).
But the kind of neighborhood criteria Warren has in mind could be one model. Brown proposes identifying neighborhoods with the least household wealth and allowing tax breaks associated with homeownership, like the mortgage deduction, only to people who live there.
Baradaran proposes a "21st Century Homestead Act" that would focus on neighborhoods with many vacant properties. She proposes using government funds to purchase, restore and transfer properties to residents, then to help them build wealth by revitalizing their neighborhoods.
Booker's proposal would give $1,000 in a government savings fund to every newborn in America, for use later in adulthood. But the government would seed more money into that fund each year according to a family's income, giving the most to children in the poorest families. That money could then be spent in adulthood on education, buying a home or starting a business.
It isn't meant to be an income supplement, but rather a means to build assets.
"Ultimately, assets give people agency in their lives," said Darrick Hamilton, director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. His work on the baby bonds concept informed Booker's proposal. "Assets give people the ability to make decisions," he said, "to have choice and have freedom and self-determination."
The point is not just to equalize wealth in America, Hamilton said, but to equalize those choices.
Booker's proposal could benefit African Americans in particular by giving more to the families with the lowest incomes. But Hamilton's original idea would steer the greatest benefits to families with the least wealth. Wealth, which takes into account the value of assets like a home or a stock portfolio, is harder for the government to track than income. But it is a clearer proxy for race in economic data.
Research shows that Black people with higher-paying jobs still hold less wealth than white people with lower incomes, who may benefit from generations of accumulated wealth. Even Black people with college degrees are likely to have less wealth than white people who didn't complete high school.
While the federal government might have trouble tracking wealth for allocating baby bonds, it would be feasible with home-ownership programs, said Dan Immergluck, a professor at Georgia State University. Loan officers already assess wealth when deciding whether to give people mortgages.
Immergluck favors an idea that would grant down-payment assistance, as Warren proposes, but that would target households with low family wealth. Ideally, he said, such a program would count parental wealth, too, given that whites are far more likely than African Americans to receive down payment assistance (or any kind of financial help) from their parents.
Much more sophisticated data is available now than in the past, said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and it could be used to devise these policies - to identify neighborhoods with depressed property values, or to trace back the people helped or harmed today by past government policies.
There are ways, in other words, to sidestep race itself.
But in the end, that may only close the racial wealth gap so much. Today, African Americans make up about 13% of the population, but hold only 2.6% of the country's wealth, said William Darity, a professor at Duke who has also worked on the baby bonds proposal. He wants to see those numbers equalized.
"That's an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now," Darity said. "Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you're really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific."
That would look, he said, like another idea that has gotten attention - albeit with far fewer details - on the campaign trail: a comprehensive reparations program. - (The New York Times)

Donors seek proof of wall effort

Texto completo: A December fundraising campaign brought in more than $20 million over the course of a few weeks, its thousands of donors united by a common goal: the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, oft-promised by President Donald Trump.
Some four months later, a contingent of those supporters is ready to see what their money has built.
The now-famous border wall GoFundMe was conceived by Purple Heart recipient Brian Kolfage.
While the majority of donors continue to believe in Kolfage’s efforts, the nonprofit’s clandestine operations and assurances of progress are insufficient for others. Some have taken to social media, seeking evidence they aren’t being misled.
Reporting on the apparent lack of progress on the private wall, published early Friday by the Daily Beast, drew criticism from Kolfage.
Kolfage did not respond to an email and message from requesting comment on Friday.
While the nonprofit has floated various groundbreaking dates in the past, it’s not exactly clear when, or if, construction will begin.
“We should be turning dirt on this thing by May 1, June 1 at the latest, according to our experts,” Kolfage told Politico in February. In a March 21 interview with American Family Radio, however, the veteran asserted they were going to “start breaking ground” in April.
In the interview, Kolfage said his nonprofit had identified eight locations to build along the border, but failed to name them, stating that his efforts could be thwarted by liberals if they were revealed.
“I wish I could name where it’s at, but we can’t name it because of the ACLU, these other liberal groups who want to sue us and impede our progress,” he said. “But it’s actually happening, the process is happening … the project is moving forward.”
He continued, “But as soon as we start breaking ground, we’ll be putting that information out there to show the American people what they’re doing.”
Kolfage has previously indicated that We Build The Wall Inc. seeks to develop segments of the wall on private property, which he told in January would cost $2 million to $3 million per mile. His GoFundMe says he’s visited the border to scope out potential sites and negotiate with private land owners. Kolfage also has enlisted the help of several high-profile politicians, among them former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and Kris Kobach, the former Secretary of State for Kansas, who sit on the group’s advisory board.
Back in January, Kobach told The New York Times they’d hopefully be breaking ground “within weeks.”
Some critics noted Kolfage was accused of shady behavior in the past, including allegations of misusing funds he raised. NBC and BuzzFeed investigations earlier this year alleged that Kolfage peddled false articles and conspiracy theories with the intent of harvesting reader email addresses. The purported scheme would draw people back to his websites and Facebook pages, generating hundreds of thousands in advertising revenue, Buzzfeed reported.
Facebook removed several of the pages he operated last year, according to NBC, in a purge of pages that were used to “drive traffic to their websites.” In response, Kolfage created a new campaign, “Fight4FreeSpeech,” which also accepts donations.
BuzzFeed looked into Kolfage’s previous crowdfunding efforts, which included an initiative to mentor wounded veterans at military hospitals — among them Walter Reed and Brooke Army Medical Center. He raised thousands for the project, according to BuzzFeed, but spokespersons for the medical facilities told the outlet they have no record of him working at the hospitals or donating money.
Asked about the story in January, Kolfage told that BuzzFeed “100 percent lied” and had fabricated the investigation to slander him. He said the money was raised to cover his travel expenses, and that he only used them for that purpose.
On Friday, many supporters of Kolfage called the Daily Beast story fake news intended to stymie donations. We Build The Wall occasionally replied in agreement, reassuring commenters the wall was on its way.
“This is what we call FAKE NEWS,” they wrote in a post. “We didn’t stop anything and we are full steam ahead. The wall is being built.”
As of Friday night, the group said they’ll be breaking ground “shortly.”
In a separate comment, one woman indicated she’d heard enough.
“Saying it doesn’t get it done,” she wrote late Friday. “Do it.”

Gun violence is a symptom of a sick society

Texto completo: For the Valley News
Another Tuesday, another school shooting. On May 7, two armed teenagers entered their own STEM School Highlands Ranch outside Denver, killed one student and injured eight more.
Photographs in The New York Times included one heartbreaking image of a small girl, probably in kindergarten or first grade, being evacuated, arms folded on her head, I suppose as part of the evacuation protocol, not wanting police to think she, too, might be armed.
I couldn’t help but see my 7-year-old granddaughter in that image, a confused child marching though a group of armed police officers, their neon vests matching the lime green of her small T-shirt.
The response to this latest shooting was immediate and predictable. Tears. Thoughts and prayers. Calls for gun control. Calls for better school security, including arming teachers.
None of those things will prevent the next, inevitable, school shooting.
“Patrick Neville, a Columbine survivor and the top Republican lawmaker in the Colorado House of Representatives, said in a statement that the shooting was a reminder ‘of the need to secure our schools,’ ” The Times reported. “ ‘School safety programs which include armed security and safety upgrades to school facilities are the best way to stop these criminals from harming our children,’ he said.”
Hours before I saw the news of this shooting, I picked up my granddaughter at her Colorado school, as I do each afternoon. She skipped out of school, giggling with friends, joining a growing gaggle of children, parents and caregivers lingering in the warm, afternoon sun. “Armed security guards and safety upgrades” would be no obstacle to anyone with a gun on this or any other afternoon at one of America’s 130,000 schools.
I frequently pointed this out, in writing, conversation and school policy, before my retirement. Arming a school or its teachers is an empty, dangerous gesture, not a solution. Children at my school went to recess on unguarded playgrounds, traveled in groups on field trips and gathered at dismissal and arrival times, as they do at schools everywhere. There is no protection, except for the odds favoring you — until they don’t.
Sensible gun control is not the answer either, unless we address the underlying truth regarding weapons and their use. Don’t get me wrong. I favor any and every gun control measure, including confiscation, the favored red herring of the gun lobby. Guns are ugly, violent things, and if one must have a gun for hunting, “sport” shooting or the delusion of self-protection, then register it, secure it and prepare to be held criminally liable if it falls into the hands of someone who kills children.
But let us be honest. Gun violence is a symptom of a sick society, the illness exponentially more grave during the Trump presidency.
Shootings like the one on Tuesday are the logical endpoint of a culture that enjoys violence, where young people are conditioned to see revenge as divine and where they are de-sensitized to bloody death. They watch mixed martial arts and cheer. They play video games where problems are solved with explosive force. They subliminally absorb the ignorant, crude bullying flowing from the lectern of the president of the United States, who invites his frothing base to beat up political opponents and directs his administration to rip babies from their migrant parents’ arms. They hear men and women in fine suits say that the only protection from a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
Every guy with a gun is a “good” guy in his own delusional self-deception. The shooters at the STEM school, Columbine, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Sandy Hook — the list is long — did not pull the trigger because they believed they were “bad.” They pulled triggers because they were seeking justice, and justice is always “good.”
These shooters — almost always boys — are usually quiet, isolated, rejected and neglected. Schools ignore or punish them, peers ridicule them and families often don’t see them. I did this work for many, many years. I know these children can be seen and they can be loved. Our schools and communities just don’t care enough until the simmering hurt builds to explosion and we say, “How did we miss that?”
Yes, we need gun control but it, alone, will not stem the violence. We need to reverse the narrative. To create cultural values that say, “guns are not the answer” rather than “arm yourself.” We must admit that guns are dangerous whether in the hands of sad teenagers or poorly trained security guards. We need more parents and caregivers to say, “Please don’t play that violent game. I love you.” We need to teach empathy in schools, to look for lonely children and invite them to join us for lunch.
Why do we express surprise when a few troubled individuals seek attention and justice precisely the way they have learned?

Rudy Giuliani's adventures abroad

Texto completo: 'We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do."
That's what Rudy Giuliani - America's mayor turned pro bono personal attorney for Donald J. Trump and for-profit consultant to foreign powers - told the New York Times as it reported his plan to try and meet with President-Elect Volodymyr Zelensky in the Ukraine about extending an investigation into an oligarch there whose company had paid Joe Biden's shady son, and maybe also opening a second investigation.
With team Trump pushing the idea that the "real" interference in 2016 was Ukrainian prosecutors exposing Manafort's crimes to help elect Hillary Clinton, Giuliani's out to stir up enough mud to inspire the "lock her up!" crowd to make "No traitor, you're the traitor" 2020's twist on "no puppet, you're the puppet."
"Somebody could say it's improper," Giuliani told the Times. "And this isn't foreign policy - I'm asking them to do an investigation that they're doing already...because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government."
Speaking of improper, the trip to Kiev, he said, had already been booked for a paid speech to a Jewish group about Middle East policy.
Less than 24 hours after the Times reported his plans, Rudy-whose son, Andrew, golfs regularly with the president and sets up sports teams' visits in his role at the White House Office of Public Liaison, like the one last week for the "World Cup series champion" Boston "Red Socks"-toldFox News Friday it was off, since he feared "enemies of the president... might misrepresent it."
"I've never lobbied him on anything," Giuliani said of Trump last year. "I don't represent foreign governments in front of the U.S. government. I've never registered to lobby."
Friday, Rudy confirmed to The Daily Beast that Giuliani Security & Safety - whose clients have included foreign governments at all levels - had signed a contract with the Kingdom of Bahrain to train its police force "specifically in regard to terrorist acts perpetrated in large part by Iran or Iranian proxies."
Those talks began last year, during the special counsel's probe of foreign interference in our election. Giuliani told The Beast he'd never mentioned Bahrain to Trump or anyone in the administration, and that his work for the kingdom, which has an army of lobbyists in the U.S., "doesn't involve any lobbying," policy advice or legal work. That was spelled out in the contract, Rudy said, though he didn't show The Beast that contract.
Back to Iran, the speaking fees Giuliani's collected over a decade from opposition-in-exile group MEK didn't stop him from working in 2017, before becoming the president's lawyer, for Iranian sanctions-buster Reza Zarrab. Rudy and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey weren't arguing in court, but secretly flying to Ankara to try and negotiate a deal with Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdo an to get his friend and their client out of the U.S. justice system.
As to Giuliani Security's "emergency management consulting" for Russia-aligned and Manafort-tied clients in the Ukraine, the president's attorney told the Times it never involved lobbying, and is now finished, even as one client told the paper Rudy had been hired as "a lobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine" to lure American investors. "This is stated in the contract."
Rudy shrugged: "My only client is the president of the United States," he said. "He's the one I have an obligation to report to, tell him what happened."
Maybe.
"The purpose of FARA is to ensure the American public can make informed judgments about the political activities of foreign agents in the U.S.," seven Democratic senators wrote the Justice Department last September, asking the National Security Division to review whether Giuliani is violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
"Given Mr. Giuliani's ongoing relationships with foreign governments as well as his concurrent representation of the President, we hope you will agree this situation merits immediate review."
Eight months later, there's been no reply.

Texto completo: In a historic change of mind, President Donald Trump has found a reason to support reparations - for President Donald Trump.
The president retweeted this bright and, oh, yes, unconstitutional idea Sunday after Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, proposed that Trump deserved an additional two years in office to make up for the time allegedly lost in the Russia investigation.
I have a counterproposal. I think the president should leave office two years early - as in, right now - to make up for the "executive time" that he reportedly has spent golfing, visiting his personal properties and watching "Fox & Friends" instead of keeping up with his daily intelligence briefings.
Just kidding. Falwell was just kidding, too, I am told. Trump? I'm not so sure.
"Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President," Trump tweeted Sunday (punctuation and ALL CAPS his), "including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back....
"The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Could this be a sign that the president doesn't expect to win four more years in office by the normal constitutional route?
As Trump and Falwell's tweets went out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was warning in a weekend New York Times interview that, even if the president fails to be re-elected in 2020, he won't want to leave - especially if he loses by a narrow margin.
The party needs to "inoculate against that," she said, by not only winning but winning "big" enough to convince Trump to step aside voluntarily, as every other sitting president has.
Pelosi didn't sound like she was kidding at all. Similar fears that Trump would "poison the public mind" and "challenge each of the races" motivated her in last year's midterms, she said. In the end, Democrats picked up a net gain of 40 seats, their biggest gain in the House since the historic post-Watergate wave election of 1974.
She's not the first to speculate about a Trump who won't go away. When comedian Bill Maher floated that notion last year on his HBO program, not as a joke but as a serious concern, my personal reaction was, hey, don't give him any ideas.
Yet Trump has said more than a little to feed the notion himself. In his final 2016 presidential debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than a month before Election Day, Trump promised to "totally accept" the election results, "if I win."
Since he did win the Electoral College, Trump's threat went away. But he went on to complain anyway, tweeting blame on some sort of a ghost-voting conspiracy for allegedly robbing him of the popular vote, "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."
"In many places the same person in California votes many times," Trump said at the official White House event in West Virginia on tax cuts in April 2018. "They always like to say, 'Oh that's a conspiracy theory.' It's not a conspiracy theory." Again, he offered no evidence to back up that claim.
Speaking at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee in April, Trump cast suspicion on the close elections that Democrats won in 2018. "There's something going on," he said, telling his audience that they needed to "be a little bit more paranoid than you are, OK?" Again, he offered no proof to back that up.
And, requiring no proof are the jokes Trump has casually dropped about somehow extending his constitutional term in office. "Well, this is really beautiful," he said, accepting a gift from the Wounded Warrior Project in April. "This will find a permanent place, at least for six years, in the Oval Office. Is that OK? I was going to joke, General, and say at least for 10 or 14 years, but we would cause bedlam if I said that, so we'll say six."
Right. I, too, have an award for the president. It's a copy of a fine old song by Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks: "How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?"
It's got a good beat and he can dance to it.

Texto completo: Tim Ryan,member, Broward County Commission
Last week, the County Commission created the Broward County Construction Apprenticeship Program in response to a local shortage of skilled laborers. The program requires bidders on county construction projects with over $1 million in labor costs to participate in an apprenticeship program approved by the Florida Department of Education or the United States Department of Labor and make a good faith effort to designate at least twelve percent of the labor to apprentices. The goal is to ensure a trained workforce moving forward. This is a good example of government working to provide training opportunities that might not otherwise be available.
Irela Bagué,president, Bagué Group
The U.N. released a report last week on the risk of the extinction of close to 1 million plants and animals in coming decades primarily due to human activity. This week, when the Arctic Council met, the U.S., exerted its influence to ensure that their joint statement excluded the term climate change. Although, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's remarks acknowledged that the Arctic ecosystem should be protected he also stated that the melting ice presented an economic opportunity to expand trade. It's a sad day on our planet when our country can only advocate for a different kind of green.
Lamar Fisher, member, Broward County Commission
This week, the Board of County Commissioners had a preliminary discussion regarding the Broward County Affordable Housing Needs Assessment, 2018, as prepared by The Metropolitan Center, Florida International University. One key finding shows that nearly all of Broward County's municipalities display high percentages of renter and owner cost burdened households. This study provides us an understanding of the shifting demands for housing, the growing housing affordability gaps, the impact on worker residents, and the housing and transportation costs in our community, which are all, extremely critical for the creation of effective housing policies and strategies.
Richard Clark,CEO, Clark Leadership Consulting
A 12-year-old student from the STEM school shooting spoke on national television. He said while his classmates, most crying and screaming, were directed into a closet, he grabbed his baseball bat stating that he wasn't going down without a fight. While shootings continue, public opinions are angrily polarized, viciously attacking others not in agreement with their supported solution. A Commission presented their findings and recommendations; still we live in fear. Our children, their parents, their teachers and staff deserve better. We can land on the planet Mars, yet not protect our schools.
Earl Maucker,commissioner, City of Lighthouse Point; former Sun Sentinel Editor
Americans should take comfort that the New York Times is doing its job. This week, the Times published tax information that President Donald Trump has refused to release. Whether or not you accept the way Trump handled his personal finances is not the issue. The president's tax history is legitimate information for public consumption and you can bet the Times will continue to pursue the story. That's good news for us. It reminds us once again that a free and independent press is the cornerstone of democracy.
Eleanor Sobel,former member, Florida Senate
A 325-foot tower will be constructed at Hollywood's West Lake Park, across from the Anne Kolb nature center. Residents oppose the incongruous structure, proximal to the ocean and natural habitats, while County officials say the new tower will upgrade emergency communications for police and firefighters. Locals worry about the new tower blowing away in a hurricane and subsequent leakage of sustaining fuel. Broward Officials quickly pointed out that towers are built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, and agreed the deed restriction "in perpetuity" no longer applies. Commissioner Furr voted "no" to protect the ecological seaside environment, preferring another site.
Michael Ryan, mayor, Sunrise
The Florida legislature failed to invest in recycling or to address their own commissioned 2010 study concluding how to reduce single use plastic bags. Instead, the Legislature used their time to protect trash companies and prohibit bans on plastic straws. Recyclers can unilaterally decide if your recycling is contaminated and send to landfill with no oversight. Local efforts to ban plastic straws would be prohibited until 2024 pending a study. This is the same strategy used to stop bans on single use plastic bags: require a study, done in 2010, and then do nothing. Corporate interests again frustrate any environmental solutions.
Heather Brinkworth,Chair, Broward School Board
This week Governor DeSantis signed SB 7030 into law. One component of this large education bill provides school districts the discretion to decide whether or not to allow classroom teachers to serve as armed guardians. As a parent, a former classroom teacher and a school board member, I don't believe arming teachers is in the best interest of our students, our teachers or our community. The School Board of Broward County voted unanimously in March 2018 NOT to arm teachers. The messages I continue to receive from a wide array of people across Broward County in the wake of the new legislation, reaffirms the Board's decision over a year ago. From our teacher's union, to our parent associations, to local law enforcement, to our students, the consensus is clear: Arming teachers is NOT the answer to school safety.

House Democrats fear Attorney General Barr

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats are threatening to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for not releasing the full Mueller report and for declining to appear in front of House Judiciary Committee. Barr has declined to appear as House Democrats want staff, instead of members of Congress, to question Barr. Only twice in history has a cabinet member been questioned by staff (Watergate and Iran Contra), so naturally Barr declined the invitation, resulting in Democrats threatening to hold him in contempt.
Barr has stellar reputation, and this is his second tour of duty as AG. He served from 1991 to 1993 after being confirmed by a unanimous vote, when then-Senator Joe Biden called him a "heck of an honorable guy."
So what changed? The starting point is Barr's testimony on April 10 that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign and that he is looking into it. In addition to that, there are several events that are scheduled to occur over this summer that are causing House Democrats concern resulting in this diversionary tactic. Here is a list of those events:
FBI involvement in Trump campaign: Last week, The New York Times reported that FBI sent an investigator posing as an assistant to meet with a Trump aide in September 2016 under the pretext "to discuss foreign policy issues." This raises serious questions on an administration from one party spying on a presidential campaign of another party. More importantly, how far up the chain did the approval for this investigation happen?
Leak investigations: During Congressional testimony on May 1, Barr said that there are multiple criminal leak investigations underway. If government officials leaked classified information, that would be a felony punishable up to 10 years. The list of leakers may include high-profile current and former government officials.
Inspector General investigation: Michael Horowitz, the highly respected IG, has been investigating if the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain warrants to investigate the Trump campaign. As James Comey admitted to Congress, FISA court operates on an honor system. In other words, the FISC typically approves FBI's request by rubber-stamping it. If it is proven that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the Steele dossier, which was then used to obtain warrants to spy on the Trump campaign without further corroboration, that could prove to be abuse of power. This investigation, which started in March 2018, is expected to be completed some time in May or June.
Declassification of Russia probe documents: The president held off on releasing these documents to avoid appearance of interfering with the Mueller investigation. With Mueller investigation now completed, there is nothing holding the administration back from releasing these documents. These documents, once released, will shed light on the extent of the FBI spying of the Trump campaign.
One final point: House Democrats want all documents from the Mueller report even though only 7.25 percent of this report is redacted (source: Vox). These redactions were approved by Mueller's team. In addition to the publicly available Mueller report, Barr has provided 12 senior members of Congress, six Democrats and six Republicans, with a less-redacted version (2 percent redacted, with only the redactions required by law). At last check, no Democrat has taken the time to read this less-redacted version (source: Politico). If the real issue is the report, then why is it that none of the Democrats have bothered to read the less-redacted version?

CAMBRIDGE — Before Daniel and Patrick Lazour were out of their teens, they'd already authored three full-fledged musicals that were staged at a community theater in their hometown of Boylston. If the shows demonstrated the Lazours' promise as composers and writers, to them it felt like child's play. Was this really something they could do as a profession?
“We started this journey with none of the pressures of an 'industry' or 'making a career,' and that probably instilled the love of the [musical] form in us," says Patrick Lazour, 28, the older of the two brothers.
Now the Lazours are poised for their first big professional breakthrough, in a city just 40 miles from their hometown but, theatrically speaking, a world away. After six years of development, the American Repertory Theater is presenting the world premiere of their musical “We Live in Cairo," inspired by the events of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, at the Loeb Drama Center, from May 14 to June 23.
The show earned them a 2016 Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater, which helps promising composers and playwrights get their work produced in New York. Previous recipients have included 2019 Tony nominee Anaïs Mitchell (for “Hadestown") and the Tony-, Grammy-, and Oscar-winning team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (for “Dogfight").
The spark for the show started with a photo Patrick saw while a student at Boston College. The indelible image, shot by photojournalist Ed Ou and appearing on the front page of The New York Times, shows young people gathered around a table scattered with coffee cups and cameras in a flat near Tahrir Square in Cairo. The glow of MacBooks illuminates their faces, and cigarettes hang from their mouths as they post updates and upload videos from the massive demonstrations. It captured the hopeful energy, uncompromising determination, and sense of possibility that reverberated across the Arab world in early 2011 during the 18 days of the Egyptian Revolution.
Patrick says he was immediately captivated by the “dynamism" and “communion of youth" depicted in the image. “It's like we knew these kids," says Patrick, seated alongside Daniel while on a rehearsal break at Oberon. “There were these similarities to our lives, but there were also small things that signaled to us that there was a lot more going on."
“One kid's head was bandaged" Daniel, 25, continues. “In a video [that accompanied the story], it says that if these activists don't succeed, they'll be tortured or killed. So they're taking great risks with their protests, and that was inspiring."
When Patrick is “hopped up" about an idea or piece of art or music, Daniel says, “it's infectious." The story they created follows six burgeoning activists brandishing their tools of revolution — cameras, laptops, guitars, and spray-paint cans — as they take to the streets to protest police violence and the brutal regime of President Hosni Mubarak, and to advocate for new social and economic freedoms. The action moves from the heady early days of the uprising and the ouster of Mubarak, to the country's first free and fair presidential elections in its citizens' lifetimes, to the dashed dreams of a population facing a military crackdown, widespread censorship and repression, and a new iron-fisted ruler.
The Lazours and their director, Taibi Magar, want to explore what unfolded in the eight years since the events of the revolution and ask hard questions. “What is the nature of activism? Is activism personal? Is it political?" Patrick says. “When is it time to act? When is it time to step aside? Is it ever time to step aside? And how far does one go, how much does one sacrifice, for the love of one's country?"
As they worked on the show, Magar, whose father immigrated from Egypt as a young man, says she and the Lazours felt a “deep apprehension" about being seen as interlopers from the West co-opting a story that's not theirs to tell. But during a trip to Egypt in late 2017, they received feedback that suggested they were on the right track. After a reading of the show at the American University in Cairo, they went for coffee with a student who had told them how moved he was by the story.
“He said, 'It brings me solace in my heart to know that you'll be over there in America telling our story — because we can't,' " Magar recalls. “It felt like the permission we wanted and needed, and I hold onto what he said almost every day."
In penning the score, the Lazours drew upon their mother's Lebanese heritage. Daniel, a pianist who majored in music composition at Columbia University, says they didn't want the music to simply reflect their own American sensibilities. So he went back and listened to the Arabic songs his grandfather used to play when they were kids. That grew into what he calls “a love affair" for divas like Umm Kulthum and Fairuz; Sayed Darwish, the so-called father of Egyptian popular music; and Sheikh Imam, a celebrated '60s and '70s performer who wrote political songs for the poor and working class.
Ramy Essam — who wrote anthems that became the virtual soundtrack of the revolution — was also a key influence. “There was such an amazing, rich blend of music playing in the Square during the revolution, from traditional Arabic music to Western rock music, from old to new, and we wanted [our score] to reflect that," says Daniel, who taught himself how to play guitar in order to write “the earthy protest-music sound" they wanted.
When the Lazours were growing up, music and show tunes were frequently heard around the house, and the brothers recall their parents, Paul and Nel, taking them to see shows in Boston. In high school, they wrote a short election-themed musical, “That Tuesday in November," with friends for a play competition. Patrick, who was on the crew team at St. John's High School in Shrewsbury, says with a laugh, “I pretended I was the jock of the family." But when a college recruiter inquired about his other interests, he talked enthusiastically about writing musicals with his brother. “The guy was like, 'I can tell in your voice that's what brings you real joy.' "
Indeed, it was the three musicals they created for Calliope Productions in Boylston every summer from 2009 to 2011 that set the Lazours on their current path. “Tribulations of the Millionaire" explored the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash. “Robynn McCree" centered on a female Irish ward boss in turn-of-the-century South Boston. And “Affairs of a French Afternoon" was a musical-comedy they describe as a “sex-farce soufflé" set in the time of Louis XVI. People around town were hugely encouraging, and it gave the Lazours a big boost of confidence. “I feel like those three summers launched us and gave us some momentum to continue for a long time with this," says Daniel.
With “We Live in Cairo" poised to open at the ART, the Lazours are thrilled to share the fruits of their labors with friends and family who live nearby. It also has them looking back on their formative experiences. “As kids, we were always collaborating with each other, creating stories and making music," Patrick says. “We pursued it as a profession as the result of the strength of our relationship, and from there it's blossomed into a real passion."

Texto completo: A little bit of silence. Sometimes that's all we want. Whether it's halfway through a 10-hour flight with a crying baby, or trying to sleep though the snoring from the hotel room next door, the promise of noise-canceling headphones is one that every traveler probably finds intriguing.
Yet are they worth it? These headphones are often expensive and for some people, they don't live up to the hype.
I've spent the majority of the last five years traveling, taking dozens of flights and train journeys, and as someone who has reviewed noise-canceling headphones for even longer, I can definitively say "maybe."
How (and when) noise-canceling headphones work
Noise-canceling headphones, also called active noise canceling headphones, use electronic processing to analyze ambient sound and attempt to generate the "opposite" sound. The result is less noise overall.
Imagine ocean waves. There's high part, the crest and the low part, the trough. If you combined the positive height of the crest and the negative depth of the trough, the result would be a flat sea. Or for the math inclined, if you add +1 and -1 you get 0. This is essentially what active noise-canceling headphones do. Add troughs to crests and crests to troughs. Except instead of seawater, it's sound waves.
It's not perfect. these headphones don't "create" silence, nor are they able to eliminate noise. The crests and troughs do not perfectly cancel out. The absolute best noise-canceling headphones merely reduce noise, and work best with low-frequency droning sounds. So a loud hum is a quieter hum. The roar on an airplane is a quieter roar on an airplane. They also don't work well for all sounds. At higher frequencies, like the human vocal range and higher, the headphones do very little if anything at all. So if your hope is to block out the cries of the baby in seat 15C, you're out of luck. Fast and transient sounds, like a door slam or a hand clap, also aren't blocked effectively.
What's perhaps even more frustrating is not all noise-canceling headphones work the same. The best reduce a lot of noise, the worst reduce very little or nothing at all. There's no way to tell, looking at a headphone's specs, which are which.
Two headphone sets could claim to reduce the same amount of noise but perform completely different. Only hands-on testing, ideally with objective measurements, can tell the difference. Wirecutter, the New York Times Company that reviews products, does these types of measurements for all the noise-canceling headphones they test. (For Wirecutter, I've written both the over-ear and in-ear noise-canceling headphone guides along with my colleague Brent Butterworth.)
Noise-canceling headphones require a battery to power their electronics. Noise-isolating headphones, which do not require electronics and therefore can be far cheaper, work by creating a seal in your ear canal to block noise. Basically they are like earplugs, but with earbuds inside. If you can get a good seal, these work reasonably well.
Getting a good seal can be a challenge, however, since everyone's ears are different and not all headphones will fit correctly. And even if you do get a good seal, noise-isolating headphones will not be able to block low-frequency sounds as well as the best noise-canceling headphones. They will reduce a wide range of frequencies, which can help.
Who really needs noise-canceling headphones?
If you are a frequent traveler, good noise-canceling headphones will make any journey in a plane, train or automobile far more pleasant. Even after a 12-hour flight, I'm not nearly as fatigued on arrival, thanks to the lower auditory onslaught.
In-ear models are easier, though still slightly uncomfortable, to sleep with and are my preference. Over-ear models reduce a little more noise as they are able to passively block some sound because of their design, but they are always bulky on your head or in your bag. After I stopped reviewing these headphones for Wirecutter, I bought a pair of Bose QuietComfort 20s, a longtime Wirecutter pick, and I never fly without them.
However, if you rarely travel, or you find higher-frequency noises like people talking, cars honking and noisy neighbors more annoying than airplane engine noise or background chatter, these headphones may not be worth it. Cheap earplugs, or perhaps noise-isolating earbuds, might work well enough. And it's worth keeping in mind that for the same money, regular headphones will likely sound better than noise-canceling headphones.
Wirecutter has a review I wrote for earplugs to sleep in, and it might give you some ideas for which headsets to buy. As earplugs are lower in cost, they might be worth trying first.
Overall, I think noise-canceling headphones are great, but I also travel frequently and have expectations about how well these headphones work. For non-frequent travelers, however, this product might not necessarily be the must-have travel accessory that they might seem.

Texto completo: Despite an endless stream of bombshells, there was little novelty in the noxious confirmation fights involving Merrick Garland, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh over the last three years. They were simply the latest rounds of a long-running battle over the Supreme Court. Well before the term "Borked" became synonymous with the unorthodox steps taken to defeat Robert H. Bork's nomination in 1987, the nomination of Abe Fortas -- already a sitting justice -- to become chief justice in 1968 established the template for the bitter confirmation battles mimicked by later generations.
Confronted with the threat of impeachment months after his aborted ascension, Fortas resigned from the court on May 14, 1969. Though renowned as an able jurist, he will forever be remembered as the only justice to resign under a cloud of scandal.
Fortas wasn't blameless in his downfall. Questionable financial arrangements allowed his political enemies to orchestrate his ouster, but his misbegotten ethical choices weren't what doomed him. As Chief Justice Earl Warren's ideological heir, Fortas was the first casualty of a conservative counterrevolution that, in trying to seize control of the court over the next half a century, revolutionized the confirmation process.

It was a cruel irony that months before his undoing, he was on the verge of reaching the pinnacle of his career. When President Lyndon B. Johnson named Fortas on June 26, 1968, to replace Warren, congratulatory letters poured in from the capital's elite.
They had good reason to be confident. Fortas brandished stellar credentials. After graduating from Yale Law School, he worked in various New Deal agencies before establishing one of the nation's preeminent law firms. Touted for guiding clients through Washington's legal and political minefields, a colleague called him a "brain surgeon ... the guy you call when all else fails."
History also foretold his swift ascension. In a process largely devoid of ideological litmus tests and partisan wrangling, the Senate had confirmed all but one of 46 nominees from 1894 to 1967, mostly through voice votes, a procedure used to vote expeditiously and often unanimously. Hearings were usually brief and uncontroversial -- one lasted five minutes. Fortas earned the Senate's imprimatur in a mere fortnight to become an associate justice in 1965. Expecting a repeat performance three years later, the New York Times confidently proclaimed: "Fortas will move up ... to stage center as Chief Justice."
Then came the unexpected insurrection. South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, a Republican, emerged as the bombastic frontman of a coalition of senators willing to breach the deep-seated customs governing judicial appointments to sabotage Fortas. Exasperated by repeated failures to neutralize the Warren court's liberal rulings, they devised a revolutionary strategy that has since become the norm: Obstruct a political rival's nominees while stacking the court with like-minded jurists.
Shattering long-held norms, Republicans teamed up with Southern Democrats to orchestrate the first filibuster against a court nominee. Claiming Johnson was a "lame duck," Fortas' opponents called for the next president to fill the vacancy. Aiming for the jugular, critics labeled Fortas a "crony" for serving as the president's advisor, tarnished his reputation by pointing to questionable earnings from a teaching position and invited social conservatives to brand him a guardian of criminals and pornographers.
In the era's version of culture wars, Thurmond aired a series of adult movies the court had shielded from censors to underscore Fortas' purportedly lax morals. The highlight of his performance occurred when, during Fortas' testimony, Thurmond blindly accused Fortas of encouraging criminals to "commit rapes." Blindsided by this unanticipated fusillade, Fortas grumbled to Justice William O. Douglas: "All the accumulated venom about practically everything seems to have come to a focus."
On Oct. 1, 1968, Fortas became the only court nominee to be done in by a filibuster. Seven months later, President Nixon pressured the justice to resign -- also a first -- by exploiting Fortas' arrangement with a white-collar criminal who arranged for him to be paid the equivalent of half of Fortas' annual judicial salary for serving on a foundation board.
Contrary to the prevailing wisdom, it was this imbroglio -- and not Bork's nomination in 1987 -- that triggered the modern confirmation wars, transforming the selection of justices into the hyper-politicized, high-stakes contest we live with to this day. This new paradigm became evident soon after Fortas' exodus. Within a year of his resignation, Senate liberals avenged him by rejecting two of Nixon's nominees -- the Southern conservatives Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell. In the next phase of this tit-for-tat, Nixon tried to impeach Justice Douglas in 1970.
After a peaceful lull, Bork's nomination represented an atavistic return to this epoch. With several of the combatants from 1968 taking part, the parallels between the Bork and Fortas nominations were palpable. A Johnson advisor, Joseph A. Califano Jr., even urged those disagreeing with Bork's judicial philosophy "to oppose the nomination, by filibuster if necessary."
Many of the groundbreaking tactics deployed against Fortas also resurfaced in later nomination clashes. In 2005, Harriet Miers was labeled George W. Bush's "crony." Calling President Obama a "lame duck," Sen. Mitch McConnell refused to consider Garland's nomination in 2016, and Senate liberals targeted Gorsuch in 2017 through a filibuster. In its latest manifestation, the heated exchanges between Kavanaugh and Senate Democrats eerily resembled the testy duels between Fortas and Thurmond.
It was Fortas' misfortune that he became an unwitting victim of this new battlefront. The final irony was that, unwilling to leave his lucrative legal practice, he capitulated to joining the court in 1965 only after Johnson's entreaties. Reflecting on his friend's tragic fate, Johnson wrote: "I made him take the justiceship. In that way I ruined his life."
He wasn't the only one left in ruins. On the 50th anniversary of his fall, the legacy of Fortas' nomination still looms over the nation.

Texto completo: For
President Donald Trump has finally proved, beyond any doubt, that there is such a thing as “fake news.”
In the 1980s and 1990s, the media conspired to perpetrate a vast fraud on the American people. So-called journalists and their complicit editors colluded — yes, that’s the word — to convince an unwitting public that Trump was a spectacularly successful businessman.
The scale of the ink-fueled myth has been exposed at last, thanks to 10 years worth of his tax information obtained by The New York Times, which revealed that Trump’s enterprises were flopping on an epic scale.
In 1985, Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his casinos, hotels and apartment buildings, which hemorrhaged $1.17 billion over the next decade. “Year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer,” The Times reported.
You wouldn’t have known any of that from a December 1987 People magazine cover that featured the 41-year-old tuxedoed “tycoon” under a headline pronouncing him “Too Darn Rich.”
“Almost everything he touches turns to profit,” the magazine marveled, adding: “He says he’s too busy to run for president right now, but in a few years, well, who knows?”
It was not the only glossy magazine to be dazzled by Trump’s multimillion-dollar toys, including a huge black helicopter with his name on the side, and his claims of a gilded financial empire.
“He is the man with the Midas fist,” Newsweek wrote a few months before the People cover.
The Times wrote the earliest classic of the genre with its first profile of Trump back in 1976.
The story by society reporter Judy Klemesrud began: “He is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford. He rides around town in a chauffeured silver Cadillac with his initials, DJT, on the plates. He dates slinky fashion models, belongs to the most elegant clubs and, at only 30 years of age, estimates that he is worth ‘more than $200 million.’ ”
Evidence suggests that figure was preposterous. As my colleagues Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher noted in their book Trump Revealed, Trump reported a mere $24,594 in income to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement that year, and said he owed $10,832 in taxes.
At the time, The Times did offer a tiny note of skepticism about Trump’s business acumen, in the form of an unattributed quote from a banker who told Klemesrud: “His deals are dramatic, but they haven’t come into being. So far, the chief beneficiary of his creativity has been his public image.”
Trumping up The Donald’s reputation was a mutually beneficial arrangement between the floundering businessman and his media enablers, particularly the New York tabloids, which had a seemingly bottomless appetite for all of this.
“When we would talk particularly to immigrants, recent immigrants who were the readers of the Daily News, they would always want to know about Donald Trump,” that paper’s gossip columnist George Rush told Kranish and Fisher. “He embodied the American Dream to them. Excessive, conspicuous consumption is not a bad thing in New York to a lot of people.”
Trump each year browbeat Forbes to include him on its annual list of the world’s richest people — which it obliged him by doing, beginning in 1985 — and then howled that it had underestimated his supposedly vast wealth.
Eventually, Trump’s blunders became too big to hide under a pile of press clippings. He was dropped from the Forbes 400 for six years, beginning in 1990, when the magazine posed a question on its cover: “How Much Is Donald Really Worth Now?”
In December 1992, columnist Gail Collins, then at Newsday, described him as a “financially embattled thousandaire.”
An enraged Trump mailed her a copy of her column with comments scrawled throughout, including: “Gail — You are a dog and a liar.” He also drew an arrow pointing to her picture and wrote: “The face of a pig — no wonder you are so angry. I would be to.”
Even now, Trump would rather be thought of as a tax cheat than a loser. “You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes ... almost all real estate developers did — and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport,” he tweeted in response to the recent Times report.
His backup singers at Fox & Friends chimed in, noting that piling up 10 digits worth of losses was a testament to Trump’s financial genius. “If anything, you read this and you’re like, ‘Wow, it’s pretty impressive, all the things that he’s done in his life,’ ” co-host Ainsley Earhardt said in wonder. “It’s beyond what most of us could ever achieve.”
During the final debate of the 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to “run our country the way I’ve run my company.”
As we are learning, that is one campaign promise he’s on track to keep.

Texto completo: NASHVILLE, Tenn. – The unexpected death of Christian author Rachel Held Evans on Saturday has led to an outpouring of support from those touched by her writings, with many saying she is the reason they kept their faith in God and the church.
In mid-April, Evans was hospitalized and put into a medically-induced coma when doctors found she was experiencing seizures while treating her for an infection.
On Saturday, her husband, Dan Evans, announced her death on her website and shock and grief overtook many at the news.
A GoFundMe campaign, launched to help cover medical expenses during her hospital stay, had a goal of $70,000. By Sunday morning, it had exceeded $179,000.
Rachel Held Evans was known for her progressive Christian voice. She was a speaker, writer and author of numerous best-selling books, including "Faith Unraveled," "A Year of Biblical Womanhood," "Searching for Sunday" and "Inspired."
Her writings resonated particularly with those struggling with their faith, traditional evangelicalism and the treatment of women and LGBT persons within the church.
"Yet instead of throwing out God or church, Rachel demonstrated a robust Christian faith outside the bounds of evangelicalism," Katelyn Beaty, author of "A Women's Place," wrote in a tribute column for the Religion News Service.
"She showed that that world's gatekeepers, its voracious 'discernment bloggers,' don't have the final say about one's standing before Christ."
Beaty wrote that Evans, in her "Searching for Sunday" book, traced her own personal journey through the Episcopal church.
"Along the way, she helped many readers stay tethered to faith when they wanted to bolt," Beaty wrote.
Indeed, after her death, the #BecauseofRHE hashtag began trending as people told their own stories about how Evans inspired them to keep their faith and remain active in their churches.
"When I was still struggling with my faith, this woman was one of the voices who made me feel like no one had the right to reject me," wrote one woman under the name Jamie Holderman. "She held space for me to feel loved."
The Rev. Emmy Kegler, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in Minneapolis and the founder of Queer Grace, an online resources guide around LGBTQ life and faith, told of how Evans inspired her.
"She taught me how to hold my faith upside down and shake it till grace fell out," Kegler wrote Sunday. "I'll do the same again today, not just for myself but for all in need. #BecauseOfRHE."
Others paid similar tributes.
But it wasn't just progressive Christians who felt touched by Evans, her writings and her life.
Most notably, Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, took to Twitter to urge people to support her family and donate to the GoFundMe campaign.
Evans "leaves behind a husband and two small children, one 3 and one less than one year old. As many as can, let's please help this grieving young family with the overwhelming medical bills," Moore wrote.
Moore regularly tangled with Evans online but said conservative Christians are better off because of her.
"I was on the other side of her Twitter indignation many times, but I respected her because she was never a phony," Moore told The New York Times. "Even in her dissent, she made all of us think, and helped those of us who are theological conservatives to be better because of the way she would challenge us."
Evans, 37, was from Dayton, Tennessee, and in addition to her writings, served on former President Barack Obama's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. She was a regular speaker across the nation.
Funeral arrangements are pending.

WHITE HOUSE PRESSURED WITNESS TO SAY TRUMP INNOCENT OF OBSTRUCTION

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - White House officials asked at least twice in the past month for the key witness against President Donald Trump in the Mueller report, Donald McGahn, to say publicly that he never believed the president obstructed justice, according to two people briefed on the requests.
Mr. Trump asked White House officials to make the request to Mr. McGahn, who was the president's first White House counsel, one of the people said. Mr. McGahn declined. His reluctance angered the president, who believed that Mr. McGahn showed disloyalty by telling investigators for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, about Mr. Trump's attempts to maintain control over the Russia investigation.
The White House made one of the requests to Mr. McGahn's lawyer, William A. Burck, before the Mueller report was released publicly but after the Justice Department gave a copy to Mr. Trump's lawyers in the preceding days. Reading the report, the president's lawyers saw that Mr. Mueller left out that Mr. McGahn had told investigators that he believed the president never obstructed justice. Mr. Burck had told them months earlier about his client's belief on the matter and that he had shared it with investigators.
Mr. McGahn initially entertained the White House request. "We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister," Mr. Burck said in a statement. "It was a request, professionally and cordially made." A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a message seeking comment.
But after the report was released, detailing the range of actions Mr. Trump took to try to impede the inquiry, Mr. McGahn decided to pass on putting out a statement supportive of the president. The report also revealed that Mr. Trump told aides he believed Mr. McGahn had leaked to the news media to make himself look good.
House Democrats have used the report to open investigations into whether Mr. Trump abused his position to insulate himself from the Russia inquiry.
In the days after the report was released, White House officials asked Mr. McGahn again to put out a statement as Mr. Trump fumed about his disclosures, but Mr. McGahn rebuffed the second request as well.
White House officials believed that Mr. McGahn publicly asserting his belief would calm the president and help the administration push back on the episodes that Mr. Mueller detailed in the obstruction section of the report, said one of the people. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the White House.

Texto completo: LONDON -- Nicholas Hytner, the acclaimed director and former head of Britain's National Theater, plans to open a 600-seat venue in North London in 2021, his London Theater Company has announced.
The as-yet-unnamed theater will be in King's Cross, about a mile north of the traditional theater district in the West End, in a nine-story building that will also house Facebook, Mr. Hytner's company said in a news release.
King's Cross, a once run-down neighborhood that hosts two of London's biggest train terminals, has undergone significant gentrification over the past decade, with offices, shops and apartments springing up.
The venue will show "a varied program of new commissions and classics," the statement added.
The theater will be Mr. Hytner's second such venture, after the Bridge Theater in Southeast London, which opened in 2017 with the aim of showcasing new talent. "New writing doesn't have to be a ghettoized, virtuous thing," Mr. Hytner told The New York Times after the Bridge opened. "These are new shows that aim to communicate widely."
The Bridge has had several acclaimed productions, including "My Name is Lucy Barton," a one-woman show that starred Laura Linney and that is transferring to Broadway next year.
Currently at the Bridge is another one-woman show, "A German Life," starring Maggie Smith, the British actress whose credits also include the TV show "Downton Abbey." The play is "a new high in a six-decade career with no shortage of peaks," the New York Times critic Matt Wolf wrote.
The new theater's auditorium has been designed by the architecture studio Haworth Tompkins and the engineering firm Tait, the same team that worked on the Bridge, the news release said.
"We've been delighted with the welcome the Bridge has received and with the intimacy, comfort and adaptability of Haworth Tompkins/Tait's auditorium," Mr. Hytner and Nick Starr, his business partner who also worked at the National, said in the statement. "We're looking forward to joining the vibrant King's Cross neighborhood in a few years' time."
The plans were the latest to present new or revitalized theaters tied to major redevelopment projects in London. Nimax Theaters, which runs several venues in the capital, said in an email that work had started on a 600-seat venue in central London that is scheduled to open in 2021.
During his time at the National Theater, Mr. Hytner presided over hits including "War Horse," "The History Boys" and "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The media turn on their former darling Beto O’Rourke

Texto completo: The press has a message for 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke: The thrill is gone.
Newsrooms loved the former Democratic Texas congressman when he ran (and lost) against Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2018. Let's be real: They slobbered all over the guy.
But that was then, and this is now. The press have gone from churning out plush, overly friendly media profiles, and even sitting on major stories that made him look bad, to sifting through the former lawmaker’s none-too-flattering voting record and publishing harsh and sometimes antagonizing commentaries on his candidacy.
It is like watching a passionate fling fall apart, where one party feels aggrieved and decides to air her ex-lover’s dirty laundry all over the internet.
The most apparent about-face on O'Rourke coverage can be seen at the Daily Beast. It produced a number of perfectly adequate straight-news stories during the 2018 Senate race, but very little in terms of critical commentary. Here is a basic sampling of headlines from when the Daily Beast covered O'Rourke's doomed Senate campaign:
- Beto O’Rourke Raked In an Epic $6.7M Haul to Unseat Ted Cruz - This Indie-Rock God Thinks Beto Could Win It All - Elderly Texan Weeps After Voting for Beto: We Are ‘So Proud’
Then, starting in April, after O’Rourke announced he would run for president, the Daily Beast’s coverage underwent a tonal shift. Here are just a few of the headlines published since April:
- The Unbearable Male Privilege of Beto O’Rourke - Beto Voted Over and Over Against Getting Tough on Russia - Beto Blew It
If you think that is amusing, you have not seen anything. There are also the newsrooms that were much more in love with O’Rourke during the 2018 Senate race, who published verbose and cloying profiles, and are now baring their fangs.
GQ, for example, has already published stories critical of his 2020 campaign, including a March 18 article titled, “Beto O’Rourke Raked in $6.1 Million in One Day with No Policy Details.” The report’s subhead reads, “He’s still not sure about single-payer health care.” There is also this March 13 story from GQ: “5 Tough Questions Beto O'Rourke's Campaign Will Have to Answer.”
This is interesting, considering GQ published a mawkish, overly friendly story in 2018 that included lines such as, “This has been the summer of Beto — a giddy campaign season during which descriptive clichés like ‘Kennedy-esque’ and ‘punk-rock Democrat’ have abounded,” and "O'Rourke's strengths — his charisma and optimism — are Cruz's weaknesses." But now, GQ seems to have just discovered that O’Rourke is light on policy, prompting them to ask “5 tough questions.”
There is also Politico, which just published a lengthy expose titled, “Beto’s Long History of Failing Upward.” But during the Senate race, when Cruz stood to lose his seat, Politico got in on the plush coverage game with an article titled, “Beto-mania Sweeps Texas.”
Then there is the New York Times, whose straight-news reports on O’Rourke’s presidential candidacy have been neither overly friendly nor overly disapproving. The Times’ opinion section, on the other hand, is a different story: “The Woman You Missed While You Were Paying Attention to Beto” and “The Next President Should Not Be a Man” are fun entries on that list — especially the former, which seems like a passive-aggressive shot across the newsroom at the author of the Times’ 2018 profile on Senate candidate O'Rourke. You know, the one that makes sure to mention his “restless energy.”
The Washington Post’s news and commentary sections have also featured unflattering articles, including “Why Beto O’Rourke is struggling to rekindle his 2018 spark,” “Beto O’Rourke offers a climate change plan, but some activists say it doesn’t go as far as the Green New Deal,” and “Beto O’Rourke has a new climate plan. Here’s the right reason to dislike it.”
But back in 2018, the Post was responsible for a particularly nauseatingly sentimental bit of drivel titled, "Beto O’Rourke is a Mexico-loving liberal in Texas. Can he really beat Ted Cruz?"
There is also Yahoo News, whose recent coverage of O’Rourke has been sparse but has included this gem: “Teenaged Beto's misogynistic online posts.” This is a long way from Yahoo’s cushy 2018 profile, which included lines about O’Rourke’s “uncanny resemblance to Bobby Kennedy.” (He doesn't look anything like Bobby Kennedy.)
The media have lost that loving feeling. If they cover him at all, it's all finger-wagging and unflattering details about his flimsy personal resume.
Here love had died between the press and O'Rourke.

A 'Oz' connection Narratives, however fictional, function as reflections of our lives — in stories we see ourselves and the people we hold dear embodied in fictional characters and in the trials they face. Through them we are able to realize meaning, relate to each other, and communicate wisdom to ourselves and those we love, giving us hope and shaping our journey.
Cue the entrance of editor Peter Guzzardi's new book, "Emeralds of Oz: Life Lessons from Over the Rainbow," a fun read that outlines the author's lifelong connection with the most watched film of all time: "The Wizard of Oz." Over the years, Guzzardi sensed a lurking familiarity in things he learned working as an editor for an impressively diverse group of authors (including Stephen Hawking, Deepak Chopra, Douglas Adams). One day he realized the wisdom he had gathered paralleled the profundity that "The Wizard of Oz" held for him.
In "Emeralds of Oz," Guzzardi invites us on a journey to trace the ways in which "The Wizard of Oz" can and did capture the experience(s) of being human, and why he — along with so many others — holds the film so dear. Even if you are one of the few who has not seen the movie, all will be able to relate to the experience of looking toward a childhood story for guidance. Join us as Malaprop's Bookstore & Café hosts Peter Guzzardi and presents "Emeralds of Oz: Life Lessons from Over the Rainbow," at 6 p.m. May 16.

Emotional and honest A good short story collection should offer a reader variety, each story introducing something different and arresting. Elizabeth Geoghegan's "eightball" does this in spades.
Geoghegan's narrators bring a refreshingly blunt candor. When discussing another character in the story "Violet Hour," the protagonist states, "Her voice had that bright intensity common among world-class athletes, idealists, and vegans." Characters in "eightball" are given titles like "Cricket Boy" and "Man Bun," providing insight into how these people work within the fabric of the story.
One story in particular, titled "Mother's Day," starts off voyeuristic and dreamy and contorts by the end into heartbreak, cleverly viewing the titular holiday through a devastating, unexpected lens. This inherent realness makes each story feel honest and frank, so much so that readers may not notice that by the end of the collection they have traveled to Bangkok, Paris and Rome.
The collection also contains moments of beautiful prose. Consider this scene near the end of the titular story, a meditation on the bond between siblings: "His pale green eyes surrounded by dark lashes. His laugh when a butterfly lands on his head then takes flight again. Monarchs clutter and cull along his arms, undulating. Tiny flames lapping at his collar close to his blonde curls." Clearly, Geoghegan is more than capable of delivering stories that evoke real emotion without sacrificing real-life accountability.
Elizabeth Geoghegan will present her new book, "eightball," at Malaprop's Bookstore & Café at 6 p.m. May 18. She will be in conversation with New York Times-bestselling author Denise Kiernan, whose most recent book is "The Last Castle."

CO-FOUNDER CALLS FOR FACEBOOK TO SPLIT UP

Texto completo: Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has added his name to the list of officials, politicians and citizens calling for the social-networking giant to be broken up due to its overwhelming size and dominance in people's everyday lives.
In an expansive opinion piece in the New York Times, Hughes cited multiple reasons why federal regulators should take the same approach to Facebook as was applied to monopolies such as Standard Oil and AT&T and split the company apart. Among those reasons Hughes mentioned were Facebook's ownership of two other popular social-media platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp, and the fact that even though Facebook is a public company, Zuckerberg's 60-percent ownership of the company's voting shares leaves him with "unprecedented and un-American" power to set Facebook's direction and policies.
"Mark's influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government," wrote Hughes. "Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook's algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it."
In a statement given to this news organization, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said that the company "accepts that with success comes accountability," but that splitting up Facebook is not the answer to the issues that Hughes' raised in his op-ed.
"You don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company," Clegg said. "Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for."
Clegg said as an example of how serious Facebook sees its role in the social-networking space, Zuckerberg "is meeting government leaders this week to further that work."
Hughes has a long history with Facebook. Along with Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 when the three were students at Harvard University. Hughes said in his op-ed that he hasn't worked at the company in 10 years, but that following a series of scandals involving Facebook's use of individuals personal information, security issues and a potential $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission, he feels "a sense of anger and responsibility" about what Facebook has become, and why it should be broken up.
"I'm worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them," Hughes wrote. "The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive."
With his ties to Facebook, Hughes has become one of the highest-profile voices to call for the company to be broken apart. His views echo statements from advocacy groups that want the FTC to split Facebook up, and for shareholders to not vote for Zuckerberg to remain on the company's board of directors. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has also publicly said Facebook, along with Google and Amazon, should be broken up because they have "too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy."
U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents parts of Santa Clara and Alameda Counties, said in a statement the Hughes is "a thoughtful voice for those left out of the digital economy," and that "in retrospect, the FTC should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram & WhatsApp in 2012. I believe the way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges."
Despite his harsh words for Zuckerberg and Facebook, Hughes still called his college friend "a good, kind person." But Hughes added that "it's (Zuckerberg's) very humanity that makes his unchecked power so problematic."

The great American podcaster

Texto completo: Ira Glass, host of the hit public radio show "This American Life," is a founding father of the modern podcast movement. His signature storytelling approach -- candid, narrative, sometimes startlingly intimate -- inspired a generation of podcasters working across genres and styles.
Since launching "This American Life" in 1995, Glass, 60, also took to hosting events outside the studio, putting a face to voice and building on the program's cult following. His "7 Things I've Learned" solo show lands Saturday at the State Theatre, featuring what Glass called "a bunch of stories I tell for people's amusement."
We caught up with the public radio star to ask what podcasts he's listening to and where the medium's future lies. The conversation has been lightly edited for length.
Q: Whenever something gets big quickly, people start using the word "bubble." Do you believe there's a podcast bubble about to burst?
A: It depends on what you mean by "bubble." I think there are two things: the business side and in people's hearts. And on the business side, do I think people will get to a saturation point and feel sick of it? Yes, I do. I think that's very possible. As happens with everything. There's, what, 600,000-700,000 podcasts on iTunes right now?
Still, I don't think it's a thing where in a year or two the bubble will burst. Partly because not enough people have even heard a podcast.
Q: What do you say to those people who aren't listening to podcasts?
A: If you aren't listening to podcasts, you shouldn't feel uncool; you are the solid majority. But I'm not finding people who are like, "I hate stories." I think a lot of people who aren't into podcasts have a technological aversion to it. They don't realize there's this app and you just click a button and it pulls up 10 podcasts.
Q: Do you see that changing?
A: I do think that's changing. The majority of the "This American Life" audience is listening via podcast. We crossed over two years ago and now we have 3 million people listening to each episode as podcast, and 2.2 million listening as radio. The radio has stayed steady, but the podcast audience, which started off as nothing, sort of overtook it.
Q: What makes a good podcast? Can any story be molded into quality radio or podcast material?
A: Oh, no, of course not. My workweek is a testament to the fact that most things aren't interesting enough to be on the radio. We're constantly running up things and killing them. I do think everyone has a story to tell but everyone does not have a story to tell on the radio. You need forward motion of a plot and someone who you want to hear what happens to them.
Q: Is that what all great radio shows share, that forward momentum?
A: It's something all stories share. If your 3-year-old tells you a story it has momentum. Often they're not very gifted storytellers, no offense.
In a good or great story there will be somebody who you can have feelings about. Some stories just have a nice -- I don't really know how to say it -- it's like how a song can have a great melody. You just know this is a good one.
Q: Do you have an example?
A: One of my favorites is a Valentine's Day episode [from "This American Life"] about this couple. They'd been together since the first week of college. It's 10 or 11 or 12 years in, and they still weren't married and they start talking about it. She reveals to him that "Oh, I just kind of thought before we'd get married I would sleep with more people." And he's like, "Me too!" And so they decide to just sleep with as many people as they can for a month -- and one month turns into two months. It doesn't go well for their relationship, as you would expect.
But what makes this story so interesting as a radio piece is the guy is very frank and vulnerable in explaining what an idiot he was when they started sleeping with other people. She did the more traditional guy's thing where she'd, like, find some German tourist and take him to bed. He was just falling in love left and right and breaking people's hearts and he didn't know how to handle himself.
There's something in his telling that's very sweet. In the hands of a different interviewee, we might hate them both and have to kill it. If he had the wrong attitude about it and was kind of a jerk, you wouldn't want to hear it anyway. If he didn't have the kind of grace about telling the story and wisdom about who he was when he was younger, it wouldn't work as a radio story.
Q: What podcasts do you listen to?
A: Lately, "The Daily," the New York Times podcast which is an experiment of doing daily news as narrative. I think it's spectacularly great. Every morning I listen to it at 1 ½ times speed while I brush my teeth. It's interesting how different the stories are on the podcast than they are in the New York Times. In the newspaper, they have to lead with "here's the latest thing that happened." But in the podcast, they can take you back to the beginning. Here's where we were two years ago that got us to this point. Here are the characters involved. It really proves the power of narrative.
I'm also listening to "Reply All," this little gem about the culture of the internet, which I normally have no interest in at all. But in their hands I do.
And then I just started listening to Malcolm Gladwell's podcast ["Revisionist History"] and it's been such a pleasure. So many of the stories are about things he's genuinely angry about and it really motivates the writing and the reporting. It totally plays to Gladwell's incredible strength as a great enjoyer of things; he takes pleasure in character and detail. And he's a really great on-air performer. It's been interesting to see him become a master broadcaster in two years.

Texto completo: Geno Auriemma is "really excited" about the opportunity to take over Cavey's in Manchester, a representative from his restaurant group said Thursday.
Last week, Steve and Kate Cavagnaro announced the May 24 closing of their 86-year-old fine-dining destination, long recognized for its northern Italian and French cuisine. In a note to guests, they shared that the UConn women's basketball coach, a longtime patron and friend of the restaurant, would be opening a place of his own in the space.
"His connection to that place is so strong, and his relationship with Steve is so strong, that I think he's really excited to kind of pick up the torch and carry it forward," said Todd Stigliano, the director of business operations for Geno's Group.
Auriemma owns several Connecticut restaurants, including the flagship Geno's Grille in Storrs, with an Italian-American menu, and four basketball-themed eateries at Mohegan Sun. He has not chosen a name for the new restaurant, but it will not be another Geno's Grille, Stigliano said.
"I think it's pretty likely we will continue with Italian in some way, but we're also considering a few other things ... having a good steak program," Stigliano said. "It'll still be a fine-dining establishment. We'll create a menu that is ours, but we don't want to completely move away from the essence of the restaurant."
Geno's Group plans a mostly cosmetic renovation of the restaurant, with the goal to be open before the 2019 holiday season. Cavey's lower level, where its French menu was served, will likely become private dining and banquet space, Stigliano said.
Cavey's, originally opened by Steve Cavagnaro's grandfather in 1933, has received numerous honors and recognition over the years, including top ratings from Zagat and multiple favorable New York Times reviews. Steve Cavagnaro earned a nod from the James Beard Foundation in 2010 as a semifinalist in the Best Chef: Northeast award category that year.
The restaurant was initially listed for sale in June. Cavagnaro told The Courant in August that he had been considering "his next steps for some time now."

Texto completo: Across the country this year, according to media reports, at least eight shootings have taken place on high school or college campuses. They have occurred inside gyms and classrooms, in parking lots and school hallways.
Altogether, four people have been killed and another 17 wounded so far in 2019, according to law enforcement authorities and news media reports, with two recent shootings -- at a university in Charlotte, N.C., last week and at a school in Highlands Ranch, Colo., this week -- accounting for the bulk of the toll.
The New York Times defined a school shooting as one that occurred on campus and involved students, either as the accused perpetrators or the victims.

Texto completo: Re "Trump used tax breaks he now slams," Business, May 9
The New York Times reported that, between 1985 and 1994, Donald Trump's tax returns showed he claimed more than $1 billion in losses as a private businessman.
This may cause those of us who thought Trump was one-dimensional to concede that he has some versatility. He is not only a failure politically as president -- which everybody except his base knows -- but now, it emerges, he was also a failure economically.

Give credit where credit is due.
Roger Carasso
Santa Fe, N.M.
::
Recent reports show President Trump is not concerned about running up debt and losing more than $1 billion in his personal life.
I would like to see some reporters provide an accounting of how much he has added to the national debt with the recent tax law and how much money we have lost because of the recent government shutdown and the overall mismanagement of the executive branch.
Trump claims that the country is raking in millions of dollars because of his tariffs. Since a tariff is essentially a tax that is passed onto the consumer in most cases, I would like to see him propose a rebate to those consumers.
I will not hold my breath on that, because I really don't think he understands how tariffs and the global economy work. Hopefully, the next president will not only be familiar with economic reality, but also our Constitution.

Protect the Panamint Valley
Re "Demand for lithium presents an environmental dilemma," May 7
The controversy over mining lithium from the pristine Panamint Valley in eastern California is yet another reminder of the price that is demanded not only in service of climate change -- the batteries that power zero-emission vehicles rely on the metal -- but in providing transportation and communication needs to our rapidly growing, rapidly modernizing society.
One consideration is population growth. A recent United Nations report estimated a world population of nearly 10 billion people by 2050. A slight downturn may actually take place instead, but would it arrive too late to mitigate the damage done?
It appears that our planet needs every care-taker it can find right now while we still have exceptional and unspoiled natural wonders like the Panamint Valley. Are we not capable of living on a planet optimized for a limited population's quality of life and not limitless growth and wealth?
Jeffrey Eulberg
Reseda
::
Only four weeks ago, the L.A. Times published an op-ed article on the crying need to revise our current mining laws that date to 1872.
These laws allow for the extraction of billions of dollars' worth of valuable minerals with no royalty payments to the government. Foreign and domestic companies have long availed themselves of this loophole.
Now an Australian corporation seeks to mine valuable U.S. resources immediately adjacent to Death Valley National Park. The history of these operations has demonstrated a lack of regard for air, water, wildlife or restoration of the scarred landscapes they leave behind.
We need to say no. Congress needs to finally say no.

Stonewalling is a betrayal
Re "Administration escalates Mueller report battle," May 9
The last several years of intensifying sniping between the executive and legislative branches of our government have culminated in something close to a constitutional crisis. Now, the American people must hear the truth, regardless of what it tells them.
The president and his supporters in Congress say subpoenas for Donald Trump's tax and business records and the full report by Justice Department special counsel Robert S. Mueller III are an extraordinarily complex charade to create the grounds for impeachment. The Democrats say they want to know more about Russia's interference in the 2016 election and attempts by Trump to obstruct Mueller's investigation.
Mueller's report, in its calculated inconclusiveness, is intended to serve as the guide for getting at the truth. Sworn testimony from everyone involved is the next logical step. The House can then gauge if there is any real basis for impeachment.
Given that President Trump's side refuses to cooperate, we must ask: If there was "nothing" to investigate, then what is there to hide? If we do not get the truth, then we have been betrayed at the highest level.
Dan Linn
La Jolla
::
In 2012, the Republican-controlled House held Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt of Congress. What did it mean? Nothing.
Now, the Democrats seek to hold Atty. Gen. William Barr in contempt of Congress. What does it mean? Nothing. I think I'll take a nap now.
Jeff Whitfield
Santa Ana
::
It is a shame that Trump's well-known modesty forces him so desperately to oppose sharing with Congress and the public the unredacted Mueller report that "totally exonerates" him.
Edward A. Ruttenberg
Rancho Palos Verdes
::
If Trump and the GOP are correct -- that congressional oversight of the executive branch is a non-starter -- then why on Earth did Hillary Clinton subject herself to days of withering questioning from House Republicans on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, and other issues?

Not another tax break for parents
Re "Newsom wants to ease diaper, tampon expense," May 8
I object to Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to halt the state sales tax on baby diapers and menstrual products.
Having a child is generally a choice. The world is absolutely overpopulated with humans. Throw-away diapers are an environmental disaster. Why encourage this? What makes these commodities special to merit such a subsidy? What about adult diapers and incontinent supplies? Adult incontinent supplies are quite expensive and, getting old, unlike having a child, is not a choice.
And tampons? Are they more worthy than adult incontinent supplies or any number of items we use? Such mini-handouts seem seldom thought out by government as to whether they contribute to or detract from important community goals.
Why not keep the taxes on diapers and menstrual products and allocate the revenue to public schools? Or to programs for homeless people? Or for other urgent needs? These would benefit kids and our society much more than a minor reduction in cost for throw-away diapers and menstrual products.
Lore Spangler
Los Angeles
::
Since males cannot benefit from no longer taxing tampon sales, I have to condemn Newsom's proposal as sexist. In the spirit of egalitarianism, maybe condoms should be included on the list of items exempt from the state sales tax.

No sympathy for Uber drivers
Re "Uber drivers plan pre-IPO strike," Business, May 8
Well, well, Uber drivers went on strike Wednesday because of what they claim are unfair labor practices. Funny how Uber and Lyft drivers seemingly didn't care about taxi cab drivers losing their jobs and livelihoods.
To become a Uber or Lyft driver, you do not need a special "chauffeur's" license to serve passengers. A chauffeur's license requires a more extensive exam than a regular driver's license.
Cab drivers are also required to submit to fingerprinting and to a background check. Uber and Lyft drivers have to undergo a background check, but not fingerprinting.
I will not shed a tear for Uber drivers, nor do I have any sympathy for them.
Neil Snow
Manhattan Beach
::
As a customer, I say Uber is too expensive, especially with "surge" pricing and other extras that can more than triple the price of a ride.
Yet the drivers say they are underpaid, and the company says it lost $1.8 billion last year. The loss is especially shocking for a company with so few capital expenses, as the drivers pay the full cost of owning and maintaining the vehicle fleet.
Perhaps having amateurs drive around all day hoping to pick up fares isn't the paradigm of efficiency we thought it was.

Texto completo: Steven Spielberg and his production company Amblin Television have pulled out of the CBS hit show "Bull," months after sexual harassment allegations against the show's star, Michael Weatherly.
Spielberg’s company, Amblin Television, pulled out of the show months ago, after word of the allegations surfaced. Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw, are active in the Time's Up movement.
He and Amblin Television co-heads Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey served as executive producers on "Bull" for the first three seasons of the procedural drama. The show was renewed Thursday for a fourth season, as expected.
In December, The New York Times reported that CBS paid actress Eliza Dushku $9. 5 million to settle her claim that she was sexually harassed by Weatherly.
Weatherly told The Times he made jokes to Dushku “mocking some lines in the script” and he was “mortified to have offended her. ”
In a lengthy Boston Globe essay, Dushku wrote that the harassment was caught on camera and lasted "weeks" while she worked on the series.
Dushku, 38, said in a March Deadline interview that she met with Spielberg "and brainstormed and discussed possible solutions for this systemic imbalance of power, the abuse and harassment that we’ve been seeing and hearing and experiencing and both in our industry and beyond. ”

Vigilance Key in Fighting Anti-Semitism

Texto completo: AT THIS TIME of year, communities around the world commemorate the Shoah with Holocaust Remembrance observances. These events vary in shapes and sizes, but all carry major significance.
Every year, we become further removed from the Holocaust and the memories of the 6 million Jews senselessly murdered with the goal of eradicating every Jew in the most vicious act of anti-Semitism ever. As the population of survivors grows older, this event must never be forgotten. We, as Jews, cannot let their memories dissipate in vain.
Ironically and sadly, we are reminded every day of the disgusting anti-Semitism resonating in the world today. Synagogue shootings, swastikas painted on buildings, rabbis being attacked and Jews of all ages being subjected to countless anti-Semitic acts on a daily basis.
This does not take into account the plethora of incidents occurring on college campuses each and every day. College campuses have become an actual danger to Jewish students. Regardless of location or school size, Jewish college students are subjected to anti-Israel bias, anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish behavior. Most of these stories don't get told in the mainstream press, and we have to rely on word of mouth from friends and family to learn of these horrific episodes.
Last week, The New York Times ran one of the most disgraceful cartoons I've ever seen. That of a blind President Trump walking a dog with the face of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This blatant and disturbing act of willful anti-Semitism should have every one of us upset and outraged. This cartoon was followed up by a second, depicting a blind Netanyahu holding the Ten Commandments and taking a selfie.
The New York Times, its editorial board and those who support it should all be ashamed. The editorial board has since put forth what they consider an apology, but it was a weak attempt to right a terrible wrong.
If we do not continuously and rigorously call out anti-Semitism, it will fester until it rears its ugly head in the form of more synagogues and rabbis being attacked, as well as violent or disturbing acts against everyday Jewish people. In parts of Europe, Jews are encouraged not to wear Stars of David or kippot, nor any article of clothing indicating their Jewishness.
We, as Jews, cannot accept this!
In addition to not putting forth a reasonable apology, we should not expect a change in The New York Times' antiIsrael news coverage any time soon. As an example, if an Israeli soldier'is attacked by a knife-wielding terrorist and the soldier then shoots the terrorist in self-defense, the Times headline reads, "Israeli Army Officer Shoots Palestinian Civilian." This false narrative continues to misrepresent the situation and readers of this anti-Semitic newspaper have the fake news and not the real facts.
Israel is a wonderful country filled with amazing people doing incredible things. People of all religions, beliefs and ideas work and live together harmoniously and enjoy many advances in modern technology seldom seen across the globe. Israel is the good guy in almost every situation and its citizens are our friends and allies.
Anti-Semitism is real and all too frequent. The end of World War II is only 74 years ago. There are tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors who will tell you this anti-Jewish behavior cannot continue. Anti-Semitism has never gone away and until we stand together and say "no more," it won't go away. Anti- any group of people is not acceptable, but Jews have been the target of hatred for far too long. First it was only far-right neoNazi white supremacists, and now they are joined by far-left anti-Israel and anti-Semites like Rep. Ilhan Omar.
Regardless of your political stand, anti-Semitism is not OK. And, it is certainly not OK from an institution like The New York Times that fancies itself as a fair and respected journalistic leader. The Jewish people must be exceptionally proactive in our resistance. It's time to fight back. We must stand tall and we must do so together. *

Songs of the Jewish mystics

Texto completo: Musician Laura Wetzler has shared the stage with Pete Seeger, Odetta, Richie Havens, The Klezmatics and many other artists over the span of her career. She tours internationally, sharing original songs, Jewish music from around the world and classics from the Great American Songbook. Pete Seeger called her "one of the very best," and Bob Sherman of The New York Times said she is "vastly impressive."
Wetzler will perform in Taos on Friday (May 10) at the Taos Jewish Center, 1335 Gusdorf Road, Suite R. There will be a 5:45 p.m. Shabbat potluck and services followed by Wetzler's free concert at 7:30 p.m.
I caught up with Wetzler via email.
Tell me about the program you have planned for Taos. What kinds of music will you be performing and what can people expect from the evening?
I'm a songwriter and guitarist and I sing all kinds of music, but I'm excited to be sharing, by request, "Kabbalah Music: Songs of the Jewish Mystics," a favorite program and CD of mine celebrating lyrics by Jewish mystical poets across millennia and across continents. Many of the songs Jewish people sing all the time on the Sabbath were written by mystics. I'll be singing songs from all over the world, in English, Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), Luganda and Amharic, gathered from Jewish communities in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. I'll also be doing some original story songs, and American classics. It'll be high energy and fun, and everyone is welcome.
Where do the Judeo-Spanish songs that you play come from?
Jewish people lived in Spain from the time of the Romans and there was, in fact, a golden age of Hebrew poetry there, when Jews and Muslims and Christians lived in relative harmony, until the Spanish Inquisition came in 1492. Jews were forced to leave, or convert to Christianity, or be killed, and even when they did convert, they were victims of violence. Those who could leave took their every day, spoken, vernacular language, Ladino, a mixture of Hebrew and old Spanish, and their Ladino songs, to live in Turkey, Greece, North Africa, the Americas and the Balkans. These beautiful songs have survived this tremendous journey, many carried by mothers, who sang love songs and lullabies in Ladino to their children for 500 years. I am a protégé of the late, great Ladino master singer Joe Elias, whose ancestors escaped to Turkey in 1492. Joe taught me many songs and I learned many on my own. I'm so honored and happy to share them in Taos.
Have you been to New Mexico before? To Taos?
This is my first time in New Mexico and I'm coming to learn. I'll be doing some hiking and bird watching, but I am most interested in studying as much as I can about the cultures, history and music of this amazing place. I can't wait to meet the community. I've heard great things about the people in Taos and look forward to meeting everyone, especially other musicians.
What is your ethnic/cultural background? How does it inform the music you play?
My mother was a musician, an Italian Jewish American who became an expert in Jewish music, working at synagogues and hosting a radio program of Jewish music in New York. She passed her love of this music on to me. I was very lucky to have learned many songs as a child working with my mom. I started playing guitar and writing songs when I was 14. When she died, when I was 16, I started working professionally, teaching Jewish music and presenting concerts of Jewish music and [doing] club work in NYC, singing American blues, ballads, standards and folk rock. I got a music scholarship to Hofstra University and earned a degree in voice. My father was a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. All this influences my work today.
Tell us a little bit about your work on multiculturalism and antiracism.
My work has always had a social justice element in it, overtly or covertly. I am the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, and the granddaughter of immigrants. In Jewish culture, we have a mystical concept called tikkun olam that says the world is not yet whole and each person must do their part to help repair the broken pieces. I am touring a show now with my band called "Hold On! Songs of Resistance, Hope, and Love" for schools, colleges, community centers and interfaith groups. My father was part of a resistance movement in prewar Nazi Germany. When you know that history, you cannot help but be alarmed about what is going on today. We all have to do something. All I can do is my little bit, using music to celebrate our common humanity, our diversity and our connection. Music can lift us, strengthen us and bring us together.
You have worked as the Kulanu.org coordinator for Uganda. How has it changed you to be involved with Kulanu.org ? Have you traveled to Uganda or do you do your work remotely?
It changed my life. My volunteer work with Kulanu.org began after 9/11. For 14 years, I had the privilege of working together with Ugandan village farmers on over 25 programs, building classrooms, water, sanitation and electricity infrastructure, feeding hungry school kids, and creating economic development projects in tourism, women's empowerment, microfinance, farmer education and an interfaith fair trade organic coffee cooperative. We also led safaris that raised funds for the community. I took direction from the village leaders about what they wanted help with, and we'd work together with United States donors to get things accomplished, one classroom at a time. I would go there once a year, and do the rest working from home on my laptop. I still raise money for the Kulanu.org Deaf Education Project. It was the first appropriate schooling these rural Ugandan deaf children ever had. The kids are doing great! Kids who didn't know there were other deaf people in the world before they got to school now have language, learning and community. It only costs a total of $3,500 per year to help six deaf students from remote villages get their education. Anybody interested in the project please be in touch with me! We need your help to keep it going.
Anything else you'd like people to know about you or your music?
I'm just really excited to explore New Mexico. If anyone's interested, folks can hear lots of different music at my website: laurawetzler.com , or at CDbaby.com . I hope people join us for the concert on May 10th. I'd love to meet everybody.
For more information, call (575) 758-8615. All are welcome.

The Associated Press
ALBANY, N.Y. - New York's Senate easily approved a bill Wednesday that would allow three U.S. congressional committees to get access to President Donald Trump's state tax returns, giving Democrats a potential end-run around the administration's refusal to disclose hisfederal returns.
The bill, which now goes to the state Assembly, doesn't target Trump by name but would authorize state tax officials to release any state returns filed in New York if requested by the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation.
The vote fell along party lines, with 39 Democrats in the 63-seat Senate voting for the measure.
Republicans said Democrats should be focused on lowering the state's high taxes and improving the lives of New Yorkers, not going after the president's tax returns.
"I find that extremely troubling. This is bad public policy," said John Flanagan, a Long Island Republican who leads the Senate's GOP minority.
Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Manhattan Democrat who is one of the main sponsors, said Republicans were "misinformed" about the issue, pointing out that current federal law already allows congressional committees to request a person's tax returns from the IRS.
"The power of the Congress to see your federal taxes already exists," he said. "We're not doing anything new here."
Trump's home state is New York, where many of his business enterprises are based. Financial information in state returns is likely to mirror much of what is in his federal returns.
Federal law allows Congress to demand the president's tax returns under certain circumstances, but on Monday Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined to disclose Trump's federal returns to the Democratic-controlled House, saying the request "lacks a legitimate legislative purpose."
That refusal set the stage for a possible legal battle.
Trump: Tax write offs a 'sport' in 1980s, '90s
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged taking massive tax write offs for real estate losses topping $1 billion from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, calling it "sport" among developers like himself during that period.
Trump was reacting to a New York Times report Tuesday that his businesses lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994.
"Real estate developers in the 1980s & 1990s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted. "Sometimes considered 'tax shelter,' you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport."
He claimed the Times report was a "highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!" based on old information.

WASHINGTON -- Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.
Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month's rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.
Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.'s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.
"Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit -- and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos," staff members wrote.
It was not the first time administration has sidelined government scientists. Under President Trump, the E.P.A. has rolled back environmental protections and come under criticism for relaxing rules on toxic chemicals.
Last month, the agency weakened a proposed standard for cleaning up groundwater pollution caused by toxic chemicals. In March, it scaled back a proposed ban on a deadly chemical in paint strippers. And it has rejected a proposed ban on the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that has sickened farm workers and been linked to developmental disabilities in their children.
Even so, one former E.P.A. official said, disregarding the advice of career scientists on an issue as complex as asbestos risk was still unusual.
"It's really unprecedented for political leaders to fail to pay attention to any of the scientists in either regional offices or headquarters," said Betsy Southerland, former director of science and technology in the E.P.A. department responsible for water.
Michael Abboud, an E.P.A. spokesman, declined to address why the Trump administration had acted against the advice of the agency's in-house experts, saying in a statement, "We don't comment on deliberative intra-agency comments." He referred The New York Times to the agency's news release about the rule.
Asbestos production in the United States stopped in 2002 but it is still imported to produce chemicals used in manufacturing items like household bleach, bulletproof vests and electrical insulation. Inhaling asbestos fibers, even in small amounts, is the primary cause of a cancer called malignant mesothelioma.
Mike Walls, vice president of regulatory and technical affairs at the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade group, said his organization objected to any effort to impose a ban before the completion of a separate, congressionally mandated evaluation of asbestos. The conclusions of that review, due by December, could help determine if there will be further regulation or a ban.
He said the industries that still used asbestos in the United States operated under strict safety regulations. "The risks of asbestos can be managed," Mr. Walls said. "We ought not to be imposing regulation simply on the basis of hazard."
The internal memos show that E.P.A. staff members considered the agency's review process and the rule itself seriously flawed. They were first obtained by the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, an advocacy group, and shared with The New York Times. Their authenticity was confirmed by people inside the E.P.A.
Specifically, agency experts criticized the evaluation for studying only six fibers of asbestos, a scientific approach they said was "decades old," and said the process had disregarded other fiber types that are known to be harmful. They also criticized the review for considering only lung cancer and mesothelioma as possible harmful effects of asbestos exposure.
Of greatest concern, they wrote, was the fact that the evaluation excluded the so-called legacy effects from the mishandling of asbestos. For example, the staff members pointed to a $ 45 million cleanup of a former Marine barracks in Oregon that was contaminated with asbestos when old buildings were improperly demolished.
"Regulated industries contact E.P.A. when they have been surprised to find out that their buildings and other facilities were constructed with asbestos, when they had been assuming asbestos had been banned a long time before. If asbestos was banned, then these surprises would not continue to take place," the staff members wrote.
On Wednesday the E.P.A. assistant administrator for chemical safety, Alexandra Dunn, testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee against legislation that aims to ban asbestos. She said the agency must be allowed to finish the congressionally mandated review before taking further action in the matter.

Texto completo: He's baa aack .
After being banished from family-friendly morning TV following the release of the now-infamous " Billy Bush tape" during the 2016 presidential campaign, the TV personality is returning to the small screen.
Bush, who was the host of entertainment news magazine "Access Hollywood" for 15 years, is set to spearhead a revamped "Extra Extra" starting in the fall.
"We all have to be able to evolve as we grow," Bush said in an interview with People published Wednesday. "The guy that left the scene in 2016 was already a changed person, but I had the opportunity to grow up a little bit. Facing adversity in some way is good. And I feel I'll be better at my job than I ever was. This is my next step."
Adversity might be an understatement. In 2016, just a year into a huge promotion from "Access Hollywood" to the morning show behemoth "Today," The Washington Post published a tape from 2005 that featured Donald Trump , then the star of NBC's "Apprentice," making vulgar remarks about women to Bush on a hot mic, who had been interviewing the reality star.
"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything," Trump said on the tape, before adding, "Grab them by the p---y." Bush laughed throughout the exchange.
Less than two weeks later, Bush was out at "Today." The following month, Trump was elected president.
"I own the moment," Bush told People. "It was a bad moment. And I was in it. But one moment doesn't define your life."
Since his ouster from TV, Bush has maintained a relatively low profile. He and his wife, Sydney, separated in 2017. Later that year, Bush seemed to launch an image rehabilitation campaign that included a New York Times op-ed reflecting on the tape in the #MeToo era and an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."
"A good wallop on the side of the head makes you, changes you," Bush told People, "and I'm a better version of the man I was."

Texto completo: Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on Wednesday warned former FBI Director James Comey that he could end up at the center of a criminal conspiracy to undermine President Trump’s 2016 campaign.
"He's worried, and he should be, that Mr. Barr ... is going to look further into the genesis of the investigation of the Trump campaign," Kennedy said during an appearance on “America’s Newsroom.” "I think they’re going to find that all roads lead to Mr. Comey."
Since being fired by Trump in 2017, Comey has been a vocal critic of the president, insisting he was removed because the department, under his watch, opened an investigation into possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians seeking to influence the election.
Tweet
During congressional testimony earlier this month, Attorney General William Barr said he believes that investigation was sparked by illegal spying done by officials in the top levels of the FBI.
[Related: Comey: 'The FBI doesn't spy, the FBI investigates']
"I don't know what he’s talking about," Comey told "CBS This Morning." "The FBI doesn't spy, the FBI investigates. We investigated a very serious allegation that Americans might be hooked up with the Russian effort to attack our democracy. The Republicans need to breathe into a paper bag."
Kennedy said he and his GOP colleagues in the Senate are breathing just fine.
“It’s clear to most Americans that Mr. Comey is not and never was a law enforcement professional. He’s just a hack politician,” Kennedy said.
The president has repeatedly referred to Comey as a “liar” and a “leaker” who should be prosecuted for abusing his power at one of the country’s most powerful law enforcement agencies.
Comey often attacks Trump personally, saying he is unfit for office and should be removed.
[Also read: James Comey: Trump eating the souls of Barr, Rosenstein]
In a recent op-ed in the New York Times Comey wrote Trump’s selfishness was “eating the souls” of otherwise good officials, such as Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on Barr’s comments and other details in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as evidence that a so-called deep state worked against Trump in 2016 and sought to prevent him from winning.
Kennedy said Comey is likely to be discovered as the driving force behind that push — one that will have a lasting impact on the bureau and the American public’s trust in its political impartiality.
“Why he did what he did I don’t know,” he said. “But it is breathtaking to the extent that he has hurt the FBI ... and we need to work hard to get their reputation back thanks to Mr. Comey’s tarnishing of that agency.”

Trump rejects ‘highly inaccurate’ report that he lost more than $1B from 1985 to 1994

Texto completo: President Trump dismissed a report indicating that he lost $1.17 billion between 1985 to 1994, claiming it was “highly inaccurate.”
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump lost $46.1 million in 1985 primarily from his casinos, hotels, and retail space in apartment buildings. Additionally, the Times reports that IRS transcripts indicate he lost more money than any other taxpayer and lost a total of $517.6 million in 1990 and 1991.
Additionally, the report revealed he didn’t pay income taxes for eight years because of his financial loss.
“Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write-offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non-monetary. Sometimes considered 'tax shelter,' .... you would get it by building, or even buying.”
“You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!” Trump tweeted.
Tweet
Trump’s attorney Charles Harder has already rejected the findings of the Times’ report, and said it is “demonstrably false.” He said the information “about the president’s tax returns and business from 30 years ago are highly inaccurate.”
Meanwhile, Democrats on Capitol Hill are pushing for Trump to release his tax return information. Trump notably refrained from releasing his tax returns during the 2016 campaign, as is standard for most candidates.

DRUG COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO POST THEIR LIST PRICES IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS: The Trump administration will require prescription drug companies to post prices in TV commercials, a move that is expected to trigger lawsuits over free speech.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called the rule, released Wednesday, the “single most significant step" any administration had taken in letting the public know how much medical goods and services cost. The administration hopes that having companies list prices will cause them to go down.
"If you're ashamed of your drug prices, change your drug prices," Azar said. "It's that simple."
How it works: Drug companies will be forced to follow the rule in about two months, and it will apply to drugs that cost more than $35 for a 30-day supply of medicines. They are allowed to notify viewers that the drug may cost less depending on what type of health insurance coverage they have. The law won't be enforced by the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates drugs, but by competitors who can sue for deceptive trade practices.
The controversy: Drug companies have pushed back on the idea of posting their prices, saying that the government forcing them to do so violates the First Amendment. The pharmaceutical industry argues that list prices are different than what most consumers pay, because health insurers, hospitals, or the government negotiate what actual spending will be.
Johnson & Johnson earlier this year began posting prices for its blood thinner Xarelto ahead of the Trump administration's announcement, while others have included websites telling viewers where they could find more information about pricing. Azar made it clear in a phone call with reporters Wednesday that linking to a drug’s website, rather than posting the prices, would be a violation of the Trump administration's rule.

RIP ROBERT PEAR, NYT HEALTHCARE REPORTER: Longtime New York Times healthcare reporter Robert Pear died Tuesday in Rockville, Md., at the age of 69, following complications from a stroke. Pear wrote more than 6,700 bylines for the New York Times. “His reporting — exacting, authoritative and closely read, particularly in Washington — spoke volumes,” the New York Times wrote in his obituary.
WAYS AND MEANS CONSIDERS PAID FAMILY LEAVE: The House Ways and Means Committee for the first time on Wednesday is holding a hearing on paid family leave, a priority that has the strong backing of first daughter and senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump.
“We’re not looking for a messaging bill, but working in earnest to develop bipartisan #PaidFamilyLeave policy that can garner the votes to be passed into law...and we’re making real progress towards that goal!” Ivanka Trump tweeted Tuesday.
The hearing comes as Republicans have introduced two bills that would let new parents take from their Social Security in exchange for delaying retirement, and another proposal in the House that would allow them to use health savings accounts. Most Democrats support a plan to fund parental and sick leave through a payroll tax, as some states have done.
MANCHIN, COLLINS URGE DOJ TO RETHINK OBAMACARE STANCE: Two of the most bipartisan members of Congress teamed up to ask Attorney General William Barr to reverse course and have the Trump administration defend Obamacare in a lawsuit seeking to undo it. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., wrote in their letter that “it is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death to many of these Americans.”
OBAMACARE CUSTOMERS STAY ON EVEN WITHOUT PENALTY: An analysis released Tuesday of state exchanges, including Covered California, the Massachusetts Health Connector, and the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, found that more Obamacare customers than before are staying on their plans even despite the zeroing out of the individual mandate. In each of the states, roughly 90% of customers kept their plans, meaning that they were paying their premiums. The report didn’t detail what percentage of the customers are getting help from the federal government, but as is true every year, the majority who buy coverage from an exchange receive subsidies. Some customers pay $0 a month in premiums because the federal government takes on the costs.
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND VOWS TO NOMINATE PRO-ABORTION JUDGES IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., on Tuesday took the unusual step of formally pledging to appoint pro-abortion judges should she win the White House next year. "I’m announcing that as president, I will only nominate judges — including Supreme Court justices — who will commit to upholding Roe v. Wade as settled law and protect women’s reproductive rights," Gillibrand wrote in a blog post announcing her campaign platform.
VERMONT BACKS STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROTECTING ABORTION: Vermont approved legislation Tuesday that would modify the state's constitution to ensure women can continue to receive abortions in the case that Roe is overturned or limited. The Vermont House voted in favor of the legislation, following approval from the Senate. The next elected legislature would also need to back the amendment, and then it would have to receive approval in a statewide vote in 2022 before taking effect.
FAMILY OF ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. SAYS HE IS WRONG ON VACCINES: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Joseph P. Kennedy II, and Maeve Kennedy McKean all say RFK Jr. is “tragically wrong” to spread anti-vaccination messages. His family members say in a Politico article that his and others’ work against vaccinations for infectious diseases including measles “is having heartbreaking consequences,” and they condemned his attacks against health organizations working to reduce the rates of infectious diseases.
CDC SAYS MOST PREGNANCY-RELATED DEATHS ARE PREVENTABLE: In a Vital Signs report published Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 3 of 5 pregnancy-related deaths are caused by preventable complications including heart disease, severe bleeding, and infection. Thirteen state maternal mortality committees agreed that each pregnancy-related death, 700 annually, is due in part to insufficient access to appropriate and high-quality care, missed or delayed diagnoses, and lack of knowledge among patients and providers around warning signs. Dr. Wanda Barfield, assistant surgeon general, said access to quality care is especially limited in rural areas, and that part of the CDC’s plan is to provide women in rural areas with specialized “risk-appropriate care” which includes updated equipment and specialists who have been trained to identify possibly fatal symptoms during and even after pregnancy.
LAW ENFORCEMENT STRETCHED BY HAVING TO HANDLE TO PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES: The Treatment Advocacy Center published a survey showing the financial strain that addressing mental health emergencies have on law enforcement officers nationwide. The group surveyed 355 sheriffs’ offices and police departments across the country, most of which said they are overwhelmed by both the number of mental health emergencies they have to respond to as well as the frequent need to shuttle patients back and forth between treatment facilities. Participating offices reported about 21% of law enforcement staff time is spent responding to and transporting those in mental health crises. The survey shows that officers drove a total of 5,424,212 miles transporting individuals with serious mental illness in 2017 — the equivalent of driving around the Earth's equator more than 217 times.
LAWSUIT SETTLED TO IMPROVE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE IN DC: After years of negotiations following a 2014 lawsuit that exposed District-wide emergency preparedness flaws that would especially affect those with disabilities, the District of Columbia and disability advocacy groups have settled the first-of-its-kind case to improve disaster preparedness plans for people with disabilities. The District has approved a three-year plan that includes such measures as establishing a Disability Community Advisory Group to work on emergency and evacuation plans, making emergency information for the public more accessible for when disaster strikes, making physical accessibility a priority in emergency shelters, and creating a plan to safely evacuate disabled persons from high-rise buildings.
NAVY TO DEPLOY HOSPITAL SHIP AMID ESCALATING TENSIONS IN VENEZUELA: The U.S. Navy is slated to deploy a hospital ship, USNS Comfort, to Latin America next month to provide humanitarian medical support to countries hosting Venezuelans who have fled their home country, the Pentagon announced Tuesday. The U.S. Navy ship will engage in a five-month humanitarian mission in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, but it has yet to be determined which countries will host the Comfort during the mission.

Jay Inslee signs clean-power bill, aims to cement himself as the climate change candidate

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill Tuesday that aims for 100% carbon-free electricity in the state by 2045 and 100% coal-free electricity by 2025.
Inslee, who has centered his presidential campaign around climate change, touted the bill as evidence of his ability to lead on the issue.
“I’m really the only candidate that on day one said that I’m going to make this the number one job of my administration ... I'm the only candidate to get something done on this,” Inslee said in an MSNBC interview Tuesday. “There’s a lot of talent in the field. I’ve already identified 18 potential vice presidents.”
Hawaii, California, and New Mexico have enacted similar legislation aiming for 100% clean energy by 2045.
Achieving total clean energy is an easier task in Washington, which already has one of the cleanest electric grids in the country, than in other states or nationwide. About 71% of the state’s electric production in 2017 came from hydropower, while less than 6% came from coal, according to the New York Times. Nationwide, coal accounted for 30% of electricity generation.
Inslee’s presidential campaign last week unveiled a plan to move the U.S. to 100% carbon-neutral power by 2030 and 100% “clean, renewable and zero-emission energy in electricity generation” by 2035.
The Washington governor is not the only candidate in the crowded presidential field to propose aggressive action to address climate issues.
Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke released a plan last week to combat climate change that includes $5 trillion in investments. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are among the candidates who have signed on to the Green New Deal, the bold but vague plan championed by progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. that aims to transform the economy to address climate change.
Despite other candidates often discussing climate change, Inslee maintains that he is the leader in the field on the issue.
“Where one Washington is stalled, another is leading the way,” Inslee wrote in a campaign email to supporters Tuesday. “I want to bring that kind of Washington leadership back to Washington, D.C. It’s why I'm running – because our future can't wait.”
RealClearPolitics’ Democratic presidential primary polling average finds Inslee with 0.5% support. He has qualified for the first round of Democratic National Committee debates in June through earning at least 1% in three polls but has not yet amassed at least 65,000 individual donors to his campaign, the DNC’s alternative qualification standard.

Since leaving the group, Reginae has spent time in the studio with her dad - a move which leaves her strong fan base excited to see what's next.

Trump defiende su “trampa” para no haber pagado cientos de millones de dólares en impuestos

Texto completo: Una vez más queda en evidencia el tipo de presidente que tiene EEUU. Donald Trump defendió la forma en que logró evitar el pago de millones de dólares en impuestos durante más de diez años.
En contra de cualquier lógica el presidente Donald Trump respondió este miércoles al informe del New York Times que dijo que las cifras de sus impuestos desde 1985 hasta 1994 mostraron asombrosas pérdidas empresariales de más de 1,000 millones de dólares.
“Siempre quiso mostrar pérdidas a efectos fiscales … casi todos los promotores inmobiliarios lo hicieron, y con frecuencia volvieron a negociar con los bancos, fue un deporte”, dijo Trump en un par de tweets de la madrugada. “¡Además, la información muy antigua que se publicó es un trabajo muy incorrecto en las noticias falsas!”
Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” ……
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
….you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes….almost all real estate developers did – and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
El diario neoyorquino obtuvo la información fiscal de Trump, incluidas las impresiones de sus transcripciones oficiales de impuestos del IRS, de 1985 a 1994.
El periódico dijo que los datos extraídos de las impresiones de los recibos del IRS de Trump mostraron que perdió dinero cada año durante el período de 10 años, por una pérdida acumulada de $1.17 mil millones en total. The Times también dijo que Trump no pagó impuestos sobre la renta durante ocho de esos 10 años.
Al parecer, Trump perdió más dinero que cualquier otro contribuyente individual en todo EEUU, según el análisis de los datos de la investigación que el IRS ha compilado sobre las personas que ganan grandes ingresos.
Trump, sin embargo, sugirió que sus tácticas de “refugio fiscal” eran normales para el curso en los años 80 y 90, y dijo en sus tweets de la mañana del miércoles que los promotores inmobiliarios como él “tenían derecho a amortizaciones masivas y depreciación que, de ser así, Construyendo activamente, mostrar pérdidas y pérdidas fiscales en casi todos los casos “.
Queda claro una vez más la razón por la que Trump está inmerso en una batalla legal a muerte para evitar que se conozcan sus devoluciones de impuestos recientes, las cuales dejarían claro el origen de sus finanzas, sus nexos con gobiernos y oligarcas internacionales y demás maniobras para evitar el pago de impuestos.
Por su parte en Nueva York la legislatura estatal avanzó este miércoles un proyecto de ley que permitiría al Congreso obtener las declaraciones de impuestos estatales del magnate.
De igual forma legisladores en otros 17 estados también están tratando de obtener las declaraciones de impuestos de Trump antes de las elecciones de 2020.
Actualmente cursan en las distintas legislaturas estatales proyectos de ley que obligan a los candidatos presidenciales a hacer públicos los últimos cinco años de sus devoluciones de impuestos si quieren estar en la boleta electoral en 2020.

Texto completo: Una vez más queda en evidencia el tipo de presidente que tiene EEUU. Donald Trump defendió la forma en que logró evitar el pago de millones de dólares en impuestos durante más de diez años.
En contra de cualquier lógica el presidente Donald Trump respondió este miércoles al informe del New York Times que dijo que las cifras de sus impuestos desde 1985 hasta 1994 mostraron asombrosas pérdidas empresariales de más de 1,000 millones de dólares.
“Siempre quiso mostrar pérdidas a efectos fiscales … casi todos los promotores inmobiliarios lo hicieron, y con frecuencia volvieron a negociar con los bancos, fue un deporte”, dijo Trump en un par de tweets de la madrugada. “¡Además, la información muy antigua que se publicó es un trabajo muy incorrecto en las noticias falsas!”
Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” ……
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
….you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes….almost all real estate developers did – and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
El diario neoyorquino obtuvo la información fiscal de Trump, incluidas las impresiones de sus transcripciones oficiales de impuestos del IRS, de 1985 a 1994.
El periódico dijo que los datos extraídos de las impresiones de los recibos del IRS de Trump mostraron que perdió dinero cada año durante el período de 10 años, por una pérdida acumulada de $1.17 mil millones en total. The Times también dijo que Trump no pagó impuestos sobre la renta durante ocho de esos 10 años.
Al parecer, Trump perdió más dinero que cualquier otro contribuyente individual en todo EEUU, según el análisis de los datos de la investigación que el IRS ha compilado sobre las personas que ganan grandes ingresos.
Trump, sin embargo, sugirió que sus tácticas de “refugio fiscal” eran normales para el curso en los años 80 y 90, y dijo en sus tweets de la mañana del miércoles que los promotores inmobiliarios como él “tenían derecho a amortizaciones masivas y depreciación que, de ser así, Construyendo activamente, mostrar pérdidas y pérdidas fiscales en casi todos los casos “.
Queda claro una vez más la razón por la que Trump está inmerso en una batalla legal a muerte para evitar que se conozcan sus devoluciones de impuestos recientes, las cuales dejarían claro el origen de sus finanzas, sus nexos con gobiernos y oligarcas internacionales y demás maniobras para evitar el pago de impuestos.
Por su parte en Nueva York la legislatura estatal avanzó este miércoles un proyecto de ley que permitiría al Congreso obtener las declaraciones de impuestos estatales del magnate.
De igual forma legisladores en otros 17 estados también están tratando de obtener las declaraciones de impuestos de Trump antes de las elecciones de 2020.
Actualmente cursan en las distintas legislaturas estatales proyectos de ley que obligan a los candidatos presidenciales a hacer públicos los últimos cinco años de sus devoluciones de impuestos si quieren estar en la boleta electoral en 2020.

Texto completo: Correction: **********CORRECTION OR CLARIFICATION PUBLISHED MAY 9, 2019**********
Correction: The New York Times reported that Donald Trump reported $1.17 billion in financial losses to the IRS from 1985 to 1994. A headline on Page A3 of Wednesday's newspaper gave an incorrect amount.
Correction: **************************************************************************
WASHINGTON - Donald Trump reported $1.17 billion in financial losses to the IRS from 1985 to 1994, a massive run of red ink that kept him from paying income taxes during most of that period, according to a report published late Tuesday in The New York Times.
The Times said it had documented those losses by obtaining official IRS tax transcripts for those years, showing the figures Trump reported on his IRS Form 1040 returns. The scope of those losses was such that, "year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," The Times said.
The Times report comes a day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would not comply with a request from a House committee for more recent Trump tax returns. A 1924 law gives Congress the explicit power to request such returns, but Mnuchin said the request lacked a "legitimate legislative purpose," a stance that is expected to be challenged in court.
The White House and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent Tuesday. The Times said a private attorney for the president, Charles Harder, called its report "demonstrably false," but he had not cited any specific errors.
Until now, Trump's early career in real estate was believed to have reached a peak in the late 1980s, when Trump wrote "The Art of the Deal" - and then collapsed into loss and debt in 1990 and 1991.
The Times story shows, however, that Trump's losses began earlier. In 1985, he reported $46.1 million in losses from his casinos, hotels and other businesses, according to the report.
Those losses got worse in 1990 and 1991, as Trump's big bets on casinos, hotels and an airline all went bad.
Trump reported $517.6 million in combined losses during those years, The Times said. Because of his losses, The Times said, Trump was not required to pay income taxes for eight of the 10 years it examined.
Trump's most profitable business during this period, The Times reported, was not in real estate but in the stock market. As The Times described it, Trump would buy a company's stock, then make public statements indicating he was contemplating a hostile takeover of that company. The publicity would make the stock price rise, and then Trump - rather than buying more shares to make good on his takeover threat - would sell his stocks at a profit.
That sort of faux takeover talk earned Trump $57 million by 1988, The Times reported. But eventually, investors stopped falling for it: When Trump bought stock in American Airlines and talked about a takeover, the market didn't bite. Trump lost $34.9 million on short-term stock trades that year, The Times said.

Texto completo: President Trump - who has spent decades crafting an image of himself as a master dealmaker - lost more than $1 billion on sketchy business ventures in the 1980s and '90s, making him one of the biggest financial losers in the country, according to a bombshell report Tuesday.
Copies of Trump's personal 1040 tax transcripts from 1985 to 1994, which were obtained by The New York Times, reveal the president racked up $1.17 billion in losses for the time period, the newspaper said.
The astronomical hit was so severe that Trump avoided paying any income tax for eight of the 10 years, according to the Times. The data, printouts of Trump's official IRS transcripts with figures from his federal 1040 forms, was provided to the Times by someone who had "legal" access to it.
When compared with Internal Revenue Service information on other high-income earners, Trump "appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," the Times reported.
The startling tax details come as the House Ways and Means Committee is pressing the IRS to provide Trump's personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday, however, refused to hand them over, saying the Democrat-controlled panel's request "lacks a legitimate legislative purpose."
Mnuchin's move, though not unexpected, will likely set off legal fireworks; Democrats could either subpoena the IRS for the returns, or file a lawsuit.
Trump is the first president since Watergate to decline to make his tax returns public.
According to the Times, Trump was swimming in red ink while he was peddling his 1987 best-seller "The Art of the Deal." For example, in 1985, his core businesses reported a loss of $46.1 million, and carried over a $5.6 million loss for earlier years.
But that wasn't the only bad news.
From 1986 through 1989, the Times reported, Trump declared $67.3 million in gains from stocks and other assets bought and sold within a year. Figures show ultimately Trump lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his corporate raider boasts seriously. The Times noted Trump would talk about a takeover but then quietly sell on the resulting bump in the stock price.
"He has an appetite like a Rocky Mountain vulture," his stockbroker, Alan Greenberg, told The Wall Street Journal in 1987. "He'd like to own the world."
In 1990 and 1991, Trump's core businesses lost more than $250 million each year - more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the sampling, the Times reported. The new tax data also showed that although Trump legally used losses to avoid paying taxes on future income, those net operating losses snowballed, reaching $418 million in 1991 - 1% of all the losses the IRS reported had been declared by individual taxpayers that year, the Times reported.
Still, amid all the figures on 10 years of Trump's tax transcripts, one stood out, the Times reported: $52.9 million in interest income reported in 1989. In the three previous years, Trump had reported $460,566, then $5.5 million, then $11.8 million in interest.
The source of the starkly higher interest income is unknown, but the interest income fell about as quickly as it spiked. By 1992, he was reporting only $3.6 million, the Times reported.
The White House declined to comment on the Times report.

Texto completo: President Trump lost $1.17 billion from 1985 to 1994, according to 10 years of printouts of Trump's IRS transcripts obtained by the New York Times.
Trump's losses in the first year, 1985, totaled $46.1 million, largely from his casinos, hotels, and retail space in apartment buildings. His investments lost money every year through 1994.
Trump appears for several years to have lost more money than any other taxpayer. His worst years were 1990 and 1991, when he lost a total of $517.6 million.
During the decade, his losses did not stop him from spending. He purchased a 282-feet yacht, the Plaza Hotel, and the Eastern Airlines shuttle, while opening the Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. Trump continued to live lavishly nevertheless as he borrowed heavily and "secretly leaned on his father's wealth," according to the Times.
Trump lost so much money that he only paid income tax for two out of the 10 years.
Charles J. Harder, a Trump attorney, wrote to the Times that its information was “demonstrably false” and that the newspaper’s statements “about the president’s tax returns and business from 30 years ago are highly inaccurate.”
The information comes as Democrats in Congress are calling for the president to release more recent tax return data. The fight over Trump's tax returns has even reached the states, with California writing a bill requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns or else they will not appear on the state's primary ballots.
The law would be applied to Republicans and Democrats, but it was created in response to Trump.
"We believe that President Trump, if he truly doesn’t have anything to hide, should step up and release his tax returns," Democratic state Sen. Mike McGuire said.

Arrogant delusions and overt weakness: Susan Rice's op-ed evokes Obama's foreign policy

Texto completo: Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice's New York Times article is both mad, because it is so divorced from foreign policy reality, and maddening, because many of its criticisms against President Trump would fit President Barack Obama far better.
Rice writes that the GOP has "largely abdicated its responsibilities" to ensure that Trump keeps America safe. The implication: Republicans are sort-of traitors. Yet, Rice's ire is saved most particularly for Trump's base, or what she describes as the "voters in every state who applaud Mr. Trump’s efforts to rid the country of brown and black people." Rice offers no evidence that Trump voters want an ethnic cleansing of their fellow citizens. And Trump doesn't seem to have a very good strategy for his evil plan: His economy is producing record opportunity for minorities.
Beyond that gratuitous smear, Rice's foreign policy arguments are similarly ludicrous. She attacks Trump's support for Israel but includes not one word for his constraint of revolutionary Iran. Rice decries Trump's Venezuela policy, but only, it seems, because that policy involves sanctioning Cuba.
Helpfully, however, Rice reminds us of the Obama glory days of American leadership. Rather than trying to address the root cause of Venezuelan suffering, Nicolás Maduro, Rice suggests that "The U.S. should grant [Venezuelans in the U.S.] temporary protected status, allowing them to remain here safely until conditions improve in Venezuela." No explanation of how we will see "conditions improve."
But on Venezuela, Rice doubles down on Obama's greatest foreign policy failing: his overtly broadcast weakness. Whatever you think of using force to remove Maduro (I think it would be a mistake outside of very specific circumstances), Rice must know she is lying when she says "there is no practical military option for deposing Mr. Maduro. Bombing Caracas would kill countless innocents and a ground invasion would meet determined resistance from the Venezuelan military."
She must know, because she was the national security adviser and will have been briefed on military plans that say just the opposite.
More amusing is Rice's derision of Trump for presenting "the bogus threat of Venezuelan-style socialism invading America through the Democratic Party." Rice must have missed the 2020 Democratic memo. The party's presidential candidates are lining up to demand a government takeover over healthcare, the annihilation of our energy sector, the destruction of our most successful companies, and unconstitutional gun confiscation — or, put another way, socialism. One of the leading candidates has openly described himself as a socialist for years, and just a few years ago held up Venezuela's regime as a better example of the "American Dream" than the U.S.
Still, it is Rice's contention of Trump's motivation that is her most ridiculous. The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claims that Trump's foreign policy is only shaped by "what would help him get re-elected. Our previous commanders-in-chief," she asserts "conducted policy to advance their vision of the national interest."
Oh, really? So, what vision of national interest did Obama have when he pretended al Qaeda was no longer a threat? When he called ISIS the "jayvee team?" Or when he abandoned our French allies and U.S. credibility in face of Assad's nerve agent attacks? Or when he appeased Putin after the KGB man destroyed a passenger airliner and damaged our democracy? Or when he allowed China to steal U.S. intellectual property and a vast sea in return for a personal pledge to maybe do something about climate change starting in 2030?
On that point, it's also worth noting that Rice mentions China just once and only in passing. That omission encapsulates the foreign policy that Rice proffered: arrogant delusion matched to overt weakness.

Texto completo: CAMDEN - Top Camden County Democrats renewed their attack Monday on a task force reviewing state tax breaks awarded to city businesses.
Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr. and Camden Mayor Frank Moran joined in a call for the resignation, "effective immediately," of Ronald Chen, the task force chair.
That demand — rebuffed by a spokesman for Gov. Phil Murphy — was echoed in a separate letter by attorneys for four firms awarded tax breaks by the state Economic Development Authority.
All of the firms have ties to George Norcross III, South Jersey's Democratic power broker.
The lawyers' letter asserted Chen, a Murphy appointee, "lacks statutory authority" over the EDA and described the task force process as "tainted from the outset."
The task force also improperly imposed "arbitrary restrictions on our clients' rights to respond to false allegations against them," the lawyers wrote to Jim Walden, special counsel for the task force.
Monday's broadside began with the elected Democrats' allegation that Chen has conflicts of interest because his employer Rutgers University has received EDA tax credits.
Chen is a current professor and former dean at Rutgers Law School in Newark.
The statement claimed Chen's challenge to the EDA's tax-credit programs "at the very least creates a reasonable impression that his conduct is contrary to both New Jersey law and Rutgers' interests."
The EDA awarded tax credits worth $25 million to Rutgers in February 2017. That helped defray costs for construction of two sports training facilities and renovation of the Rutgers Athletic Center at the school's Piscataway campus.
Murphy formed the task force in January after the state Comptroller's Office released an audit critical of the EDA's programs, which were revised in 2013 to steer more money to Camden.
The Democrats' statement described task force hearings as "mock trials" and claimed Chen's role "is a blatant political exercise" that raises ethical concerns.
But a Murphy administration spokesman rejected that view.
Chen, a former state Public Advocate, "is one of the state's preeminent legal minds and his ethics are above reproach," said the spokesman Darryl Isherwood.
"Any effort to say otherwise is nothing more than a desperate attempt to muddy the water on the task force's investigation and the potential abuses of taxpayer resources it has so far uncovered," Ishwerwood said.
But attorneys for the South Jersey employers blasted the task force process as "a one-sided investigation (that) smacks of political retribution.'
It described the lawyers' clients as "the obvious targets of your 'inquiry.'"
The attorneys represent Cooper University Healthcare, where Norcross is chairman, and the top Democrat's insurance firm, Conner Strong & Buckelew Cos.
Also represented were the Michaels Organization of Evesham and NFI of Cherry Hill.
Those firms are jointly developing an office tower on Camden's Waterfront with Conner Strong & Buckelew.
The EDA is providing tax breaks worth $40 million to Cooper and $245 million for the office tower.
The letter demanded the company's representatives have a "an opportunity to submit a public presentation" at the next scheduled hearing.
In a statement after a hearing Thursday, the task force said "time constraints precluded (it) from taking public comments" but that input would be "welcomed" in the future.
The elected Democrats previously criticized Murphy on Thursday, saying they were "deeply appalled" by the administration's "relentless, unfounded and disingenuous attacks" on many of Camden's largest employers.
That came one day after Murphy said he was "deeply troubled" by two media reports on state tax breaks for Camden businesses.
The governor asserted the stories showed the need for "a total revamp of the tax incentive program."
One of the stories, published Wednesday by the New York Times, detailed points about Camden projects that were made the next day in witness testimony before the task force.
Those points included the role of Mount Laurel attorney Kevin Sheehan in obtaining tax breaks for two firms, Holtec International and Subaru of America, that moved to Camden.
An attorney for Sheehan's firm, Parker McCay, also was among those signing Monday's letter to Walden.
The second news story, reported jointly by WNYC and ProPublica, noted more than $1.1 billion in tax credits went to Camden firms with ties to Norcross and to his allies in business and politics.
Advocates say the generous tax breaks to Camden firms — worth about $1.6 billion in all — have attracted economic development to the city.
But Murphy has said the EDA's programs should be reviewed.
"Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for," the governor said in a statement Wednesday.
The South Jersey Democrats last week also said Murphy's "invective has been particularly targeted at Camden companies" and noted much larger credits have gone to North Jersey firms.
They suggested the governor "may be holding Camden, and the business community, hostage to get his massive tax increases through the legislature."

'Heartbeat bills' wholesome provocations in abortion debate

Texto completo: While constitutional lawyers, ethicists and theologians -- in descending order of importance in the abortion debate -- have been arguing in the 46 years since the Supreme Court attempted to settle the debate, some technologists have been making a consequential contribution to it. They have developed machines that produce increasingly vivid sonograms of fetal development. This concreteness partially explains the intensification of the debate.
Six states have passed "heartbeat bills" to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, approximately six weeks after conception. Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the courts Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb -- which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should "viability" be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are "viable" in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial (Dec. 28, 2018) opposing the idea that "a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person" spoke of these living fetuses -- that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction -- as "clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings." Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective "viable," and look at a sonogram of a 10-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a "cluster of cells" or as a baby? The cluster-of-cells contingent resembles Chico Marx in the movie "Duck Soup": "Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"
The "heartbeat bills" are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, the Kansas Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution -- "All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" -- a reason to overturn the state's ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus.
In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that not even that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democrat-controlled states.
In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required, in the rare cases in which a child survives a botched abortion procedure, that the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, which was neither a constitutional nor political possibility. Rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And: Would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, Lincoln thought, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates, practicing Lincolnian prudence, consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford). And confining a morally objectionable practice is a worthy, albeit not fully satisfying, objective.
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother's stomach. (Most European nations restrict abortions by at least week 13. France and Germany are very restrictive after 12, Sweden after 18.) The court's new composition has encouraged some pro-life advocates in their maximum hope, that Roe can be overturned, which would not proscribe abortion but would restore its pre-1973 status as a practice states can regulate. That is not a foreseeable possibility; a more nuanced abortion regime is.

Texto completo: 1. You won't find limited TV series much more grueling than HBO"s “Chernobyl," a five-parter that premieres on Monday at 9 p.m. It's a look at the 1986 nuclear disaster in the Soviet Ukraine, and in particular how the Kremlin repeatedly chose to ignore science for political reasons, just as certain governments currently choose to ignore climate change science. But it's a well-made and essential cautionary tale about the culture of disinformation, featuring fine performances by Jared Harris and Emily Watson as the scientists.
2. Every year, social media plotzes over the drag that celebrities wear to the annual Met Gala , a benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Birds of Paradise, Peacocks, Puffins, and Macaws, they all come strutting down the red carpet, their chests forward and their plumage freshly groomed. It's a parade of pretty people in gawky frocks. This year's red carpet event, on Monday, will air live on E! starting at 5 p.m..
3. Old friends meet up for a birthday event vacation in Napa Valley and things go awry. But really who cares because: Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Tina Fey, Paula Pell, and Maya Erskine from “PEN15." The movie “Wine Country," directed by Poehler, is available Friday on Netflix..
4. I'm a sucker for you, Emma Thompson, who hosts “Saturday Night Live" with musical guests the Jonas Brothers.
5. Former FBI director James Comey is marking the second anniversary of his firing by President Trump by having a CNN town hall, moderated by Anderson Cooper. Will he be asked about his recent op-ed in The New York Times in which he described how Trump's amorality sparks the worst in those around him, such as Attorney General William Barr? As he put it, “Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites." The town hall is Thursday at 8 p.m.
6. “State of the Union" follows Louise and Tom — played by Rosamund Pike and Chris O'Dowd — as they meet in a pub before their weekly marital therapy sessions. Each of the 10 episodes is only 10-15 minutes long, and they air nightly at 10 on Sundance. Crucial information: Author Nick Hornby wrote the series, and Stephen Frears — “The Grifters," “The Queen," “A Very English Scandal" — directed it.
7. Two documentary series feature familiar Massachusetts stories this week. On Tuesday at 10, ABC's “1969" will dig into the case of Mary Jo Kopechne and Senator Ted Kennedy. And then on Saturday at 9, Reelz's “Real Story Of…" will feature the Boston Strangler case.
8. The British podcast “My Dad Wrote a Porno," in which Jamie Morton shares the amateur erotic novels his father writes under the pen name Rocky Flintstone, is getting a TV special. HBO is airing a live show filmed in London, on Saturday at 10p.m.
9. Think “Lord of the Flies," or “Survivor," as a group of teens are mysteriously transported to a facsimile of their New England town and fight to survive. The 10-episode first season of “The Society," due Friday on Netflix, stars Kathryn Newton and is written by Chris Keyser (“Tyrant," “Party of Five") and directed by Marc Webb (“500 Days of Summer," “The Amazing Spider-Man").

Trump's new 'nasty' woman: Kamala Harris

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
"Nasty."
When President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Sen. Kamala Harris was "probably very nasty" in her questioning of Attorney General William Barr at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, he brought back sharp memories for many Democrats. During the final presidential debate in 2016, Trump described Hillary Clinton as "a nasty woman," a phrase that drew disgust from many critics, spawned countless memes and merchandise and became a feminist rallying cry.
Trump's latest use of the adjective, in an interview on the Fox Business Network, was part of a wider attack on the three Democratic presidential candidates who sit on the Judiciary Committee, all of whom questioned Barr at the hearing.
"How about these three people?" Trump said, in an apparent reference to Harris and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
"You have three of them running against me, and they're up there ranting and raving like lunatics, frankly," he said. "They don't care about this. They're just looking for political points."
It was the second time in a week Trump had used the word "nasty" to describe Harris. Last Thursday, when Fox News host Sean Hannity asked him for his thoughts on the senator, Trump said, "I think she's got a little bit of a nasty wit, but that might be it."
Asked Thursday on CNN about why Trump had chosen to describe her as "nasty," Harris chose not to speculate, saying, "God only knows."
Instead, she drew a broader contrast with the president.
"We have a president of the United States whose primary interest, I think, that has been clear as a result of what we know as a result of the Mueller report, his primary interest has been to obstruct justice," Harris said.'."My primary interest is to pursue justice. You can call that whatever name you want, but I think that's what the American people want in a leader."
Harris was pointed in her questioning of Barr at the hearing Wednesday, which centered on his handling of the special counsel's report. She displayed her prosecutorial style from her days as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, rattling off questions and repeatedly cutting hirn short. At one point, she prodded Barr into saying that he had not examined the underlying evidence before deciding not to charge the president with obstruction of justice.
Several Democrats, including Harris, have called on Barr to resign. In the interview Wednesday, Trump called those demands "ridiculous."
Trump has previously offered a measure of praise for Harris. Asked who he believed to be the Democrats' "toughest candidate," in an interview with The New York Times in January, Trump said: "Somebody that you think would be the least tough is the toughest. I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris. I would say, in terms of the opening act, I would say, would be her."

Trump names Mark Morgan, former head of Border Patrol, to lead ICE

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday named Mark Morgan, a former Obama administration official who has aligned himself with some of Trump's hard-line positions on border security, as the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Morgan served as the Border Patrol chief at the end of the Obama administration, and was also previously an FBI agent. He will lead the agency that arrests, detains, and deports people who are in the United States illegally, after Trump last month withdrew his previous nominee, Ronald D. Vitiello, saying he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher direction."
The move continues a leadership churn at the Department of Homeland Security as Trump seeks to overhaul the department. In recent weeks, the president has forced out multiple top officials, including former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
Though Morgan served in the Obama administration, he has backed some of Trump's tougher immigration positions.
In an interview on Fox News on April 15, Morgan said he supported Trump's suggestion that he might send migrants crossing the border to so-called sanctuary cities that are defying a crackdown by ICE.

Stretch of road in LA renamed Obama Boulevard
A stretch of road in Los Angeles has been renamed after former President Obama.
A concert and ceremony Saturday unveiled Obama Boulevard. The street replaced Rodeo Road, a 3½-mile street that runs across the city's historic black neighborhood. It also intersects with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and further establishes a "presidential row" that includes Washington, Adams, and Jefferson boulevards.
"I get to live in a lifetime where we elected our first black president," the Rev. Russell Thornhill of South Los Angeles told KABC TV. "I get to share that with my mother, who's 92 years old who voted and actually went to the inauguration. I called her before I came here to let her know what I was doing, and she was just in tears because she was seeing in her lifetime . . . the naming of a street of the first black president in this community."
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti noted at Saturday's ceremony that Obama Boulevard is in a section of the city that has a number of other streets named after presidents, the Los Angeles Times reported.
A couple who proposed the name change told the Times they wanted to raise the profile of the road, attract more funding for the Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw neighborhood, and honor the 44th president.

Buttigieg, husband attend Carter's Sunday school class
Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, joined the large crowd at former President Carter's Sunday school class in rural southern Georgia.
At Carter's invitation Buttigieg stood and read from the Bible as part of the lesson at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains.
"You know him?" Carter had said earlier in reference to Buttigieg, drawing a laugh from the crowd.
The South Bend, Indiana, mayor later tweeted: "I was humbled to meet with President Carter in Plains, Georgia today. He is a true public servant and America is blessed for his continuing leadership." The Buttigieg campaign said in a statement that he had lunch with Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, and "enjoyed a conversation about topics ranging from faith to the rigors of the campaign trail."
Carter, 94, said he knew Buttigieg from working on a Habitat for Humanity project in Indiana where the mayor volunteered.

Sanders calls for breaking up big agriculture monopolies
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday proposed a sweeping agriculture and rural investment plan to break up big agriculture monopolies and shift farm subsidies toward small family farmers.
"I think a farmer that produces the food we eat may be almost as important as some crook on Wall Street who destroys the economy," Sanders said during a campaign event in Osage, Iowa, a town of fewer than 4,000 people. During his speech, Sanders outlined the dire circumstances confronting rural America — population decline, school and hospital closures and rising addiction and suicide rates — as the impetus for his policy.
His plan includes a number of antitrust proposals, including breaking up existing agriculture monopolies and placing a moratorium on future mergers by big agriculture companies. He would also ban "vertically integrated" agribusinesses — companies that control multiple levels of production and processing of a product.

Trump makes Russia issue worse, Klobuchar says
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on Sunday sharply criticized President Trump's response to Russian interference in US elections, saying that he "makes it worse by calling it a hoax."
Trump had a lengthy phone call Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. After being asked by reporters whether he raised the issue of election interference, Trump acknowledged, "We didn't discuss that."
Klobuchar accused Trump of dismissing the seriousness of the issue. "This was actually an invasion of our democracy, OK?" she said on CNN's "State of the Union."
In a Friday tweet, Trump said he and Putin discussed the "Russian Hoax," referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Texto completo: The shabby, endless Jussie Smollett story has at least taught us one thing:
Anyone can petition the courts for the appointment of a special prosecutor and subpoena big shots to appear in front of a judge.
I, for one, was misled by the fact that Sheila O'Brien, the woman behind the effort to bring Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx to account for her handling of the Smollett case, was not just anyone, but a retired Illinois appellate court judge.
I assumed she had special standing in the legal system to formally issue a call for the appointment of a special prosecutor, but no. "I'm just a private citizen," she said when I reached out to ask about it. Her initiative was put on hold Thursday when Cook County Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. agreed to consider O'Brien's demand that he recuse himself from the case because his son works as a prosecutor in Foxx's office.
"I'm just a private citizen acting as a private citizen," she said. "It's actually a user-friendly system if you know your way around it. If you have a case, you can subpoena people -- I served mine myself -- then they can file to have the subpoena quashed (as Foxx has), and it goes from there."
Citizen O'Brien, like a lot of her fellow citizens, including me, still wants to know why Foxx abruptly dropped a seemingly strong case against TV actor Smollett alleging that he staged a high-profile hate crime against himself. Foxx and her office have offered various partial and unsatisfactory explanations, giving rise to the view that Smollett got special treatment because he's a celebrity (or was until this story turned his name into a punchline).
She may well fail. Foxx is contesting O'Brien's call, citing the precedence of an ongoing review by the county's independent inspector general.
This would all be so much simpler and faster if Foxx would just open up in a lengthy interview. But that is not her way.

Ignorance is an excuse ... to go ahead with impeachment
"Trump has done nothing wrong!" "Mueller has exonerated him, so let it go!" "What part of 'no collusion, no obstruction' don't you understand?"
Angry messages like this from supporters of Donald Trump came quickly and furiously in response to an item in my column last Sunday in which I laid out the reasons House Democrats should begin impeachment proceedings even though Senate Republicans would be certain, ultimately, to acquit the president.
Now, I get the argument that says Trump's transgressions aren't worth the political upheaval of commencing a futile effort to remove him from office. I get the argument that says we should leave the question of Trump's fitness for office up to the voters in November 2020.
I don't agree with those arguments, but I respect them as considered differences with my own view. But what I don't get and can't respect is the argument that special counsel Robert Mueller's report supports the contention that Trump has followed and respected the law while in office.
In fact, Mueller's report lays out at least 10 incidents that smacked of an effort to obstruct the investigation into the Trump campaign's involvement with Russians who interfered with the 2016 election.
Let me leave it to Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, a former judge, to sum up the highlights:
Mueller found that Trump attempted "to slow down, impede, negate, or interfere with the investigation," Napolitano said in a recent online-only commentary. "That's a serious allegation of criminal activity. So when the president asked his former (deputy national security) adviser K.T. McFarland to write an untruthful letter to the file knowing the government would subpoena it, that's obstruction of justice. When the president asked Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, to get Mueller fired, that's obstruction of justice. When the president asked his then-White House counsel to get Mueller fired and then lie about, that's obstruction of justice. When he asked (White House counsel) Don McGahn to go back to the special counsel and change his testimony, that's obstruction of justice. When he dangled a pardon in front of (his former attorney) Michael Cohen in order to keep Cohen from testifying against him, that's obstruction of justice."
Mueller cagily explained that "fairness concerns counseled against" directly accusing the president of crimes because Justice Department guidelines say that a sitting president can't be indicted. So making such an accusation would deprive Trump of the "opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator," he wrote.
He also wrote, "If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment."
The wrathful notes in my in-box have been telling me that the thinly veiled implication here has eluded a great many people. And that it was an effective strategy for U.S. Attorney General and volunteer Trump surrogate William Barr to spin the report as more or less an exoneration of the president before he released a redacted version of it April 18.
But in fact "this moment has found us," as U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, told The New York Times. "We cannot ignore it. We cannot wish it away. ... This is why we have a House of Representatives. And this is absolutely what our founders imagined when a president did these sorts of things."
The best and perhaps only way for Democrats to fill the information vacuum created by Barr and sustained by incurious Trumpkins is to plunge ahead with impeachment proceedings that will fully air the evidence against Trump in advance of the voters' judgment next year.
The "Trump has done nothing wrong!" crowd ought to be enthusiastic about this opportunity for actual vindication and thrilled at the prospect of a political face-plant by the Democrats.
Yet they're not. They're foaming at those of us encouraging the Democrats to be bold.
I don't wonder why.

Texto completo: Joe Biden finally stopped drawing out his decision to enter the presidential race to confront Donald Trump in 2020. He was the 20th Democratic candidate at that point.
According to a Morning Consulting/Politico poll, Biden is not only leading the rest of the Democratic field, but he also has an edge over Trump at this point. The poll found: "Biden leading the president by eight percentage points in a hypothetical matchup, 42% to 34%. Biden has a significant edge over Trump among women (17 points), millennials (22 points) and independents (10 points)."
This is welcome news for many Democrats, particularly established ones, whose main, if not only, objective is to defeat Trump.
Biden is a solid candidate with years of experience, but, like many candidates, he has pros and cons. He has a long legislative history of congressional leadership, and has evolved in the right direction on some important issues. But he also has a history of being "handsy" with women, did not treat Anita Hill terribly well during her testimony at Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearing and led the charge on the disastrous 1994 crime bill.
People will have to wrestle with his history as they wrestle with the history of other candidates, or for the younger candidates, a lack of long history.
But there is part of the Biden enthusiasm, and to a lesser extent the energy around candidates like Bernie Sanders, that focuses too heavily on the fickle white, working-class swing voters and is not enough focused on the party's faithful.
Barack Obama ran phenomenal campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and there is no doubt that choosing Biden, an elder white man, helped grease the skids among a certain section of white working-class voters. But, these are the same people who in the next breath - or next election - could reverse course and vote for a flagrant white supremacist.
These people are not experiencing conversion, they are being coddled. Democrats want to hold constant their support from women and minorities even as they chase the votes of people hostile to the interests of women and minorities. What does it say that the Democrats lust after disaffection rather than rewarding devotion?
Democratic candidates would be much better served focusing on energizing new voters among constituencies amenable to this philosophy and these goals, rather than bending to accommodate voters who vacillate between open contempt for those interests and begrudging countenance of them.
The way people obsess over white, working-class voters, one would think that they are an overwhelming portion of the electorate. They aren't.
A 2017 study by Johns Hopkins University researchers Stephen L. Morgan and Jiwon Lee found that non-Hispanic white voters totaled 69.3% of the electorate in 2016. The percentage of that total who were working class was just 18.6%.
Conversely, blacks and Hispanics together, voters who overwhelming and consistently support Democrats, accounted for 20% of all votes cast in 2016.
Furthermore, according to exit polls, the Democratic presidential candidate hasn't won the white vote in the whole history of those polls being conducted.
And yet, we are fated to an unending obsession about courting those voters, about their worries and anxieties, about their propensity to angrily storm off if they don't feel properly exalted and centered.
At some point, the leadership and the front-runner are going to have to explain to women and minorities why their inordinate focus on white, working-class voters is justified, and that explanation will have to extend beyond, "It's the only way."
That explanation no longer has currency. "Anything to defeat Trump" is also not a soothing elixir. At some point, the loyal constituencies will demand to know: "What's in it for us, specifically?" And I don't blame them.

Bill Barr goes to Hell. And finds a client.

Texto completo: There is no second day of the testimony of William P. Barr because William P. Barr has decided not to appear before the House Judiciary Committee. So, to him, it comes as a surprise to find himself in a limousine on his way to testify.
"Testify where?" he asks, sounding a bit snitty. The figure in the front does not turn. "I told the House 'no.' "
"After seeing your performance Wednesday," the driver says, "my boss wanted you to come testify on his behalf, as well."
"Your boss?"
"Call him Individual-0, if you like." He holds up a tiny plastic bag with what look like some dirty coffee grounds in it. "Here, do you want the remnants of the credibility of the Justice Department? If not, I'm going to toss it next to the little chunk that is all that remains of John Kelly's soul."
Barr chuckles nervously. "Now, look, uh, nobody's been eating anybody's souls, no matter what that showboat Comey says in the New York Times."
"One of the best tricks Individual-0 ever pulled," the figure says. "Ensuring that people who are right are often also extraordinarily annoying. Enough. Just do what you did Wednesday. It was perfect."
"Who is the client?"
"What would you say if it were the Night King?"
"I would say he was within his rights to try to protect himself and that the creation of an army of wights was well within the scope of his power and a logical step for a man who believes he has done nothing wrong."
"What would you say if it were Sauron?"
"A man is entitled to try to hang on to his jewelry."
"Then you should have no trouble."
Barr then is in another hearing room. It is about the same as in Congress, only the light all feels artificial, as though it is deep underwater, seen through feet of smeared glass. The walls of the room seem to heave and breathe and perspire.
Barr is in the midst of talking. There is a Bible in front of him, but for some reason, he does not wish to touch it.
The words are drawn up and out of him.
"I have not read the full evidence," Barr says, "but I am confident this so-called Good Book largely exonerates my client. The serpent did no wrong."
There is a noise like a thousand flies buzzing with satisfaction, and like Reince Priebus trying and failing to swat them.
"There isn't any law against offering people free apples. Though it could be argued that those apples were planted there by his opponent and, thus, any attempt to use them to indict him is fruit of a poisoned tree. In fact, the real question is why a nude woman was trying to take ownership of a garden. The real question is what she was trying to cover up afterward."
All around, a thousand pig heads nod on the ends of sharpened stakes.
"All these allegations that they saw him transform into a serpent are just mind-bendingly bizarre, and I don't know why they were spying on him. 'Spying' is not a pejorative term."
There is the sound of someone perhaps attempting to ask a question, then an enormous crunch.
"Did he try to lead people into temptation? I am struggling with the word 'temptation.' I will spend up to 40 days struggling with it. Tempt? Did he tempt people? I'm sorry, I do not know what the word means. I am confused. Did he suggest that people do bad things? What is bad? I am sorry, I have forgotten the meaning of all words. I have forgotten even myself. I am just a little baby who has gotten here for the first time today. No word carries any value or meaning. I say them and they flutter away and I forget them, like instructions from a president."
The room seems to be getting darker. The buzzing is louder. The darkness is nearer to where he stands, and from it comes another crunch and a satiated hiss.
"Yes, I am familiar with the people who have called him directly and personally responsible for every bad thing that happens, and who have castigated me for my willingness to serve as his personal defender. But afterward, I called them on the phone and they said they did not mean it. They said really they were upset because of the way it was talked about. They regretted denouncing me. I wish that instead of the evidence of all the derogatory things they said publicly in writing, you had evidence of all the good things that they said afterward, definitely in secret, where only I could hear them. And my client, who hears all things. No matter where we are." The light is gone. His voice echoes. "Where are we?"
If this were a nightmare, the sound would wake him. But it has not awakened him yet.

Texto completo: I can't recall exactly who the first one was, but I believe the first one that I know of to have a doctorate degree in the following of the Hon. Elijah Muhammad was Dr. Lonnie Shabazz from Washington, D.C.
Maybe Dr. Salaam, who was a dentist, maybe they came in around the same time. But I think Lonnie Shabazz was before him, coming in earlier.
The head of the school, when I was a high school student, was Bro. James Shabazz, and he was only a high school student; he never had any college education. So the head of our school had no college education but was a very devoted, excellent teacher.
And I used to think about that and I'd say, "Well, Master Fard sure used some masterful psychology on us" - calling us the "University of Islam" and we didn't even have a college teacher with any college education - teaching the high school.
I used to think about that and I'd said, "He was some kind of man.'" He really could stretch it and get results. Until I did some reading on the history of the founding of African American colleges and found that most of them had no college man over those institutions.
They were not college graduates themselves, but they started colleges and did a great work. So that seems to go for practically everything that Fard did that seemed like he was doing it first.
He wasn't doing it first. He just found (it) in history. He studied; the man was very wise. He studied what had already occurred in our people. And he just took it out and used it in such a powerful way to empower us, to make us feel strong and valuable and powerful.
He did a masterful job, there's no doubt about it - even calling the white man a devil. We think, "Oh Master Fard, he told us the white man was the devil." No, it was a slave that associated the white people with devils, named Julia, long before Master Fard ever came.
It's written in a book that she said, "You all look like G-d in the face." Now, what did she mean by that? They gave her the picture of Jesus Christ and said that was G-d.
And she was saying, "You all look like him (Jesus) in your face, but you're the devil in your hearts." That's what she said about them, You're the devils in your heart."
But she's not the only one. You should listen to what Frederick Douglass said. Frederick Douglas said, You all claim Jesus, you claim to be Christians and claim Jesus Christ, but your behavior is such that would shame a nation of savages." That's what Frederick Douglass said.
So Mr. Fard wasn't the first one to attack the credits of white folks. Others had attacked those credits. And I can go on to more. There's the big preacher, Father Divine. When he said "Father Divine," was he saying he was G-d?
Father Divine. Divine is G-d. Anything divine is godly, isn't it? You can use it very loosely, and it won't mean G-d, you know? But if you use it seriously, it's supposed to mean G-d.
And he was using it very seriously. He told his following, "If you want to see Jesus, look at me." That's what he told his followers. And this was before Mr. Fard introduced his teachings.
So when you study exactly - without even being trained but with my own intelligence; the Hon. Elijah Muhammad and Clara Muhammad, the leaders of the Nation of Islam who were associated with me and my family, who became so close to us they were like uncles or aunts to us; that environment that I was in, including my own family - my older sisters and brothers and other relatives in the family, they gave me a kind of circumstance or an environment that made me a very special guy.
See, you are the product of your environment. I don't care who it is you're talking about. The Imam here, to my left, Imam Yusuf Saleem - before he came to the Nation of Islam, if we want to know what produced him, we have to study his environment: his parents, the house that he was raised up in, where he lived.
But not only that, everything close to him; his close friends, the involvements that he had that were close to his life.... When you study all that, then you'll understand what produced Yusuf Saleem, the man who was not Yusuf Saleem but Joseph - before he joined the Nation of Islam.
If you want to know what accounts for the man that he is now, you have to know that. And in addition, you have to know what has impacted his life since he became a member of the Nation of Islam and now with us.
If you can do that, you can write his blueprint. You can draw a blueprint to reproduce him; you have a pattern on him.
Well, without me going to a higher institution to learn this, this is just naturally in my mind. And because of the circumstances I was put in, to make me think a certain way, I was able to go back and do research.
I studied that time that Mr. Fard came in, and I studied what he taught. And I made the connection for what he taught, and what was happening in his time. And that caused me to really see him.
I think nobody in this community, then and now, know Mr. W.D. Fard or Mr. Fard Muhammad like I know him. Nobody! No sir, you don't know him. But G-d has revealed him to me. I know him.
G-d has guided me to what will make me know him, and G-d has also made me understand things that he said and did that helped me to know him. I know him very, very well.
And he did a masterful job, and we don't want to play down the importance of his work. We want to preserve and respect the importance of his work.
They accuse me of being the one who did away with everything, but if you read what these learned people are saying, quoting me and talking about me, and giving it to the general public, like in the New York Times and in other publications - there's a magazine coming out soon, produced I'm told mainly for bookstores.
It might be in Borders; you can get it from there. It's called T and the World." And this writer is sharing with the readers, the public, the important things that have happened in my life to shape me and make me the person I am.
If you do a worthy work and you remain sincere, you don't have to worry about it being preserved. G-d will preserve it. Allah, Most High, will have it preserved.
And I knew that as long as we just stayed within the walls of the temple or the mosque, or masjid, and did our work just among ourselves, we wouldn't be protecting it for the future.
The history of our people tells us that we keep things too private, and our children go out and they leave us with nobody to inherit it. Leaders sometimes go back or go in the streets, just give it up.
Nobody's valuing it enough to preserve it for generations to come. So I feel that the best way to protect us from that, being in a situation like that in the future, was for me to take my ministry out of the Nation of Islam. And that's what I did.
I established my own ministry out of the Nation of Islam. And right now I'm established outside of ASM (American Society of Muslims), though I'm a spiritual leader for ASM.
My ministry is separate from ASM, WDM Ministry, or The Mosque Cares office, which is a legal name now for The Mosque Cares office. It's separate. It's on its own. It's a separate legal entity.
So G-d is saving our good works and preserving it for generations to come. But at the same time, I've been working with you all, too, pressuring you all to take it serious and to not trust your history to writers who are not you, not one of you.
You haven't done anything yet, but I think you'll do something before I'm gone. I hope that I'll be able to read it. I may be so old and blind, I can't even read it. I may have to say, "Read it to me, brother."
I don't expect to live that long, though. I don't think I'd get that decrepit. I think I'll just stop eating and die. No, I like life. I don't like to hang around.

Texto completo: Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, mocked former President Barack Obama after it was reported he was very unhappy after Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
"More trouble in paradise," Conway tweeted Thursday evening.
Tweet
The news comes from New York Times Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker’s new book Obama: The Call of History. In the book, he reports Obama was shocked at the outcome of the 2016 election because he thought there would be "no way Americans would turn on him” and “[h]is legacy, he felt, was in safe hands."
When Clinton did lose because of her “soulless campaign," Obama reportedly took it as a personal insult. After Obama met President-elect Trump, he told speechwriter Ben Rhodes he “peddles in bullshit.”

Florida passes bill mandating felons pay outstanding fines before they can vote

Texto completo: After Florida voters last year approved a constitutional amendment restoring formerly incarcerated felons' voting rights, Republicans in both chambers have passed a provision requiring they pay any outstanding court fees and fines before they can vote.
The amendment, which excludes those convicted of murder and felony sexual assault, would give up to 1.5 million people with felony convictions the ability to vote.
The bill approved by the Florida statehouse gives felons who owe three options: pay in full; obtain a court’s dismissal of the financial obligation, if the person who is owed agrees; or convert the obligation to community service and complete those hours.
"Basically, they’re telling you, ‘If you have money, you can vote. If you don’t have money, you can’t,’" Patrick Penn, 42, who spent 15 years in prison for strong-arm robbery and a violent burglary, told the New York Times. Penn said he does not know if he owes money, but he said "that’s not what the people voted for."
The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, among other groups, has voiced its opposition to the added measure.
Tweet Tweet
The debate over felon voting rights has become an issue in the 2020 Democratic primary. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently voiced his support of giving incarcerated felons, even those convicted of terrorism and sexual assault, the right to vote.
"If you commit a terrible crime, you're going to pay the price," Sanders said at a rally in Fort Worth, Texas, last month. "But that does not mean that your right to participate in our democracy is taken away from you."
"Once you begin taking away somebody's right to vote, you're moving down a slippery slope. 'You committed a crime, you can't vote. You're poor, you can't vote,'" Sanders added.

Leonard Pitts: The man of 10,000 lies

Texto completo: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the referees.”
Admittedly, that is not quite how the famous line from Shakespeare’s “Henry VI” goes. As you may recall, it was actually the lawyers whose demise was proposed.
But though no one is known to have uttered the words above, they still neatly encompass the strategy conservatives have long used against the so-called “liberal media.” Namely, undermine them — and thus, their ability to act as arbiters of truth — with relentless attacks on their credibility.
No less an authority than conservative pundit Charlie Sykes admitted as much in a 2016 interview with journalist Oliver Darcy. “We’ve basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers,” he said of himself and his conservative colleagues.
Sykes spoke during the 2016 campaign when people were still stunned at the barrage of untruths spewing from the Republican candidate.
“We’ve created this monster,” said Sykes, adding that, “At a certain point, you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible (news) outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that.”
In related news, Donald Trump told the 10,000th lie of his presidency Friday. This, according to The Washington Post, which maintains a database of all the times Trump has exaggerated, distorted or misled.
Ten thousand.
Feels like there ought to be a statue, or something. And what does Trump lie about? Pretty much everything.
He lies about the border wall, claiming it is now being built. It isn’t.
He lies about his tax cut, claiming it was the biggest in history. It wasn’t.
He lies about the Mueller report, claiming it exonerates him. It doesn’t.
Indeed, the very same weekend he notched his dubious milestone, Trump told a particularly gruesome whopper about supposed legislation empowering a new mother and her doctor to “determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”
And how did The New York Times respond to this flaming canard? It called it “inaccurate,” which raised something of a stink on Twitter. That’s not surprising. Calling that hogwash “inaccurate” is like saying the Titanic was “delayed.”
The Times is not alone; most news organizations have resisted calling Trump’s lies lies. Their reasoning, it must be conceded, is thoughtful. After all, to call something a lie is to impose judgment. Sometimes, when people are incorrect it’s not a lie, only a mistake.
But 10,000 times in a little over two years? How gullible must you be to believe someone could be that wrong that often by accident? If any other man told you half that many untruths, you’d call him a liar. You wouldn’t hesitate. Yet here, we do.
It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is. In their refusal to call him that, in their insistence upon giving him the benefit of nonexistent doubt, news media compromise their prime directive, which is to present a picture of the world as it is.
That’s something we can ill afford with the very idea of truth under attack and the need for news media to do their jobs arguably more critical than ever.
This is a time for forthrightness, yet too often journalists are anything but, from coverage of race, to climate change to this, as the newspaper of record dubs a grotesque lie merely “inaccurate.”
It makes you wonder if all the effort conservatives put into neutering the referees was not a waste of time.
Seems the referees have done a fair job of neutering themselves.

Everyone's cuckoo for "Jeopardy James"—that is, James Holzhauer, the 34-year-old professional sports gambler currently dominating the iconic quiz show by winning $902 billion in 11 days, or something like that. Mr. Holzhauer is deploying an aggressive strategy, piling up cash early, but he's also got to have the correct answers to the questions, and I was struck by what he said he uses as a preparation tool:
Children's books.
"I have a strategy of reading children's books to gain knowledge" Mr. Holzhauer told the New York Times. "I've found that in an adult reference book, if it's not a subject I'm interested in, I just can't get into it."
Finally: something I have in common with Jeopardy James! I, too, am a great reader and admirer of children's books, although I'm not reading them in preparation for "Jeopardy!" or anything cool like that. I'm just reading them to my crummy kids, every night, until they stop complaining and fall asleep, and I can finally get some peace, and fall asleep four and a half minutes later.
But Mr. Holzhauer is correct (surprise!). Children's books, especially simple books about single topics like sharks and snakes, have sharpened my intellect in a way that no fancy adult book ever has. Maybe it's the pictures, the large type, the repetition or the clarity of language—"Sharks don't have bones. Their bodies are supported by cartilage"—but I recall far more information from a children's book than I ever did from anything I ever read in college.
(I'm just kidding! I didn't read in college.)
The problem is, I don't know where to put all this new information. My son, he can strut into kindergarten and rock his teachers' minds with the knowledge he's learned about king cobras. It's harder for me. The adults I know all want to talk about Mueller, the NBA playoffs or real estate. I know nothing about that boring junk. Ask me about frogs! I know about American bullfrogs, South American Horned Frogs and, of course, poisonous dart frogs, which are barely the size of a gummy bear and will kill you dead.
Nobody cares. I've had to learn the hard way: talk about frogs too much, and adults start looking at you funny. Consider this kind of scene:
DINNER PARTY HOST: We were just talking about books, Jason. What about you? Have you read the new Ian McEwan?
ME: No, I have not read the new Ian McEwan.
HOST: Well, what have you read that you liked?
ME: "Bears."
HOST: Brilliant. What's it about?
ME: Bears.
(That scene is fiction. I don't go to dinner parties. The last time I ate outside of the house was at a rest stop Sbarro's on the New Jersey Turnpike.)
If you're looking to gain an edge on a quiz show, I suggest sticking to children's reference books: classic topics like animals, dinosaurs, planets, construction equipment, fire trucks. Avoid frivolous, anthropomorphic sagas about pig families and dog taxi drivers; that stuff is never going to come up on "Jeopardy!" Don't waste your time on any book about an animal losing a hat. I didn't know this before my wife and I had children, but about 92% of children's literature is about an animal losing a hat. Alex Trebek is not asking if the animal got the hat back.
(UPDATE: Well, well, well—it turns out Alex does ask about hats: https://twitter.com/burstofbeaden/status/1124366381292478464 )
Rod Stewart once sang, "I wish that I knew what I knew now/When I was younger"—it seems so obvious, but Rod must have been reading about sharks and bears. If you stick with it, you'll see that a good children's book really does widen the mind. I'm not "Jeopardy!" material, but I'm starting to feel like a better adult. Please let me tell you about frogs.

Viral misinformation: Rise of 'anti-vaxxer' movement requires news literacy inoculation

Texto completo: When I first began using the “virus” analogy to describe the rapid spread of misinformation and its potential to do serious harm, I didn’t realize how fitting, or timely, that comparison would become.
The recent outbreaks of measles, one of the most contagious diseases in the world, make that connection alarmingly real.
Thanks to a safe and effective vaccine, measles was declared eliminated in the U. S. in 2000. Yet this year, as of April 26, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 704 cases of this potentially deadly illness in 22 states. More than 500 of those cases were in people who had not been vaccinated. On April 15, the World Health Organization reported that measles cases in the first quarter of this year were up 300% over the same period in 2018. This year looms as the worst one for measles in the U. S. in decades.

Disinformation is the new barrier to measles vaccines, and it's deadly: Rosalynn Carter
Measles outbreak drains resources we may need for a future epidemic or bioterrorist attack
I'm fighting New York's measles outbreak from the inside, but the public needs to help
What changed? In recent years, the “anti-vaxxer” movement has flooded social media platforms with misinformation questioning the safety of vaccinations. Articles, videos and posts replete with conspiracy theories, hoaxes and pseudoscience have, well, gone viral. Many people have been persuaded to make health-care decisions based on provocative, frightening and false content that puts their children, and their communities, at risk.
The internet often acts as an echo chamber, serving up content to reinforce a person’s opinions regardless of compelling evidence to the contrary. Anti-vaxxers have benefited from this phenomenon. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote this about them in March: “They turn to the internet, which is both a hall of mirrors and an overstuffed bazaar. It lets them customize their input and thus tailor their reality, which is reinforced by the like-minded company they keep online. ”
Life or death information
Information is the basis for many of the decisions we make, and those decisions, in turn, become the basis for our actions. In the case of vaccination, these actions can have life-and-death consequences.
Online anti-vaxxer communities cross political, religious, geographic and income divides. What they have in common is their steadfast belief in dangerous and disproven information — including that vaccines cause autism, or that toxic compounds are used in the formulas.
For years, studies have repeatedly shown the safety of vaccines and their role in saving lives. Most recently, a study published in April in the Annals of Internal Medicine looked at data from more than 650,000 children in Denmark and found no link between autism and the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Yet those false claims persist.
The tangible consequences from the anti-vaxxers’ misinformation campaigns are lower rates of vaccination and the all-but-inevitable outbreaks of disease. Those who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their sons and daughters at risk, but potentially make others who come into contact with them vulnerable as well.
Ogbonnaya Omenka, a public health expert and assistant professor at Butler University, recently told USA TODAY, “The impacts of misinformation and lack of trust have not been fully appreciated. ” The World Health Organization calls “vaccine hesitancy” a worldwide public health danger.
Inoculate against misinformation
There is a proven vaccine against the pandemic of misinformation: the News Literacy Project’s Checkology virtual classroom. Equipped with the news literacy skills to separate fact from fiction, young people gain an innate resistance to information that aims to mislead, incite, frighten or provoke. They also learn to question what they’re thinking about sharing with others so that they aren’t complicit in infecting others with harmful information.
Since 2016, more than 126,000 students across the U. S. and in more than 100 other nations have been inoculated against the misinformation virus through this platform, which teaches young people how to confidently navigate today’s complex and challenging information landscape.
Today’s students — who are tomorrow’s decision-makers, voters and parents — are on the front lines of the fight for facts. We must equip them with skills and resources to protect themselves from the rampant misinformation virus. Otherwise, the health of our democracy — and in the case of the anti-vaxxer movement, the health of the public — is at risk.

Texto completo: "Everybody can relate to it (oil industry). Everybody puts gas in their cars. Everybody turns on the lights. I'm still so passionate about it. It's the lifeblood of every other industry."
Charlotte Batson
It's 1979 and Charlotte Batson is a petroleum engineering student at Louisiana State University interviewing for her first job in a heavily male-dominated industry.
"I'm there in my navy blue suit from Sears and blouse with a bow," she said of her interview with the oil company — one of only four women in LSU's petroleum engineering program at the time.
She walks into the office of the drilling engineer in charge of Gulf of Mexico operations and sees his entire wall is covered with calendars featuring scantily clad women.
"But this was the best company in all of the Gulf of Mexico and this was the job I wanted," Batson told the Women Business Owners of the Pine Belt at their meeting Monday in Hattiesburg. "I focused on the task at hand and getting the job I wanted.
"When I went to the manager of the Gulf of Mexico operations, I was offered the job right on the spot."
Batson said she was lucky because, despite some chauvinism, there was beginning to be a change in thinking about allowing women in the industry.
Watching deadly blowout Batson, of Wiggins, has come a long way. She is now owner and principal of Batson & Company and an internationally recognized expert on the oil industry. She sometimes speaks about her beginnings in the petroleum field and what it was like being one of the first women on the job.
She remembers her first week offshore, working for Tenneco Oil Co.
"I watched a blowout from three miles away — which was pretty close," she said. "I remember I was in the drilling engineer's trailer and it sounded like the drill pipe was coming out of the hole.
"Not only we were nearby, we were drilling at about the same depth as this rig that had blown out. We were 15 seconds away from grabbing the life preservers and jumping over the side."
The blowout on that other rig was so severe the news made the front page of the New York Times. One worker was killed, while the others managed to evacuate safely.
"We watched it blow out all day like a cloud of gray smoke," Batson said. "About 5:30 in the afternoon it finally caught fire.
"The derrick glowed red hot. Thank God everybody on our facility was safe."
Batson said she learned an important lesson that day.
"Your personality and being cool under difficult circumstances are important," she said.
Often first female on rigs, platforms Batson took that lesson with her as she progressed through her early years in the oil business. She might have encountered bad attitudes from some of the men on the oil rigs, but management tried to smooth the way for her.
"I was the first female on different oil and gas rigs and platforms during the day," she said. "They went to all the crews and said, 'Any funny business and you're out of here.' "
She remembers one rig she visited where she found another woman already there — a female roughneck. Batson imagined this woman toting bales of hay and doing heavy lifting on the farm where someone discovered her and offered her a job on the rig.
The two spent the night in the infirmary because there were no sleeping quarters for women.
"Boy, was I nice to her," Batson said. "All I needed was for her to get mad at me.
"She really was a remarkable young woman. My path to get out there was so much easier than hers."
Batson said she found that doing good work was the best way to be accepted.
"To me, there's no substitute for striving for excellence," she said.
Batson said there are always a few bad apples, but that can't be an obstacle.
"You have jerks, but jerks are everywhere," she said. "Jerks are a part of life."
'The lifeblood of every other industry' Audience member Jennifer Clark, a Hattiesburg event planner, could relate to a lot of what Batson talked about.
As someone who relies on email to a large extent, Clark said she appreciated what Batson had to say about developing trusting, face-to-face relationships needed to work on an oil rig.
"The tips she gave on working in a male-dominated industry and working in the oil and gas industry were very interesting," Clark said.
As for Batson, she has no regrets about going into petroleum engineering.
"I've always just thought it was the most exciting industry ever," she said. "What industry is it that you pick up the newspaper every day (and read about it)?
"Everybody can relate to it. Everybody puts gas in their cars. Everybody turns on the lights. I'm still so passionate about it. It's the lifeblood of every other industry."
"Everybody can relate to it (oil industry). Everybody puts gas in their cars. Everybody turns on the lights. I'm still so passionate about it. It's the lifeblood of every other industry."

Texto completo: CAMDEN – Key South Jersey Democrats blasted Gov. Phil Murphy Thursday in a deepening dispute over a state program that's provided some $1.6 billion in tax breaks to city businesses.
The local Democrats, including Camden County's top freeholder and Camden's mayor, said they were "deeply appalled" by the Murphy administration's "relentless, unfounded and disingenuous attacks" on many of the city's largest employers.
The broadside, which described Murphy as a hypocrite and compared him to President Donald Trump, came one day after the governor said he was "deeply troubled" by two media reports on state tax breaks for Camden businesses.
The governor asserted the stories showed the need for "a total revamp of the tax incentive program."
But a subject of both stories, Democratic powerbroker George Norcross III, suggested the publicity was a positive.
Norcross said a joint story by WNYC and ProPublica — headlined "How Companies and Allies of One Powerful Democrat Got $1.1 Billion in Tax Breaks" — showed "all of the hard work that went into getting the city on its current path forward."
"I join with other Camden leaders to thank WNYC Radio for its lengthy story detailing the massive undertaking to help rebuild Camden's future," Norcross, the chairman of Cooper University Health Care, said in a statement.
In Murphy's view, that story and a separate New York Times article reinforced his desire to see results from a task force reviewing the Economic Development Authority's incentive programs.
The task force, assailed by the South Jersey Democrats as "blatantly political leaning," held a public hearing Thursday.
It was formed in January after the state Comptroller's Office released an audit critical of the EDA's programs, which were revised in 2013 to steer more money to Camden.
"Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for," the governor said in a statement Wednsday.
"If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable," he said.
Advocates say the generous tax breaks to Camden firms — worth about $1.6 billion in all — have attracted economic development that would otherwise have bypassed the city.
"I will stand on top of that dirt pile over there and yell it from the top of my lungs," Mayor Frank Moran said Monday at a ground-breaking in East Camden.
The ceremony was held by ResinTech Inc., a Berlin Township firm that makes water treatment products. It's relocating to a 27-acre tract between River Road and Federal Street with support from nearly $140 million in EDA incentives.
In Thursday's statement, the local Democrats said Murphy's "invective has been particularly targeted at Camden companies" and not at North Jersey firms that also received tax breaks.
"Perhaps in the age of Donald Trump, the governor has learned all the wrong lessons of leadership and adherence to the truth," said the statement from Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr., Mayor Frank Moran, Assemblywoman Nilsa Cruz Perez and Camden Council President Curtis Jenkins.
It said Murphy "was fully prepared to give away $5 billion to the planet's richest company, Amazon, but has feverishly insinuated without proof that irregularities exist for tax programs that would help Camden."
It claimed Murphy's actions have caused "a chilling effect" on Camden's business community in Camden and have raised "legitimate questions" regarding the governor's intent to honor agreements between companies and the EDA.
"It has occurred to us that the governor may be holding Camden, and the business community, hostage to get his massive tax increases through the legislature," the statement added.
The WNYC/ProPublica story detailed how almost two-thirds of Camden's incentives went to companies with ties to Norcross and to his allies in business and politics.
It noted his brother, Rep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, had co-sponsored a law revising the EDA's Grow New Jersey program in 2013, when the congressman was a state senator. And it said a law firm run by a third brother, Philip Norcross, collected lucrative fees from firms that received tax credits.
The New York Times story also mentioned the Norcross brothers, but focused primarily on Kevin Sheehan, a real estate attorney who represented several firms that received tax breaks.
According to the Times account, Sheehan added language to the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013 to aid Camden firms.
It contends Sheehan's efforts yielded tax breaks worth $260 milllion for Holtec International, which built a technology campus in the port district, and $118 million for the Subaru of America's headquarters in the Gateway area.
The Times noted Holtec's tax break, the largest for any Camden firm, is estimated to have a net benefit to the state of just $155,520 over 35 years.
When Holtec was awarded the tax breaks in July 2014, a Courier-Post story noted a critic's assessment that the project would support 160 jobs already in New Jersey and 235 new position at a "sky-high" cost to taxpayers of $658,228 per job.
Sheehan could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
His firm, Parker McCay of Mount Laurel, released a statement to the Times saying it "was asked by policymakers, including those in the Legislature, to review this legislation and offer input and suggestions on ways it could be strengthened."
Philip Norcross is Parker McCay's CEO.
In commenting on the WNYC/ProPublica article, George Norcross noted "much of the story has previously been reported by other outlets."
He offered an upbeat assessment of several points made in the story.
The WNYC/ProPublica story, for instance, noted Camden "reaped more than four times as many tax breaks as the combined amounts of other cities designated as 'growth zones.'"
In Norcross' view, that showed "an unprecedented partnership between residents, government, business and community leaders."
And while the story described Camden's crime rate as "the second highest in New Jersey," Norcross noted it was down almost 59 percent since 2012.
Norcross also described efforts to craft the 2013 law to help Camden as "legislative back and forth."
"The fact that private investment is returning to Camden is no accident — it was planned and fought for," he said.

Texto completo: James Bennet, the editorial page editor of The New York Times, said on Thursday that he would recuse himself from any involvement in opinion coverage of the 2020 presidential election, after his brother, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.
The move by James Bennet, who is considered a contender to succeed Dean Baquet as The Times's executive editor, was long anticipated. Michael Bennet has served for a decade in the Senate and had earlier signaled interest in a presidential bid.
It is unusual for the chief of a newspaper's Opinion section to withdraw from a topic that is certain to dominate the global news conversation over the next 18 months. Mr. Bennet's self-imposed moratorium applies to Op-Eds, columns, editorials and other opinion articles related to the presidential candidates or major issues in the campaign.
The Times said Mr. Bennet's deputies, Kathleen Kingsbury and James Dao, would share responsibilities for all political coverage in their department. The arrangement is expected to last as long as Michael Bennet is an active candidate in the race.
James Bennet said on Thursday that he would not be involved with his older brother's campaign in any form, adding: "My guess is that's probably the last thing he wants anyway."
Mr. Bennet, 53, is a veteran Times journalist who left the paper in 2006 to assume the editorship of The Atlantic. He returned in 2016 to lead The Times's Opinion pages, where he has introduced video, graphics and audio teams and expanded coverage of subjects like gender and online privacy.
Several months ago, he asked Ms. Kingsbury and Mr. Dao to develop a plan in the event that his brother entered the presidential fray. Mr. Bennet recused himself from those discussions, as well.
Ms. Kingsbury said on Thursday that Mr. Bennet "will not participate in the interviews that we do with candidates, and he will not participate in the discussions around who we endorse." She and Mr. Dao plan to decide "on a case-by-case basis" when Mr. Bennet should step back from editorial board discussions about subjects that may overlap presidential politics.
"It becomes a little more difficult if we have a piece about 'Medicare for all' -- does that fall into the no-go zone?" Ms. Kingsbury said. "I personally think 'Medicare for all,' and the question of universal health care, you won't write that piece without discussing the viewpoints of the 2020 field, so he shouldn't participate."
The Opinion department -- which oversees unsigned editorials, Op-Eds, columnists, letters to the editor, the Sunday Review and online commentary -- operates separately from the reporters in the paper's newsroom. Mr. Bennet already had no role in The Times's news coverage of the 2020 candidates.
Michael Bennet, the 21st candidate to enter the Democratic race, is seen as a moderate with a policy focus on education and immigration. The senator, 54, announced this year that he was being treated for prostate cancer, and his candidacy was, for a time, in doubt; he underwent successful surgery in April. He is likely to face an uphill battle securing the name recognition that can be crucial in a crowded primary field.

No Pressure to Approve Staff, Ex-White House Official Says

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Carl Kline, the former director of the White House's Personnel Security Office, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week that he had overruled the recommendations of his staff and approved security clearances for White House officials on his own authority, and denied that President Trump or anyone else had directed him to do it.
"I have never been approached by anybody at the White House or outside the White House to adjudicate a case, one way or the other, in my tenure at the White House," Mr. Kline said on Wednesday, according to a congressional official with direct knowledge of his testimony.
Mr. Kline was responding to testimony by a subordinate, Tricia Newbold, who told the committee in March how he frequently overruled the recommendations of security specialists and described how she had kept a running list of at least 25 officials whose clearance applications Mr. Kline had approved, despite a "wide range" of disqualifying information, including drug use, financial problems and criminal conduct.
Two of those officials were Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the president's son-in-law and eldest daughter, both of whom serve as senior advisers in the White House. NBC News reported that Mr. Kline overruled recommendations against giving Mr. Kushner a clearance, despite concerns from F.B.I. officials.
The New York Times reported in February that Mr. Trump had ordered the White House chief of staff at the time, John F. Kelly, to direct security officials to give Mr. Kushner a clearance in May 2018 despite issues raised during his clearance process.
Mr. Kline's more than six-hour appearance before the House committee on Wednesday was the latest episode in a continuing debate over the vetting of White House staff, and Mr. Trump's role in enabling them to receive security clearances. It also highlighted a continuing struggle between the Trump administration and the Democratic House over access to information, officials and documents.
The White House initially directed Mr. Kline to defy the subpoena issued to him by the committee, then said he would testify, but only on generalities of the vetting process.
Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the committee's chairman, said he was not satisfied with Mr. Kline's testimony. He said in a statement that the White House had declined to allow any official to go into detail about specific actions taken on security clearance recommendations.
"Because of the White House's obstruction," Mr. Cummings said, "we still have no idea why the president's daughter and son-in-law were given clearances, and we still have no idea who some of the other two dozen employees are who were given clearances when they should not have been."
Democrats on the committee also criticized Mr. Kline for eliminating credit checks during the security clearance process, but he stood by the policy, according to two people with knowledge of his testimony, confirming details first reported in Politico.
Republicans, for their part, accused Democrats of creating a political stunt to slander the White House. Mr. Kline, for his part, told the panel that his character had been "assassinated" in the news media.
"The Democrats used just one witness, Trish Newbold, to pretend they did an investigation and to slander the White House by raising false alarms about our national security," Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio and the committee's ranking Republican, said in a statement. "We've now heard from Mr. Kline and learned that neither the president, the chief of staff, nor any other White House official attempted to influence his decisions with respect to any security clearance application."
Ms. Newbold, who has a rare form of dwarfism, accused Mr. Kline of retaliating against her and of workplace discrimination that came in the form of moving files out of her reach and declining to provide a way for her to gain access to them. On Wednesday, Mr. Kline told congressional investigators that he had moved the files but not intentionally, and called Ms. Newbold a "tricky" employee, according to two congressional committee aides with direct knowledge of his testimony.
On Thursday afternoon, Ms. Newbold, who has maintained that Mr. Kline moved the files on purpose, accused her former supervisor of lying to lawmakers.
"He denied putting files out of my reach?" Ms. Newbold said in a message relayed through her lawyer, Edward Passman. "So he blatantly lied to Congress?"
Mr. Passman said that his client did not know why Mr. Kline would have overruled security clearance recommendations -- and that her motivations were not political. Ms. Newbold, he said, continued to be troubled by Mr. Kline's policy of eliminating credit checks, one of the first ways officials can determine whether an individual is susceptible to foreign influence or blackmail.
"She's only acting on behalf of national security," Mr. Passman said. "She doesn't want to get involved in this back-and-forth."

Texto completo: "The Nun" runs on HBO. And Christina Applegate stars in "Dead to Me," a dark comedy on Netflix.
What's on TV
THE NUN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO. In an interview with The New York Times last year, the director Corin Hardy described the concept behind a particularly memorable scene in this horror movie. "I wanted to use this scene to maximize and amplify the tension around the concept of being buried alive in a coffin," Hardy said. Those are the kinds of tense thrills found in this spinoff of "The Conjuring," which centers on Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), a young nun assigned by the Vatican to aid in an investigation of mysterious matters. Spearheading that investigation is Father Burke (Demián Bichir), whose wheelhouse includes potentially paranormal activities. "The franchise has proved to be a reliable if variably elegant 'boo' machine," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The New York Times. "The same applies here."
DATELINE 9 p.m. on NBC. The reporter Dennis Murphy hosts this episode of NBC's long-running show, which this week focuses on a bank heist with unexpected ties to social media.
What's Streaming
DEAD TO ME Stream on Netflix. In this dark comedy, Christina Applegate stars as a comically cynical real estate agent who says things like, "I'm not defensive, O.K.?" She is also a victim of tragedy. Applegate's character, Jen, was recently widowed by an unsolved hit-and-run, so she sets out to solve it. Meanwhile, at a support group, she meets the idiosyncratic, freewheeling Judy (Linda Cardellini), who rapidly becomes her close friend -- and who has something to hide. The show was created by Liz Feldman, who also created the short-lived NBC sitcom "One Big Happy."
SUSPIRIA (2018) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This reimagining of Dario Argento's highly stylized 1977 frightfest was something of a departure for its director, Luca Guadagnino. A follow-up to Guadagnino's romantic "Call Me by Your Name," the horror remake stars Dakota Johnson as Susie, an American dancer who arrives at a dance school in 1970s Germany to find an exacting instructor (Tilda Swinton) and increasing levels of mystery. Susie begins to pull at the threads of a dark, hidden side of her new institution -- which leads to an extremely violent climax. Guadagnino fills the movie with primped set pieces and a score by Thom Yorke, but "what precisely he wants to say amid all the carefully choreographed bloodletting and disembowelment chic is unclear," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "Other than some women are beautiful and erotically beguiling but also mysterious and murderous."
EXTREMELY WICKED, SHOCKINGLY EVIL AND VILE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Zac Efron plays the serial killer Ted Bundy in this biographical crime drama. Directed by Joe Berlinger (no stranger to crime as a director of HBO's "Paradise Lost"), the film follows Bundy from the perspective of Liz Kendall, Bundy's longtime girlfriend, played here by Lily Collins.

'The New York Times' apologizes for running anti-Semitic cartoon

Texto completo: (Jewish Journal) The New York Times issued an official apology on April 28 overtheir publishing of an anti-Semitic cartoon on April 25.
The cartoon, which appeared in the Times' international edition above a column about immigration from Thomas L. Friedman, showed U.S. President Donald Trump wearing a kipah and sunglasses being guided by a dog with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's head.
In a statement on Sunday, the Times said it was "deeply sorry" about the cartoon. The statement followed an earlier one on April 27 acknowledging that its publication had been "an error of judgment."
"We have investigated how this happened," read Sunday's statement, "and learned that, because of a faulty process, a single editor working without adequate oversight downloaded the syndicated cartoon and made the decision to include it on the Opinion page. The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training. We anticipate significant changes."
Many were not satisfied by the paper's response.
Anti-Defamation League director Jonathan Greenblatt said via social media that the apology was "insufficient."
"New procedures obviously are needed but @nytimes must do more," Greenblatt wrote on Twitter, going on to suggest that the Times start implementing "sensitivity training for their staff on #antiSemitism" and "educate readers on the persistent poison of anti-Jewish hate."
Times columnist Bret Stephens wrote in an April 28 op-ed that the Times' decision to publish the cartoon reflected "an astonishing act of ignorance of anti-Semitism-and that, at a publication that is otherwise hyper-alert to nearly every conceivable expression of prejudice, from mansplaining to racial mi-croaggressions to transphobia."
"Imagine, for instance, if the dog on a leash in the image hadn't been the Israeli prime minister but instead a prominent woman such as Nancy Pe-losi, a person of color such as John Lewis, or a Muslim such as [Minnesota Congresswoman] llhan Omar," wrote Stephens. "Would that have gone unnoticed by either the wire service that provides the Times with images or the editor who, even if he were working in haste, selected it?"
Stephens added that "the mainstreaming of anti-Zionism, including by this paper" has resulted in anti-Semitism being viewed "as a form of political opinion, not ethnic prejudice."

Texto completo: Tareck El Aissami , uno de los líderes más poderosos del gobierno venezolano, cercano al presidente Nicolás Maduro , exvicepresidente y ahora ministro de Industrias y Producción Nacional en Venezuela , está siendo señalado de nueva cuenta por narcotráfico y de tener nexos con el grupo terrorista Hezbolá .
Así lo revela el diario The New York Times, que tiene en su poder un expediente que indica que El Aissami , de 44 años, y su padre, Carlos Zaidan El Aissami , buscaron cómo introducir a Hezbolá en Venezuela .
De igual manera los documentos afirman que su hermano, Feraz El Aissami , tenía negocios con el narcotraficante más famoso de Venezuela , Walid Makled alias “ El Turco “, y que tenía casi $45 millones de dólares guardados en cuentas bancarias de Suiza. Pero no solo eso, si no que además a Tareck se le vincula directamente con “ El Turco “, pues hay documentación que afirma que emitió contratos millonarios para empresas propiedad de Walid .
Y mientras la mayoría de los venezolanos viven entre el hambre y la miseria, Tareck El Aissami ha amasado una enorme fortuna que le permitió comprar un banco en Estados Unidos , parte de una constructora, acciones en un centro comercial panameño, tierras donde se construirá un complejo turístico de lujo y varios proyectos inmobiliarios en Venezuela, entre ellos una costosa mansión hecha para sus padres.
El 8 de marzo pasado Estados Unidos acusó formalmente a El Aissami por narcotráfico lo que lo convirtió en el segundo miembro del gabinete de Maduro señalado de dicho delito luego que se hiciera lo propio con Néstor Reverol , actual ministro del Interior venezolano.
De igual manera detallan cómo almacenes supuestamente abandonados en realidad estaban siendo usados para guardar toneladas de químicos que se utilizan para producir cocaína. Aquí de nueva cuenta suena el apellido de El Aissami : Haisam , primo de Tareck , quien se identificó como representante legal de Makled Investments , la compañía del “ El Turco “.
La última parte del archivo recoge informaciones de testigos que vinculan a la familia El Aissami con Hezbolá , quienes detallan los intentos para reclutar a militantes que buscaban establecer una red de tráfico de información y de drogas a lo largo de América Latina , algo que no se aclara si se logró o no.
* La “bruja” que no pudo predecir que sería víctima de “El Mencho” o “El Marro”
* Le llegan más malas noticias a “El Mayo” Zambada desde Colombia
* Profanación de cuerpos y más atrocidades; la cruel venganza del Cártel del Noreste

Texto completo: As a kid growing up on the streets of Brooklyn in the 1950s, Garland Jeffreys wasn't thrilled about the name his parents gave him.
“I didn't feel it was a masculine thing," he says with a chuckle. Later, however, when he began performing, he came to value how it had a memorable ring to it.
“Sometimes what you want is not as good as what happens to you," says Jeffreys, who plays a sold-out show May 10 at City Winery in Boston (tickets are still available for a May 9 concert at the Double E Performance Center in Essex Junction, Vt., where he'll share a bill with Steve Forbert). “I think that's happened in many ways and situations with me."
At 75, Jeffreys is set to play the final shows in a 50-year career marked by occasional highs, periodic interludes, and an an overarching story of rock 'n' roll survival. He wrote and recorded the timeless song “Wild in the Streets," was a longtime friend to Lou Reed, and has been a regular in recent years at Bruce Springsteen's charity shows. Bob Marley was a fan of his forays into reggae.
“Sometimes you take a break — you feel like you've done your best," Jeffreys says. “Then you crawl back. You say, 'Hey, this music world is pretty good' " — in spite, that is, of its long history of failing to reward worthy artists such as himself.
Jeffreys is probably best known for his 1977 album “Ghost Writer," still regarded as a classic of the era, with hints of doo-wop, easy skanking, and even a little disco, all scuffed up with bankruptcy-era New York City grit. But his performing days reach back as far as the tail-end Greenwich Village heyday and subsequent Woodstock retreat of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and his most recent albums — after a decade-plus hiatus — have been hailed as a welcome comeback.
“It's interesting," he says, on the phone from his home in Manhattan. “When you get to be my age, you look back and think: Where did the time go, you know?"
After a few more farewell dates, including a birthday tribute with special guests set for New York City in late June, Jeffreys and his wife and manager, Claire, will concentrate on completing a documentary on his life in music. He'll continue to write songs, he says, “but I'm ready to hang up my rock 'n' roll shoes."
Jeffreys, whose heritage is African-American and Puerto Rican, grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, in a melting-pot neighborhood with black, Latino, and white schoolmates. He attended Syracuse University, where he befriended Reed and hung out with the poet Delmore Schwartz and his coterie of student followers.
He cut his first album in 1970 as part of the rootsy Upstate New York band Grinder's Switch, which featured keyboardist Stan Szelest, who would become a latter-day member of the Band.
“Stan was a great guy," Jeffreys says. “He was like a papa. He was a real rock 'n' roller. When you're around people like that, you learn a lot from them."
Jeffreys co-produced his self-titled solo debut, released three years later, with the jazz-oriented Atlantic Records staffer Michael Cuscuna, who would go on to major reissue projects for Blue Note and other labels. After the success of “Ghost Writer" and “Wild in the Streets," Jeffreys tried to capitalize with a flurry of albums that ranged from softer rock (one song, “Matador," became a surprise hit across Europe) to a stateside version of pub rock.
Following a decade of downtime, Jeffreys returned in 1992 with an album called “Don't Call Me Buckwheat." The title track was spurred by a derogatory remark someone shouted at him at a ballgame. In a New York Times essay last year, songwriter Loudon Wainwright III included it among a list of 10 great songs “that have challenged the status quo."
Jeffreys's music has often addressed the uncomfortable truths of racism, from “Why-O" and “I May Not Be Your Kind" (from “Ghost Writer") to a cover of “I Walk the Line" for a Johnny Cash tribute album, which lent a very different interpretation to the familiar lyric. One song from the “Buckwheat" album, “Color Line," was inspired by a boyhood trip to a ballpark, when his father took him to see Jackie Robinson play for the Brooklyn Dodgers.
“My uncles were Giants fans," he explains. “But my father loved Jackie Robinson, so consequently I did, too."
After several years spent mostly out of the spotlight while raising his daughter, Savannah (now a 23-year-old songwriter and activist), Jeffreys launched a comeback with 2011's “The King of In-Between," which featured the sublime Boston guitarist Duke Levine. Two more albums have followed.
“You wouldn't have known he hadn't been in the studio making a record for that long," says Levine, who first met Jeffreys while Levine was holding down a residency at an East Village club. “He was totally at home, natural. There was a really good energy about it."
Jeffreys's biggest gift is his ability to synthesize all the various styles he likes into one all his own. “Whatever bags he's been into in his life, they're all there," Levine says. “Early rock 'n' roll, blues, boogie-Magic Sam kind of stuff. And he seems to always have a reggae groove in there somewhere. If an artist wasn't that strong as a singer and songwriter, that stuff might not hang together on record." But it does.
There have been times, but not many, when Jeffreys has chased a hit.
“Commercial music occasionally hits on something that's a success," he says. “But that's not the goal. The goal is to make music you appreciate, with the hope that other people appreciate it. I feel like I made that step."
On that 2011 album, Jeffreys announced his return with an irresistible song called “Rock and Roll Music," which sounds like his version of the Beatles revisiting their own roots on the rooftop at Apple Records.
“When the day comes, and I'm 64/ I won't be one of those guys who falls on the floor," Jeffreys sang. “But if it so happens, I'll pick myself up/ And dust myself off, and listen some more/To the rock 'n' roll music."
He's 75 now, and it's your last chance to see him onstage. “I'm ready to let it go," he says.
But even in retirement, you can bet he won't stop listening to the rock 'n' roll music.

What if a teen going through the Holocaust had Instagram? Inside the account seeking to modernize history

Texto completo: At a time when the last generation of Holocaust survivors is dying out, one Israeli tech executive and his daughter created a new digital tool for education and remembrance using photo-sharing app Instagram.
The account, “Eva Stories," uses Instagram's stories feature to create a 70-part documentary based on the diaries of 13-year-old Eva Heyman, retelling the Holocaust through the lens of a smartphone.
“The memory of the Holocaust outside of Israel is disappearing. We thought, let's do something really disruptive," said Mati Kochavi — who created the account with his daughter, Maya — in an interview with The New York Times. “We found the journal and said, 'Let's assume that instead of pen and paper Eva had a smartphone and documented what was happening to her.' So we brought a smartphone to 1944."
Much like teenagers today, Eva documents almost every aspect of her life on her Instagram. She films herself getting ice cream in the park, dancing with her friends, and goofing around in class.
Eventually, her stories take a darker turn as her family is forced to move into the cramped chaos of the ghetto and then into a packed train that transports her to Auchswitz, the Nazi concentration camp located in Poland. All the while, Eva documents everything.
Eva's diary spans from Feb. 13 to May 30, 1944, and the Instagram story highlights on the “Eva Stories" account document these entries. Her real diaries ended a few days before her deportation.
She was killed in Auschwitz on Oct. 17, 1933. Her mother, Agnes Zslot, survived the Holocaust and found Eva's diary when she returned to their hometown of Nagyvarad in what was then Hungary.
The account launched on Wednesday for the start of Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, which lasts until sunset on Thursday.
The project was filmed over three weeks in Ukraine and cost several million dollars to produce. Four hundred people were involved in the production.
“A lot of serious movements are happening on social media," said Maya. She said she and her father worked hard to make the Instagram experience authentic and real, with hashtags and captions, while seeking to “maintain the sense of honor."
The account has gained nearly 1 million followers as of Thursday afternoon. Before it was even activated, it had more than 200,000 followers, according to the Times, due to billboard ads and online buzz created by celebrities and influencers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also endorsed the project Monday.

Democrat Gillibrand wants to give voters $600 to spend on political campaigns

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand unveiled a plan Wednesday to provide each voter a credit of up to $600 to donate to federal political candidates of their choice in their state.
Gillibrand, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said her "Democracy Dollars" program is aimed at getting big money out of politics by making politicians less reliant on wealthy donors.
If enacted, Gillibrand's plan — which is based in part on a program in Seattle — would allow voters to request a credit of up to $200 each for House, Senate and presidential race, with the money equally split between primaries and general elections.
Politicians would only be eligible for the contributions if they voluntarily limit themselves to maximum individual donations of more than $200, well under current federal contribution limits.
"My Clean Elections plan is a critical structural change that gets big money and special interests out of politics, and ensures that elected officials in Washington are beholden only to the people who sent them there," Gillibrand said in a statement.
Trying to gain traction in 2020 race Gillibrand's plan comes as she struggles to gain traction in the 2020 presidential race.
Public-opinion polls, including a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, have put her near the bottom of the crowded Democratic primary race.
And she has not yet surpassed the 65,000 individual donors needed to qualify for Democratic debates, though she will likely qualified based on her having at least 1 percent support in more than three polls, according to The New York Times.
The first Democratic debates are scheduled for June 26 and 27.
Gillibrand's election plan calls for allowing voters to spend their credit in $10 increments.
She told NBC News the credit could only be used in a voter's home state, though they would be able to spend it on House races in their state but outside their home district.
"It will change who has a seat at the table and who gets elected in this country within one election cycle," Gillibrand told NBC.
Gillibrand was first appointed New York's junior senator in 2009 after former Sen. Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.

With Woodstock 50 in Peril, Michael Lang Is Defiant

Texto completo: The most widely read piece of news about Woodstock's planned 50th anniversary festival this summer came on Monday, when Dentsu Aegis Network, the event's financial backer, made a surprise announcement declaring it dead.
The event, promoted by Michael Lang, one of the original partners in the legendary 1969 festival, was supposed to run from Aug. 16 to 18 in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with Jay-Z, Miley Cyrus, Imagine Dragons, Santana, Dead and Company and dozens of others on the bill.
But from the start, Woodstock 50 drew skepticism throughout the music industry. The lineup was announced in March, later than expected, and one of the headliners, the Black Keys, soon dropped out. The announced date for the start of ticket sales came and went, with no tickets and a red flag: The festival was still awaiting necessary permits from state and local authorities.
Yet as soon as Dentsu pulled its support, Lang insisted that the show would go on, somehow. He even brought in the big legal guns. In a statement on Tuesday directed at the industry, the festival's lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz -- who also represents President Trump -- said that Dentsu did not have the right to cancel the festival, and instructed "all stakeholders, including the entertainers," to proceed as planned. (Dentsu has declined to make any further comment.)
Still, many artist representatives have expressed grave doubts about the festival's future, and chatter in the industry has already equated Woodstock 50 with the Fyre Festival -- whose collapse in 2017 was so publicly disastrous that two documentaries were made about it. "It seems to be doomed for this year," said Marsha Vlasic, a veteran talent agent whose client Cage the Elephant was booked for the festival.
On Wednesday, Lang spoke to The New York Times about how he proposes to keep his festival alive, and what went on behind the scenes with Dentsu, which he said was the only investor. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
You've insisted that Woodstock 50 will go on. What do you need, financially and otherwise, to do that without Dentsu?
We need to replace them financially. Frankly, I think it will be a much easier process going forward, because all that baggage gets left behind. We are a few days away from permits; we are in talks with investors who are anxious to come in.
The clock is ticking. How quickly does this need to be done?
Believe me, I know. [Laughs.] We have a short window to put this back together. That's obvious. We feel it's enough time, and there is enough interest, that we think we will accomplish it.
Do you have sponsors?
We have potential sponsors, yes. Most of the sponsors ultimately were brought in through Concept One Communications, which is another partner to the deal, so we feel that that's secure.
Did you get any more information from Dentsu about why they pulled out?
We really didn't. The surprising thing was that they didn't give us a heads up, or call, or say, "We'd like to back away, can you replace us?" It was just a surprise. It's mind-boggling, in fact.
Dentsu felt that production deadlines were not met, and that the capacity had been reduced too much from what was originally planned -- from 100,000 people to 75,000. Do you have a response to that?
We were definitely pushing initially for more than that. In researching the site more minutely, and assessing the surrounding properties that we thought would be available, we were looking for more than 100,000. But we were willing to go at 100,000, which we feel that the site can handle well.
It went down to 75,000 quite a while ago. Dentsu felt that's the number they wanted to go with. And they pushed us to agree to that number, which surprised me, because it's not in everybody's interest to go smaller. But nonetheless, we went along with it, and that's been the case for months; that's not a new circumstance that would set this off.
So they agreed to 75,000?
Not only did they agree to it, they kind of insisted on it.
When you announced this festival, there was skepticism that you could compete with big events like Coachella and Bonnaroo. Now there is doubt that you can continue at all. How will you overcome that?
The best way to overcome that is for us to get on sale, and that's the objective now. The talent has been solid for a couple of months now. They've been completely paid.
All of them?
Yeah, all of them. So moving forward for us is finishing up the permit application, which the state and the county have been really helpful with, and should be doable in just a few days. And then to go on sale.
What about the public? How do you get their confidence back?
The best way to turn things around is by your actions, not by your words. So again, it's getting on sale.
I put out a letter last night to all the people who have emailed us, just to explain what is going on. The response has been great. People are being really supportive. Everybody is giving us the best of wishes, and "go get 'em" kind of stuff. And we will deliver.
I know that in this day and age when things are so buttoned down, and the industry is so buttoned down, this is kind of an oddity. But things happen when you are committed and have a purpose, and we are getting a lot of heartfelt support out there.
The last Woodstock festival, in 1999, ended with riots and reports of sexual assault. Now the 50th anniversary event is in doubt. What do you think this is going to do to Woodstock's legacy?
Funnily enough, this kind of fits the legacy of Woodstock in a way. In 1969, we got kicked out of Wallkill a month before the festival was to happen. One of the miracles was that we found a site the next day.
Woodstock is kind of about ... I don't know how describe it other than that it's just about commitment. We're committed. We were committed then, and we're not stopping now.

Texto completo: Alana Kysar grew up on Maui, surrounded by the feast of flavors we call “local food,” and she uses that background to great effect in a new cookbook, “Aloha Kitchen: Recipes From Hawai’i” (Ten Speed Press, 2019, $ 30).
“When you close your eyes and think of Hawaii, what comes to mind?” she writes in her introduction. “For me, it’s the way the islands taste.”
Kysar now lives in Los Angeles, where she has written the blog Fix Feast Flair since 2014. Although her posts run the gamut, she noted that her comments on Hawaii food struck a chord with her readers.
This is how cookbooks are born.
The 83 recipes she’s gathered — from kalua pork and teriyaki sticks to guava cake and prune mui — are not groundbreaking. You’ve seen versions in community cookbooks and your mom’s recipe box. And that’s the point. Kysar’s aim was to present the dishes that best speak of Hawaii, in recipes all her own.
Delicious photos, many taken by Kysar, accompany the text, and it’s all set up by an introduction to the mixed-plate of cultures in the islands, pantry suggestions and a dissection of the plate lunch.
“Aloha Kitchen” has a national publisher, which means exposure for our island cuisine among cooks and eaters who identify our food with Hawaiian pizza, and little else. The New York Times has already named it one of the best cookbooks of spring.
This katsu recipe is a good example of how Kysar can put a twist on the norm. She says her neighbor made the best katsu using a secret ingredient, garlic salt. She’s built on this inspiration to create a garlic-flavored katsu.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is sorry. Kind of.
Sort of.
He's sorry for the way Anita Hill was treated, but not for the way he treated her. He's sorry women were uncomfortable when he invaded their personal space, but he's not sorry he did it.
He's sorry these bad things happened to other people, but he just can't bring himself to acknowledge that he's the one who made them feel marginalized, diminished and inferior.
"I'm sorry for the way she got treated," Biden said Friday, responding to a suggestion from ABC's "The View" co-host Joy Behar that Hill might want a more straightforward apology from Biden than what he's offered thus far.
The former vice president's response is not unlike a 12-year-old who comes home from school without his jacket and explains, "It got lost."
And it's all too familiar to any woman who has shared an experience of sexual harassment or assault publicly or privately only to hear, "I'm sorry you interpreted it that way" in response.
Biden's ham-handed answers on "The View" came a few weeks after he made a private phone call to Hill, who, 28 years ago, testified during
In this April 5, 2019 photo, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers construction and maintenance conference in Washington. If Biden aims to offer himself as the Democratic foil to President Donald Trump, he needs to offer a direct apology to Anita Hill.
Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings to join the U.S. Supreme Court that he had sexually harassed her. Hill now a professor at Brandeis University was a young, African-American attorney and professor who faced intense questioning from an all-white, all-male panel led by Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Hill, speaking to the New York Times last week, said she was left unsatisfied by her recent conversation with Biden.
He has expressed regret for the way Hill was treated, but at every turn has avoided accepting responsibility for his role.
"To this day, I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us," Biden said during a March speech at the "Biden Courage Awards" an event honoring people fighting sexual assault on college campuses.
The New York Times' Astead Herndon gave Biden's responses the perfect description in a recent CNN appearance: "apology-adjacent."
Unless he's under the impression he can't win the Democratic presidential nomination without the support of Clarence Thomas, there's no clear explanation as to why Biden appears to be incapable of directly apologizing to Hill.
If Biden aims to offer himself as the Democratic foil to President Donald Trump, he needs to do better than this. He needs to learn how to take ownership of his mistakes and, when it's called for, offer unequivocal apologies.
"I'm sorry."
No strings, no "buts," no passive voice. Not "I'm sorry you felt this way." Not "I'm sorry this happened to you."
"I'm sorry for what I did to make you feel that way."
"I'm sorry I did that to you."
Biden defenders will ask us to judge his legacy in its entirety, to look at the policies he supports, instead of focusing on a handful of blemishes on his record.
Indeed, Biden does have an impressive and honorable history of service to this country. He is, in many ways, the definition of a statesman recognizing, of course, that no statesman is perfect.
He should be applauded for his work, especially as vice president, to combat sexual assault, particularly on college campuses. His "It's On Us" campaign, launched in 2014, was a long overdue effort to shift the responsibility narrative away from victims and survivors and toward perpetrators and bystanders.
And he was a welcome voice of opposition, excoriating Trump as the president faced accusations of sexual misconduct from multiple women.
That's why we should expect and demand more from Biden.
Some supporters will also question whether it's worth criticizing any Democratic candidate for missing the mark on sexual misconduct when the number of sexual misconduct allegations against Trump is in the double digits.
Why criticize a Democratic candidate who has taken steps to prevent sexual assault when the sitting Republican president has suggested an accuser was too unattractive for him to assault and bragged about kissing women without their consent and grabbing them "by the pussy"?
Because we can't afford to lower the bar any further.
The counter to "candidate who brags about sexual assault" is not "candidate who generally fights sexual misconduct but can't directly apologize to a woman he acknowledges was wronged by a process he led."
Many of Biden's "apology-adjacent" comments have focused on his intentions. And to be sure, it's not unreasonable to assume, based on his policy stances, that his intentions have more often than not been good.
Intentions matter, but apologies do, too. And it's not a huge leap to get from one to the other.
Democrats have, for the last four years, presented themselves as a strong moral contrast to Trump especially to his treatment of women. The 2020 election gives them a chance to prove it.
Now is not the time to point fingers and say, "The other side is worse." Now is the time to offer a clear argument as to why their side is better.
It's not enough to say you believe women. It's not enough to say you support women. It's time to prove it. CREDIT: By Jessie Opoien

Texto completo: New Orleans General Manager David Griffin knows him well.
Head coach Alvin Gentry does, too.
So longtime Phoenix Suns head athletic trainer Aaron Nelson will be around familiar faces when he officially joins the Pelicans' training staff.
Nelson is leaving Phoenix for New Orleans, and his arrival is being deemed a major hire for Griffin, whom the Pelicans hired earlier this month.
Nelson has thrived at extending careers of players such as two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash (2005, 2006), Shaquille O'Neal and Grant Hill.
The New York Times' Marc Stein first reported the Nelson acquisition earlier Monday night. League sources confirmed, and the Suns made it official on Tuesday.
"We are extremely thankful to Aaron for his contributions to the Phoenix Suns over the last 26 years, including the care he provided to hundreds of Suns players along the way," said Suns General Manager James Jones in a news release. "We are excited for Aaron as he pursues the next step in his career and wish Aaron, Jessica and their family nothing but the best."
Nelson has been a trainer in Phoenix since 1993 when he and Griffin both joined the Suns. Griffin worked as a media relations intern while Nelson was hired as an assistant athletic trainer.
A 1992 Iowa State graduate, Nelson became Phoenix's head trainer in 2000 when the legendary Joe Proski stepped down. In 2009, he was named Joe O'Toole NBA Athletic Trainer of the Year and the Trainer of the Year by the National Basketball Athletic Trainers Association.
Griffin, who served as the Suns' senior vice president of basketball operations for three years, spent 17 years working in Phoenix while Nelson was on the training staff.
Griffin was the general manager for the Cleveland Cavaliers when they won their only NBA title in 2016.
As for Gentry, he was an assistant with the Suns for four seasons (2004-08) and head coach for five seasons (2008-13). Nelson was there for that run which included five playoff appearances.
Phoenix last made the postseason in 2010. The Suns reached the Western Conference finals before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers, who beat Boston in in seven games to win the second of back-to-back NBA titles.
Moving forward, Phoenix is working with Steward, a world-class healthcare provider, as well as EXOS, a human performance company, EXOS, on the team's medical and performance efforts as part of a evaluation of its basketball operations.
The Suns are "leveraging" their partnership with Steward to expand its medical operations this offseason. The Steward team includes expert care in sports medicine, orthopedic surgery, physical therapy, athletic training, sports psychology.
Phoenix's new partnership with EXOS, a 31,000-square foot facility that is known for training athletes while reducing injuries. Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, TJ Warren, Tyler Johnson, Kelly Oubre Jr. and De'Anthony Melton each had lengthy injuries this season.
EXOS creates customized player performance programs and utilizes data, insights and resources for its athletes.
This is all part of an overall evaluation of Phoenix's basketball operations.
Grant Hill receives treatment from Suns trainer Aaron Nelson after being hit in the mouth against the Lakers in 2010.

Filing puts Tesla results in an even uglier light; Large loss would have been worse without $200 million in credits not mentioned earlier.

Texto completo: Tesla Inc.'s financial results released last week didn't mention that the automaker's revenue included $200 million collected from regulatory credits. When Chief Executive Elon Musk answered questions from analysts, he didn't point that out, either.
The number was buried in the report known as Form 10-Q that Tesla filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Without the revenue spike -- which is unlikely to be repeated, analysts say -- the company's first-quarter loss would have been much deeper than the $702 million that Tesla reported. Gross margins on Tesla's cars, a key measure of manufacturing profitability and efficiency, would have taken a significant hit.
Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi's reaction? "Egad," he said in a note to investors.

Tesla's shares fell 1.2% to $238.69 on Tuesday. The $235.14 closing price Friday was its lowest in more than two years.
The new data add to Tesla's already bleak financial picture. The $702-million loss followed a $139-million profit in the previous quarter. Sales fell sharply. Automotive revenue plunged 41%, to $3.7 billion from $6.3 billion in the previous quarter, as vehicle deliveries dropped to 63,000 from 90,700 the previous quarter.
Operating cash flow turned negative -- a net $640 million going out the door over the three months compared with a positive $1.23 billion in the previous period. Cash on hand dropped from $3.69 billion at the end of last quarter to $2.2 billion, including $920 million to pay off convertible bonds.
The fall in gross margins was "the largest decline in Tesla's history," Sacconaghi said in his note. And, he warned, it is likely that Tesla's average selling price will fall as cheaper Model 3s come online.
Asked about gross margins, a Tesla spokesman pointed to an investor letter the company published last week. "We have refocused on operational efficiency of these businesses and are targeting gross margin improvements throughout this year," it said.
The fact that Tesla did not report the $200 million of credit revenue last week and Musk did not raise it in the analyst call "is likely to raise further eyebrows among investors," Sacconaghi wrote. Tesla always saved reporting of those credits for the 10-Q, Sacconaghi said, but he noted that the current amount is unusually high.
Musk blamed falling auto sales in part on difficulties the company encountered shipping cars to Europe and China. (Tesla broke off relations with its main European logistics contractor this year; mislabeled Model 3s were held up at customs in China.) Musk told analysts last week that the company will deliver at least 90,000 cars in the second quarter, although it will continue to lose money until the third quarter.
Tesla did reveal a portion of its credit revenue last week: $15 million in zero-emission vehicle credits sold to other automakers as part of a California scheme to reduce pollution from internal combustion engines. Because Tesla's all-electric offerings emit no tailpipe gases, the company earns credits it can sell to automakers.
It's the "non-ZEV" credits that Tesla didn't report until Monday. The company didn't go into detail on where that money came from, but in the past it has sporadically reported non-ZEV credits "generally in the range of $15 million to $30 million, about $1,000 per car," Sacconaghi said.
The far higher figure, he speculated, may have come from an "emissions pooling" deal Tesla recently struck to help Fiat Chrysler Automobiles meet greenhouse gas regulations in Europe. The $200 million amounts to $3,000 per car, he said.
Tesla is struggling on a number of fronts. Total solar installations have been declining since Tesla bought Solar City in November 2016 -- a business founded by Musk's cousins. Tesla assumed Solar City's heavy debt.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that Tesla plans to cut solar prices in an attempt to boost sales and profits. Any price cuts could also attract new orders and deposits, which could boost much-needed cash flow for Tesla.

China Unlikely to Yield To U.S. on Data Rules

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump began his trade war with China out of concern that Beijing was using unfair economic practices to prevent the United States from dominating next-generation technologies like autonomous vehicles, advanced telecommunications and artificial intelligence.
But as the two countries move closer to a trade deal, it seems increasingly unlikely that China will give ground in a crucial area that could determine which country wins the technology race. Despite months of pressure from the White House, Chinese negotiators have so far refused to relax tight regulations that block multinational companies from moving data they gather on their Chinese customers' purchases, habits and whereabouts out of the country. Such data is crucial as industries build next-generation technologies.
With another round of trade talks underway this week, the United States and China appear headed toward an agreement that could end the monthslong trade war and lift tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of products. China is offering to strengthen its laws surrounding intellectual property, direct large purchases of American goods and reduce barriers for foreign companies in industries like finance and agriculture. It has also proposed giving foreign cloud computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple greater ability to operate independently in China, people familiar with the negotiations say.
A trade deal between the two nations will calm tensions and be seen as a victory for Mr. Trump, but some American technology companies fear the administration is giving up a valuable opportunity to press China on data-related issues and will cede too much economic power to Beijing.
China has already overseen a splintering of the world's internet, a move that has helped Chinese companies catch up to American firms. Over the past two decades, China built and shored up the Great Firewall, which blocks websites including YouTube, Facebook, Google and The New York Times from reaching more than 700 million Chinese internet users. Behind those barriers, Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have thrived, developing cutting-edge services that have in many respects surpassed those of their Western competitors.
The American tech industry is concerned that this same fracturing is being repeated with data, setting up more permanent divisions in how technology will be used around the world. As companies collect and analyze ever more data on customers, China has insisted that information be stored within its borders, on Chinese-made servers and routers, and not be transferred out of the country.
Business executives say relaxing China's restrictions on data is critical to ability of the United States to build globally competitive firms in areas like autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, which are expected to power jobs and economic growth.
China describes its data restrictions as an issue of national security, but technology firms, financial advisers, energy companies and others argue that the rules are intended to help Beijing dominate data-intensive industries. American firms say the restrictions increase their costs, force them to share sensitive technology with Chinese partners, make them more susceptible to cybertheft and leave them beholden to Chinese monitoring and censorship.
Trade in data is just one of several technology issues the United States is discussing with China. Trump officials are also trying to end Beijing's pattern of forcing American companies that operate in the country to transfer valuable technology to Chinese partners, and curb cybertheft. It remains unclear how these issues will be resolved, but a final deal is expected to include changes that allow American companies in the financial and automotive industries to operate independently, rather than with a Chinese partner.
"There's no question to me that the Chinese are setting up a separate technology system, and they are a superpower in the field," said Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a consulting group. "There are some areas where they are more advanced than we are."
The enormous volume of email, software, audio and video content that crosses international borders each day facilitates trade in goods and services in a range of industries, including entertainment, finance, law, manufacturing and retail.
It is also allowing companies to amass troves of information on customer behavior, through monitoring purchases on Amazon, Netflix binges, GPS routing, fitness tracking and other digital services. That data, in turn, gives companies information about users' shopping habits, viewing history, driving patterns and health that is feeding the development of industries like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous vehicles.
Companies are also gathering data about their own operations from sensors that monitor production lines in factories and alert retailers when certain products are out of stock.
This data is helping companies make and sell products in ways that are far more important to the American economy than is typically recognized, said Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center. A 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that digital flows now exert a larger impact on economic growth than trade in goods.
Despite its economic importance, there are few global rules governing trade in data. Trade in goods is governed by the World Trade Organization and an extensive network of bilateral and multilateral trade deals, but no similar regulatory structure exists for data flows.
That is beginning to change. The United States has enshrined the tech industry's position in the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, which provides for open access to government data, protections for company source codes and algorithms and a prohibition on customs duties on data, among other provisions.
The agreement will serve as a jumping-off point for American trade talks with Japan, as well as negotiations on e-commerce rules with more than 70 countries at the W.T.O. Trade agreements between Europe and Japan, and between Japan and a collection of 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, also have as a default the free flow of information, with some exceptions.
In other parts of the world, the tide is moving in the opposite direction, said Aaron Cooper, vice president of global policy at the Software Alliance, a trade group. In countries like India, Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, governments are introducing regulations to ostensibly protect their citizens' privacy and build domestic internet industries that will stymie the ability of American companies to provide services in those countries.
China and the United States, home to the world's largest tech companies, are the global "controllers of data," said Susan Aaronson, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University. "There are private firms in the United States, and private firms in China that work very closely with the Chinese government."
It remains to be seen which country takes the lead and how rules around their data evolve. For now, both are throwing up roadblocks to thwart each other. For instance, Chinese rules prevent foreign companies from mapping the country, which could limit the ability of American companies to offer automated driving technology. American lawmakers and policymakers have tried to prevent China from monopolizing data-related infrastructure by barring Huawei and other Chinese telecom equipment firms from building any part of America's next-generation telecom network.
In the trade talks, China has offered some concessions on rules governing the cloud computing industry, where foreign companies are required to operate in tandem with a Chinese partner. In a meeting in March, China's premier, Li Keqiang, floated the idea of giving foreign cloud computing companies the ability to operate independently in a free-trade zone, as well as two of the roughly eight licenses that companies need to operate in China, people familiar with the negotiations say. In return, the Trump administration has pressed China to provide all the required licenses, and eliminate all ownership requirements without geographic restrictions.
The Chinese have also been willing to discuss setting a fairly high bar for which companies are deemed so vital to China's information infrastructure that they have to keep vast amounts of data within China using government-approved telecommunications equipment. The Chinese government has discussed applying its most stringent rules to enterprises with a market share of at least 10 percent, said one person familiar with the discussions.
American negotiators have called on China for more openness on its data rules, but it is not one of the Trump administration's top priorities, and China has given little ground, people familiar with the negotiations say. Even if China opens up to foreign cloud computing, continued restrictions on the flow of data from China will make these ventures less profitable. And companies say Chinese laws on critical data could be used to curtail their operations at any time.

Texto completo: Joseph R. Biden Jr. said this week that he takes "responsibility" for the way Anita Hill was treated when she testified in the 1991 confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, the latest attempt by Mr. Biden to quell Democratic resentment over his handling of the hearings and his refusal to directly apologize to Ms. Hill.
The remarks, which aired on ABC's "Good Morning America" on Tuesday, came just days after Mr. Biden opened his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president.
As decades-old questions about his oversight of the hearings continue to swirl, fresh concerns have arisen about Mr. Biden's attempt to mitigate a political vulnerability by calling Ms. Hill shortly before his entrance into the race. His camp has said the former vice president sought to express "his regret for what she endured," but in an interview with The New York Times last week, Ms. Hill said the call had left her feeling deeply unsatisfied.
Mr. Biden's comments on Tuesday were the latest in a recent series of incremental concessions, as he has seemed to move closer to unconditional contrition for the aggressive questioning Ms. Hill faced from an all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee about claims that Justice Thomas had sexually harassed her.
Here's a look at what Mr. Biden has said about the matter, and how his view of his role in the hearings has evolved and shifted over the years.
October 1991: 'I don't want to be a judge'
By the end of the second day of the 1991 hearings, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee had begun a fierce assault on Ms. Hill and called her truthfulness into question. Then-Judge Thomas had also strongly denied any inappropriate behavior, accusing the committee of conducting a "high-tech lynching."
In short, the hearing had devolved into a spectacle, and the committee's performance was drawing significant criticism. Mr. Biden, the committee's chairman, offered a long, impassioned defense in response.
"I don't want to be a judge," he said. "I hate this job. But all of my colleagues here are telling everybody how awful the process is. Let me be completely blunt about it: It's like democracy. It's a lousy form of government, except no one's figured out another way."
June 1992: 'I erred in not attacking the attackers'
In a lengthy interview eight months after the hearing, Mr. Biden was more contrite, worrying aloud to The Washington Post that he had not "attacked the attackers" of Ms. Hill "more frequently and consistently."
But he also said he could not have acted differently toward Justice Thomas without violating "the basic values embodied in our constitutional system."
"That's what makes me mad about the Republicans," Mr. Biden said at the time. "What they do is they put you in a position on so many matters of principle that in order to fight with them and have a chance of winning, you have to either have the ability to go right above the issue, or you've got to do it the way they do it and disregard the rules."
November 2017: 'So sorry that she had to go through what she went through'
Many years later, appearing at Glamour's Women of the Year event in New York with his wife, Jill Biden, the former vice president emphasized that he "believed Anita Hill" and had "voted against Clarence Thomas."
"What I do feel badly about is the bad taste that got left in the mouth of some of the people around Anita Hill, and maybe even Anita," Mr. Biden said, according to HuffPost.
Pressed on the fact that Ms. Hill had previously said she felt the process was unfair, Mr. Biden said he was "so sorry if she believes that" and "so sorry that she had to go through what she went through."
December 2017: 'I owe her an apology'
In an interview with Teen Vogue in 2017, Mr. Biden specifically acknowledged having regrets about his failure to "tone down the attacks" on Ms. Hill by Republicans, while at the same time suggesting that, even as the committee's chairman, he did not have much power to do so.
"As much as I tried to intervene, I did not have the power to gavel them out of order," he said. "I tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask."
"I wish I had been able to do more for Anita Hill," he said. "I owe her an apology."
March 2019: 'I wish I could have done something'
Weeks before he would announce his candidacy for president, Mr. Biden took the stage at an event in New York City and gave an emotional speech in which he again expressed regret.
"She faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell this was all about. To this day, I regret I couldn't give her the kind of hearing she deserved," he said. "I wish I could have done something."
His lament, which echoed his previous argument about having been constrained in what he could do as chairman, rang hollow to some who said Mr. Biden had considerable influence over how the hearing was conducted.
April 25, 2019: Sharing his 'regret'
On the first day of his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden's campaign disclosed that he had called Ms. Hill weeks earlier and shared "his regret for what she endured."
But in an interview with The New York Times the day before, Ms. Hill declined to characterize Mr. Biden's words to her as an apology.
"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,"' Ms. Hill said. "I will be satisfied when I know that there is real change and real accountability and real purpose."
April 26, 2019: 'I'm sorry for the way she got treated'
The next day, Mr. Biden appeared on ABC's "The View," and repeatedly declined to deliver a straightforward apology to Ms. Hill, even after being nudged to do so.
Joy Behar, one of the hosts, suggested that Mr. Biden say to Ms. Hill, "'I'm sorry for the way I treated you' -- not for the way you were treated."
"I'm sorry for the way she got treated," Mr. Biden responded, haltingly. "If you go back to what I said, and didn't say, I don't think I treated her badly."
Describing his phone call with Ms. Hill, Mr. Biden added: "I said privately what I've said publicly. I'm sorry she was treated the way she was treated. I wish we could have figured out a better way to get this done. I did everything in my power to do what I thought was within the rules to be able to stop things."
April 29, 2019: 'I take responsibility'
Asked again Monday about the situation by Robin Roberts of ABC's "Good Morning America," Mr. Biden went further than he had days earlier by claiming responsibility for the way the hearing unfolded.
"I believed her from the very beginning, but I was chairman. She did not get a fair hearing. She did not get treated well. That's my responsibility," Mr. Biden said in the interview, which aired Tuesday. "As the committee chairman, I take responsibility that she did not get treated well. I take responsibility for that."
Mr. Biden also said he had apologized to Ms. Hill, though Ms. Roberts reminded him that Ms. Hill had declined to characterize his words during their phone call as such.
"I apologized for it," Mr. Biden insisted. "I apologize again because, look, here's the deal. She just did not get treated fair across the board. The system did not work."

The New York Times, which published the Congress Jew tracker in 2015, is sorry for distributing anti-Semitic cartoon

Texto completo: The same newspaper that published the Congress Jew tracker in 2015 is now apologizing for sharing an anti-Semitic political cartoon.

The since-retracted drawing depicts a blind, yarmulke-wearing President Trump being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is portrayed as a large-nosed, Star-of-David-sporting service dog.“The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it,” the New York Times said in its initial response to criticisms of the cartoon.

The Times also announced that the above statement would be published as an official editor’s note in Monday’s international print edition.

However, despite the admission of an “error of judgment,” some groups are not satisfied.

“Apology not accepted,” the American Jewish Committee said Saturday on social media. “How many [Times] editors looked at a cartoon that would not have looked out of place on a white supremacist website and thought it met the paper’s editorial standards? What does this say about your processes or your decision makers? How are you fixing it?”

The anti-Semitic cartoon, which was published only in the newspaper’s international edition, appeared originally in last Thursday’s opinion section, right next to a column by Tom Friedman.

On Sunday, Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy issued a lengthier explanation separate from the paper’s “error of judgment” statement. Unlike the note published in Monday’s international edition of the Times, Murphy’s remarks contain an actual statement of apology.

“We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday in the print edition of The New York Times that circulates outside of the United States, and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again. Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it’s all the more unacceptable,” she said.

Murphy added, “We have investigated how this happened and learned that, because of a faulty process, a single editor acting without adequate oversight downloaded the syndicated cartoon and made the decision to include it on the Opinion page. The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training. We anticipate significant changes.”

The Times reported that the cartoon came from Portuguese cartoonist António Moreira Antunes.

It was “originally published by Expresso, a newspaper in Lisbon. It was then picked up by CartoonArts International, a syndicate for cartoons from around the world,” the paper explained. “The New York Times Licensing Group sells content from CartoonArts and other publishers along with material from The New York Times to news sites and other customers.”

In 2015, the Times published – and then quietly removed – a list tracking which Jewish U.S. lawmakers voted against the Iran nuclear deal. The list included categories that read “Jewish?” and “State and estimated Jewish population.” Later, in 2017, the Times published a report insinuating the Orthodox Jewish Hasidic movement Chabad might be a puppet organization for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last week, the Times published a clearly anti-Semitic cartoon.

At what point do we draw a trend line?

WARREN'S RELENTLESS FOCUS ON INEQUALITY THE SENATOR'S PROPOSAL TO REDUCE STUDENT DEBT UNDERSCORES HER COMMITMENT

Texto completo: When it comes to offering polices that target American inequality, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is on a tear. So far, the Democratic presidential contender's proposals have taken on wealth concentration, affordable child care and the excessive power of dominant companies. Last Monday, she introduced a proposal to significantly reduce the stock of outstanding student debt.
Her plan would cancel as much as $50,000 in student debt for those in households with income of less than $100,000. For student debtors in higher income households, the $50,000 figure falls by $1 for every $3 in income. So, someone in a $150,000 household would be eligible for about $33,300 in debt forgiveness, which is still above the average debt level for those with a bachelor's degree (about $30,000). The plan phases out for families with incomes above $250,000.
According to Ms. Warren's materials, her proposal would reach more than 42 million Americans, or 95% of those owing student debt. The $50,000 is enough to achieve complete debt cancellation for more than three-quarters of student debtors.
Why not just cancel all student debt and be done with it? Because, as The New York Times' David Leonhardt argues, that's not as progressive an idea as it sounds. The problem is that the "the highest-earning quarter of the population holds about half of all student debt ... which means that universal student debt cancellation would be a giant welfare program for the bourgeoisie."
The Warren plan expends resources on student debtors from upper-income families, but it is still broadly progressive. Analysis from experts at Brandeis University, the University of Tennessee and Arizona State University shows that among low- and moderate-income families - those in the bottom 40% of the income distribution - close to 90% of borrowing households would have their student debt wiped out compared to just under 30% of those in the top 10 percent. Similarly, the proposal provides total cancellation for about 90% of those with an associate degree or less but provides total cancellation for about only 25% of those with a professional degree or doctorate. (Because student debt rises with household income, the plan could be made more progressive and less expensive by lowering the $50K cancellation amount).
This is especially important from a racial perspective. The large and persistent racial wealth gap, historical discrimination and unequal access to housing in places with decent public schools all help erect steep barriers to college completion for African Americans, which in turn lowers their economic mobility. Black college students are half as likely to graduate without debt (only 14% do so), their debt levels are higher, and too many suffer a particular harsh outcome in this space: They leave college without finishing, meaning they have the debt but not the degree (the debt burden itself is a factor in this outcome). As a recent Wall Street Journal front-page article revealed, even students at historically black colleges, institutions with a clear mission to correct the inequities noted above, are now beset with disproportionate loan burdens.
According to the research at Brandeis and other institutions, Ms. Warren's proposal would, by reducing the indebtedness of minority households with student loans, significantly raise the ratio of black/white wealth in such households from about 3% to about 28%, and the white-Latino gap from 54% to 81%.
Who wins and who loses from progressive debt cancellation? Since more than 90% of student debt is now public (the government is the lender), loan cancellation shouldn't hurt private lenders, especially since the proposal doesn't cancel private debt (instead, it works with the borrower and the lender to allow the government to pay off the outstanding debt). Research has found the economic benefits of student debt reduction to be net positive, driven by higher net worth and findings that connect student debt to reduced homeownership and lower business formation. Private-sector debt servicers get dinged by the plan, a case of a (relatively small) sector getting hit by a policy-induced, structural change. Also, those who have paid off their loans might well feel left out.
This price tag for this one-time debt cancellation will cost around $640 billion, about 3% of GDP and close to what we spent on defense last year. Is it worth it?
In fact, while the student debt problem is invariably described as a "crisis," some experts view such labeling as overwrought. Higher education expert Sandy Baum, for example, convincingly argues that even with the debt they've accrued, most college grads "... are better off than they would have been if they hadn't borrowed and hadn't gone to college." And there's compelling evidence that even with loans, investment in higher ed reliably pays off in terms of future earnings. Moreover, around a third of families pay an affordable share of income to service their investment in higher ed and cancel outstanding balances after 20 to 25 years (Ms. Baum has long advocated for simplifying and expanding income-based repayment plans).
At the same time, while the polling data varies a lot, there's evidence that especially younger people are increasingly questioning the value of college, and this certainly relates to the loan burdens that too many students take on. (One recent poll finds that "more than 40% of millennials and Gen Xers say their student debt probably, or definitely, was not worth the loans.")
This split creates a serious problem. On one hand, one of the strongest messages society and policymakers promulgate is "go to college!" On the other, the intersection of two long-term trends - stagnant incomes and rising tuitions - make it hard for less advantaged families to follow this advice. Ms. Warren's plan is an attempt to fix that disjunction.
That one-time fix must include measures to prevent ending up back here again, and the other part of Ms. Warren's proposal aims to restructure higher ed so that it doesn't require so much debt accumulation. That too makes sense. Americans have long agreed that 12 years of education is a public good. But that number - 12 - is clearly outdated. For people to compete in today's economy, they'll need more schooling. We can and should argue about whether the right number is 14 or 16. But it's not 12.

Texto completo: An Australian crime series gets a new spinoff on Acorn TV. And a documentary about Queen and Adam Lambert is on ABC.
What's Streaming
MS. FISHER'S MODERN MURDER MYSTERIES Stream on Acorn TV. The Australian crime show "Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries" -- about an elegant heiress-turned-detective in 1920s Melbourne named Phryne Fisher -- got rave reviews in the land down under when it debuted in 2012, and gained a global following with distribution by Netflix, Acorn TV and PBS. This spinoff takes place in the '60s and focuses on Phryne's audacious niece, Peregrine (Geraldine Hakewill), who inherits Phryne's fortune after she disappears and is presumed dead. And -- shocker! -- Peregrine becomes a sleuth, too, chasing murderers with the help of a hunky detective (Joel Jackson) and women from her aunt's Adventuresses' Club.
AMERICAN HONEY (2016) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. This nearly three-hour movie is a dizzying trip across Middle America in the company of some very reckless youth. At the outset, Star (Sasha Lane), a poor teenager in Oklahoma, leaves her family to join a group of drifters who ostensibly sell magazine subscriptions door to door. (They mostly pass the time partying and hustling gullible customers.) The story grows darker, but it also gives way to tenderness when Star becomes involved with Jake (Shia LaBeouf), a high-earner who answers to the group's leader, Krystal (Riley Keough), in more ways than one. He's a lot to handle, and so is Star. By the end, it's clear that the tale is really about the baggage we carry and where it might lead us. "The movie is a sprawling anthology of contradictory feelings, sensations and genres," A. O. Scott wrote in his review in The New York Times. "It's an episodic travelogue, a coming-of-age chronicle and an indictment of grim social conditions."
WAITING FOR 'SUPERMAN' (2010) Stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. The director Davis Guggenheim ("An Inconvenient Truth") sheds light on the failings of the United States public education system in this alarming documentary. Educators explain how ineffective schools and teachers have kept thousands of students from academic success, and we see part of the process in action: The lens follows five children whose chances of going to charter schools rely on highly competitive lotteries.
What's on TV
THE SHOW MUST GO ON: THE QUEEN + ADAM LAMBERT STORY (2019) 8 p.m. on ABC. Last year's Oscar-winning biopic "Bohemian Rhapsody" tells the story of Queen's electric frontman, Freddie Mercury. This new documentary jumps ahead to the band's second life, focusing on the rise of its current frontman, Adam Lambert, who first sang with the group as a finalist on American Idol in 2009 and joined a new version of the outfit in 2012. Named after a song from Queen's 1991 LP "Innuendo," the movie features behind-the-scenes concert footage and interviews with Lambert, the founding band members Brian May and Roger Taylor and the "Bohemian Rhapsody" star Rami Malek.

Texto completo: "The Silk Road" isn't what you might think -- a trade route bridging East and West. In this case, it's more of an endless bolt of shimmery gossamer fabric with a mutable quality; its meaning at any given point depends on the diviner. That's you. Your guides are motley pilgrims from a contemporary Canterbury Tales, identified only by occupation: the Cook, the Botanist, the Topologist, the Astronomer and others. (Only the yoga instructor has a name.)
Kathryn Davis' new novel has the feel of an allegory, one set in a dismal, dripping place -- Northern Europe? -- melting on a dying Earth and pinned down by the stars of the BoÃ¶tes constellation (which encompasses a void, the Great Nothing). The pilgrims cannot clearly discern what surrounds them or remember the events of the day before, but we know that at least part of the time they are fleeing a plague. Or a beast. Or mortality.
Even though they share distant memories of a common past, including two parents, a creepy person called Nanny, and some family games -- enough memories that it's easy to believe they are siblings -- the travelers seem more disjointed than attached.
The fact that the spooky subterranean labyrinth where their journey begins bears some resemblance to the home where they grew up presents the possibility that the not-so-merry band may only be trekking in place.
Except the place seems to be Europe, and their childhood home, based on a few textual hints, sounds like Philadelphia of a bygone era. No matter. For Davis, the laws of physics are elastic. As we have come to expect with this author, time is like taffy, stretching and twisting to accommodate vastly different chunks of words, some with a nursery-rhyme cadence and others that sound like an exercise in free association.
The environment she creates is one of danger, with the same threatening atmosphere of the gassy bog that lingers with readers of her early novel "The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf." Here on the trail there is a moss, enticingly "pale green and translucent like a Luna moth's wings," that radiates a vigorous sexuality and delivers on its promise of orgasmic fulfillment.
But this book functions with only the most tenuous sense of a unifying plot and with the barest character development. Davis' imagery, however, transcends the other elements:
In one passage she writes: "The morning was beautiful, Le Puy's streets empty of all but a few clerics in long black cassocks, sliding up and down the steep pathways like chessmen."
In another, "There was to be driving rain, the regular kind and the kind composed of dead birds. People were going to get in bed healthy and wake up dead."
The story never gets clearer, but then Davis, who teaches during the spring semester at Washington University, never makes it easy for the reader. For those who like a puzzle, however, "The Silk Road" conceals rewards.

Texto completo: TV commercials label reverse mortgages simple fixes for elderly homeowners needing cash – a financial easy button.
Sorry, there is no such thing.
Yes, reverse mortgages can be attractive. Folks older than 62 can unlock cash from their home without selling. They can simply draw monthly income, a line of credit or lump sum from their home equity, with no repayment until the home is no longer their primary residence. Staying current requires covering property taxes, homeowners insurance and maintenance.
But be careful. Read the fine print. This isn’t money you lend yourself. It’s a loan using your home equity as collateral. That means interest, typically at a high rate, plus other fees and costs. Worse than paying that interest monthly, it compounds, magnifying what you owe. When you sell, you repay the principal plus all compounded interest.

Elderly retirees need their finances to be simple, clear and available until they die. Reverse mortgages’ ballooning costs can cut against those basic needs.
Reverse mortgage calculators show interest’s huge impact. Pretend you did one borrowing $2,000 per month for 10 years – $240,000 in total. At a 4. 5% interest rate, your total due after 10 years would $303,530 – before fees. That’s $63,530 in interest alone. Bump it to 20 years of payments and your final bill is $779,160 – $480,000 in principal plus $299,160 in interest. Thirty years? You owe $1,524,468. Less than half of that, $720,000, is your principal. The majority is interest. The longer, the uglier – until your home’s entire value is the lender’s.
These loan amounts aren’t realistic for everyone. They’re illustrative, showing the key risk: underestimating your life expectancy, living far longer than you anticipate, and ending up aged and broke, unable to meet late-life health expenses. If you’re in great health with a good family history, you could live into your 90s or beyond. Planning for a longer life is key to not exhausting your money.
Reverse mortgages often do the opposite, with perverse incentives. The longer you live, the bigger the lender wins, while your compounding interest burden balloons. Do you really want to be cash-strapped and in debt while trying to fund assisted living or other late-life care?
Some disagree, arguing reverse mortgages can insure against depleting your savings before you die, working alongside an investment portfolio. They can. This view rightly considers folks’ assets in totality, rather than in buckets, avoiding a common error.
But it requires the elderly to invest well. Are you a strong investor? Will you be? Are you willing to risk being forced to sell your house late in life to cover a ginormous compounded interest debt, hoping there is enough left to live off of? At an age when most people need simplicity and ease, this seems unwise.
Beware products charging big fees for something you can do easily with cheaper, more simple investments. If you’re younger, save now and invest in your 401(k), reaping compound growth’s rewards rather than having them work against you. Stay invested throughout retirement without excessive binge-type withdrawals, and you should readily cover normal late-life expenses.
More security, less debt. Wouldn’t you rather have that control?

Will Russia get a pass from media conservatives?

Texto completo: The conservative media world, along with all but a few Republican members of Congress, are in the process of handing Vladimir Putin his greatest victory yet. They are ignoring the copious evidence in the Mueller report that Russia interfered in our election — and continues to do so. Pace Jared Kushner, it was a whole lot more sinister than a "couple of Facebook ads."
The narrative has now taken hold that the Mueller investigation originated with the Steele dossier. On Fox News, Ed Henry said that the FBI relied on the dossier to "get this whole thing going." Breitbart referred to the debunked "Russia hoax," and a Wall Street Journal editorial demanded to know how "the partisan propaganda known as the Steele dossier become the basis for an unprecedented FBI probe of a presidential campaign..."
As the Mueller report makes clear, and as even the infamous "Nunes memo" of 2018 conceded, the investigation did not begin with the dossier. It began when a foreign government (believed to be Australia) "informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with (George) Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign."
Sixteen members of the Trump campaign had direct ties with Russians or Russian agents, including President Donald Trump. Some of these were benign. Some were not. Paul Manafort was sharing polling information and plans for winning midwestern states with Konstantin Kilimnik, who has ties to Russian intelligence. Is it the received Republican wisdom now that this was not, at the very least, eyebrow raising?
As for Trump's connections to Russia, we now know that they existed throughout most of the campaign, even as he was issuing tweets like this one on July 26, 2016: "For the record, I had ZERO investments in Russia." And saying that it was crazy to suggest that Russia was "dealing with Trump." In fact, he had been negotiating one of his largest real estate projects ever, for a Trump Tower Moscow, until just the previous month.
But even if the investigation had begun with the Steele dossier, so what? As they say in legal circles: res ipsa loquitur — "the thing speaks for itself." The Mueller report is sober and meticulous. The dossier is hardly mentioned. If Republican partisans skip over the documentation of Russian meddling because they've internalized Trump's sense of grievance, they are disserving the nation.
The Russian interference was and is far more extensive than a few Facebook and Twitter posts, though those were noxious enough. The IRA (Internet Research Agency), an arm of the Russian intelligence services, along with the GRU (Russia's foreign intelligence service), also organized "dozens" of actual rallies, hacked into the computers of the Democratic Party, maliciously spread falsehoods, stoked already existing divisions between Americans of different races and ethnicities and planted malware. More worrying, the report notes that the Russians aimed at actual voting infrastructure:
"Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. The GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.
"In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees of (redacted), a voting technology company that developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to manage voter rolls..."
The independent counsel did not further investigate these attempts to subvert elections because the "Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity."
Or perhaps not. According to the New York Times, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wanted to make blocking Russian interference in the 2020 election a top priority. She was warned off by Trump's chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who made it clear that the president still regards any mention of Russia as a personal slight.
In a continuation of patterns established under communism, Russia has exerted malign influence on elections in many nations. Throughout the democratic world, they seek to sow the kind of division and distrust they enjoy in mother Russia. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Hungary and other former Soviet captives have been particularly hard hit, but the Russians have also stirred the pot of Catalan succession in Spain, boosted Marine Le Pen in France, and helped Brexit in Great Britain. In 2017, the Netherlands switched to all paper ballots to prevent Russia from hacking its election.
What is the difference between other democracies and the U.S.? Only here does dismissing the threat of Russian interference now equate with loyalty to the president.

THE GREAT GOP ABDICATION A PARTY THAT NO LONGER BELIEVES IN AMERICAN VALUES

Texto completo: So all the "fake news" was true. A hostile foreign power intervened in the presidential election, hoping to install Donald Trump in the White House. The Trump campaign was aware of this intervention and welcomed it. And once in power, Mr. Trump tried to block any inquiry into what happened. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="3283">
Never mind attempts to spin this story as somehow not meeting some definitions of collusion or obstruction of justice. The fact is that the occupant of the White House betrayed his country. And the question everyone is asking is, what will Democrats do about it?
But notice that the question is only about Democrats. Everyone (correctly) takes it as a given that Republicans will do nothing. Why?
Because the modern GOP is perfectly willing to sell out America if that's what it takes to get tax cuts for the wealthy. Republicans may not think of it in those terms, but that's what their behavior amounts to.
The truth is that the GOP faced its decisive test in 2016, when almost everyone in the Republican establishment lined up behind a man fully known to be a would-be authoritarian who was unfit morally, temperamentally and intellectually for high office.
In their chilling book "How Democracies Die," Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt call this "the great Republican abdication." The party's willingness to back behavior it would have called treasonous if a Democrat did it is just more of the same.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="3290">
Messrs. Levitsky and Ziblatt say that when mainstream politicians abdicate responsibility in the face of a leader who threatens democracy, it's usually for one of two reasons. Either they have the misguided belief that he can be controlled, or they're willing to go along because his agenda overlaps with theirs - that is, they believe that he'll give them what they want.
At this point it's hard to imagine that anyone still believes that Mr. Trump can be controlled. But he is delivering on the Republican establishment's agenda - certainly far more than any Democrat would.
The key point is that Republicans are committed to a policy agenda that is deeply unpopular. By large margins, the American public believes that corporations and the wealthy don't pay their fair share in taxes. By even larger margins, the public opposes cuts to safety-net programs like Medicaid. Yet as far as I can tell, every GOP budget proposal over the past decade has combined big tax cuts for the rich with savage cuts in Medicaid.
If the Republican agenda is so unpopular, how does the party win elections? Partly by lying about its policies. But mainly the GOP's political achievements depend on identity politics - white identity politics. Exploiting racial resentment to capture white working-class voters, while pursuing policies that benefit only the wealthy, has been the core of the party's political strategy for decades. That's why, in an increasingly diverse country, Republican support has stayed overwhelmingly white.

In a fundamental sense, Trumpism is the culmination of that strategy. Commentators keep calling Mr. Trump a "populist," but the only way in which he actually caters to working-class white voters is by appealing to their racial animus. He may be successful in doing so partly because it's the only thing about his political persona that's sincere: All indications are that he really is a racist.
His substantive policies, however, have followed the standard right-wing agenda: In 2017, he passed a huge tax cut, largely for corporations, that disproportionately benefited the wealthy, and almost succeeded in repealing Obamacare, in the process gutting Medicaid.
And these policies have endeared him to the GOP's money men. "Deep-pocketed Republicans who snubbed Donald Trump in 2016 are going all in for him in 2020," reports Politico.
They're doing so even though they know that Mr. Trump was installed in office in part thanks to Russian aid, that his financial entanglements with foreign governments pose huge conflicts of interest and that he consistently shows a preference for dictatorships over our democratic allies.
As I said, the modern GOP is perfectly willing to sell out America if that's what it takes to get tax cuts for the wealthy.
Once you accept this reality, two conclusions follow:
First, anyone expecting bipartisanship in dealing with the aftermath of the Mueller report - in particular, anyone suggesting that Democrats should wait for GOP support before proceeding with investigations that might lead to impeachment - is being deluded. Mr. Trump is giving the Republican establishment what it wants, and it will stick with him no matter what.
Second, it's later than you think for American democracy. Before 2016 you could have wondered whether Republicans would, in extremis, be willing to take a stand in defense of freedom and rule of law. At this point, however, they've already taken that test, and failed with flying colors.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="3304">
The simple fact is that one of our two major parties - the one that likes to wrap itself in the flag - no longer believes in American values. And it's very much up in the air whether America as we know it will survive.

Texto completo: In the bowels of the federal bureaucracy, in Cubicle 717-02 of the Consumer Product Safety Commission's headquarters in Bethesda, the U.S. government's experiment with memes is getting weird.
Joseph Galbo, 32, sits at this cube Mondays through Fridays with a stock photo subscription and a rudimentary knowledge of Photoshop. With these, he transforms banal government safety messaging into almost dadaist tableaus - if only the old dada artists had enjoyed access to ironic clip art.
Nearly three years after the agency hired its first "social media specialist" from the marketing world, Galbo has turned the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Twitter and Instagram feeds into a universe of flying smoke alarms, malevolent washing machines and cartoon cats riding all-terrain vehicles toward oncoming trucks. The effect is very twisted, somewhat dark, and - when you think about it - somehow appropriate for an agency that exists to worry about how your favorite retail products might kill you and your loved ones.
"Someone once said to me, our memes are what you call wholesome memes," Galbo said, and in his next breath proved he was fluent in the online vernacular. "Others look at this as just a government agency s--- posting. I don't agree. S--- posting is all about intent, or putting things up they don't believe in. This is straight-up earnest. It's an outlandish way of communicating something important. It could save your life."
Lives saved last year: somewhere between 0 and 800,000 - the latter the number of social media engagements for an agency that, before Galbo's arrival, had all the online charisma of a surgeon general's warning.
The experiment began on the second day of Baby Safety Month in 2016, when Galbo persuaded his boss to let him put an infant in a force field.
The agency's Twitter feed hadn't been entirely conventional until then. A horror GIF of an unsecured dresser crushing a dummy toddler had been put to good use, for example. But the image @USCPSC tweeted that Friday morning in September - a glowing baby inside what looked like the bubble from the end of "2001: A Space Odyssey" - was pure Galbo in its clip-art-meets-Photoshop-filter aesthetic, and its earnestly weird message: "Imagine a 3-foot force field around your baby. That's how far away cords should be at all times."
Force-field babies led to astronaut babies led to fire safety tips written on presidents' faces and the first of many inspirational messages about smoke alarm batteries. Certain consumer products took on personalities. Portable generators became tentacled monsters. Windows got lonely. An ATV rider named Ted was invented, and Ted rode his ATV through the Cretaceous Period, the Oregon Trail and the void, demonstrating proper helmet usage throughout. By the end of 2018, @USCPSC had gone viral so often that it caught the attention of the New York Times.
"The way he makes his images is really unique, and the absurdity has an appeal," said Elias Bruno, a 21-year-old YouTube host who is one of the agency's 56,000 Twitter followers. "A lot of brand accounts use memes as a marketing strategy. How many promoted Wendy's tweets have I seen cashing in on the latest meme? . . . A U.S. government agency doesn't really need to market. He just makes his own thing."
There is both less and more to Galbo's strategy than is immediately apparent. His work is unique by necessity; government regulations forbid him from using copyrighted images found in the most popular mainstream memes, limiting him to what he can scrounge from basic iStock photos. And yet for a man who works in the medium of unicorns and sea turtles, Galbo has thought deeply about the history and philosophy of his art.
"I grew up as part of the DARE generation," he said. "I forget what the DARE lion was called" - he was called Daren - "but it was a lion that would show up with a handful of meth, and you were supposed to take that seriously as a kid." The government has been creating cartoon characters since at least World War II, when it commissioned a humorless Smokey Bear to admonish the public about forest-fire risk. As if in parody, Galbo's characters are named haphazardly - Potato the dog, Dennis the unicorn, Bird Ben Franklin - and have passions as esoteric as reminding you to clean lint out of your dryer.
"A lot of [my] characters are taking what you'd expect to see of a government agency making and turning in on its head," Galbo said. "A lot of government agencies take themselves very seriously, and for good reason. But when it comes to your communications, it's got to be for people."
So he sits at his cubicle on a rented floor of a gray office tower on the fringes of the District, doing his strange work far below the tumult of White House politics or even the safety commission's occasional dramas, such as this month's scandal over how it handled concerns about jogging strollers. He works with headphones on, and depending on the day and the meme, those headphones might be playing Jay-Z's verse in "Diamonds From Sierra Leone" on an infinite loop while Galbo dreams of woodland animals battling faulty space heaters for the good of the American people.
Sometimes his dreams are dark.
"The more obvious a safety tip seems, the more people are going to shake their heads," Galbo said. "I want to put something out there that's going to get through that cynicism . . . something that shocks you out of your daze."
On Instagram, Galbo hand-drew a comic strip about an ironically named "Safety Cat," whose adventures in playground construction and joyriding always end one panel before an implied disaster. He abandoned humor altogether for an image last October of a baby sinking in a soapy bathtub. The caption reads, "They left me."
"That's stuff I want to do more often, actually," Galbo said, and mentioned that when his agency isn't trying to cram safety advice into the public consciousness, it is often working with people whose children and loved ones really were killed by everyday household objects. "I think we've gotten to a place that people expect us to have this fun messaging, which is great because when we do take a darker turn," they will pay attention.
For now, @USCPSC is still the odd duck in the federal ecosystem. Most government social-media feeds consist of bland literal messaging, or occasional throwback cartoon characters such as the National Weather Service's Owly Skywarn, whose idea of fun is asking his Twitter followers: "On this day in 1986, which city was impacted by a supercell thunderstorm that produced 4 tornadoes?"
Like the inspirational raccoon that starred in a tweet last July, Galbo believes habits can change. Late last year, a counterpart at National Park Service emailed him out of the blue, seeking insight into his "Twitter shenanigans." He expects the meme culture he has implanted at the safety commission will - as good memes do - evolve and spread across the public sector.
Galbo, who happens to work at relatively small and benevolent arm of the federal government, sees this as all for the good. But in time, the same viral psychological mechanisms that Wendy's uses to sell hamburgers could help other parts of government communicate with the governed. Even influence our behavior.
Or propagandize us? How might the Department of Defense deploy the techniques Galbo is developing? We didn't have the heart to ask him. He just wants everyone to be safe. It remains to be seen whether his future of government memes brings us smoke-alarm rainbows or ATVs in hell.

One tiny change made in a massive omnibus bill at the Legislature would nullify Minneapolis’ and St. Paul’s $15 minimum wage ordinances

Texto completo: Between the time a bill dealing with local labor laws was heard in a Minnesota Senate committee and when the proposal appeared in a large omnibus bill, a small change was made that could make a huge difference in its impact.
By changing a single date, from “2019” in the original bill to “2017” in the omnibus bill, the GOP-led Senate would cancel ordinances passed in Minneapolis and St. Paul to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The same language would preempt ordinances passed in those cities, as well as Duluth, that requires employers to let workers accumulate paid sick leave.
The date was the only change from when the original bill, SF 2321 — the Uniform State Labor Standards Act — was heard by and passed by the Senate’s Local Government Committee on March 13 and when it was incorporated into the large Jobs and Economic Growth omnibus bill drafted by the Senate Jobs and Economic Growth committee.
The original language of the bill noted: “This section is effective upon final enactment and applies to ordinances, local policies, and local resolutions enacted on or after January 1, 2019.”
But the Jobs and Economic Growth omnibus bill says: “This section is effective upon final enactment and applies to ordinances, local policies, and local resolutions enacted on or after January 1, 2017.”
The reason that date is so important: It was 2017 and 2018 when Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth adopted their ordinances to provide benefits to workers that exceed those required by the state. The state has a lower minimum wage adopted in 2014 but has no statewide statutory demand that workers be allowed to accumulate sick leave.
While there was testimony against the original bill in the Local Government Committee, none came from officials from the three cities. That was because the prime sponsor, Sen. Mark Koran, R-North Branch, had said the measure wouldn’t cancel out the existing ordinances. Instead, it would apply only to cities that adopt similar regulation in the future. That made the hearing more philosophical than practical, with supporters and opponents arguing about the concept of local control versus statewide standards.
But Sen. Eric Pratt, the Prior Lake Republican who chairs the Senate Jobs and Economic Growth committee, which put together the Jobs and Economic Growth omnibus bill, said he wanted the existing ordinances to be addressed in the larger bill, since it is important to have uniform labor standards across the state, especially for employers who do work in multiple cities. “This is about having uniform labor standards across the state,” Pratt said.
DFL elected officials argue that the state wage standard is the floor — the minimum — and that cities should be able exceed that if they want. But Pratt has a very different view. “I believe the state is the standard,” he said. “We’re not the floor; we’re not the ceiling; we’re the standard.”
“When we start talking about wage theft and safe and sick time and paid family medical leave, if the state is the floor you could have businesses having to comply with over 800 different rules and regulations depending on where their employee is,” he said. “As we were pulling it into our bill, it seemed appropriate that we make it retroactive to prior to when Minneapolis implemented their first labor ordinance.”
While some Republicans and some lawyers for businesses who challenged the Minneapolis wage ordinance in court thought the state already preempts local action, the state court of appeals disagreed, and in March it upheld the law. The Senate bill language states specifically that the state of Minnesota — and not local governments — has sole domain over labor standards.
Pratt takes issue with suggestions that he snuck the preemption language into his omnibus bill, saying that he briefed the DFL members of the committee on that and other changes ahead of time. It was also discussed in open committee before it was approved — and again when the bill was presented to the Senate Finance Committee. In fact, the existence of the preemption was one of the reasons Sen. Chris Eaton, DFL-Center, said she voted no.
“We had a good conversation when it went into the omnibus bill,” Pratt said. There was additional testimony and DFLers offered amendments to strip it out. “I didn’t want this to be me trying to sneak something in.”
Yet the breadth of the language in the omnibus bill was news to St. Paul City Council president Amy Brendmoen, who said she heard her city’s wage and leave ordinances were at risk. “Allowing the municipalities to make these changes at the local level is almost like a pilot project,” she said. “We’re doing the heavy lifting in figuring out how to navigate timelines and rollouts and working with advocates and businesses to come up with a good plan. I would think they would welcome the opportunity to see how these things work on the local level if they’re not willing to make a statewide investment in our people.”
“Rather than seeking preemption and trying to micro-manage local government, especially the urban core like Minneapolis and St. Paul, maybe the state could spend its energy on a statewide effort,” she said. “It seems funny to try to roll backward rather than take what we’re doing and move it forward to the state level.”
Brendmoen said she would have testified on the issue had she known it was attempting to cancel out the St. Paul ordinances. “This has been a huge priority for Mayor [Melvin] Carter. I know it has been a huge priority for Council President [Lisa] Bender and Mayor [Jacob] Frey in Minneapolis. I am sure there would have been loud voices testifying, not only from the city government but from the advocates who worked hard to create these ordinances.”
While Pratt said he hopes the language will be acceptable to House DFL leaders and Gov. Tim Walz, the chair of the House Jobs and Economic Development Committee said that will not happen. “It’s obviously a negotiating ploy, some kind of a what-can-I-trade-for,” said Rep. Tim Mahoney, DFL-St. Paul. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s not coming back to this House.”
“The states are the laboratories of the national government and the cities are the laboratories of the state government,” Mahoney continued. “I don’t understand what the Republican caucus has against laboratory experiments unless they are against science.”
Taking issues like minimum wage to the local level has become a central tenet of local and national Democrats. It was seen as a way to overcome opposition to higher wages at the federal and state levels. Dozens of cities, counties and a few states have adopted something akin to $15 Now ordinances. A New York Times article this week said that U.S. workers on average have the highest minimum wage in history because of the drive for local ordinances.
At the very beginning of session, House Speaker Melissa Hortman was asked at a Minnesota Chamber of Commerce dinner whether she favored increasing pay and benefit requirements for workers. While she said her DFL caucus would introduce a paid family leave insurance plan, local governments have been doing the work that the state has not. “Cities have been leading because the state has not been leading; and that has pushed the issue forward,” the Brooklyn Park lawmaker said.
“Cities need to be allowed to innovate,” Hortman continued, citing as an example public smoking bans that began in cities. “We learned that it could be good for our local economies by seeing counties and cities take leadership first.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Joe Biden's team said it raised $6.3 million in the first 24 hours since launching his presidential campaign, surpassing his rivals' first-day hauls as he seeks momentum at the start of his third run for the White House.
The former vice president's campaign-opening fundraising spree exceeded that of former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who pulled in $6.1 million during his first day, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who collected $5.9 million in his first 24-hour span.
Mr. Biden, who announced his campaign on Thursday, entering a field of 20 major Democrats vying to challenge President Trump, said in an email that it was "proof we are running a truly grass-roots campaign." His quick financial start came on a day in which the 76-year-old fielded questions about his lengthy tenure in the Senate and said he wouldn't commit to only a single term if elected.
The former vice president has lacked a large online fundraising apparatus compared with rivals like Mr. Sanders and Mr. O'Rourke, and has sought to make up for that with a strong showing among traditional fundraisers. Mr. Biden's first-day showing, while large, was the result of months of planning, and his campaign team will need to sustain a quick pace against rivals who used their head start to build their war chests and networks of small donors.
Mr. Sanders leads the pack with more than $18 million raised during the quarter ended March, while Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported more than $12 million and Mr. O'Rourke had $9.3 million.
Mr. Biden's team said Friday it received contributions from nearly 97,000 donors in the campaign's first 24 hours, a key measuring stick for online fundraising. None of the money Mr. Biden raised was earmarked specifically for the general election—all of it was dedicated to the primary, aides said.
That number of total donors is less than his rivals. Mr. Sanders, for example, received money from nearly 225,000 donors in his first day. Mr. O'Rourke, meanwhile, was helped by 128,000 donors on his first day.
Mr. Biden headlined a Philadelphia fundraiser Thursday that raised at least $700,000, according to organizers. The event was hosted by David L. Cohen, a senior executive vice president for Comcast Corp., and featured former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, an ally of Mr. Biden's.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has declined to hold any big-money private fundraisers, noted in an email supporters: "How did Joe Biden raise so much money in one day? Well, it helps that he hosted a swanky private fundraiser for wealthy donors at the home of the guy who runs Comcast's lobbying shop."
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign, meanwhile, said after Mr. Biden's fundraiser that it would no longer accept money from lobbyists. His campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, said the campaign was returning more than $30,000 in donations the mayor had received from registered lobbyists.
Mr. Biden will hold several fundraisers at the start of his campaign, including a Beverly Hills, Calif., event on May 8 with prominent Democratic donors such as Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg and director Rob Reiner.
Earlier Friday, Mr. Biden faced questions about his handling of the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, as he sat for his first televised interview since launching his campaign .
Mr. Biden said in an interview with ABC's "The View" that he was sorry for the manner in which the Senate Judiciary Committee treated Anita Hill, the law professor who had accused Mr. Thomas of sexual harassment when they worked together years earlier.
Mr. Biden, who served as the committee's chairman, faced criticism at the time that he was too accommodating to Mr. Thomas and failed to protect Ms. Hill, who is black, from a series of harsh questions from the committee, which was composed entirely of white men. Mr. Thomas, who is also black, denied the accusations and called the hearings "a high-tech lynching."
"If you go back and look at what I said and didn't say, I don't think I treated her badly," Mr. Biden said in Friday's interview. "What I couldn't figure out to do, and we still haven't figured it out: How do you stop people from asking inflammatory questions? How do you stop these character assassinations?"
Mr. Biden added: "There are a lot of mistakes made across the board, and for those, I apologize, that we may have been able to do and conduct it better. But I believed Dr. Hill from the beginning, from the beginning, and I said it."
Mr. Biden spoke in private earlier this month with Ms. Hill and said he told her he was sorry for the way she was treated.
Who's Running in 2020
Ms. Hill said in an interview Wednesday with the New York Times that she wasn't satisfied with what he said to her. Ms. Hill, a Brandeis University professor of social policy, law and women's, gender and sexuality studies, didn't respond to requests for comment Thursday and Friday.
Mr. Biden also stopped short Friday of offering a full-throated apology to the seven women who came forward in recent weeks t o accuse him of invading their personal space in his interactions with them. None of the women have accused him of sexual harassment.
Mr. Biden said he needed to be "more cognizant" of his interactions with men and women and their personal space.
When co-host Joy Behar noted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi "wants you to say, 'I'm sorry I invaded your space,'" Mr. Biden responded: "So I invaded your space…I'm sorry this happened."
"But I'm not sorry in the sense that I think I did anything that was intentionally designed to do anything wrong or be inappropriate," he said. "It was inappropriate that I didn't understand."
Mr. Biden declined to commit to serving only one term if elected, adding that he might get only one term if he wins.

Texto completo: The press wants so badly to believe religious conservatives have a seething, unquenchable hatred for gay people that newsrooms are creating drama and feuds where none seems to exist.

The most recent imagined struggle between the religious Right and the gay community (where the gay community is glorified) comes from CNN, which published an attention-grabbing opinion piece (technically an "analysis") Thursday titled, “Pete Buttigieg, a gay Christian, is driving the religious right nuts.”

With a headline such as that, the reader is right to expect that the accompanying article will include a litany of examples showing the religious Right has a decidedly noncharitable view of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Surely the CNN article provides examples spanning the whole, vast, and diverse array of various faith factions and traditions that make up the religious Right.

Nope.

No such litany of examples is provided by the article’s author, CNN Politics digital director Zachary Wolf. In fact, the only proof that the religious Right is being driven “nuts” by Buttigieg is three tweets from Franklin Graham, who is very much not a fan of the mayor.

As a card-carrying member of the “religious Right,” I can say with confidence that Graham does not speak for me. I can also say with confidence that he does not speak for the whole of the religious Right. To be fair, the CNN article itself hedges by saying that “some” on the “religious right” see Buttigieg as an anomaly (again, it quotes only Graham). But that “some,” which is doing a lot of heavy lifting, justifies neither the headline nor the story’s reason to exist. We are told that Buttigieg is driving the religious Right “nuts.” We are then told that Buttigieg's existence as a gay Christian “does not compute” for "some on the religious right." We are then given a single example of what the headline and the body of the story allege. This is nonsense.

Now, it would be one thing if this CNN article existed in a vacuum. But we keep seeing this from our national media, asserting, without evidence, that some member of the LGBT community is just owning the hell out of religious conservatives.

In 2018, for example, newsrooms hyped a supposed war of words between Vice President Mike Pence and gay Olympic skater Adam Rippon. USA Today even claimed the vice president had “backed down” after being put in his place by the skater. In reality, Rippon was the one doing all the talking. He repeated the baseless assertion that the vice president supports gay conversion therapy, which Pence’s office denied. The vice president invited Rippon to the White House to discuss the matter, which the skater declined.

So an athlete lied about Pence. Pence invited him to talk about it. USA Today painted it is Pence "back[ing] down." Baffling.

From this, newsrooms such as the New York Times ran with headlines such as: “Mike Pence Tangles With Olympian Adam Rippon Over Gay Rights Record.”

More recently, newsrooms have tried to build up a supposed “feud” between Pence and Buttigieg over the issue that the former is a Christian and the latter is gay. But like the Rippon story, the Pence/Buttigieg “fight” is also a matter of one side doing all the talking (that side being Buttigieg). Pro tip: It is not a dispute or even an argument if only one side participates.

I understand we are in the era of reality TV politics, and newsrooms love a good drama to drive clicks and eyeballs. But let us at least have something to back up the gossip we sell in our headlines.

Rep. King says he relates to persecution of Jesus

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Steve King said that after facing months of criticism for comments in the New York Times about white supremacy and nationalism, he better understands the persecution Jesus Christ felt.
The 4th District representative made the comments in response to a question from the Rev. Pinky Person of the Faith In Christ Fellowship, who told King during a town hall Tuesday in Cherokee that she was concerned that "Christianity is really being persecuted."
"When I have to step down to the floor of the House of Representatives, and look up at those 400-and-some accusers — you know we just passed through Easter and Christ's passion — and I have better insight into what He went through for us, partly because of that experience," King told about 30 attendees the town hall at Western Iowa Tech Community College.
King's "accusers" were fellow members of the U.S. House of Representatives, who took action condemning King after the New York Times published an article quoting him saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
House Republicans also stripped King of committee assignments after the article.
The Kiron Republican has repeatedly said the New York Times misquoted him or mischaracterized his words.
King said he is proud of the "strong Christian ethic" in the 4th District. He said the United States is a Christian nation because Americans have strong morals and are willing to confess to wrongdoings and ask for forgiveness.
"It's in our culture, it's who we are," he said. "If it were any other way we wouldn't be the America we are, and probably wouldn't be an America at all."
King is a member of the Roman Catholic Church. He said he counts on his faith to get through difficulties in his role.
He faces multiple primary challenges for the 4th District seat.

Opioid epidemic &#xa0;was vertically integrated

Texto completo: When Marianne Williamson, self-help author and Democratic presidential aspirant, visited Headrest last week, she attributed the nation’s opioid addiction crisis to greed by pharmaceutical companies, health care providers and pharmacies, abetted by lax federal regulation. As staff writer Tim Camerato reported, the substance-abuse recovery experts at the Lebanon-based nonprofit demurred. While the desire for ill-gotten gains are partially to blame, they said, society was also calling for drugs to better manage pain and doctors were often misinformed about the effects of opioids.
It’s certainly true that man-made catastrophes rarely have a single cause, but recent litigation and criminal prosecutions pending in courtrooms across the nation bolster the case that Williamson was arguing: that the addiction crisis is profit-driven.
At the provider end, on the same day that Williamson visited Headrest, federal indictments were unsealed charging 60 people, including 31 doctors, seven pharmacists and eight nurses, with various schemes to illegally peddle pain pills in exchange for cash and, in some cases, sex. According to an assistant U.S. attorney general, the cases involved about 350,000 opioid prescriptions totaling more than 32 million pills. That, he said, is “the equivalent of a dose of opioids for every man, woman and child” in the five states combined where the schemes were operated — Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and West Virginia.
At the middleman level, The New York Times reported earlier this week that the attorneys general of New York, Washington state and Vermont have brought new civil suits accusing drug distributors of devising schemes to evade federal regulation, helping some pharmacies increase or get around limits on the amount of opioids they were allowed to buy and tipping off others that they were at risk of being reported to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. The companies deny the allegations.
Consider that combined, the three major players in the field control 90 percent of the distribution market for drugs and medical supplies. One of them, McKesson, reached an agreement in 2017 with the Justice Department to settle allegations that it failed to meet its legal obligation to monitor and report suspicious orders of opioids. If you doubt that the business is lucrative, consider that the $150 million it agreed to pay the government is less than the $159 million retirement package it bestowed on its longtime chief executive when he left in 2013. (After a public outcry, the package was reduced to a tidy $114 million.)
At the producer end, lawsuits filed by the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York have highlighted the role of the Sackler family and the company it controls, Purdue Pharma. According to the Times, the filings cite documents that allegedly demonstrate that the family continued to push hard to expand the market for its highly lucrative and highly addictive signature drug, OxyContin, and other opioids years after it had pleaded guilty in 2007 to a felony involving fraudulent marketing of OxyContin and paid more than $600 million in criminal and civil penalties. The filings also allege that as the opioid crisis deepened, the family recognized a new business opportunity in developing opioid-addiction treatment drugs to counter the problem the company had helped to create, profiting at both ends of the funnel. Both the Sacklers and the company deny the allegations.
The filings also shed light on the causes of the crisis highlighted by the Headrest staffers in their meeting with Williamson. According to the Times, they detail how the pharmaceutical industry undertook a concerted effort to reshape public perception of pain and to undercut physicians’ reluctance to prescribe opioids by downplaying the risks of addiction and raising the specter of an epidemic of untreated pain affecting 100 million Americans. And sales representatives focused their marketing efforts in part on inexperienced providers and primary care physicians who knew little about pain management, according to the suits.
We do not hold that the love of money is the root of all evil. But 200,000 Americans have died of overdoses related to prescription opioids since OxyContin came on the market in 1996. Much evidence suggests that the pursuit of profit is heavily implicated in that appalling death toll.

Another reason to quit Twitter: To better understand American voters

Texto completo: It was an accident, a simple act of muscle memory that pulled up the tweets about the black hole.

For Lent, I had decided to give up a very powerful addiction: Twitter. An update in Apple’s iOS had begun alerting me to how much screen time I was spending on social media each day, and the horrifying tally shocked me into action. Each day, I’d post a photo of my dog and then dutifully close out the app without reading or engaging with whatever was in my feed.

But April 10, without intention, and without even noticing it, I had flicked over to my Twitter feed and encountered a solid stream of photos of a glowing orange donut and the accompanying news that history had been made. (Part of why I did not immediately notice that I was reading tweets: the collective awe and wonder at the story was mostly devoid of toxicity and partisanship.)

Black holes are fascinating for countless reasons, not the least of which is their ability to warp space-time. They pull matter toward themselves so strongly that it bends everything near them.

After a few weeks of being away from the daily Twitter chatter, I have come away more convinced than ever that the platform itself is a kind of black hole, exerting enormous pull and warping everything it touches.

Don’t worry: this is not a column about how I left Twitter and became a better and more enlightened person in the process. On Easter evening, with my 40-day fast completed, I was back logged in reading everyone’s take on the latest "Game of Thrones" episode. All of my usual quirks and flaws are still intact. But it was a fascinating experiment in seeing just how different one’s experience of news consumption differs when it no longer includes Twitter, and how easily the platform warps discussion in an unhelpful way.

While I was off Twitter, the team at the New York Times’ Upshot analyzed some data from the Hidden Tribes opinion research project, trying to understand the differences between Democrats who do and don’t engage in politics online. The analysis looked at the demographic and behavioral differences between Democrats who posted about their political views or political stories on social media, and found that there are large ideological gaps between the two worlds, with a majority of “offline” Democrats identifying themselves as moderate or conservative.

The implications of this are important; it will be tempting for Democratic presidential contenders to feel compelled to engage with the Twitter panic of the moment, to have an opinion or talking point or meme about everything, to win the internet. And there’s a certain group of Democratic primary voters among whom this matters quite a bit. They are largely white, progressive, college-educated, and economically better off. They are the folks who are most likely to make a donation or show up at a rally.

But, crucially, Twitter is not a representative sample of much of anything. Smart political observers will keep that in mind.

During the time I was off of Twitter, whole news stories came and went. The ones that truly mattered — the release of the Mueller report, for instance — were ones that were easy to read about through a news diet that looked more like what your average American’s does. Being off Twitter did not mean being off the planet, it just meant I missed out on the internet laughing at a coddled college student who can’t cope with food that has sauce on it.

Twitter is obviously a powerful force. It is undoubtedly a piece of how Donald Trump is now president. It has contributed to revolutions. But it is also important to bear in mind how much it warps the reality it touches, and how it pulls into its orbit a decidedly unrepresentative pool of political views.

Texto completo: “Me pregunto si The New York Times se disculpará conmigo por segunda vez, como lo hicieron después de las elecciones de 2016. Pero esta vez tendrá que ser una disculpa mucho más grande y mejor. En este caso, tendrán que arrodillarse y pedir perdón, ¡son verdaderamente el Enemigo del Pueblo! ”, escribió el mandatario Donald Trump el martes en Twitter.
Según él, el diario más importante del país debe “arrodillarse y pedir perdón” por su cobertura negativa de su presidencia, como parte de un desgarro de Twitter ayer contra una variedad de medios de comunicación.
El presidente también criticó a Paul Krugman, columnista de ese diario, cuyo último artículo de opinión dice “uno de nuestros dos partidos”, en referencia al Republicano, “ya no cree en los valores estadounidenses”.
La columna criticaba a Trump y los resultados de la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la supuesta injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016 , afirmando que el mandatario estaba consciente de la intervención en su campaña por parte de una “potencia extranjera hostil” y, una vez en el cargo, trató de obstruir cualquier investigación sobre ese hecho.
“Paul Krugman, de Fake News New York Times, ha perdido toda credibilidad, al igual que el mismo Times, con sus escritos falsos y altamente inexactos sobre mí. Él está obsesionado con el odio, al igual que otros están obsesionados con lo estúpido que él es. Dijo que el mercado se estrellaría, ¡Sólo los máximos históricos!”, escribió Trump en Twitter.
Añadió: “¡Los radicales demócratas de izquierda, junto con sus líderes en los medios de noticias falsos, se han vuelto completamente locos! Supongo que eso significa que la agenda republicana está funcionando. ¡Manténte sintonizado, viene más!”
También cuestionó a Chris Cuomo de CNN y al canal por darle un programa en horario estelar. Y a Joe Scarborough de MSNBC, diciendo que el presentador de “Morning Joe” ha “caído en picada” y lo llamó “demasiado enojado, tonto y enfermo”.
Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Stephen Moore, the conservative commentator who has been tapped by President Donald Trump for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, lashed out Tuesday in response to news media reports on his past writings about women, accusing journalists of "pulling a Kavanaugh against me. "
Moore was equating the resurfacing of his old columns and interviews to the allegations of sexual misconduct that surfaced against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as his confirmation played out last year.
Since his appointment by Trump, "it's been one personal assault after another and a kind of character assassination, having nothing to do with economics," Moore said during an interview with North Dakota radio station WZFG.

"They have six full-time investigative reporters looking into me at The Washington Post, and New York Times and CNN," Moore said. "I kind of wear it as a badge of honor, that they're so afraid of me that they want all these people looking into my past because they're worried that I am going to prevail here. "
Moore cited news coverage of his National Review columns – in which he bemoaned the rise of women in sports, and gender equality in general – as examples of the media campaign against him.
Moore told CNN, which first reported on his past writings, that those columns were "a spoof," explaining, "I have a sense of humor. "
And Moore noted reports that included details about a messy divorce process that began in 2010.
Reporters have also pointed to Moore's past statements that he is "not a big believer in democracy. "
Moore told WZFG that his critics "have not attacked me on my economic ideas" and that he is willing to "debate anybody, anywhere, anytime" on the economy or his qualifications.
CNN host Erin Burnett did ask Moore about one of his economic opinions earlier this month, challenging him on his past statements in favor of a return to the gold standard, an idea opposed by many leading economists.
Moore claimed he had not said "anything much" about the gold standard, at which point Burnett played a series of clips in which he did exactly that.
USA TODAY's Editorial Board has objected to Moore's nomination, citing a lack of qualifications.
Democrats have derided Moore's nomination, along with Trump's other pick of former Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain, comparing their selection to a skit on NBC's comedy show, "Saturday Night Live. "

Cain withdrew his nomination on Monday. During an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Tuesday night, he said his decision to withdraw had "nothing to do with" with the past accusations of sexual harassment that helped derail his 2012 presidential campaign.
Rather he said he realized the Federal Reserve would not be a good fit for him when he learned about the limitations he would face.
"That’s like taking a stallion, keeping him in the stable, and not let him run," Cain said.

'Sleeper' &amp; keeper?

Texto completo: When Chad Thorson strolls into a Steak 'n Shake in Indianapolis, he turns heads.
Is that him?
Could it be?
What will he order?
It happens at the Potbelly on Washington Street too. The cashiers swear Thorson is Peyton Manning. So you can imagine the reaction when Thorson appears within 50 miles of Lucas Oil Stadium.
And how's this for a juicy topping? Clayton Thorson and his brothers will play along, asking their dad just loud enough: "Hey, when's Uncle Eli coming to town?"
During one visit a waiter remarked: "Mr. Thorson, it wasn't until you gave me your credit card that I knew it wasn't Peyton Manning."
So Chad Thorson, Clayton's father, is not the five-time NFL MVP and ace pitchman. But Manning is a family friend. His agent, Tom Condon, is also the agent for Clayton Thorson, the former Northwestern quarterback.
And speaking of connections: Before the 1990 draft, ESPN analyst Mel Kiper heralded Chad Thorson, linebacker from Wheaton College, as a sleeper.
Want your mind blown? Kiper remembers doing it. Vividly.
"He was a tackling machine, a phenomenal player, a 3-4 inside linebacker," Kiper said. "I had him 6-2 and about 239, 240 (pounds). What hurt him was that he ran a 5.05 (40-yard dash) at the combine, but he was a dominant performer at a lower level of competition. All over the field."
There were 12 rounds that year. More than 330 players were drafted. Thorson was not selected. It was 29 years ago.
And now Kiper is grading Clayton Thorson, taller and trimmer than his dad at 6-foot-4 and 222 pounds. Kiper projects him to go in the fourth round Saturday.
"Before you know it," Kiper joked, "I'm going to be scouting Clayton Thorson's kids."

Among Giants
Chad Thorson recalls the Chargers and Giants saying they would draft him in 1990, but neither did. It was the first year juniors were eligible for the NFL draft, and the linebacker group was so strong, seven went in the top 18. (The Giants snagged a future Pro Bowl kicker, Matt Stover, with their final selection.)
Thorson recalls being the first Division III player to participate in the Senior Bowl and thought he would be a mid-round pick, so it stung. But the Giants signed him right after the draft, and he celebrated at his family's home in Columbus, Ohio, with fiancee Shauna. He reported to training camp in New Jersey. His coaches were Bill Parcells, Bill Belichick (defensive coordinator) and Al Groh (linebackers). Romeo Crennel coached the defensive line, and Charlie Weis helped with special teams.
"To see that expertise," Thorson said, "you can understand why they won the Super Bowl."
The linebacking corps included All-Pros Carl Banks and Pepper Johnson. And -- oh, yeah -- Lawrence Taylor.
Thorson recalls a bit of razzing -- "Where is Wheaton College?" -- but no hazing. The Gulf War broke out in August 1990, and Thorson says they talked politics; he was a political science major at Wheaton.
"Pepper Johnson went to Ohio State; he was someone I looked up to," Thorson said. "Carl Banks became a close friend. LT is arguably the greatest defensive player in NFL history. He held out that training camp but was there the next one. They were happy and willing to show me how to shed blockers. They said: 'Hey, let's get the second- and third-team guys better.' It was the epitome of team.
"And they used to tell us: 'Don't watch film of LT. What he's doing, you can't do.' "
That professionalism permeated the organization. Before the Giants' final preseason game, players were brought by bus from the team hotel to the stadium.
"If they were going to cut you," Thorson said, "they'd grab you before you turned left into the locker room."
After Thorson made it in safely, he thought: Oh, my goodness. Then Parcells found him and told him the team had tried to trade running back Joe Morris to open a roster spot.
If that explanation sounds far-fetched, consider the headline that ran in the New York Times on Aug. 29, 1990: "Giants Keep Morris (For Now), but Waive Thorson."
Thorson long-snapped and played linebacker for the Birmingham Fire of the World League of American Football. The Eagles signed him and kept him for six weeks. The Giants picked him off waivers, and he spent 1991 on injured reserve. After the Colts released him in 1992, he moved to Wheaton and got a job in financial services, selling bonds.
He's now an executive at Performance Trust Capital Partners. He and Shauna have five children: Hunter, Luke, Clayton, Molly and Ben. Three are married, including Clayton, 23, with another wedding scheduled for June.
When it comes to settling down, this family runs the two-minute drill.

Family ties
On the eve of Northwestern's 2018 season, Clayton Thorson joked about how wife Audrey, who works for a Chicago software company, was the family breadwinner.
For how much longer?
"Well, hopefully until next April 28 or something like that," he said.
April 28 is Sunday.
"Holy cow," Clayton said.
He selected Condon as his agent in part because Condon represented his dad, in part because of the Manning connection (Clayton got to know Peyton and Eli at the Manning Passing Academy) and in part because of what Condon told him: "I can't get you drafted any higher. And any agent who tells you he can is wrong."
The reverse sales pitch also worked on NFL quarterbacks Matthew Stafford, Sam Bradford, Matt Ryan and Alex Smith.
Thorson started 53 games for Northwestern, beginning his senior season less than eight months after ACL reconstruction surgery on his right knee. He threw for 10,731 yards, but his 58.4 completion percentage was middling.
Asked what he believes Thorson must do to have a good career, Kiper said: "Getting healthy. Getting back to where he was. He was limited (last season), playing at less than 100 percent. I give him a lot of credit for playing and being an inspiration and leading them to a lot of victories. He has an NFL arm. He's a smart kid, a tough kid. Once he gets back to 100 percent, I think Clayton Thorson has a chance to be a starting quarterback in the NFL."
Thorson will watch the draft with family members in Wheaton, breaking for the occasional game of touch football. (He's the automatic QB.) On Saturday he'll throw with former NFL quarterback Kent Graham, his longtime personal coach.
His father remains Clayton's role model. They view football the same way -- a huge part of Clayton's life, but not his life.
"He's a husband, a son, a great friend, a follower of Christ," Chad said. "That is his essence."
That essence will not be affected by which round he's selected.
"I said to him: Whatever happens this week, the goal is to get an opportunity to earn a spot on the roster," Chad said. "Show 'em what you've got."

The Mueller report identified 1 guilty party: The gullible American public

Texto completo: Along with the far left and far right in the U.S., Russian President Vladimir Putin holds the pieties of liberal democracy in contempt. His nation's attacks on American hearts and minds, detailed in the long-awaited Mueller report, carried with them the spirit of the Joker in the Batman myth -- a malevolent court jester motivated by venality, contempt for pretense and a craving for relevance and thrills.
In the special counsel's report, one member of WikiLeaks -- the organization that framed, staged, timed and distributed Russian-hacked material to wreak maximum havoc on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign -- described his feckless goals this way:
"We want this repository to become 'the place' to search for background on hillary's plotting at the state department during 2009-2013. ... Firstly because its useful and will annoy Hillary, but secondly because we want to be seen to be a resource/player in the US election, because eit (it) may encourage people to send us even more important leaks."
To a ghastly extent, the social media attempts "to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States" (Mueller's words) and the more formal Russian military cyberattacks to demonize Clinton (and by extension liberals and centrists) succeeded. They've left our cognitive processes in disarray.
It used to be that Americans didn't feel remotely threatened by "invaders" at the border; or thwarted by a phantom "deep state"; or constantly lashed by racist, sexist and violent fantasies. These psychic phenomena, and many more, were seeded in our consciousness on Facebook and Twitter and Reddit, then amplified by traditional media so aggressively that we came to believe and even act on them.
Like Iago whispering to Othello, the Kremlin's operations convinced the prosperous, peaceful United States that it is teetering on the brink of civil war.
Just read the opening -- pages 19 to 62 -- of Robert Mueller's work product. This section closely resembles the 9/11 Commission report, the exhaustive compendium of facts issued in 2004 not to build a criminal case but just to show us what happened on Sept. 11, 2001.
Likewise, we need to know what happened in 2016, when armies of hostile foreign actors decided to have their way with us. We have to get it straight if for no other reason than that it will clear our heads enough to grasp what follows in the report.
Beginning in 2014, the Internet Research Agency, a network of Russian trolls and other "information war" foot soldiers, went to work online "to undermine the U.S. electoral system" essentially by making trouble.
The will to make trouble is a constant in the report. According to White House counsel Don McGahn, President Donald Trump wanted his henchmen to "do crazy stuff" (he used an obscenity) to shut down the Mueller probe. The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, intended to create a dramatic rift between Clinton and Bernie Sanders just to keep things "interesting."
In early 2016, the IRA had moved on to disparaging Clinton nearly full time, while lavishing fond attention on Sanders and praising Trump as a mashup of Superman, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and Jesus. It also staged rallies for candidate Trump, in sync with local activists.
People who should have known better picked up the dis-info campaign. And this wasn't just Trumpites like Kellyanne Conway and Michael Flynn. U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul, for example, amplified one of the IRA's most prolific "personas" -- accounts manned by intelligence professionals -- on Twitter. The report adds that "U.S. media outlets also quoted tweets from IRA-controlled accounts and attributed them to the reactions of real U.S. persons," citing a 2018 study from the Columbia Journalism Review.
Russian military intelligence -- the GRU -- was more overtly criminal. In short, its operatives hacked both the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, and then made sure to release only the material that would hurt Clinton and the Democrats. Again, some media outlets recycled what was gouged out of the servers.
Assange middle-managed the handoff from the GRU to various illustrious newspapers. Readers no less than reporters were enthralled by the stolen materials and the fraternity-style panty raid on Clinton. Amy Chozick, who covered the Clinton campaign for The New York Times, later described herself as "an unwitting agent of Russian intelligence."
We all were.
What makes the attacks on the U.S. so repellent and ultimately tragic is that so few saw them for what they were -- viruses, memes and earworms unleashed in social and traditional media where Americans spend an average of 11 hours every day, and where we are supremely vulnerable to novelty and arousal: #whitegenocide, #invasion, #hillaryforprison -- a lot of us spread this stuff, if only to complain about it.
The hacker's work is to create, prevent and capitalize on disruptions on the internet. Amoral in themselves, disruptions are pure opportunity: to confound enemies, to make money, to achieve renown. Even the good guys, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which develops emerging technologies for use by the military, states as a goal "preventing -- and creating -- strategic surprise."
The Mueller report is so rich, and its lessons are infinite. Here's my first one: Refuse to be drafted into the next infowar, and certainly don't enlist. If something you're being fed hurts the brain, don't believe it. It could be a reference to "the Satan" that's not quite idiomatic. Or a photo of mostly naked girls demonstrating in favor of Harvey Weinstein.
Mueller is careful -- to a fault -- to go only where the evidence leads. Trust him on this: If it seems un-American, it is.

Operations at Boeing Dreamliner plant threaten safety, NYT says

Texto completo: Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, one of two plants that produces the 787 Dreamliner, has faced problems with production and oversight that create a safety threat, the New York Times reported.
The Times cited a review of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records, as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees.
Faulty parts have been installed in some of the planes, and metal shavings were often left inside the jets. A technician at the plant, Joseph Clayton, said he routinely found debris dangerously close to wiring beneath cockpits.
Brad Zaback, Boeing South Carolina's site leader, disputed the report in an email to his team, saying the manufacturing operations are healthy and performing strongly based on quality metrics. The newspaper also declined Boeing's invitation to visit that site, he said.
The report "paints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team here at Boeing South Carolina," he said. "This article features distorted information, rehashing old stories and rumors that have long ago been put to rest."
John Barnett, a former quality manager who retired in 2017 after almost three decades at Boeing, said he found clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands flight controls. A U.S. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, Lynn Lunsford, said the agency inspected several planes that Boeing had certified as free of such debris and found the same metal slivers.
Less than a month after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max jet on March 10, which came five months after another Boeing 737 Max crashed in Indonesia, Boeing called North Charleston employees to a meeting and told them customers were finding random objects in new planes.
In 2014, Qatar Airways stopped taking 787 Dreamliners from North Charleston after complaining workers had damaged plane exteriors. The airline's chief executive officer chastised the North Charleston workers, saying they weren't being transparent about the length or cause of the delays. Qatar Airways has since only taken Dreamliners built in Everett, Washington. Qatar said in a statement to the New York Times it "continues to be a long-term supporter of Boeing and has full confidence in all its aircraft and manufacturing facilities."
Boeing's head of commercial airplanes, Kevin McAllister, defended the South Carolina team and said they were producing the highest levels of quality. "I am proud of our teams' exceptional commitment to quality and stand behind the work they do each and every day," McAllister said.
The newspaper's report comes as Boeing is close to submitting its software fix linked with the two fatal 737 Max accidents. Once Boeing's proposed fix is finalized, it will be reviewed by U.S. regulators. The FAA's testing could go beyond June.

Texto completo: Before we declare, as The New York Times already did Tuesday, that the radical new school diversity admissions plans being implemented in some city districts are "working," perhaps we should check in with parents like Magali Selosse.
Selosse, like the rest of us guardians of fifth-graders in Brooklyn's District 15, found out Monday which middle school her son is being assigned to. For those who haven't experienced the pleasure, it may shock you to learn that parents of these 10-year-olds are tasked with ranking up to 12 schools in order of preference, after which there's a lottery, then the system spits out your designation.
Until last year in D15, student performance - attendance, test scores, specialized talent - was taken into consideration. This makes sense when you have arts schools, or gifted and talented centers such as the Park Slope favorite M.S. 51, where Mayor de Blasio and local City Councilman Brad Lander successfully graduated their kids from.
These "screens," as they are derisively termed, had originally been implemented in the 1980s and 90s as a way to lure middle-class parents of high-achieving elementary school students back into an unattractive system.
It worked! The kids came back, the parents stayed in the district, and several schools started to noticeably improve.
But then five years ago the Civil Rights Project at UCLA embarrassed local progressives by pointing out that those very schools were heavily white in an ethnically mixed area. The race to "desegregation" was on, culminating with the decision last fall to ditch every screen except poverty and special needs. Now 52% of each middle school in the district is supposed to be composed of kids who are either homeless, speak English as a second language, or qualify for reduced-price school lunch.
So our incoming class of middle schoolers are the diversity guinea pigs. Tuesday morning, as local grandees were congratulating themselves for dramatically upping the percentage of poor kids being admitted into coveted schools, parents like Selosse were sharing horror stories via email.
"[I] took off from work and took my kid out of school to tour institutions and choose our best fit in creating a list of 12 choices," the French native wrote. Result? Her son was assigned to "a school we never heard of...45 minutes away from home. With the lowest scores you can possibly imagine....It's a disaster for us."
Nearly half of the 36 students represented on our PS 58 French dual-language program email list were assigned to institutions they ranked ninth, lower, or not at all, with a disproportionate amount being shunted to the same low-performing school in far-off Sunset Park (whose percentage of low-income/special needs admissions was thereby slashed from 91% last year to 67% this week).
Not that any of our kid's classmates intend to go. "Makes me wonder why we made a list," Didier Louvet wrote.
Unlike its proponents, I have no idea whether the new system will improve the schools and provide a better learning environment for my daughter (who, knock on wood, got the school she wanted). But I can testify that when the admissions overhaul was being sold at a public forum last August, the first mention of student performance came 45 minutes in, not from Lander nor the school diversity consultants, but a parent, who had to interrupt to even inject that not-insignificant consideration.
Therein lies my worry, and warning to the rest of the city. Equality of opportunity is a critical goal. But the simple black-white measures of desirability, before and during this process, has been the color of people's skins and the size of their incomes, rather than the measurable quality of their schools and experiences.
You can "improve" such measurements by driving good students and motivated parents to exit the public system. But that's not likely to improve the schools.

CIA going too far with censorship

Texto completo: I have joined in a lawsuit with four former federal employees to end the government's censorship of our writings on national security issues. The current publications-review system of our intelligence agencies is dysfunctional, inhibiting our ability to participate in national security debates. The government has a legitimate interest in protecting bona fide secrets, but the review system is opaque, exceeding legitimate national security boundaries and compromising free speech. Former CIA director Michael Hayden acknowledged the problem, stating that "although the public cannot be briefed on everything, there has to be enough out there so that the majority of the population believes what they [i.e., intelligence agencies] are doing is acceptable."
My experience with the Central Intelligence Agency's review system exemplifies the obstacles that keep legitimate information from policymakers and the public. In last year's congressional discussions of the confirmation for CIA director Gina Haspel, senior agency officials, such as former acting director Mike Morell, were permitted to defend her role in the unconscionable practice of torture and abuse in secret prisons during the War on Terror. The CIA's publications review board, however, redacted my writings describing her extensive role in these activities. Her involvement was effectively covered up. For a forthcoming book, the reviewers ordered me to remove a reference to an article in the New York Times that referred to these activities because they claimed the "title" of that article was classified.
My last book, "Whistleblower at the CIA," was critical of the CIA's politicization of intelligence in the 1980s and in the run up to the Iraq War in 2003. The book was held up for 11 months, violating the 30-day time period for review that was part of my original agreement with the CIA; the time frame was affirmed in a 1972 circuit court decision. My analysis of U.S. drone activities, including a reference to civilian casualties, was redacted, although I was citing the public remarks of U.S. officials, including the president of the United States.
Manuscripts from former senior intelligence officials who praise the work of the intelligence community are quickly reviewed and rarely redacted. Critical manuscripts, on the other hand, receive extensive delays and numerous redactions of materials previously discussed in the media. There are nonsensical examples as well. I was told that there could be no references in my writing to CIA "station chiefs" because the term is classified. The agency backed off when I cited the numerous references to station chiefs in the writings of former director of central intelligence Stansfield Turner. Similar time was wasted arguing references to CIA training facilities in Virginia, which are familiar to anyone who follows the news or reads the works of David Baldacci.
In addition to imposing long review periods, the CIA now is demanding that I dispose of all redacted information by transporting "hard copy material" as well as CD/DVDs and memory cards to a "USG approved destruction capability." They also want to approve deletions from the cloud, such as Dropbox or Google Drive, or from files in the "Recycle Bin" or "Trash" folders. I consider this harassment.
Another deliberate attempt to complicate the process of review is to maintain a very small staff at the CIA's Publications Review Board. The agency is managing the review system with the same number of officials they employed in the 1970s when its PRB was formally established. At that time, the board reviewed 1,000 pages a year. In 2014, according to the CIA's inspector general, the board reviewed over 150,000 pages, averaging a rate of 400 per day. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which are representing our lawsuit, obtained this information by using the Freedom of Information Act.
Our democracy requires accountability in the field of national security, and former intelligence officers are uniquely qualified to provide such accountability. There are compelling reasons for protecting the ability of former military and intelligence officers to participate in the democratic process and to inform the American public.
Nearly two years ago, the Congress determined that the review system was dysfunctional and ordered the intelligence community to develop new rules for governing publication review. Congress's deadline has passed, but the director of national intelligence has given no indication of the publication or implementation of new rules. Additional reforms are needed in the Congressional oversight process and in the Office of the Inspector General in order to limit the ability of the publications review system to block legitimate and timely writings of former military and intelligence officers. President Gerald Ford created the Intelligence Oversight Board in 1976 to correct the abuses of power that took place during the Vietnam War, but it currently lacks a quorum to conduct oversight.
Secret intelligence agencies will never be fully compatible with the democratic process; there will always be tension between an open society and secret agencies. The openness and accountability that our democracy requires depends on truth-tellers to expose corruption. Congressional inquiry and investigative journalism, essential to a democracy, require participation from former federal officials with extensive experience. They should not be obstructed by a biased review process that makes politicized judgments, which violate the right of free speech.

A blurry question: When does life end?

Texto completo: The report last week read like science fiction.
Researchers at Yale University restored some cellular functions to the brains of pigs decapitated in a slaughterhouse four hours earlier.
Let that sink in.
The brains were dead by any conventional measure. But after being infused with a solution of synthetic fluids that functioned as a substitute for blood, some brain cells regained metabolic activity. Brain tissue absorbed oxygen and glucose. Some neurons exhibited electrical activity.
The brains never regained anything that could be termed consciousness. The experiment as reported in the journal Nature was designed to ensure that would not happen, by using a chemical in the fluid that would inhibit the recovery of full brain activity. Just in case, an anesthetic was on hand.
Nevertheless, enough happened to give us a new reason to examine an old question:
Where is the line between life and death?
The answer has long been definitive. Brains are fragile. Depriving one of oxygen will quickly and irreversibly lead to brain death. And that's the end.
And now?
"We had clear lines between 'this is alive' and 'this is dead,'  " Duke University bioethicist and law professor Nita Farahany told The New York Times. "How do we think about this middle category of 'partly alive'? We didn't think it could exist."
This new ethical quandary arrived in a week during which Christians contemplate life and death, and life after death, and what it means to be reborn. And it came in a season in which rebirth is all around us, from the flowers that spring like magic out of barren ground to the chirping of chicks making their way into the world.
The work by the Yale researchers addresses a different sense of rebirth: Is it possible that someone who has suffered a severe brain injury from a heart attack or stroke could recover that brain function? Is it possible, in other words, that the brain is not as fragile as thought? Is it possible a brain can be reborn?
This once was the realm of sci-fi storytellers and B-movie plots featuring brains in jars and other mad scientist concoctions. Now that it's edging toward reality, the ethics of these experiments must be debated.
Does a "partly alive" brain feel pain? If so, does the goal of relieving a profound human condition justify that suffering? As the technology of restoring brain function improves, and it will, what are the implications for organ donation, which depends on the defined moment of death of the donor?
This new work is one more variation of the life-after-death themes that humans always have found powerful and alluring. They're in our religions, to be sure, but really are present in almost every facet of life.
At their root, they animate every comeback story, and we do love a good comeback. The athlete, the politician, the inventor. The career, the idea, seemingly dead. Then the triumphant return - the resurrection, if you will.
That's why we thrilled at the Masters victory of Tiger Woods, whose career was once thought to be dead. It's why we mourned the fire at Notre Dame cathedral, unsure that it could ever recover. It's why we refuse to leave the ballpark, hoping to see our team rise up.
We cling to life. We yearn for its return. Medicine gets ever more successful at helping us avoid death and prolong life. Often, we are immensely fulfilled. Sometimes, the trade-off for a renewed lease on life is a diminished quality of that life.
The ethical questions are endless. But they must be asked. And we shouldn't shy away from the progress that forces them to be asked.
If the Yale researchers are blurring the line between life and death, that's OK. Boundaries are meant to be tested, and knowledge is meant to be learned.

Mueller's report isn't just a legal finding. It's also the greatest nonfiction book about Trump.

Texto completo: The Mueller report is that rare Washington tell-all that surpasses its pre-publication hype.
Sure, it is a little longer than necessary. Too many footnotes and distracting redactions. The writing is often flat, and the first half of the book drags, covering plenty of terrain that has been described elsewhere. The story shifts abruptly between riveting insider tales and dense legalisms. Its protagonist doesn't really come alive until halfway through, once Volume I (on Russian interference) gives way to Volume II (on obstruction of justice). The title - far too prosaic, really - feels like a missed opportunity. And it hardly helps that the book's earliest reviewer, Attorney General William Barr, seems to have willfully misunderstood the point of it; he probably should not have been assigned to review it at all.
Yet as an authoritative account, the Mueller report is the best book by far on the workings of the Trump presidency. It was delivered to the attorney general but written for history. The book reveals the president in all his impulsiveness, insecurity and growing disregard for rules and norms; White House aides alternating between deference to the man and defiance of his "crazy s---" requests; and a campaign team too inept to realize, or too reckless to care, when they might have been bending the law. And special counsel Robert Mueller has it all under oath, on the record, along with interviews and contemporaneous notes backing it up. No need for a "Note on Use of Anonymous Sources" disclaimer. Mueller doesn't just have receipts - he seems to know what almost everyone wanted to buy.
Befitting a best-selling work of political nonfiction - less than 24 hours after the report went online Thursday, paperback versions took the top two spots in Amazon's new-release sales ranking - the Mueller report has its miniseries-ready signature moments. There is the obligatory expletive for the ages, when President Trump learns that Mueller has been appointed as special counsel. "This is the end of my presidency," he moans. "I'm fucked." There is the embarrassing contradiction from the president's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, who told reporters that countless FBI employees loved the firing of director James Comey but then admits to investigators that she'd made it up. (Though, in truth, it's only embarrassing if Sanders maintains any residual capacity for said emotion.) There's the contrast between the president's public bluster, evident in his Twitter rants, and his private diffidence, embodied in Trump's lawyerly written responses to Mueller's queries, full of "I do not recall" and "I have no recollection."
And there is the inevitable Nixonian reference, as when White House counsel Don McGahn refuses the president's request to instruct the deputy attorney general to dismiss Mueller, because McGahn worried about unleashing a new Saturday Night Massacre.
In its portrait of the Trump campaign and White House, the Mueller report also echoes recent, high-profile works. The mix of incompetence, disorganization and self-interest evident here evokes Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury," which depicts a Trump inner circle both unprepared and uninterested in actually governing. In the Mueller report, top members of the Trump team take meetings with foreign representatives without so much as Googling their names. A random hedge fund manager friendly with Jared Kushner ends up co-writing a memo on U.S.-Russian relations that Kushner delivers to incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Donald Trump Jr. probably doesn't know enough about campaign finance laws to grasp the legal peril of the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016. And even candidate Donald Trump admits the purpose of his presidential bid when he suggests to personal lawyer Michael Cohen "that his campaign would be a significant 'infomercial' for Trump-branded properties."
The mob-like mentality among the Trump team that Comey describes in his 2018 memoir, "A Higher Loyalty," reappears in the Mueller report, with the president delegating dirty assignments to outside players and demanding loyalty above everything. But where Comey perceived total control by the boss, Mueller shows top aides undermining, slow-walking or simply ignoring the president's more outlandish instructions. It is reminiscent of Bob Woodward's best-selling "Fear," in which White House economic officials derail the president's effort to blow up a free-trade agreement with South Korea by stealing a letter off the president's desk. Aside from McGahn refusing to help oust Mueller, we see former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, among the most obsequious of the president's loyalists, declining to deliver a message to Jeff Sessions urging the attorney general to publicly defend the president and limit the special counsel's investigation. In a sense, the Mueller report reads like a dozen anonymous New York Times op-eds from that internal White House resistance, except they are far more detailed - and they're signed.
The Mueller report is not beautifully written. These are lawyers, not stylists, and the book's power rests not in its prose but in its overwhelming authority. Yet even that authority has limits, as does the document's scope. The report expertly documents Russia's "sweeping and systematic" interference in the 2016 election, for instance, but does not really reveal the impact of that interference. The omniscient narrator, described most often as "the Office," is an essential player in the drama, but the special counsel's own actions, reactions and impressions are largely absent. (Leave that for the journalists to ferret out - or for a blockbuster Mueller memoir.)
And though Volume II of the Mueller report offers a devastating, point-by-point portrayal of the president's efforts to interfere in the investigation against him, Mueller stops short of declaring criminality. Not because, as Barr initially implied, he was simply unable to make up his mind. Part of his reasoning, Mueller lays out in the report, was that "a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President's capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct."
"Constitutional processes" - it's a nice euphemism. Others have been less circumspect. In his 1998 report on the Clinton and Lewinsky saga, independent counsel Kenneth Starr declared grounds for President Bill Clinton's impeachment in the opening paragraph. In the Watergate Special Prosecution Force Report of 1975, published a few months after President Richard Nixon's resignation, investigators detailed their deliberations on whether to indict Nixon while he was in office. Though they found no constitutional basis for a president to be "immune from the ordinary process of criminal law," prosecutors wrote, they also considered that a lengthy legal proceeding would undermine the president's ability to govern and that "the impeachment process should take precedence over a criminal indictment."
The Mueller report spans 448 pages over two volumes, and it is tempting to view it as the definitive insider account of the Trump presidency, as most tell-alls purport to be. But it is not. Mueller's work is done, yes. But how we - and the president - respond to it now will mark the first of several volumes to come.

Texto completo: Call this battle Amazon versus the Amazon.
The New York Times reported Friday that the giant Internet retailer's seven-year battle with eight Amazon basin countries over the domain name .amazon has come down to the wire.
Amazon has until Sunday to submit a new proposal to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, that would appease the claims of eight South American countries that want to block the company's proposal.
Brazil, Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname aren't bidding for the name, but claim the retailer's use could infringe upon its cultural and natural heritage. They want the name protected and to ensure they have a voice in its use.
The issue comes down to one of ICANN's rules that require applicants for geographic names obtain local government approval.
"It's not the classic issue of two different parties applying for the same name," said Rodrigo de la Parra, the regional vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean at ICANN, in the Times article.
Wonder if Amazon has thought of offering free Prime throughout the Amazon basin?

Texto completo: He bullies. He praises. He attacks. Just how he has always operated.
The cavalcade of evidence in the Mueller report showing that President Trump repeatedly sought to limit, discourage and end the investigation into his campaign's connections to Russia's interference with U.S. elections may or may not fit the legal definition of obstruction, but it definitively demonstrates how Trump has always done business.
The president's unique, norm-smashing way of doing his job is a reflection of his campaign promise to be the ultimate disrupter, the outsider who would "drain the swamp" and bust up Washington's chummy power channels.
It is also an entirely predictable, steady continuation of a lifelong pattern. Trump has always operated as the boss of a tight, small circle of executives and enforcers. He has always demanded loyalty, searched for ways around established customs and defied the rules - painting himself as a pragmatic, practical, plainspeaking truthteller, and dismissing those who play by the rules as small-minded or petty.
When he asked then-FBI Director James B. Comey for loyalty; when he asked then-deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland to write a letter saying, falsely, that Trump didn't direct national security chief Michael Flynn to talk to the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions against his country; when the president called his White House counsel, Donald McGahn, at home and directed him to have special counsel Robert S. Mueller III removed - in all these cases and in many more detailed in the report, Trump was acting in the way that got him where he is today.
The president portrayed in Mueller's report is strikingly similar to the real estate developer, casino magnate and TV celebrity who spent four decades crafting a public image as a playboy billionaire with a populist touch and an outrageous mouth. Mueller's investigators present a detailed narrative showing Trump calling aides at home at night, clearing the room to deliver a personal appeal, naming names and spewing insults - whatever it took to demand loyalty and hit back at perceived enemies.
In success and in failure, in his historic outsider campaign and in his bankruptcies and business collapses, Trump's tactics have barely varied. He bullies, he praises, he uses the media to attack and insult. He talks to many and trusts few. He lives in the moment and ignores the past. He acts now and constructs rationales later.
Trump rose to celebrity and to power by forming close alliances with renegades and rogues, with lawyers who were willing to push people around, with union bosses and construction executives who had close ties to organized crime, and with his own top executives who could be relied on to keep secrets and work behind the scenes to make problems go away.
As a real estate developer in New York City and later as a casino magnate in New Jersey and elsewhere, Trump worked closely with all sorts of seedy characters, some of them mobsters. Trump came to believe that politics and real estate - two fields he saw as inextricably intertwined - were dirty businesses, shot through with corruption.
He built his business around his personal brand, his media-fueled presentation of himself as a can-do billionaire who got results by doing end runs around the rules. Building his company as a tight family circle, bolstered by a tiny group of totally committed lawyers and executives, allowed Trump to withstand bankruptcies, business collapses, lawsuits, federal investigations and an avalanche of bad publicity.
So when he got to the White House, it's no surprise that he expected similar loyalty and devotion from his closest aides. When he didn't always get that loyalty in return, he was enraged. But as the Mueller report makes clear, the aides who refused to do his bidding may in the end be what saved the president from an obstruction charge.
Trump has argued throughout his career that the only people you can absolutely trust to provide total loyalty are blood relatives and a tiny inner circle of longtime employees.
McGahn, for example, listened to Trump's directives about getting rid of Mueller and decided he'd prefer to "resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre," as the report put it, referring to a key moment in the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon's downfall.
Even one of Trump's original political loyalists, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, found a way to avoid executing the president's order. After Trump dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directing Sessions to publicly announce that the president had done nothing wrong and that Mueller's investigation would be sharply limited, Lewandowski told Trump he'd do it. But instead, he passed the job along to another official, who, the report said, "was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through."
"The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful," the report says, "but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."
In his rhetoric and in his actions, Trump has veered far from the conventions of business or politics.
"Where's my Roy Cohn?" Trump asked in 2017, exploding in public frustration over the fact that his own attorney general had removed himself from supervision of the investigation into the president's campaign.
Cohn, Trump's first attorney and most valued adviser in the early years of his career, was a notorious rule-breaker, an aggressive advocate whose client list included alleged mob bosses and who was ultimately disbarred. Cohn taught Trump two of his most enduring mantras: Never back down, and when you're hit, hit back a hundred times harder.
Cohn was fiercely loyal, and Trump has often lamented his inability to find a similarly tenacious and unstinting consigliere. At one point in 2017, according to the report, Trump blew up at McGahn, saying he wished Cohn was his attorney.
Sessions, too, did not fit the bill.
"What kind of a man is this?" Trump asked in a Fox interview last summer. "The only reason I gave him the job: Because I felt loyalty."
But then, Sessions, in Trump's view, failed to back up his boss. "Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the president," Trump told the New York Times in 2017. "How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? . . . It's extremely unfair - and that's a mild word - to the president."
Trump is the first president to lash out at advisers who cooperated with a federal investigation and to adopt the language of the mob to bash people such as Michael Cohen, his longtime attorney and fixer who spoke extensively to Mueller's investigators.
"I know all about flipping," Trump told Fox News. "For 30, 40 years, I've been watching flippers. Everything's wonderful, and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is, or as high as you can go."
Before Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, the president was complimenting him on Twitter because "he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' "
As the report documents, Trump tried a similar strategy with Cohen, telling his longtime attorney to "stay strong." When Cohen instead agreed to share what he knew with the special counsel, Trump turned on him, dubbing him a "rat."
Trump's ability to sound like a mobster, or at least the movie version of one, is a vital part of his charm and his effectiveness. Friends say he has an unusually intimate way of connecting, on the phone, in the office, on the golf course. He shares secrets, showers with praise - and when he deems it necessary, he delivers vague threats about the aggressive response he'll have if things don't go as he wants them to.
In 1987, before Trump published his first best-selling book, "The Art of the Deal," he was a regional figure, a tabloid newspaper's minor celebrity, something of a joke to many New Yorkers. But those who doubted him failed to see the appeal of the character he had built in his many media appearances - the rare rich guy who spoke like a blue-collar worker, who preferred cheeseburgers, hung out with his security guys rather than his fellow executives, and explained the world's problems in simple, binary terms.
The book was a hit because its author displayed no moral qualms, wholly embracing the idea that the way you get things done is to do them, whatever it took. "Mr. Trump makes one believe for a moment in the American dream again," the New York Times's critic gushed in a review.
The rich kid whose classmates considered him a bully, the self-proclaimed king of debt who spent the meat of his career watching his enterprises fall into bankruptcies, became president of the United States.
As the Mueller report richly details, the way he got there and the way he has behaved there are virtually identical. What the American people and Congress make of that is the subject of the coming months of investigations, legal confrontations and, in a bit more than 18 months, an election.

Surviving in the wild and in the world

Texto completo: I love survival stories. Perhaps because of my own aversion to risk - yes, I check the stove twice before going to bed - I am drawn to stories of people who have been exposed to extreme risk either by choice or by circumstance.
I can relate to "Everest," the story of eight relatively "normal" people from ordinary walks of life who tried to summit the Himalayan Mountain in 1996 with the help of a professional guide. Four of them, along with four others, died on that fateful day because of inexperience and bad decisions.
I cannot relate to "Free Solo," the story of the extraordinarily "abnormal" Alex Honnold who climbed El Capitan, a 3,200-foot granite wall in Yosemite Park, without ropes. His ascension of El Capitan without regard to his personal safety was characterized by The New York Times as "one of the great athletic feats of any kind, ever."
With this attraction to survival stories, I perused the shelves of the outdoor adventure section of a bookstore and came across "Deep Survival," by Laurence Gonzales, a lifelong student of survival stories and expert on survival skills.
Attracted by the title, I thought I was in for a treat of great tales of survival. Instead, Gonzales instructs the reader about the psychology behind survival, while mixing in an accounting of some rather spectacular successes and failures.
Gonzales explains that the part of our brain that first receives reports of danger and fear is the amygdala. The amygdala processes the stimuli and emotionally prepares us for action, whether that's fight or flight, without much consultation with the rational part of our brain. That's why casual outdoor recreationalists, when confronted with danger without proper training, do things that get them further in trouble. A CAT scan revealed that Honnold, a superbly trained athlete, does not have much reaction to dangerous stimuli in his amygdala. Go figure.
With my aversion to risk, you will not find me summiting Everest or hanging 3,000 feet above the ground without a rope. You will find me backpacking into the wilderness of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
My friend and I ventured into Porcupine Mountains to test our survival skills - and also our social skills while confined to a two-man tent during a 12-hour rainstorm.
Yet survival skills have more application than on the trail or on a mountain. We can apply them in our everyday lives and in overall society.
The amygdala not only processes stimuli from fear and danger. It also triggers the flames of anger.
An aggressive move from an adjacent driver, a thoughtless comment from a politician, a nonsensical statement by a columnist, or a provoking post on social media all get sent to the amygdala for reaction. The response, driven by emotion, is often equally aggressive, thoughtless, nonsensical and provoking. And that's just for starters.
A better first step might be: "Whoa! What just happened?" The sooner the intellect overrides the amygdala, the better the outcome. Emotional responses get us lost in the wilderness and misled in society. Anger is helpful as a motivator, but useless as a plan. It entrenches
Adversaries and ends communication. Moreover, it sullies our reason.
Gonzales points out that people lost or injured in the wild who rely solely on emotion make bad decisions. Anger arises from blaming others for your predicament. Why didn't my hiking companion pack a survival kit? Why didn't my boating companions let someone know our route? Why did I let them talk me into this?
The most important step for those who survive is to realize no one can help them but themselves. Survivors take complete responsibility for their survival.
Gonzales suggests that survivors also find motivation in getting back to loved ones, a connection to needs larger than themselves.
Whether lost in the wild or in the world: We can't change our predicament. We can't change others. We can only change ourselves - if not for ourselves, then for the greater needs of family and society. We don't need to step foot on a mountain to learn that lesson.

STANFORD CLEARS 3 IN CRISPR-BABY PROBE

Texto completo: Stanford University has exonerated its researchers of any wrongdoing in their communications with a Chinese biophysicist who brazenly violated a scientific taboo using a gene-editing technique to alter the DNA of human embryos.
In a statement released late Tuesday, the university said that its review concluded that the school's high-profile faculty were not participants in the CRISPR-Cas9 work by He Jiankui, a former Stanford postdoctoral researcher, and that they had no research, financial or organizational ties to He's research.
The review, conducted by a Stanford faculty member and an outside investigator, found that the Stanford researchers expressed serious concerns to He about his work. But Stanford did not address concerns that its faculty members biophysicist Stephen Quake, physician and medical ethicist William Hurlbut and hematologist and gene-editing specialist Matthew Porteus failed to publicize what they knew about He's work.
"When Dr. He did not heed their recommendations and proceeded, Stanford researchers urged him to follow proper scientific practices," according to the statement.
Although this review is over, there remains debate about what scientists should do when confronted with ethically troubling research.
He Jiankui conducted his postdoctoral research at Stanford in 2011-12 under Quake, one of the university's top bioengineers. In 2017 and 2018, He consulted with Quake, Hurlbut and Porteus about his gene-editing research and they all said they discouraged He from pursuing the research.
Critics say the American scientists should have alerted the public that the Chinese research into embryonic gene editing was underway.
"I am convinced that this silence is a symptom of a broader scientific cultural crisis: a growing divide between the values upheld by the scientific community and the mission of science itself," wrote molecular biologist Natalie Kofler of the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics in the journal Nature.
The president of He's Chinese university has blamed Quake for the rogue experiment, alleging in a letter to Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne that Quake provided instructions to the preparation and implementation of the experiment, the publication of papers, the promotion and news release, and publicity strategies after the news was announced.
While Quake would not discuss his involvement with He's research when asked by this newspaper in November, he told The New York Times in an April 14 article that his interactions had been misinterpreted.
Email correspondence between Quake and He provided to the Times shows no evidence that the Stanford researcher was involved in the work himself but also that he did not tell his Chinese protégé to stop. He informed Quake of milestones, according to the Times article, including that the woman became pregnant and gave birth. The emails show that Quake advised He to obtain ethical approval from Chinese institutions and submit the results for vetting by peer-reviewed journals. They do contain expressions of Quake's polite support, like "good luck!" and "Wow, that's quite an achievement!"
The Chinese researcher forged ethical review documents and engaged in actions that "seriously violated ethics, scientific research integrity and relevant state regulations," according to a preliminary report released in January by the Chinese government.
Meanwhile, there is still no proof that He, a biophysicist, was successful in changing the genes of twin girls or those of a third child expected to be born later this year.
When He was working in Stanford at Quake's lab, his research did not involve CRISPR gene editing. He was part of a team that studied how the genetic sequence of antibodies, produced by the immune system's B cells, changes over time. The team's findings, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, revealed that elderly and young people have different mutations, which could influence the effectiveness of flu vaccines.
In 2017, the Chinese scientist returned to the U.S. to attend a UC Berkeley workshop about gene editing technology, where he met Stanford's Hurlbut and UC Berkeley's CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna.
Hurlbut said he carried on a long conversation with He about societal opposition during the Chinese scientist's later visits to Stanford.
In conversations about ethics, "he wanted to get some sense of guidance. He wanted to understand what that was about," said Hurlbut, who disagrees with what He did. The Chinese scientist seemed skeptical of arguments that life begins at conception and cited the good that could come through gene editing, according to Hurlbut.
Porteus, a pioneer in the effort to use CRISPR to find curative therapies for blood diseases, reportedly tried to dissuade He, telling him such a step was reckless and put the entire field at risk.
Other major American scientists communicated with He. He confided in his plans with Mark DeWitt, a researcher with UC Berkeley's Innovative Genomics Initiative, but assured him that an ethics committee had approved the study and subjects were already being enrolled in China, according to STAT News. In a draft article about the gene-edited twin girls, which He planned to submit to journals, he thanked DeWitt for "editing the manuscript."
Michael Deem, a prominent physics and bioengineering professor at Rice University, faces a less certain future. In November, the university said that it had opened a "full investigation" into Deem's involvement.
The CRISPR baby scandal has highlighted the shortcomings of existing guidelines. International medical leaders are planning a commission to guide genome editing, and there are calls for an international moratorium on related research.
"I don't think they did anything wrong but I do wish each had done something more  (and) that science had established a framework to encourage them to do so," Stanford law professor and bioethicist Hank Greely tweeted in response to the university statement.
"Many scientists (& other people) have moral frameworks but don't see good ways to embody them," he wrote. "Let's give them some, rather than kvetch about their failures to be saints."
But "in this whole fiasco," added Greely, "at least 99.9% of the blame' was earned by He Jiankui."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump and his advisers have run the gamut of excuses for not releasing his tax returns. There was the audit excuse (which the IRS has made clear doesn't exist). There's the do-it-later promise that never manifests. There was the claim that only reporters cared about his taxes (despite numerous polls showing that average Americans want to see them, too).
More recently, there's the "congressional overreach" and "dangerous precedent" argument that somehow a president releasing details of his personal finances, as every modern Oval Office occupant has done, would simply be beyond the pale. And then there's what can only be described as the peak moment of chutzpah - White House press secretary Sarah Sanders observation last Sunday that Congress isn't "smart enough" to understand the financial complexities involved.
That's pretty galling. Not because there aren't some low SAT scores hanging out in the U.S. Capitol but because you don't have to go so far as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's alleged observation that his former boss is "dumb as a rock" to conclude that if the president can understand it, surely somebody in the legislative branch can, too.
Congress reviews all kinds of matters that are beyond the average person's comfort level, including actual rocket science - like how much NASA should be spending on space exploration and whether the throw-weights of the next generation of ballistic missiles are adequate. Just as happens in the executive branch, House Democrats have a bunch of smart folks around to dissect the details and explain them. But then everybody, including Ms. Sanders, knows that.
No, what we have here is a White House dead set against releasing those tax returns and Democrats, including House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, just as committed to reviewing six years of them. The result has been a bunch of new reasons to refuse the request popping up by the day that have to be debunked one by one. Meanwhile, the law on this is pretty clear. It says the Treasury Department "shall" release "any" IRS return requested. And the current argument against that from Mr. Trump's legal team? That the law only applies when there is a "legitimate legislative purpose."
Now, we can't look into the heart of every House Democrat. There may well be some who are delighted by the prospect of producing the returns exclusively to embarrass the president on relatively minor matters like whether he's truly a billionaire or how much (or little) he gives to charity. If that's all there is to this dispute, then maybe the Trump team has a point.
But there's plenty of evidence that a lot more is involved. There could be tax avoidance schemes that are flat-out illegal. There may be evidence of serious financial misconduct. It may be white collar crime and outright fraud. And why should Americans think so? Gentle readers, we give you six words: All County Building Supply & Maintenance.
Sound familiar? On Monday, The New York Times won a Pulitzer Prize, the highest award in newspaper journalism, for its 18-month investigation into how Mr. Trump and his relatives benefited from a half-billion-dollar tax avoidance scheme. All County was the shell company created by the Trump family in 1992 that was used to skim millions of dollars from Fred Trump's business empire by marking up purchases and then sending the proceeds as untaxed gifts to Donald Trump and his relatives. The added cost was then used to justify rent increases for thousands of tenants. If something similar is taking place now, Congress ought to know about it - and take appropriate policy action whether it's politically embarrassing or not.
The IRS is supposed to catch those kinds of abuses, but they often don't, particularly as the budget for audits has diminished over the years. Indeed, it's no secret that federal tax filers have a smaller chance of being audited this year than at any time in decades. The agency's funding has been cut by 25 percent since 2010. The IRS has the same number of auditors today that it had in the 1950s when the U.S. economy was one-seventh of its current size. The question shouldn't be why Congress is reviewing Mr. Trump's tax returns, it's why members aren't looking at a lot more. Clearly, the IRS needs all the assistance it can get.
Will the Treasury Department meet Chairman Neal's latest deadline - to present the returns to his committee by 5 p.m. next Tuesday, April 23? Based on recent history, probably not. The matter is likely headed to court - perhaps by way of New York and the hunt to release Mr. Trump's state tax returns.
Either way, there's simply too much history of questionable financial practices for the American electorate to be shortchanged on this matter. Just as Democratic candidates for president are now releasing their returns voluntarily, Mr. Trump should be obliged to release his whether ordered by Congress, the courts or New York state.

Mueller's team won't be at Barr's morning conference

Texto completo: No one from special counsel Robert Mueller’s office will be present at a press conference hosted by Attorney General William Barr before the rollout of the special counsel’s report.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Barr would hold a press conference with reporters at 9:30 a.m. Thursday, but did not specify if the much-anticipated report would be released by then.

After the press conference, Congress is set to receive hard copies of the 400-page report at 11 a.m. That news, along with the fact that no one from Muller’s team will be present at the press conference, prompted an outcry from Democratic lawmakers and some in the media.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman called into question the efficacy of the 9:30 a.m. huddle, tweeting: “Sorry but this is not a press conference - it’s an opportunity for Barr to put a spin on the ball or defend himself. No one can ask real questions here.”

House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., also addressed concerns about a report that Justice Department officials have had discussions with White House lawyers about the Mueller report prior to its release.

“I’m deeply troubled by reports that the WH is being briefed on the Mueller report AHEAD of its release. Now, DOJ is informing us we will not receive the report until around 11/12 tomorrow afternoon — AFTER Barr’s press conference. This is wrong. #ReleaseTheReport,” Nadler tweeted.

Nadler also announced that he will hold a press conference at 8 p.m. Wednesday to discuss the pending release of the document.

It was also reported in a Wednesday court filing that the Justice Department would allow “a limited number of members of Congress” to view the report without certain redactions.

“Once the redacted version of the report has been released to the public, the Justice Department plans to make available for review by a limited number of Members of Congress and their staff a copy of the Special Counsel’s report without certain redactions, including removing the redaction of information related to the charges set forth in the indictment in this case,” the filing reads.

Last month, Barr announced in a four-page letter to Congress that Trump did not collude with Russia but said the report didn’t make a determination on whether the president obstructed justice during the course of Mueller’s 22-month investigation.

The White House is preparing a counter-report, which according to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani will likely focus on potential issues with obstruction of justice that Mueller’s report might raise.

Houston • The Game 1 blowout has been dissected, analyzed, overanalyzed even, to death.
It’s been a long couple days since the Jazz dropped their postseason opener to the Rockets by 32 points. Now they’re ready to finally try and do something about it.
At Wednesday afternoon’s shootaround at the Toyota Center, Donovan Mitchell said it does no good now to fixate on that initial result; the focus must change to what can be done better tonight in Game 2.
“We’re in a hole, and we gotta get out of the hole. That’s where my head is at,” he said. “… It helps when you know it’s a series, you process it differently in the regular season than you do in a series. You understand that you can’t do nothing about it, you can’t sit there and sulk, ’cause that’s playing into their hands. We’ve got to be able to find a way to bounce back and make adjustments.”
Donovan, on getting past the blowout: "You understand that you can’t do nothing about it, you can’t sit there and sulk, ’cause that’s playing into their hands. We’ve got to be able to find a way to bounce back and make adjustments. All of us have come in and given our input." pic.twitter.com/U8YBI8zKqH
— Eric Walden (@tribjazz) April 17, 2019
The biggest one in forward Jae Crowder’s mind is ratcheting up the mental and physical ferocity. Watching the Game 1 tape, he said, clearly showed that the on-court fervor didn’t match up to the magnitude of the moment.
Asked what must change most from Games 1 to 2, he was direct and blunt.
“Our intensity — watching that, it didn’t feel like a playoff game. We didn’t bring the intensity that we needed to, and the game got away from us,” Crowder said. “First of all, our intensity has to pick up, and everything else will fall into place.”
There are plenty of other things, of course, that could use some improvement. And the Jazz are confident many of those areas will be better. Mitchell said there has been great back-and-forth between players and coaches on how best to make it all work.
“All of us have come in and given our input on what we see and what we should do, and the coaching staff is great and phenomenal as far as listening to us, as far as giving us their input as well,” Mitchell said. “We have a great team team chemistry that allows our coaches and allows teammates to give their opinion and constructive criticism; and that makes it a lot easier when you have guys who want to help each other out.”
In case you missed it …
Doesn’t it feel like just about forever now since the Jazz’s 122-90 loss to the Rockets in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series? We’ve at least had plenty to discuss in the aftermath. Like, how can the Jazz get Donovan Mitchell going after a tough opening effort? And the need to make some more 3-pointers going forward. The bromance between Jazz coach Quin Snyder and Rockets point guard Chris Paul. Columnist Gordon Monson took a look back at last year’s Game 2 victory over the Rockets in the Western Conference semis.
But wait, there’s more! We also examined what the Jazz might do defensively for the rest of the series after their opening-game strategy largely fell flat. Speaking of which, the Rockets surprised a lot of people with how good their defense has become. Meanwhile, if you thought a 32-point loss would discourage the team, well, they’re confident in the adjustments they’ll make going forward.
Other people’s stuff
• The New York Times did a feature story on Warriors guard Steph Curry’s love of in-arena popcorn, wherein he ranks every NBA arena’s version of the snack. Vivint Smart Home Arena’s is tied for 15th overall, earning high marks for saltiness, but low marks for freshness and presentation.
• Deseret News columnist Brad Rock took note of Rudy Gobert’s simple message heading into Game 2: “We’ll be fine.”
• The Tribune’s Andy Larsen and the Deseret News’ Eric Woodyard appeared with Aaron Falk and Angie Treasure of utahjazz.com on a Jazz Facebook livestream to discuss takeaways from Game 1 and preview Game 2.
• Ben Anderson wrote a contributing column for KSL.com, arguing that Game 1 wasn’t actually lost on Sunday, but much earlier, when the team decided not to make significant changes from last season.
• The Athletic has a couple pieces that touch on the Jazz, with beat writer Tony Jones touching on Derrick Favors’ soft-spoken admonition that the team needs to “play better,” and analyst Zach Harper taking an in-depth look at how the strategy for defending James Harden went so wrong.
• Here’s a fun thing — the Jazz, in combination with student developers from the Neumont College of Computer Science, have released a new video game called “Splash Uncles.”
Up next
Game 2 of the series is tonight in Houston. After that, the teams return to Salt Lake City for Games 3 and 4 on Saturday and Monday, respectively.

TRISHA YEARWOOD TO HOST TAILGATE BEFORE HUSBAND GARTH BROOKS' MAY CONCERT

Texto completo: Grammy award winner Trisha Yearwood has been popular with country music lovers ever since her self-titled debut album in 1991. Thanks to three best-selling cookbooks that led to a cooking show on the Food Network, she's got legions of food fans, too.
She'll get a chance to marry those two talents when she hosts a giant party at Heinz Field on the North Shore before husband Garth Brooks' sold-out concert on May 18.
Dubbed Trisha's Tailgate, the ticketed afternoon event in the tents near Gate A will feature a spread of the star's favorite tailgate bites, along with drinks including her signature cocktail. Called Summer in a Cup, it pairs a variety of fruit juices with banana liqueur and rum.
"It just seemed like a good idea," Yearwood said of the preconcert party, which will accommodate up to 1,300 guests. "People are there anyway tailgating for the show, so we're giving them a place to play games and get out of the weather with good food and drinks."
The singer held her first tailgate last year ahead of Brooks' Oct. 20 concert at Notre Dame Stadium in Indiana. Everyone involved had such a good time despite the squirrelly weather - the day brought rain, snow, hail and high winds, necessitating space heaters - that she and her staff decided it might be fun to do it in every city on her husband's 2019 stadium tour.
"If you're a Garth fan, you kind of know each other, and so it's a good hang," Yearwood said.
Although she says she was born to be a singer, the Georgia native has always liked to cook. When she moved to Oklahoma after marrying Garth in 2005, she scaled back on touring, because she didn't want to be married only to be apart. Needing a creative outlet to fill the hours besides going to kids' soccer games, she decided to write a cookbook with her mother, Gwen, and her sister, Beth, just for fun. She never imagined anyone would want to read it, let alone it would become a New York Times bestseller.
"It was kind of an accident," she said.
A second cookbook followed in 2010 after which producers at the Food Network came knocking. She initially hesitated, she said, because while she loved to prepare food, she wasn't sure she wanted to be in front of the camera "telling people when to add butter."
She also knew that celebrities tend to get scrutinized when they put their name on a project, and that she would have something to prove. "Trisha's Southern Kitchen" not only proved a hit - she just finished filming season 14 in Nashville - but it's been really fun, too, as well as a springboard for a commercial venture.
After releasing her third cookbook in 2015, Yearwood collaborated with Williams Sonoma to create a line of drink and biscuit mixes, flavored coffees and seasonings. The high-end kitchen store also had exclusive rights during the 2018 Christmas season to her "Let's Be Frank" album paying homage to Frank Sinatra before its general release in February.
"It's the only other thing other than music that I've pursued so hard," she said.
Every tailgate is a little different, with its own footprint and menu. But Yearwood is always sure to include foods that are easy to eat, and filling, so people go to the concert full. Previous tailgates have included offerings such as deconstructed corn salsa, pimento cheese nachos and blueberry pie bars, "and we always have some kind of slider," she said.
With Pittsburgh being something of a ground zero for pierogies, guests probably can expect some form of the potato-stuffed dumplings on the buffet table, along with Heinz ketchup and food topped with fries.
What you won't get to experience is a chance to take selfies with the singer. But you will have the opportunity to ask her questions when she's up on stage doing a demo. You might also catch sight of her sister, who often travels with her.
A portion of the proceeds will go to Habitat for Humanity, which the couple have been involved with for more than 10 years. They volunteered to help build homes on the Gulf Coast post-Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and also have lent their names and support to numerous Habitat events and projects, including the Carter Work Project and National Women Build Week.
"It's a passion project for us," she said.
Cooking, Yearwood said, is a little like singing because there's appreciation and applause for the cook when she or he does a good job. Because many of her recipes have family roots, it also has allowed her to share her parents' legacy in a way she never expected.
"It makes people feel good on both sides," she said.
Tricia's Tailgate runs from 3 to 6 p.m. at Heinz Field on May 18. Tickets cost $65 and include unlimited food and two drink tickets. To purchase, go to heinzfield.com (search "Trisha's Tailgate).
Summer in a Cup
PG tested
Trisha Yearwood concocted this fruity cocktail on a hot summer day in Oklahoma. You can buy the mix at Williams Sonoma, but it's really easy to make from scratch at home. "It's really refreshing," she said.
16 ounces pineapple juice
9 ounces banana liqueur, such as 99 Bananas
9 ounces coconut rum, such as Malibu
8 ounces fruit punch
8 ounces orange juice
Orange slices, for garnish
Pineapple slices, for garnish
Mix together the pineapple juice, banana liqueur, coconut rum, fruit punch and orange juice in a gallon pitcher filled with ice. Pour into martini glasses and garnish with slices of orange and pineapple.

Texto completo: Issa Rae is, be it noun or adjective, the definition of boss.
As a creator and star of HBO's "Insecure," she has racked up praise and awards navigating the ticklish terrain of young black womanhood, and is now putting her producing power behind projects like Robin Thede's "A Black Lady Sketch Show." She's also propelling her acting career into film, with Michael Showalter's "The Lovebirds" and Stella Meghie's "The Photograph" due out next year.
So you'd think Rae would have no trouble making herself heard.
But for her latest role, in "Little," the "Big"-in-reverse comedy starring Regina Hall and Marsai Martin, she found herself mining experiences that had threatened to silence her candid voice.
"I was tapping into that fear of speaking up that we all have," Rae recalled. "There are some terrible people, even within this industry that I work in, that are known to be yellers, and I can't take it, personally. But sometimes you just feel like you have no option, like you have to endure verbal abuse to get to the next step."
"Some people really think that they have to be mean - women especially, sometimes - to be heard and to be respected," she added.
In "Little," Rae plays April, the beleaguered assistant to a tyrannical tech mogul (Hall) who is sent hurtling back via a swish of a wand into her nerdy, bullied younger self (Martin). Which in turn leaves the dismayed April to run her company, if only she could get the words out. Directed by Tina Gordon, "Little" is based on an idea pitched by Martin, of "black-ish" fame, when she was 10 years old - leading her at 14 to become the youngest executive producer of a major studio movie. "I just loved that Marsai had come up with this idea as a little girl and I wanted to be a part of that," Rae said. "I used to watch 'Big' every single day as a child and this movie is paying homage to that."
In a phone interview from Los Angeles, Rae, 34, talked about some indispensable advice, the future of "Insecure" and what she has called a golden moment for black women.
Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: So, did you land this gig because Marsai is a big fan of yours or what?
A: I still don't know how that conversation came about. But I was happy to be there and now I'm trying to be on her best side you know? I'm just like, hey girl now that you've got this first look I could play other roles too.
Q: In an interview with Stephen Colbert, you said that the best advice you'd been given was don't be afraid to be a bitch. Dc you ever find yourself going there?
A: That's just not my way to operate, to be mean or to yell. But I sometimes get crippled by a fear of being labeled a bitch. And it's just like, that shouldn't prevent you from speaking up if you really need to. And that's the advice that I heed.
Q: Your first movie role was in "The Hate U Give" and you have four more coming up after "Little." Why the leap into film?
A: When you're doing "Insecure," it can'be limiting and suffocating. I want to have different experiences to bring to the stories that I'm telling. And now that I've taken a longer break, I'm excited to get back. It's been fun and less stressful not having to be one of the bosses or writers or producers. I've shifted in every single role that I've played. I've had maximum responsibility and I love that. I love also getting a sense of what it's like behind the scenes where nobody cares about me.
Q: When is Season 4 of "Insecure" happening?
A: No date yet. No time soon.
Q: Can you tease where we're going to find Issa, Molly and Lawrence after that cliffhanger you left us with?
A: I always called Season 3 the setup season. We were having to get all our characters to this place where they have to face each other and face themselves. There's that point in your life where you question everything around you - where you're like, I'm at this certain age. Do I need to make the effort to make this career or these relationships last? Like, where and who do I want to be? And that's something we're going to hone in on.
Q: You've revealed that you know when, where and how "Insecure" will end. Do you have that actual endpoint in sight?
A: Definitely, but I'm kind of torn and I'm working through that. Prentice (Penny, the show-runner) and I just met up to have our annual poolside discussion of the season, so that's kind of where we are right now, answering those questions.
Q: Poolside?
A: Yeah, every year the two of us meet up, rent a cabana at a hotel and get drinks and talk about the season. This is our fourth time doing that and we're really happy to see each other. He just finished directing his feature debut ("Uncorked"), and I've done other projects, and we're just sharing our war stories.
Q: You've also said that you learn with each new episode. What's the takeaway after 24?
A: I still appreciate the opportunity to tell concise stories but we do want to tell longer (ones) - to use not necessarily more episodes but maybe just develop those episodes further. A lot of the basis of our meetup this year was just, OK, where are these characters now and how do we tell a story that still feels fun to tell in a fresh way?
Q: Has there been any change for you at HBO with the resignation of its CEO, Richard Plepler?
A: Richard was such a champion of our show. Like, every time I would encounter some rich white man, he'd be like, "Richard recommended the show. I loved it." He's been really responsible for introducing our show to different audiences and just genuinely believed in us. So I'm sad to see him go. And Casey (Bloys) and Amy (Gravitt) have reassured us that they're here, and that's kind of who I came up with. So if I lose them I don't know how I'll feel.
Q: You've called this a golden moment for black women in terms of shaking the culture. Can you elaborate?
A: I think so many eyes are on us and the acknowledgment of the impact that we have. People want to be involved in what we have to say. So many of us are united in making sure that our voices are heard. We're protective of each other and we're protective of our culture in a new way that feels like other people are hearing us too. And that's just so important.
Q: Are there any emerging creators popping for you at the moment?
A: Amy Aniobi is someone I've been working with forever and I'm just so excited about her career. There's Lala Milan, whose Instagram I've been following for a while. She's such a joy to watch and going to be one of the next female comedic voices, if not now already. And Robin Thede. I'm doing an HBO show with her and she's phenomenal.

Texto completo: A Cook County judge Monday lifted part of her previous order prohibiting ProPublica Illinois from publishing some details of a child welfare case it has been investigating, conceding that the restriction was “overbroad.”
At the same time, Patricia Martin, the presiding judge of the Cook County Juvenile Court’s child protection division, continued to block the news organization from publishing the names or pictures of the minors involved in the case. While acknowledging the constitutional right of ProPublica Illinois to publish, the judge ruled that her restriction on disclosing the identities is necessary to protect the children.
ProPublica Illinois has a “right to act as a conduit of information and to keep the public informed as to the workings of the court and the Illinois child welfare system,” Martin wrote in her modified order. “Nevertheless, if ProPublica publishes the children’s names or likenesses, it would be the actions of ProPublica, and ProPublica alone that would be responsible for inflicting a gratuitous harm on these children.”
Aside from not revealing the identities of the minors, ProPublica “is free to report on any aspect of these cases, DCFS [the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services], the court, or the Illinois child welfare system as a whole,” Martin wrote.
Richard Tofel, president of ProPublica, the parent organization of ProPublica Illinois, said in a statement: “While there are significant aspects of Judge Martin’s order and opinion with which we disagree, we are gratified that the order and opinion recognize our constitutional right to report on any aspect of these cases beyond the children’s names. That reporting continues.”
ProPublica Illinois had no plans to publish the names of the children in the child welfare case. But the First Amendment protects the right of the media to make decisions about what to publish without “the invasion of the power of the state into a newsroom,” Gabriel Fuentes, an attorney with Jenner & Block representing ProPublica Illinois, argued in a April 5 hearing on the prior restraint order.

Cook County Judge Keeps Limit on Publication in Place in Child Welfare Case
The presiding judge of the child protection division of juvenile court says she will rule soon on ProPublica Illinois’ request to lift ban.
Cook County Judge Blocks ProPublica Illinois From Publishing Details of Child Welfare Case
In moving to shield minors, the judge weighs a challenge to the First Amendment right to publish.
Martin issued that order last month in response to a request from Bruce Boyer, a professor at Loyola University Chicago’s law school and director of its Civitas ChildLaw Clinic, who represents the children involved in the case. Boyer had argued that their privacy should be protected. DCFS attorneys had also argued that ProPublica Illinois should not be allowed to identify the children.
Martin barred ProPublica Illinois and other news organizations from publishing “the names and/or any other information that would permit the ready identification” of the children or the foster parents involved in a case ProPublica Illinois is investigating. That included “specific address or other demographic information.”
Martin’s order was a rare instance of a judge restricting a news organization before the publication of a story, and it drew criticism from other journalists and media rights organizations.
ProPublica Illinois told Martin that while it had no plans to identify the children in the case, the judge’s order was too broad and shouldn’t restrain the organization before publication. ProPublica Illinois reporters learned the identities of the children and foster parents independently and outside court hearings.
Boyer said Monday that he is “very respectful” of the media’s First Amendment rights. But as the guardian ad litem for the children in the case, “I also have an obligation to do everything in my power to safeguard their best interests, and this includes defending the fundamental privacy rights of blameless children that the law says must be weighed in the balance.”
A spokesman for DCFS, which had opposed ProPublica Illinois’ effort to lift the judge’s order, declined to comment Monday.
Forty news organizations, led by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a group that advocates for press rights, had submitted a friend of the court letter arguing that the judge had violated ProPublica Illinois’ First Amendment rights.
The judge’s order, while an effort to protect the children’s privacy, was “an unconstitutional prior restraint” and a “direct attack on the marketplace of ideas,” the letter said. The letter was signed by news organizations that included Chicago’s daily newspapers, NPR, The New York Times and The Washington Post.

JUDGE DISMISSES CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST LAWSUIT AGAINST SANTA CLARA MAYOR

Texto completo: SANTA CLARA >> A judge has thrown out a lawsuit that accused Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor of failing to divulge at least $180,000 in income on conflict-of-interest forms, ruling the documents are "political works" exempt from disclosure requirements.
Known as 700s, the forms require elected and appointed officials to report all their financial interests to ensure they are making decisions in the best interest of the public and not to benefit their own wallets.
According to the lawsuit, Gillmor failed to report a management position and income earned over a five-year period from a business called Public Property Advisors.
But Gillmor's attorney argued that the lawsuit, filed a week before the 2018 general election, was hatched by the San Francisco 49ers and other political opponents and should be dismissed under an anti-SLAPP statute that protects people against lawsuits filed to intimidate them or silence their free speech rights.
Superior Court Judge Mark H. Pierce ruled last week that Gillmor's conflict-of-interest forms papers that every elected official must fill out annually are related to her role as a politician and thereby qualify as "political works" that are protected speech under the anti-SLAPP statute.
Gillmor, in a text message Monday, said the lawsuit was "clearly frivolous" and the timing "obviously political."
"I properly filed my forms. Both the district attorney and the courts agreed," Gillmor said, referring to a statement from District Attorney Jeff Rosen that his office investigated the issue and found she properly reported income from the business.
Jim McManis, the attorney for plaintiff Brian Exline, a Santa Clara University law student, said he will appeal the ruling.
"It's just a form," he said about the 700s. "The only special skill or talent is if you can type and write and sign your name. This is not an op-ed in the New York Times.  I think the judge is dead wrong on this."
Pierce noted in his ruling that his decision is the first court decision to weigh in on whether the anti-SLAPP statute applies to lawsuits related to form 700s.
Bob Stern, one of the authors of the 1974 Political Reform Act that requires officials to disclose conflicts of interest, said the ruling is surprising. The law has a provision that allows private citizens with standing to sue to enforce it in the event law enforcement agencies fail to do so.
"I'm quite concerned about using Anti-SLAPP provisions to get around what was a clear intent of voters, to allow private actions to enforce the act," Stern said in a phone call.
The ruling doesn't appear to restrict government agencies such as the Fair Political Practices Commission, which is tasked with enforcing the Political Reform Act, from continuing to do so.
"It would be much more troubling if this were a ruling where the district attorney was filing a civil suit. But it sets, perhaps, a precedent," Stern said.
The anti-SLAPP statute enables attorneys to argue for dismissal of lawsuits that try to intimidate or silence free speech. It does not apply to public interest lawsuits, although there's another provision that says political works aren't exempt.
Gillmor was appointed mayor in 2016 after previously having served on the council from 1992 to 2000 and from 2011 to 2016. Before that, her father Gary Gillmor served as mayor of Santa Clara. Her family has worked in property management for decades.
She argues that she didn't need to report Public Property Advisors because until 2017 it was a division under her father's business, Gary Gillmor and Associates, which she did report on her forms.
Lisa Gillmor pointed to her criticism of the San Francisco 49ers and the fact that McManis is also the attorney for a rival councilmember, Patricia Mahan, as evidence the suit was politically motivated.
The mayor questioned whether funding for the lawsuit is coming from a political campaign.
"I think the real issue still unresolved is who funded the lawsuit? This may be another way for dark money to influence political campaigns," Gillmor said.
McManis denied any notion that the lawsuit was politically motivated and said he is behind it, not other political interests. He said his firm was approached by "citizens of Santa Clara," including Exline, who were concerned about Gillmor's disclosure forms.
"I feel very strongly about this, as a lawyer and citizen. I don't care about Lisa Gillmor or who is mayor over there, but whoever is mayor over there has to follow the law," McManis said. "If it's upheld on appeal, my law firm will pay (the attorney fees)." Judge Pierce ordered the plaintiff to pay Gillmor $7,960 in attorney fees.
McManis' high-powered trial firm, McManis Faulkner, has also hired Ann Ravel to work on the lawsuit, the former chair of both the U.S. Federal Election Commission and California Fair Political Practices Commission. Ravel is also running to replace termed-out state Sen. Jim Beall in District 15.
In their response to Gillmor's request to dismiss the case, attorneys for Exline said that before she created a separate business for Public Property Advisors, Gillmor had contracts under that business entity with a number of clients, including school districts.
"the form 700 is not a vehicle for political advocacy in support of or in opposition to any candidate or ballot measure. Nor is defendant free to exercise creativity in filling out the Form 700," the plaintiff's court filing argues.
Judge Pierce was appointed to the bench in 2005 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was a private attorney in San Jose for 30 years after earning his law degree from Santa Clara University.

Bret Easton Ellis tells 'spoiled children' liberals how to deal with Trump: 'He was elected president. Get over it.'

Texto completo: Now middle-aged, the enfant terrible novelist Bret Easton Ellis, has turned to nonfiction to mock the "childlike fascism" and "demented narcissism" of American liberals that helped put President Trump in the White House and left them facing "mental and emotional collapse."

For good measure, Ellis, 55, also denounces the "legacy media" in his new book "White" — originally due to the called "White Privileged Male" — describing it as "a moral disaster for the country" that had covered Trump in the 2016 with such bias and "absolute cluelessness" that it assisted him. The Washington Examiner obtained a copy in advance of its publication Tuesday.

Already facing a backlash from the liberal intelligentsia he disdains — a Q&A with the New Yorker was intensely hostile — Ellis has also been praised for his devil-may-care contrarianism. Interview Magazine described "White" as containing "searing points about how the national obsession with being liked at all costs and the silencing of opposing voices under the banner of inclusivity can create its own American hellscape."

As the author of the 1991 dystopian novel "American Psycho," in which the Wall Street banker — and serial killer — protagonist Patrick Bateman venerates Manhattan real estate mogul Donald Trump, Ellis has a unique perspective on the 45th president of the United States.

He places Trump's 2016 victory and what he sees as the Left's continued refusal to accept his legitimacy squarely in the context of millennials — those who reached adulthood around the start of the 21st century. He brands them"Generation Wuss" and laments their "oversensitivity, their sense of entitlement, their insistence they were always right despite sometimes overwhelming proof to the contrary, their joint tendencies of overreaction and passive-aggressive possibility."

This, he argues, has been fostered by "overprotective, helicopter moms and dads mapping their every move" while "smothering their ids and not teaching them how to deal with life's hardships ... people might not like you, this person will not love you back, kids are really cruel, works sucks, it's hard to be good at something, your days will be made up of failure and disappointment, you're not talented, people suffer, people grow older, people die."

"Generation Wuss," he writes, became consumed by "victim narratives" and "anxiety and neediness." More darkly, and with the help of social media, Ellis diagnoses a growing inability to accept or even listen to viewpoints that differ from a "woke" status quo.

"This is an age that judges everybody so harshly through the lens of identity politics that if you resist the threatening groupthink of 'progressive ideology,' which proposes universal inclusivity except for those who dare to ask any questions, you’re somehow fucked," Ellis writes. "Everyone has to be the same, and have the same reactions to any given work of art, or movement or idea, and if you refuse to join the chorus of approval you will be tagged a racist or a misogynist."

Ellis idenitifies disgust with this as one of the factors behind the rise of Trump. Born in Los Angeles and now living there again after decamping from New York, Ellis found himself as an almost lone voice in the "Hollywood bubble" who believed Trump could defeat Hillary Clinton.

In the summer of 2015, he began to feel that "legacy institutions like The New York Times and CNN [were not] tracking what seemed to me a shifting reality..the media became so freaked out that they abandoned the hallmarks of neutrality and perspective."

Trump insulted everyone, Ellis argues, "and white men got it first and far more than anyone else, yet as the national press corps explained it, this was not the case."

He continues: "Trump was the poster-boy antithesis of the proud moral superiority of the Left as defined forever by Clinton's 'basket of deplorables' comment, as well as by Michelle Obama's breathlessly condescending 'when they go low, we go high,' both of which were quoted approvingly in the legacy media."

If the media had reported "Trump more objectively he wouldn't have won...the way the legacy media was covering the election of 2016 — Clinton as heroine, Trump as villain — would prove to be an utter moral disaster for the country because it helped turn Donald Trump into the biggest underdog in American political history."

For his part, Ellis voted for neither candidate. "I hadn't voted for anyone, not only because I lived in rest-assured California bt also because during the campaign I'd realized I wasn't a conservative or a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican, and I didn't buy into what either party was selling. (I'd also thought Bernie Sanders's platform was impractical to the point of absurdity.)"

But Ellis found himself being pilloried merely for failing to be distraught that Trump had won. "When my traumatized boyfriend criticized me for not being angrier about the election (five months after it had happened) I shot back that I didn't want to talk about Trump anymore. I didn't care. He was elected president. Get over it." His boyfriend shot back that "by simply accepting the elections' results I was 'colluding' with the new administration and, by extension, with Moscow."

He began to tune out those who harped on about Clinton winning the popular vote, a mantra that "started reminding me — as the resistance continued — of the complaints of spoiled children at a birthday party when they didn't win the relay race, and who wanted the race rerun with different rules, while stomping their feet, arms crossed, pinched faces crimson and wet with tears."

When he heard people using words like "Hitlerian" and "apocalypse," he writes, he'd "stare at them while a tiny voice in the back of my head started sighing, You are the biggest fucking baby I've ever fucking heard in my entire fucking life and please you've got to fucking calm the fuck down — I get it, I get it, you don't like fucking Trump but for fuck's sake enough already for fuck's sake."

One friend told him that the Electoral College — the agreed rules by which Trump won — was "bullshit" and Los Angeles and New York should choose a president. "I don't want any goddam know-nothing rural hicks deciding who the president should be," Ellis quoted him as saying. "I am a proud liberal coastal elite and I think we should pick the president because we know better ."

Ellis found the incident in which press secretary Sarah Sanders was refused service in a Virginia restaurant to be especially ominous. "The shunning of other who don't like you had moved past protest and resistance into childlike fascism. ... The differing viewpoints were judged as immoral, racist and misogynist." During the Senate hearings into the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, the Left "had turned into haters, helped by an inordinate amount of encouragement from the mainstream media and now came across as anti-common-sense, anti-rational and anti-American."

On one level, Ellis concludes, this may have been "simply the year of endless low points for a resistance that was spinning epic fails in venting their anger about Trump," the latest episode in the reality show that is the Trump presidency.

"Or maybe when you're roiling in childish rage, the first thing you lose is judgment, and then comes common sense. And finally you lose your mind and along with that, your freedom."

Texto completo: Last week’s arrest of Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange by the British government on a U.S. extradition order is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the U.S. Constitution. It is an attack on the free press. It is an attack on free speech. It is an attack on our right to know what our government is doing with our money in our name.
Julian Assange is every bit as much a political prisoner as was Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary or Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
They, and so many more, were imprisoned because they told the truth about their governments.
Repressive governments do not want their citizens to know that they are up to so they insist on controlling the media. We are taught, at the same time, that we have a free press whose job it is to uncover the corruption in our system so that we can demand our political leaders make some changes or face unemployment. That, we are told, is what makes us different from the totalitarian.
The arrest of Assange is a canary in a coal mine to warn us that something is very wrong with our system.
What’s wrong? The U.S. mainstream media always seems to do the bidding of the U.S. government. That is why they rushed to confirm Washington’s claim that the Assange indictment was not in any way about journalism. It was only about hacking government computers!
As the New York Times said in an editorial, sounding like a mouthpiece of the U.S. government, Julian Assange committed “an indisputable crime.” But was it? As actual journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote last week, what Julian Assange did in 2010, for which he is facing extradition to the U.S., is no different from what New York Times and other journalists do every day! He attempted to help Chelsea Manning shield Manning’s identity as Manning blew the whistle on U.S. government crimes to a publisher. The information in question included a video showing U.S. military personnel participating in and cheering the murder of Iraqi civilians. Why is it criminal for us to know this?
The difference is that what Assange and Manning did embarrassed the U.S. government, which was lying to us that it was “liberating” Iraq and Afghanistan when it was actually doing the opposite. Mainstream journalists publish “leaks” that help bolster the neocon or other vested narratives of the different factions of the US government. That’s why the US media wants to see Assange in prison, or worse: he upset their apple cart.
The lesson is clear: when you bolster the government’s narrative you are a “brave journalist.” When you expose corruption in government you are a criminal. Do we really want to live in a country where it is illegal to learn that our government is engaged in criminal acts? I thought we had an obligation as an engaged citizenry to hold our government accountable!
As long as Julian Assange is in prison, we are all in prison. When the government has the power to tell us what we are allowed to see, hear, and know, we no longer live in a free society. Julian Assange will be extradited to the U.S. and he will have dozens of charges piled on. They want him to disappear so that the next Assange will think twice before informing us of our government’s crimes. Are we going to let them steal our freedom?

WOODS ENDS MAJOR, MASTERS DROUGHT STORMS TO FIFTH GREEN JACKET AT AGE 43 TO ELECTRIFY GOLFING WORLD

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Ga. - It was 22 years ago, almost to the day, the world was presented a player who would take the game by storm.
Sunday at the Masters, he struck again.
The predicted electricity in the air at Augusta National Golf Club was no match for what was happening on the ground when Tiger Woods became the second-greatest Masters champion of them all, ending a 14-year drought and winning his fifth green jacket with a performance every bit as pulsating as his other four.
The player who became the youngest Masters champion in history in 1997 became the second oldest at age 43 when he birdied three of the final six holes to leap past a stumbling Francesco Molinari of Italy and back into the consciousness of everybody in the golf world.
"It's overwhelming what has transpired the last year," Woods said after he won his 15th major championship and first in 11 years. "It's unreal for me to experience this. My mom was here. I couldn't be more happy and more excited."
On a day when the final starting time was pushed up five hours to beat forecasted severe weather, it was Woods who provided the thunder through the hills and valleys of Augusta National. He shot a final-round 70 that included six birdies and four bogeys to finish at 13-under 275, a shot better than two of the top four players in the world - Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - and Xander Schauffele.
When he two-putted the final hole for bogey to complete an improbable two-year comeback from back fusion surgery, Woods celebrated like at no other time after any of his 81 PGA Tour victories, including his previous major victories. He threw his arms in the air several times, pumping them to the sky in ecstatic jubilation, smiling broadly to break the icy demeanor he showed throughout the final round.
When he walked off the green and shared long, emotional embraces with his son, Charlie; daughter, Sam; and his mother, Kultida, there weren't many dry eyes around the 18th green as the patrons loudly chanted, "Tiger, Tiger."
"To have my kids there, it's come full circle," Woods said. "My dad was here in [1997] and I'm the dad with two kids here."
It was Woods first major championship since his 2008 U.S. Open playoff victory over Rocco Mediate and his first at the Masters since 2005, when he defeated Chris DeMarco in a one-hole playoff. It also was the first time he won a major when he didn't have the 54-hole lead.
It has been a steady progression back to the top for Woods. He was in the final pairing and finished sixth at the British Open in July and finished second at the PGA Championship in August. In both instances, he lost to the players he held off the Masters - Molinari and Koepka.
"It's just unreal, to be honest with you," Woods said. "The whole tournament has meant so much to me over the years. To come back here and play as well as I did . to have everyone here, it's something I will never, ever forget."
It was a classic Woods performance, filled with sterling iron play and some crooked tee shots. He led the field in greens in regulation, hitting 58 of 72 over four days (80.6 percent), despite hitting 35 of 56 fairways and ranking 47th in driving accuracy (62.5 percent).
In the end, the players beat the storm that was forecast for Sunday afternoon in Augusta. They just couldn't beat the other one.
"The energy out there was brilliant with Tiger being out there," said Molinari, the 54-hole leader who began the day with a two-shot lead. "People were loving it."
Molinari, who had made just one bogey in his first 60 holes, made two double bogeys on the back nine when he watered two shots in a span of four holes - his tee shot at the par-3 12th and his third shot at No. 15 after it clipped a tree limb. The reigning British Open champion shot 74 and finished tied for fifth at 277, two shots behind Woods.
"The mistake Francesco made there at 12 let a lot of people back in the tournament, including myself," Woods said.
Indeed, when Woods two-putted from 50 feet, he had finally caught Molinari to tie for the lead. When he two-putted for birdie at the par-5 15th, Woods broke a five-way tie at the top to emerge as the sole leader with three holes to play - his first time all week at the top of the leader board.
But Woods still had other worries. Ahead of him, Koepka made eagle at the par-5 13th and birdie at the par-5 15th to climb into a share of the lead. So did Schauffele, who made five birdies in a seven-hole stretch beginning at No. 8; and Johnson, who birdied four of the final six holes.
In fact, the only player to momentarily overtake Woods was Patrick Cantlay, who had battled back from an opening-round 73 and got to 12-under after an eagle at No. 15. But Cantlay bogeyed the next two holes to finish at 278, tied with Jon Rahm and Rickie Fowler.
?All that was left was for Woods to bask into the adulation of the throng that gathered around the 18th green and put another indelible imprint on the tournament he has mastered better than everyone - except one.
"It was an amazing buzz out there," Woods said. "There were so many different scenarios that could have transpired on the back nine, so many guys that had a chance to win. You couldn't have had more drama than we all had out there. Now I know why I'm balding."

Texto completo: Tiger Woods faced this question: Should Jack Nicklaus be worried about his record 18 majors?
"Well, I don't know if he's worried or not," Woods replied, later adding: "I'm just enjoying 15."
Perhaps he'd also enjoy these 15 takeaways from one of the most memorable Masters in history:
1. This place always delivers. Sunday drama at the Masters is a given. The risk-reward holes on the back nine lend themselves to "ooohs" and "aaahs" every year. Dustin Johnson picked up four shots on the back nine Sunday. Francesco Molinari crumbled, putting two balls in the water.
Masters officials lengthened the fifth hole and got what they wanted, we suppose. Woods bogeyed the hole all four days. But they'd be wise to think twice before moving the tee box back at No. 13, which yielded 17 crowd-pleasing eagles this week.
2. Woods' victory is great news for Chicago golf fans. Medinah will host the BMW Championship (Aug. 15-18), a FedEx Cup playoff event featuring the top 70 on the points list. Woods just surged from 81st to 13th.
3. Woods' dissection of his thought process on the 155-yard 12th was epic. "I had 147 over the first tongue in the bunker, so my number was 150. I saw Brooks (Koepka) ended up short. (Ian Poulter) ended up short as well. I was up there on the tee box and I could feel that wind puff up a little bit. Brooksy is stronger than I am, and he flights it better than I do, so I'm sure he hit 9-iron but didn't make it. So I knew my 9-iron couldn't cover the flag. I said: Just be committed. Hit it over that tongue. Let get out of here (with par) and let's go handle the par 5s, and I did."
4. Masters officials had a spectacular week. The women's amateur event was well attended and shined a light on the progress the club has made since former Chairman Hootie Johnson's "point of a bayonet" clash with Martha Burk. Champion Jennifer Kupcho won in epic fashion, with an eagle on 13 and birdies on three of her final four holes.
And then, because of the threat of severe weather, they moved up Sunday's start time and had players go off both the first and 10th tees. By the time the weather horn sounded at 2:52 p.m., calling for the evacuation of the course, Woods had received his green jacket from Patrick Reed.
5. Woods has won green jackets in 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2019, joining Nicklaus as the only men to win the Masters in three decades.
6. Asked to describe his impact on golf, Woods said he has brought more youth to the game. And encouraged players to improve their conditioning.
"A lot of the guys on the tour now are training," he said. "They are getting bigger, stronger, faster, more athletic. They are hitting the ball prodigious distances, and a little bit of that's probably attributed to what I did. When I first turned pro, I was the only one in the gym, except Vijay (Singh)."
7. And now for the ribbing. "Now everyone trains," he said. "Even Phil (Mickelson) is working out. Things have come a long way."
8. Chew on this. Mickelson told the New York Times last month that he likes to chew gum while playing to boost cognitive functioning.
Woods chewed much of the week but for a different reason: "I'm chomping on this gum because I usually get hungry, I keep eating so much. And it curbs my appetite a little bit, which is nice. The issue I have at tournaments is I lose so much weight."
9. Viktor Hovland of Norway was low amateur, finishing at 3 under. Arlington Heights' Doug Ghim took the prize at last year's Masters, shooting 8 over in tougher conditions.
10. Rickie Fowler remains the best player never to have won a major. He got close again Sunday, finishing T-9.
"I love this place," he said. "I've got a jacket coming soon, just not this year. I know I can get it done here."
11. Woods received $2,070,000 for his victory. A Woods fan did almost as well. The William Hill sportsbook had an $85,000 wager on Woods at 14-1, resulting in a $1.19 million payout.
"It's a painful day for William Hill -- our biggest golf loss ever -- but a great day for golf," company official Nick Bogdanovich told VSiN.com.
12. Woods' kids (daughter Sam, 11, and son Charlie, 10) might have a love/hate relationship with golf. "Prior to the comeback," Woods said, "they only knew that golf caused me a lot of pain. If I tried to swing a club, I would be on the ground. I struggled for years.
"Now I think they're starting to understand how much the game means to me."
13. Woods was steaming as he came off the fourth green after back-to-back bogeys. Asked about his conversation with caddie Joe LaCava, Woods said: "The talk that Joey and I had ... I just listened. He was saying some things that I can't really repeat here. Then I went into the restroom and proceeded to say the same things over and over to myself and then came out and I felt a lot better."
14. Several non-winners can take pride in their results. Former Northwestern golfer Matt Fitzpatrick followed an opening 78 with rounds of 67-68-70 to finish T-21. Patrick Cantlay (T-9) and Tony Finau (T-5) threatened. And Jordan Spieth finally showed a pulse, shooting 75-68-69-71. "Progress," said Spieth, who is in the midst of his worst season.
15. Tiger will not reach 18 majors. That's my prediction. Why? While it's true he contended at the final two majors last year, Augusta National is the one course that's perfect for him. Woods doesn't pay much of a price for errant tee shots such as Sunday misses on Nos. 2 and 11, and he puts his years of course knowledge to use.
That said, he does know Bethpage Black quite well. The course on Long Island in New York will host the PGA Championship next month as part of the reconfigured schedule. Woods won the 2002 U.S. Open there and finished tied for sixth in the 2009 Open.

Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
Web regulators are getting into their groove. But are they going too quickly?
This past week, the British government proposed new powers to issue fines and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content on their platforms. My colleague Adam Satariano said it "would be one of the world's most aggressive actions to rein in the most corrosive online content."
Days earlier, Australia passed legislation that threatens fines for social media companies that fail to rapidly remove violent material. And there's a growing pipeline of other internet regulation, along with existing laws like the European Union's sweeping General Data Protection Regulation.
"We're entering a new phase of hyper regulation," said Paul Fehlinger, the deputy executive director of the Internet and Jurisdiction Policy Network, an organization established to understand how national laws affect the internet.
This flurry of content rules is understandable. Much of the material they would police is abhorrent, and social media's rapid rise has caught lawmakers off guard; now the public wants something done.
But the regulations could have unintended consequences.
Difficulties in defining "harmful" mean governments will develop different standards. In turn, the web could easily look different depending on your location -- a big shift from its founding principles. (This is already happening: The Chicago Tribune's website, for example, doesn't comply with General Data Protection Regulation, so there's no access to it from Europe.)
There may be less visible effects. If regulation required differences at a hardware level, that could fragment the infrastructure, said Konstantinos Komaitis, a senior director at the nonprofit Internet Society, which promotes the open development and use of the internet. That could make the internet less resilient to outages and attacks.
And bigger, richer companies will find it easier to comply with sprawling regulation, which could reinforce the power of Big Tech.
"There is a major risk that we end up in a situation where short-term political pressure trumps long-term vision," Mr. Fehlinger said.
Mr. Komaitis said avoiding unintended consequences was "very simple, yet very difficult."
"It is all about collaboration," he added. The idea: lawmakers work together across borders to ensure rules are more consistent.
The challenge is that collaboration could slow the pace of regulation that lawmakers desire. But Mr. Komaitis said many proposed regulations lack clear plans for implementation, and envisions snags when governments come to apply them. If they struggle, he said, collaboration and sharing of expertise may be the only way to make their plans work.

A.I. ethics: Work in progress
Artificial intelligence could make our lives easier and more efficient. But, like any powerful technology, it's more complicated than that. A.I. can be used for surveillance. To control autonomous weapons. It can be biased. It could erode jobs. The list goes on.
None of those are reasons to reject A.I. outright. But they underscore how its development must be approached with care.
Big Tech has struggled to publicly demonstrate that care. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have all drawn criticism for their A.I. work with military and government agencies. Just this month, Google's plan to create an A.I. ethics board ended disastrously when backlash about board members led to its dissolution.
Missteps should be called out, especially when they're made by such powerful corporations. But in an emergent field, mistakes also serve as lessons. And a new set of A.I. ethics guidelines from the European Commission is a good example of how trial and error will be a fundamental part of ethical A.I. development.
The guidelines, developed by 52 experts, contain seven requirements that A.I. systems should meet to be deemed trustworthy. What stands out about them for Charlotte Stix, a policy officer at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University, is that they're designed to be carried out.
Unlike other A.I. ethics guidelines, they attempt to join ethical principles to firm recommendations -- something that has divided opinions among some people working in the field. That's why the European Commission hopes companies will adopt and test them between now and 2020, so that they can be improved.
Frank Buytendijk, a vice president in Gartner's data and analytics group, said the guidelines sent a message to big tech companies that may have struggled with A.I. ethics in the past: "Here's your chance to do the right thing."
Why Big Tech loves satellites
Amazon joined the ranks of tech companies wanting to blanket the world with the internet.
Its Project Kuiper plan, which came to light in filings made by the Federal Communications Commission, would put 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit to deliver the internet to "underserved communities around the world." It has been likened to a network under development by SpaceX. Facebook has plans for a similar system, and Google has teamed up with the satellite operator Telesat along the same lines.
These initiatives seek to provide affordable internet connections to people who currently lack them -- from Alaska to sub-Saharan Africa. Satellites appear to be a front-runner: Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal noted that, according to the satellite industry veteran Shayn Hawthorne, "some kind of affordable satellite internet now appears inevitable."
For big tech companies, this is not selfless. A good example of why is the Free Basics program offered by Facebook's nonprofit Internet.org: a zero-cost data service that provides access in some developing countries to a curated group of websites, including Facebook. In locations that are essentially untapped markets, its provision of the web can help it secure new users.
Other Big Tech players are unlikely to want to miss out.
And some stories you shouldn't miss
■ Does privacy matter? What do companies know, and how do they know it? And what can we do about it? The New York Times is trying to answer those questions for you.
■ What you've heard about Chinese A.I. may be bluster. Jeff Ding from Oxford University says the West has overhyped China's abilities.
■ China might ban Bitcoin mining. A government agency added it to a list of industries that it proposes to eliminate.
■ It's all I.P.O.s. Uber and Pinterest are the next big tech unicorns to go public, in the coming month.
■ Amazon's cloud might be a potent spy tool for the United States. That's why it's unsuitable for storing German police data, Germany's top data protection officer told Politico.
■ Big Tech's data tricks are under scrutiny. Facebook will change its terms of service to explain its use of data in response to pressure from the European Commission. And Senators Mark Warner and Deb Fischer introduced a bill aimed at clamping down on user-interface tricks that encourage data sharing.
■ Amazon or Microsoft will build the Pentagon's cloud. They were the only bidders to meet the "minimum requirements" to win the $10 billion contract. One will be chosen.
■ YouTube had to shut down comments on a House hearing about social media. The live stream of the event, focused on white nationalism, was overrun by racist comments.
■ The House passed a bill to revive net neutrality. But the legislation faces long odds in the Republican-led Senate.
■ Amazon workers are listening to our Alexa commands. They even share some amusing ones in an internal chat room.

Texto completo: Notably, reading images does not begin in adulthood; rather, it is rooted in childhood, specifically picture books. In the world of education, we call this visual literacy, the ability to derive meaning from image.
"Optics." This word seems to be a trendy addition to our vocabulary. Like me, you have probably encountered it most often in political reporting.
By doing a little research, I was surprised to learn that William Safire wrote about this term a decade ago in his last column for On Language, a once regular feature in the New York Times Magazine.
In essence, Safire (and later his successor, Bill Zimmer) noted that the term "optics" is merely a scientific-sounding buzzword for image-making. How the "optics" are understood is critical; but it is not always the same for every person.
Notably, reading images does not begin in adulthood; rather, it is rooted in childhood, specifically picture books. In the world of education, we call this visual literacy, the ability to derive meaning from image.
To interpret a picture in a children's book, a visually literate reader considers the composition of the picture and sees beyond the colors and lines to the social constructs that are revealed. (And, yes, children do this! But they do this better if adults help!)
If you want to enhance your children's visual literacy, start by selecting a few wordless books. Wordless books focus on making meaning from images ALONE! Here are a few strategies that parents, caregivers and teachers might use while reading a wordless book:
Develop vocabulary to help your children talk about the picture. Consider these terms: line, shape, size, color, space and point of view/perspective. For example, specifically ask your child why an illustrator used a particular color or why certain objects are larger or smaller, or why the illustrator drew the image from a specific point of view. Ask about that white space and why the illustrator chose to add that to the page.
When you come upon a particularly interesting picture in a wordless book, pause. Use these three questions as you look at a page: What do you see? What do you think about what you see? What do you wonder about this image?
Afterward, have your children draw pictures to help them express their response to the image.
There are so many superb wordless picture books, but here are three that will help enhance your child's visual literacy:
"Another" by Christian Robinson is a recently published wordless book that has received starred reviews from many sources. Reviewers have called this book a "work or art and a celebration of childhood." Join the main characters, a little girl and her cat, as they explore another world that seems to be both enchanting and puzzling.
"Wave" by South Korean author/illustrator Suzy Lee offers images of a child protagonist who is investigating the beach for the first time. This book provides extraordinary images for discussion.
"Shadow," also by Lee, provides another opportunity to "read" a story told in just three colors: black, white and yellow. The setting is a dark attic, but it is a lightbulb and the child's imagination that offer an ideal venue to expand your child's visual literacy.
Perhaps Henry David Thoreau provided the best summary for thinking about visual literacy when he wrote, "It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see."

Notably, reading images does not begin in adulthood; rather, it is rooted in childhood, specifically picture books. In the world of education, we call this visual literacy, the ability to derive meaning from image.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Canada's top economic diplomat personally lobbied President Trump's advisers this week to remove American tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports and warned that the levies could jeopardize that country's ratification of the rewritten North American Free Trade Agreement.
Bill Morneau, Canada's finance minister, said in an interview with The New York Times that the United States appeared unwilling to budge on the tariffs despite continued pleas to remove them. Canada has argued that the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum are harmful to both countries' economies and make little sense given the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement reached late last year.
"We continue to advocate for the complete removal of the tariffs," Mr. Morneau said on Thursday afternoon on the sidelines of the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The United States and Canada have had continuing negotiations about the removal of the tariffs. One option that the United States has proposed is rolling back the tariffs in exchange for Canada agreeing to quotas on its steel and aluminum exports to the United States.
But Mr. Morneau called replacing tariffs with quotas unacceptable.
"We continue to think that the most appropriate way to move forward is just to fully move away from this approach," said Mr. Morneau, who met this week with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative.
Mr. Trump has pointed to the new trade deal as one of his signature economic accomplishments, but it faces an uncertain path to ratification in the United States. Democrats, who now control the House, are demanding changes to the agreement, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who leads the House, must agree to bring it up for a vote.
Ms. Pelosi said last week that the House would not vote on the trade deal until Mexico passes new labor laws that are required under the agreement. The revised Mexican labor law, which is devised to give workers greater freedom to organize, passed that nation's lower house on Thursday and could go to the Senate next week.
Mr. Morneau said that he had been watching the proceedings in Congress carefully and staying in touch with his Mexican counterparts, but said ratification in Canada was also not guaranteed given the tariffs.
"It's a real issue that we have Canadians asking why we don't have agreement on that based on getting to agreement on everything else," Mr. Morneau said. "I made that point to Secretary Mnuchin, that from our perspective steel and aluminum tariffs in two close trading partners don't make sense."
He added, "And they certainly don't make sense in the context of trying to improve our trading relationship by signing a new trade deal."
Mr. Morneau said that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer were aware of Canada's concerns but noted that the steel industry lobby in the United States, which supports the tariffs, is powerful.
At a Senate hearing last month, Mr. Mnuchin suggested that a resolution to the tariffs could coincide with congressional approval of the new trade deal.
Republican lawmakers in the United States have been on Canada's side when it comes to removing the steel and aluminum tariffs. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has also personally asked Mr. Trump to remove them and publicly called for their repeal this week.
"I'd like to see a resolution with Canada and Mexico on steel and aluminum tariffs," Mr. Grassley said on the Senate floor on Monday, where he referenced the trade act provision used to impose the tariffs on national security grounds. "I urge President Trump to lift the 232 tariffs so we can forge ahead with United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and eliminate the uncertainty in the North American market."
Mr. Trump, however, continues to cast doubt about the future of the agreement. In recent weeks he has threatened to seal the border with Mexico and impose tariffs on Mexican cars -- which the new trade deal largely forbids -- out of frustration with Mexico's immigration policies.

David Brooks confused why immigration crisis isn’t easily solved

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks must have really pitied the political process when all on his own he came up with what is, according to him, “a practical response” to the crisis at the southern border.

It just so happens, however, that Brooks’ recommendations are either already in place or they’re points of dispute between the White House, which wants to end the hundreds of thousands of illegal border crossings, and Democrats, who simply want to accommodate them all. This is otherwise known as “American democracy.”

“Over the short term do the things any practical mayor would do,” Brooks wrote Tuesday with Olympian confidence. “Build new detention centers at the border; expand the capacities at the ports of entry; expand the number of judge teams, to speed through the backlog; create an orderly release procedure coordinated with humanitarian agencies; increase the number of counselors so refugees can navigate the system; vet children in their home countries for refugee status so they don’t have to make a fruitless trip.”

Problem solved!

Building new detention centers would not deter the unabated flow of migrants coming to the U.S. and taking advantage of the gaping asylum loophole. It would do the opposite. When cities erect more Section 8 housing, the buildings don’t sit there empty. Building more detention centers simply means filling them up with ever more migrants. It would function as an incentive, not a solution.

Expanding ports of entry would have the same effect. To reiterate for Brooks what is well known, the migrants coming to the U.S. are abusing our own law that was intended to save people of other nations who fear persecution based on their race, religion, or political opinions. The asylum law was never supposed to function as a welcome mat for the world’s destitute.

Adding more immigration judges to the system could help, but not if nothing is done to discourage migrants from exploiting the asylum scheme. The backlog for immigration hearings is at nearly 1 million cases. We won’t put a dent in that number with more judges if the stream of asylum claims continues at its current pace.

By establishing an “orderly release procedure,” Brooks presumably means the process by which migrants who have their claims denied are sent back to their country of origin. Why hadn’t anyone thought of creating an “orderly release procedure?”

They have, and there is one. But, contrary to Brooks’ very well-informed declarations, it’s not as easy as buying a plane ticket from Washington to New York. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, where the vast majority of these people are coming from, are thousands of miles away. When 200,000 people are showing up at the border in the span of three months, how many planes, buses, and agents do you think it takes to get these people home? It’s almost as if there’s a reason the current situation is called a “crisis” and not “orderly.”

Brooks wants to “increase the number of counselors so refugees can navigate the system,” which is another way of saying, “aid the migrants in their exploitation of the system.” You know, just like any practical mayor would do!

Finally, he suggests that the U.S. “vet children in their home countries for refugee status so they don’t have to make a fruitless trip.” The process for this already exists. It’s called claiming asylum or refugee status at the American embassy. Central Americans make the “fruitless trip” to the U.S. precisely because it’s not fruitless. When children are involved, they are largely allowed to stay, at least until their court hearing arrives some two years later. That’s only if they show up for it at all.

If only Brooks were in Congress to solve all of the nation’s most pressing issues. Unfortunately, kids, he has a column to write.

Your lawyer is unreal: How to spot the scammers

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Assange Arrest Won’t Chill Press Freedom

Texto completo: Some media watchdogs worried Thursday that Julian Assange’s arrest would inhibit the disclosure of government information and, therefore, diminish government accountability and erode personal privacy.
But Assange’s case is distinctly different from other cases in which whistle-blowers or leakers have released information that the government wanted to keep secret.
The federal indictment against Assange does not charge him with illegally publishing anything. Rather, it charges him with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, claiming that he conspired with convicted Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning in 2010 to steal government secrets, and hacked into government computers to steal classified information.
Generally, U.S. courts have found that journalists cannot be held liable for information that they legally obtain from others.
That does not absolve them, however, of doing anything illegal to obtain the information.
In the famous Pentagon Papers case, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post received documents from Daniel Ellsburg, who worked as a consultant for the Department of Defense. Unlike the allegation against Assange, they did not steal the information from the government.
Most important, the indictment does not charge Assange with espionage.
Unfortunately, the government’s penchant for secrecy breeds suspicion, but there is no indication that this case will chill press freedom.

Texto completo: For New Jersey residents, it all feels very new. After years of emotional debate, lawmakers approved a measure last month to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives with medical help, and Gov. Phil Murphy has said he will sign it into law.
But so-called aid-in-dying laws have been in effect for over two decades in the United States. Oregon was the first to approve such a measure in 1994, followed by Washington in 2008 and four other states in the past six years.
Litigation has closely followed just about every successful vote to decriminalize assisted suicide, but courts have generally allowed such laws to be implemented, and polling has shown the policies to be popular among residents with access to them.
As New Jersey prepares to become the latest state to permit strictly regulated, medically assisted suicide for its residents, here's a look at the events that led to the gradual spread of the policy across the country.
Oregon the pioneer In a victory for groups trying to wrest end-of-life choices away from the state and the medical profession, Oregon voters narrowly approved a referendum in 1994 to make it the first place in North America where doctors could legally help patients end their lives.
Oregon's ballot question came in the wake of failed attempts to legalize assisted suicide in Washington and California. But unlike the measures in those states, the Oregon measure did not allow doctors to administer a lethal dose.
Nonetheless, the backlash was fierce. The Vatican, which viewed the measure as a half step from euthanasia, condemned the Oregon vote as "a day of mourning for all humanity," according to a report in The New York Times.
Such depth of emotion spawned more than a decade of litigation that twice brought Oregon's policy before the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be years before another state followed Oregon's example.
Legal challenges Within weeks of the Oregon referendum, implementation of the law was put on hold after lawyers for the National Right to Life Committee challenged the measure as unconstitutional, arguing that it violated the rights of terminally ill people to equal protection.
Around the same time, other cases challenging bans on medically assisted suicide in New York and Washington made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the summer of 1997, justices ruled that the Constitution does not provide a general right to assisted suicide, but they left the door open to states to experiment with such laws.
Four months later, the high court removed the last legal obstacle to the Oregon law taking effect, and voters there again endorsed the measure when they roundly defeated a ballot measure aimed at repealing the law.
After more threats, laws spread A series of threats from Washington, D.C., over the next decade had a chilling effect on other states considering assisted suicide laws. After unsuccessful attempts by members of Congress to overturn Oregon's law, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced in 2001 that doctors who prescribed lethal medication under state law risked losing their federal licenses to prescribe controlled substances.
That directive, too, was met with a legal challenge, culminating five years later in the U.S. Supreme Court again defending the Oregon law, ruling that Ashcroft had overstepped his authority.
Washington was the next state to approve an assisted suicide law in 2008, followed by Vermont in 2013, California in 2015, Colorado in 2016 and Hawaii in 2018. The District of Columbia also allows medically assisted suicide.
Montana does not have a statute permitting the practice, but a 2009 state Supreme Court ruling said state law protects doctors from prosecution for helping terminally ill patients die. Since the ruling, Montana lawmakers have introduced several bills to ban the practice but none has passed.
What to expect in New Jersey If New Jersey is like other states that have legalized medically assisted suicide, participation rates will gradually increase over time. In Oregon, the first state to allow the practice, 249 people received prescriptions for lethal medication last year, up from 24 in 1998, according to state data. Cancer has been the most common underlying illness there, followed by neurological and respiratory diseases.
Deaths under so-called aid-dying laws have accounted for a tiny fraction of overall deaths in other states. Still, it's possible some people from neighboring states could establish residency in New Jersey to take advantage of its assisted suicide law. Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with terminal brain cancer, for example, made international news when she moved from her home state of California to Oregon in 2014 to legally end her life.
Under the New Jersey measure, patients can prove their residency by showing a doctor their driver's license or non-driver ID card, proof they are registered to vote in New Jersey, a resident income tax return or "any other government record" that demonstrates residency.
If Murphy, a Democrat, signs the measure this month, the new law will take effect Aug.1.

Texto completo: Fox Business has the exact opposite problem of its competition.

As left-leaning newsrooms, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, etc., struggle with the obvious problem that their reporting errors on the White House always seem to go in the same anti-Trump direction, Fox Business' errors always seem to go in the administration's favor.

Case in point: The Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs, a rabid Trump devotee, touted an on-air graphic Wednesday evening showing the president supposedly enjoys a 55% overall approval rating. The same graphic also showed Trump's approval rating on the economy is at roughly 58%.

But the survey, conducted by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service, found the president has an unfavorable rating of 55%, while a much smaller 41% said they have a favorable opinion. The poll also found that 52% of respondents say they disprove of the job Trump is doing as president, while 43% say they approve.

The survey did at least find that 58% of respondents say they approve of Trump’s handling of the economy. So, at least Dobbs was only a little bit off there.

Distressingly enough, the president himself shared the erroneous graphic on his Twitter account Thursday morning, distributing actual fake news to his more than 59 million followers:The error was bad enough that the Fox Business Network issued on-air correction Thursday.

“It’s been a quiet start to the day for President Trump, though he did send out a tweet this morning from the Lou Dobbs show last night on Fox Business," Washington correspondent Blake Burman said. "That tweet featured a poll that was not entirely accurate, which Fox Business would like to correct."

He added in his note of correction, "According to a poll from Georgetown University, 58% of respondents approved of the president’s handling of the economy. That portion of the graphic was right. However, the graphic also showed that 55% of the respondents approve of the president, that number is not correct. The 55% number was those who have an unfavorable impression of President Trump."

The president’s tweet, which carries with it the joyous proclamation of "Great news! #MAGA,” has not been removed from his social media page.

It may seem like a small thing, but it’s not. The graphic's chief claim is factually inaccurate, it’s the product of a pro-Trump zealot with a national platform, and it is currently being shared all over the country and the world by the president’s fans and allies.

There has been a great deal of slipshod and unethical behavior from the press in its reckless crusade to bring down the president, but it’s important to note that there has also been a good deal of reckless news reporting and commentary performed on his behalf. Both are worthless. Both are dangerous.

Battered Biden could succeed as a moderate in a Democratic field tilting to the left

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden has been rocked in recent days by a heightened focus on his years of engaging in uncomfortable and uninvited contact with shocked and demoralized women.

But if he can continue to show strength in the face of controversy while running as one of the Democratic 2020 race's few moderates, he may have staying power as other candidates trample herd-like to the left.

Biden, 76, appears to be passing the test, at least for now. Despite multiple allegations from women who said that Biden made them uncomfortable with unwanted contact, he remains atop the polls.

A Morning Consult poll of Democratic primary voters conducted April 1 to 7, while allegations were gradually surfacing, found Biden leading the field with 32 percent. Another POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted April 5 to 7 found that about half of Democratic primary voters said that the allegations would make no difference in their vote.

Hidden Tribes Project survey data found that about half of Democratic-leaning voters call themselves moderate or conservative, the New York Times reported. They make up a smaller but still significant portion in the primaries: 2 in 5 Democratic primary voters identified as moderate or conservative in 2016, according to CNN exit polls.

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist and president and CEO of Blueprint Strategy, said that Biden showed strength in his response: a video in which Biden acknowledged that social norms have changed and promised to be more mindful of personal space.

“People just want to hear you say, ‘Look, I’m not perfect, and I will never be perfect, but I’m willing to learn from my mistakes.’” Seawright said.

The big danger for Biden is that that the lesser-known candidates in the 2020 Democratic field could gain a lot of traction once voters learn who they are.

Early poll numbers “represent name recognition, broad acceptability, et cetera. It’s not to dismiss it, but they are misleading,” Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster and chairman of Hart Research, told the Washington Examiner .

“Any of these unknown candidates have the ability to grow and pick up more acceptance as the electorate sorts through things. I’m not saying that Joe Biden can’t hold on to that vote, but to fall in love with these sets of numbers is a mistake,” Hart said.

There is also a concern about whether Biden, 76, and his wing of the party can connect with younger voters.

In presidential primaries over the last 50 years, “Democrats have a tendency to kind of chew up and spit out their front-runners,” John Zogby, a Democratic pollster at Zogby Strategies, told the Washington Examiner . “It’s not necessarily the most comfortable position to be in."

One of Biden’s advantages, though, is appealing to demographics where Democrats have been weak in recent decades, Zogby said, pointing to “blue-collar territory, more traditional, Catholic kinds of voters.”

Other candidates tout progressive policies like abolishing the Electoral College, a wealth tax, and "Medicare for All," which could alienate a significant portion of the electorate.

“Maturity, stability, a sense of the bigger picture rather than splinter issues, all of those things could work for Joe Biden. But he has to be able to meld it together in his language and his campaign,” Hart said.

And while Biden is seen as more of a moderate, he has enough progressive chops to make his case to those in the progressive wing whose number one goal is to defeat President Trump.

“Biden knows how to discuss policy, and he may be in a position to finesse things like the 'Green New Deal' by saying things like, ‘Look, I got Obamacare through. Look, I stopped the government from being shut down a couple of times,’” Zogby said.

Strategists said that the best thing Biden can do is stay strong, but don’t get cocky.

“The worst thing you can do is act like the front-runner when you are the front-runner,” Seawright said. “Which way the poll numbers go will be up to Joe.”

There is a danger in getting too far ahead in the polls too early. Zogby mentioned 1984 Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who was the front-runner polling around 45 to 48 percent before the Iowa Caucuses. But Mondale got 48.9% in Iowa, making the big story Gary Hart’s surprising 16.5% second-place finish.

“The press just declared Mondale the loser,” Zogby said. “Far and away the frontrunner, he couldn’t get 50%?”

Hart went on to win the New Hampshire primary and gave Mondale a tough race, though Mondale ultimately won the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bret Easton Ellis turns to nonfiction to talk Trump, Kanye West, ‘American Psycho’ and our whiny culture in ‘White’

Texto completo: By the fall of 1990, Bret Easton Ellis had enjoyed the success of his debut novel “Less Than Zero,” seen it adapted by Hollywood, and published a second novel all before he’d turned 27.
And then “American Psycho” happened.
Or more accurately, at first it didn’t happen: Just weeks before publication, Simon & Schuster canceled the book amid outcry over the violence in the black satire about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer.
And then it was back on. Knopf plucked “American Psycho” off its rival publisher’s scrapheap and published it 1991 to widespread publicity that zigzagged between acclaim and scorn.
While Ellis found success with the book, and the movie adaptation that followed years later, in that moment of controversy something changed. These events would influence his perspective on the world, on the role of the independently minded individual and on the ability to be truly free. All this flows across the pages of “White,” his first-ever book of non-fiction, and first book at all in nine years.
“That for me was a wake-up call,” Ellis says recently from his home in West Hollywood just over the hills from the San Fernando Valley of his childhood and adolescence. “That a corporation was making decisions about what creatively a subsidiary could do creatively. What a publishing house was allowed to publish and was not allowed to publish.”
It was, Ellis says, his close-up look at a mob mentality, a hysteria over fiction that nearly no one, including all of the individuals and organizations arguing against “American Psycho,” had read.
“Like the cancellation was going to save something in America,” he says. “It was a moment. My friends were right. Jay McInerney (author of “Bright Lights, Big City,” which made a similar splash to that of “Less Than Zero”) said recently in the New York Times that he believes that’s where my freedom of expression and hating censorship and self-censorship really began.”
In “White,” which is crafted as a series of loosely themed essays, many of them adaptations of pieces originally written as monologues for “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Ellis shows readers where that mindset – fiercely independent, sometimes controversial, and always outspoken – has led him today.
“It came together very quickly in terms of the mood I was in at this moment,” he says. “And the changes I was feeling as a member of a generation who really, you know, was mostly noted for not really be able to take offense at anything, and finding myself forced into a way of thinking that I never that I would before.
“I never thought I would have been labeled or considered, as my democratic socialist boyfriend calls me, very much in the center, rather than what I always thought was a progressive gay guy.”
So what offends the 55-year-old Gen X-er today? He points to groupthink and virtue-signaling, trigger warnings and safe spaces, the culture of victimhood, and perhaps most of all, what Ellis views as the tension between the righteousness of rationality and logic and the wrongheadedness of emotion-fueled sensitivity, though he admits that inside his own home that distinction depends on one’s particular point of view.
“He thinks I’m nuts,” Ellis says of his 32-year-old millennial boyfriend of more than a decade now. “I’m over-emotional, I’m a drama queen, I don’t see anything rationally or with logic whatsoever.
“That is where we are,” he says, and laughs.
The book runs in a relaxed chronology, from an adolescence in the Valley focused on horror movies, the beauty of Richard Gere in “American Gigolo,” and the furtive pursuit of porn in the pre-digital age, to the publication of “Less Than Zero,” the unsatisfying adaptation into a movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy, the “American Psycho” controversy, and eventually, his dismay at the dismay of Democrats and the mainstream media at the rise of Trumpism in the United States.
Not because he agrees with Trump on much of anything, but because of his distaste for what he considers the dishonest arguments and overkill with which Trump foes attack him.
“I do think if this had been written, I don’t know, 10 years ago, I would have totally gone after the Tea Party and the birther movement or whatever,” Ellis says. “It’s always an extreme or something that is hysterical or so rooted in kind of fundamentalism that bothers me. I sensed that a lot in the last four years, and it’s just kind of gotten out of control.”
“White” will surely anger some readers, but if they’ve followed Ellis’ writing in fiction, journalism, or social media they shouldn’t be that surprised. His Twitter feed, in particular, was home to some of his darkest humor, eventually sparking so much outrage that he largely abandoned the platform but includes a chapter titled “Tweeting” in the book.”
“I loved Twitter,” he says. “A lot of it was funny, it was exciting. It was to titillate and outrage people, which is what creative people do. That is their instinct, to push boundaries. And then it started morphing.
“I guess it’s about power-grabbing, one group trying to shut down another group. Now it’s all negative, and it is not fun anymore.”
“White” closes with a section on Kanye West, a creative artist who like Ellis has had his share of public controversy. West approached Ellis to write a script for him, and they’ve worked on other projects in recent years, and Ellis says he quickly came to admire West for his iconoclasm and refusal to change to appease his critics.
“He has this notion of freedom that is extremely appealing to a lot of people,” he says. “Regardless of whether you agree with it all or not, he is really his own man. He’s contradictory, he makes mistakes, he falls down, he picks himself up.
“It’s not that I agree with Kanye 100 percent, I don’t,” Ellis says. “But I like the notion of Kanye, and I like that kind of person who is unencumbered by feeling he has to tell a narrative that he doesn’t believe in just to placate the press.”
Like West, Ellis has no interest in pacifying his public critics, though he says at home he and his boyfriend have reached a truce of sorts as the 2020 presidential campaigns begin, and his partner – “a committed Bernie bro” – rededicates himself to MSNBC’s coverage.
“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Spygate: Did American intelligence agencies spy on Donald Trump? Barr says we'll find out.

Texto completo: What’s in a word? When the word is spying, it could mean defending American democracy, or trying to undermine it.
On Wednesday Attorney General Bill Barr startled Senators when he said during a budget hearing that he believed that “spying did occur” during the 2016 presidential race, and that “spying on a political campaign is a big deal. " He tempered his statement by adding “the question is whether it was adequately predicated” and was not ready to say that “improper surveillance occurred;” but he is “concerned about it and looking into it. ”
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, took issue with Barr’s word choice, saying “the word ‘spying’ could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out. ” And of course they did. NBC News’ Chuck Todd said this was a “conspiracy theory” for which there was “zero factual basis. ” Furious Democrats denounced Barr for even raising the issue. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. , tweeted that Barr should “retract his statement immediately or produce specific evidence to back it up. ”

Crossfire Hurricane: Pull back curtain on FBI's investigation of Donald Trump, Russia
Today's talker: Russians and 'spies' and Trump — oh my!
Luckily the evidence may be on its way. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is near the end of his investigation into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) with respect to targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Since the FISA warrant was the predicate for subsequent surveillance, the impending IG report potentially will reveal whether it was legitimately obtained. Recently revealed text messages between FBI lawyer Lisa Page and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe show that the issue of biased sources was being hotly contested even days before the warrant application. If the warrant was in fact issued on the weight of the notorious “Steele dossier,” which was underwritten by the Clinton campaign, then all that followed could fall under the “improper surveillance” rubric, especially if some FBI employees knew it was bogus all along.
And there will be more information coming. The attorney general said he was looking into the genesis of the Russian collusion story, and that he was “not talking about the FBI, necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly. ” Because if you want to find spying, go where the spies are.
Intelligence treated Trump like the enemy
Obama-era officials like former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have cast the effort to investigate Russian influence in the Trump campaign as a standard counterintelligence operation. As such, they were just doing their duty.
But there are some problems with this narrative. One is that if foreign entities were attempting seriously to subvert the Trump campaign, it would have made most sense immediately to warn Donald Trump. Once alerted he could have insulated his campaign from foreign influence, fired members of the campaign who were already compromised, and worked actively with the Intelligence Community and the FBI to expose the malign foreign network.
But rather than warning Trump, the intelligence community treated his campaign like a target. Instead of helping Trump block Russia from penetrating his organization, it seems more like the agencies were hoping to discover that a collusion network was up and running. The CIA’s Counterintelligence Mission Center soon became a “conduit to the FBI” feeding information about alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians. But as House testimony from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos reveals, many such contacts were setups seeking to entrap people tied to Trump. Papadopoulos recently tweeted to Brennan that the assets the CIA “weaponized … are being outed in London, Canberra and Rome,” and that “foreign governments are now cooperating with the Trump administration to out the rest. ” Does the activity Papadopoulos alleges sound like “spying?” It certainly uses the tools of the trade, and if foreigners were involved what better word is there?
Did partisan agencies spy on Trump?
We’ve been down this rhetorical road before. In May 2018 when reports surfaced about the FBI using an informant to target Papadopoulos and Page, President Trump made repeated references to a “spy” being planted in his campaign. The New York Times countered that this was not so much spying as an “investigation. ” James Clapper referred to it as “observing. ” Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa called it using an “intelligence source. ” And in this context none of those terms are materially different from what most people understand as spying.
Spygate is more than a semantic debate. The issue is whether high ranking officials in various government agencies abused their power to conduct intelligence gathering on a major party presidential campaign for a political purpose. The attorney general calls that spying. President Trump calls it treason. And when all the evidence is laid bare the American people can call it as they see it.

AOC: Kirstjen Nielsen 'oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history'

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., lambasted Kirstjen Nielsen, saying the outgoing homeland security secretary “oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history.”

"In stealing 1000s of children, deporting their parents,& refusing to provide info for reunification, Sec. Nielsen oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history. Awarding her a lucrative deal or prestigious post is to legitimize+celebrate that abuse," she tweeted on Tuesday.

Ocasio-Cortez's tweet linked to an opinion piece in the New York Times published this week titled, "Cancel Kirstjen Nielsen, her role in terrorizing children should make her a permanent pariah."

"She put babies in cages, traumatized children for life, and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done. She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness, failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families," the op-ed said.

The policy referenced in Ocasio-Cortez's tweet and in the op-ed is an Obama-era homeland security policy that led to the separation of parents and children of migrant families apprehended at the border. The Trump administration continued the policy, resulting in thousands of family separations and prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans. Trump’s wife, first lady Melania Trump, was also against the zero-tolerance approach to illegal immigration that led to families being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump reportedly has been considering resuming family separations, placing pressure on members of his administration to use the policy. According to reports, Nielsen opposed the approach, which played a role in Trump’s decision to push her out.

Nielsen's resignation and other high-level purges directed by the White House, reportedly spearheaded by Miller, have battered the department's leadership and underscored tensions between the Senate and the White House. Some GOP senators, who have been vocal about their support for Nielsen, are worried the shakeup will lead to an unstable and highly politicized department.

Days before Nielsen submitted her resignation on Sunday, a group called Restore Public Trust urged Fortune 500 firms to reject any resumes of Trump immigration aides linked to policies that led to the separation of illegal immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, including Nielsen.

Democratic congresswoman cannot bring herself to say there is a crisis at the border

Texto completo: It is not enough for the anti-Trump Resistance to oppose the Trump administration’s policies. A true resister must also oppose statements of fact, so long as they are uttered by the president.

This adherence to total opposition, even to the point of the absurd, is the only explanation for why Democrats and their allies in the press refuse to concede that there is indeed a crisis at the U.S. southern border.

Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, D-N.M., for example, declined to say Tuesday whether there is an ongoing humanitarian crisis at the border stemming from mass immigration and efforts by U.S. officials to control it. Rather, the congresswoman would say only that lawmakers and immigration officials face some “real challenges,” as if she were discussing an obstacle course.

“So as you mentioned, I grew up along the border, and I’m actually the only member of the Homeland Security Committee that represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border,” the congresswoman said during an appearance on MSNBC. “So I see real challenges we are facing, and those challenges are getting bigger as we see more and more families voluntarily presenting along the border.”

She said the administration’s “lack of initiative” has only exacerbated these so-called challenges.

“For example, we have a bipartisan agreement to increase judges. That was part of the resolution over the shutdown,” she said. “Instead, those immigration judges haven’t been hired. So there are ways we can make our asylum process more efficient that are just being ignored right now.”

MSNBC co-host Willie Geist pressed her for clarification, saying, “So you believe there is a crisis at the border now, it's just that there’s not enough being done about it.”

“I believe that there are real challenges along the border and that we have to work together to address them,” the congresswoman replied.

Sure, Democrats don't want to be seen conceding the point that there is a crisis at the border. But there is a crisis at the border.

As noted elsewhere in the Washington Examiner , more than 50,000 migrants were arrested each month in October, November, and December trying to enter the U.S. illegally, marking an increase from 2017’s monthly average, according to Customs and Border Protection officials.

The number of families illegally crossing the border into the U.S. in recent months has overwhelmed immigration officials with a new kind of “humanitarian crisis,” the New York Times reported in January. At the same time, immigration courts have also been overwhelmed with a backlog of roughly 760,000 cases, the Justice Department reported in January.

“You’ve got a humanitarian crisis, which has created a border security crisis for us, that we’ve been doing this for an awfully long time, and this is all being driven by policy crisis,” Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz of the U.S. Border Patrol said in an interview with CNN this week.

He added, “And until we fix the policy crisis, we’re going to continue to deal with the other two.”

Notice that Ortiz did not use the word “challenges.” He used the word “crisis.”

DOJ watchdog inspecting FBI informant in Trump-Russia investigation

Texto completo: The Justice Department's watchdog is reportedly looking into an FBI informant who was a source for the bureau's Russia investigation during the 2016 election cycle.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigators are asking questions about Stefan Halper, an American professor at Cambridge University, who met with members of President Trump's campaign, according to the New York Times.

Halper was asked by the FBI to collect information on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who was surveilled by the government, and George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI and who agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

But Halper went further and also met with Sam Clovis, a former national co-chairman of the Trump campaign, a move which has prompted concerns about the academic's activities as it's not clear whether the FBI asked him to make contact with Clovis.

Halper's identity as an FBI informant was leaked to the media in May 2018, after which Trump and his allies alleged his campaign was the target of a politically motivated scheme. Trump tweeted the FBI embedding a spy in the 2016 campaign would be the "all time biggest political scandal" if true.

Attorney General William Barr testified before a congressional panel on Tuesday, his first time doing so since Mueller completed his investigation. Barr said he is "reviewing the conduct" of the FBI's initial investigation into the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016.

Barr also testified Horowitz's investigation into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the Justice Department and FBI should be "complete probably in May or June, I am told.”

Last month, Barr provided a four-page summary of Mueller's roughly 400-page report to Congress stating that Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in 2016. Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein agreed there was insufficient evidence to show Trump obstructed justice.

The FBI launched its original Russia investigation in July 2016, two weeks after Page says he met with Halper, and was later wrapped into Mueller's inquiry.

The investigation was prompted by Australian diplomat Alexander Downer informing the FBI that Papadopoulos told him Russia had stolen emails related to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Actress Allison Mack pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges connected to her longtime involvement in NXIVM, a cult-like self-help group in the Albany area whose leader is accused of treating women as sex slaves.
Mack, 36, best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan in the CW's "Smallville, signed a plea agreement late Monday morning in Brooklyn federal court, admitting to two racketeering felonies that could put her behind bars for years when she is sentenced in September.
Mack had been facing seven federal felonies in connection with her role as a high-ranking leader in DOS, a group secretly led by NXIVM co-founder and spiritual leader Keith Raniere that purported to be a women's empowerment sorority.
Federal prosecutors said the DOS group was essentially a sex ring to benefit Raniere, with women known as "slaves" who reported to "masters" who ultimately reported directly to him and were wholly devoted to his teachings.
Mack's plea came the same day jury selection began for the NXIVM trial. Now, three defendants remain, including Raniere and Segram's liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, the group's major funder.
"I believed Keith Raniere's intentions were to help people and I was wrong," Mack said in court, according to The Associated Press.
She added: "I know I can and will be a better person."
Mack accused of recruiting women Prosecutors say Mack was a co-conspirator, recruiting women to join the master-slave group. She reported directly to Raniere.
The women, some of whom were branded with a logo containing Raniere's initials, were presented to him for sex and forced to follow restrictive diets to adhere to his preferred body type, according to prosecutors.
They were also forced to give up collateral — nude photos, family secrets — in order to join the group. DOS leaders threatened to release the information if the women publicly revealed the group's existence, prosecutors claim.
Mack's plea deal Monday had her admit to using the threat of extortion to force lower-level DOS members to give up their personal collateral and forcing a woman (identified only as a Jane Doe) to perform manual labor under threat.
Under the agreement, five charges were dismissed, including three related to sex trafficking.
She faces up to 40 years in prison when she is sentenced Sept. 11, though sentencing guidelines will likely call for less than the maximum.
Trial set to begin for remaining defendants In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have acknowledged in court that Mack and some of her co-defendants had been engaged in plea negotiations.
Nancy Salzman, NXIVM co-founder and president, pleaded guilty last month to one count of racketeering conspiracy, confessing to stealing email addresses and passwords of NXIVM critics and altering a tape used in a lawsuit against one.
Her daughter, Lauren Salzman, also pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy last month.
With Mack's expected plea, three defendants remain: Raniere, Bronfman and Kathy Russell, a NXIVM bookkeeper.
Raniere, 58, attended high school in Suffern, Rockland County, before moving to the Albany area to attend the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
He gained a devoted following through NXIVM, which taught expensive self-help classes that were based on Raniere's teachings.
But Raniere's critics — including former girlfriend Toni Natalie of the Rochester area, who has spoken out publicly against him for years — have long accused NXIVM of operating like a cult, aggressively suing former members who went on to criticize the group.
Federal prosecutors got involved after Sarah Edmondson, an actress from Vancouver, went public in an account in The New York Times with news that women in DOS, the secret sorority, had been branded on their pubic region with Raniere's initials.
The account also detailed "Dynasty" star Catherine Oxenberg's fight to rescue her daughter from the group.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award at a ceremony next month, the Kennedy Library Foundation announced Sunday.
The California Democrat is being recognized for leading "with strength, integrity, and grace under pressure — using her power to protect the most vulnerable of our citizens," former ambassador Caroline Kennedy, the foundation's honorary president, said in a statement.
"She is the most important woman in American political history and is a true Profile in Courage," Kennedy said.
The award, created in 1989, is among the most prestigious in politics. It is meant to identify heirs to the people profiled by President John Kennedy in his 1957 book, "Profiles in Courage."
Winners are chosen each year by a bipartisan committee of political, business, and academic leaders. Previous recipients include the late senator John McCain of Arizona and former presidents Barack Obama, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. Bush.
In announcing this year's award, the foundation cited Pelosi's work spearheading the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democrats' subsequent loss of the House, and Pelosi's "persistence and determination as she set out to rebuild the Democratic Party in the image of America" and eventually reclaim the speakership last year.
Pelosi called the award "a powerful testament to the extraordinary legacy and leadership of President Kennedy."
Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg, the foundation's president and a grandson of the late president, will present the award to Pelosi at a ceremony May 19 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.

Democratic campaign arm nears war with liberals
The House Democratic campaign arm is nearing open warfare with the party's rising liberal wing as political operatives close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to shut down primary challenges before what is likely to be a hard-fought campaign next year to preserve the party's shaky majority.
Progressive Democrats were infuriated last month when Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois — the chairwoman of the campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — moved to protect centrist incumbents by formally breaking committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who go to work for primary challengers.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who owes her seat to a successful primary challenge, went so far as to encourage her 3.8 million Twitter followers to “pause" their donations to the campaign committee in protest. She also started a fund-raising push on her official Twitter account for Representatives Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Katie Hill of California, and Mike Levin of California. That initiative, Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter, raised $30,000 in roughly two hours. She also helped raise money for Representatives Katie Porter of California and Lauren Underwood of Illinois.
The open hostilities are just the latest in the rising tensions between an experienced party establishment focusing on what is possible in the short run and a group of young liberals chafing at such restraint. House Democrats have divided over single-payer “Medicare for All" versus incremental legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and over Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal versus less ambitious climate change policies. Liberal Democrats and more moderate newcomers from Republican-leaning districts have fought over Republican procedural motions.
And divisions on health care, climate change, military spending, and tax policy persuaded the House Budget Committee chairman, John Yarmuth of Kentucky, last week to give up on drafting a budget that would have laid down a broad legislative agenda for the new Democrat-controlled House.
Now that tension has migrated to the mechanics of the 2020 campaign.

Booker raises $5 million in first quarter of 2020 race
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced on Sunday that his presidential campaign had raised more than $5 million in the first quarter of the year.
Booker's total is among the smallest fund-raising figures to be voluntarily disclosed so far by a Democratic candidate, though it is still expected to outpace others; nearly a dozen candidates have yet to announce their first-quarter numbers.
Six candidates have released their totals: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he raised $18.2 million; Senator Kamala Harris of California raised more than $12 million; former representative Beto O'Rourke raised $9.4 million; and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., raised $7 million. Booker outpaced only political newcomer Andrew Yang, who said he raised $1.7 million.
In addition to the money he raised, Booker has $4.1 million in his Senate campaign account that he is eligible to transfer to a presidential campaign.
Booker declined to disclose how many people had contributed to his campaign or the number of contributions he received.
The full fund-raising reports are due on April 15.

Larry Kudlow calls criticisms of Moore and Cain 'unfair'
President Trump "stands behind" Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, his picks for two open seats on the Federal Reserve Board, the top White House economic adviser said.
Criticism of the pair for being insufficiently qualified or too partisan for the independent central bank is "unfair," said Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." Moore and Cain, if confirmed, would represent Trump's view that economic growth is not, by nature, inflationary, he said.
Kudlow didn't directly call for a change in Fed interest rate policy, as he and Trump have done recently.

Don't buy Dems' lies on health

Texto completo: "If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we'll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare," President Donald Trump pledged Wednesday. Democrats and their media toadies attacked, claiming Trump will sucker-punch consumers with "junk" plans and abandon people with preexisting conditions - even cause about 20 million Americans to lose coverage, as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman warns.
These claims are lies.
Trump said the plan will be released after the 2020 election, but White House health experts have already put out reports suggesting what it will look like. The key pieces are a special fund for people with preexisting conditions, lower-cost plans and Medicaid reform.
The Trump administration wants to protect people with preexisting conditions by duplicating nationwide what several states have done to fund coverage for the sick separately.
A tiny 5% of the population consumes nearly 50% of the healthcare. Forcing consumers to pay the same for insurance regardless of health status, as Obamacare does, is extortion. Actuarial experts explain that's why Obamacare premiums have almost tripled since 2013.
When healthy consumers in Alaska rebelled against skyrocketing premiums, the state set up a separate fund to pay the costs of seriously ill Alaskans out of general revenue. Premiums dropped 22% overall and 39% for bronze plans. Now, other states are experiencing similar success.
Coverage for chronically ill people in the individual market will cost about $20 billion a year, less than half the $55 billion spent subsidizing people to overpay for Obamacare. The remaining funds will be sufficient to subsidize premiums in the individual market, which will be substantially lower.
A February report from Trump's Council of Economic Advisers proposes this remedy. Democrats claim Obamacare is the only way to cover preexisting conditions. It's just the unfairest way.
Trump's reform will also slash premiums by liberating consumers from plans loaded with items Obamacare mandates, such as pediatric dental care (even if you don't have kids) or maternity coverage (even if you're 50). Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ardently defends these mandates, warning insurance with fewer benefits is "junk" and insisting consumers need protection.
Look who's actually being protected: the insurance companies, who helped write Obamacare. Mandated benefits are their profit protection.
The Trump administration is trying to circumvent Obamacare's insurance rules and enable consumers to buy low-cost options such as short-term plans and association plans. But House Democrats just introduced a bill outlawing these options, which the Congressional Budget Office predicts some 6 million buyers will prefer within three years.
Critics claim Trump's reforms will cause millions to become uninsured. Here are the facts: Of the 20 million newly covered because of Obamacare, three-quarters went on Medicaid, not private health plans. Medicaid was originally meant for low-income women with children and the disabled. The health law added millions of able-bodied childless adults.
The administration wants able-bodied recipients to work. A shocking 40% don't - even part time. The administration already backs state efforts to discourage freeloading and a Trump replacement plan should make it nationwide. Healthy Medicaid recipients would be required to work, attend school, care for family or volunteer. In short, get off the couch.
Why should taxpayers support healthy people who refuse to work, when jobs are plentiful?
Trump's reforms will enable millions priced out of Obamacare to buy insurance, while protecting people with preexisting conditions and getting the scammers out of Medicaid.

Texto completo: Wyatt Cenac's late-night show returns to HBO. And Brie Larson's directorial debut hits Netflix.
What's on TV
WYATT CENAC'S PROBLEM AREAS 11 p.m. on HBO. The first season of this late-night show from Wyatt Cenac, an alum of "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart," had a bevy of idiosyncrasies that helped it stand out: There was no studio audience. No laugh tracks. Cenac presented each episode from a groovy '70s set. And the season repeatedly returned to an overarching topic: police reform and misconduct. The second season shifts its focus to education issues. In the footsteps of Cenac's fellow "Daily Show" graduate-turned-HBO-presenter, John Oliver (also an executive producer of "Problem Areas"), "Problem Areas" mixes commentary with field pieces. Not following in the footsteps of most late-night hosts: Cenac's more casual style, which extends to both his demeanor and dress. "If the idea of my show is to be a little more curious about things, it felt like stepping away from that newsy look would be key," Cenac told The New York Times last year. "I don't know if I convey that same sort of gravitas. For me, it was like, lean into what you are, which is a sleep-eyed guy who rambles."
What's Streaming
UNICORN STORE (2019) Stream on Netflix. There's a scene late in this surreal comedy -- the directorial debut of Brie Larson -- in which a corporate meeting room is blasted with confetti. The movie, filled with rainbows -- and tension over some of the more poisonous and humorless elements of adult life -- is a bit like that explosion. Larson (who also stars in this) plays Kit, a young creative whose childhood passion for rainbows and unicorns has turned into an adult passion for the same things. She drops out of art school after her artwork fails to impress. Just when she takes a temp job and begins to question her passions, Kit receives a mysterious invitation to visit a store whose proprietor (Samuel L. Jackson) informs Kit that he can procure a unicorn for her.
THE TICK Stream on Amazon. Fans of the joke-making superheroes of "Guardians of the Galaxy" and "Deadpool" will feel at home in this comic-book spoof, which is based on a beloved cult character created by the cartoonist Ben Edlund. The first season ripped its story from a 2001 cult TV show of the same name, infusing the character with an Amazon budget and a smiley performance from Peter Serafinowicz. Season 2, beginning on Friday, promises to bring back some of the series' many strange heroes and villains.
OUR PLANET Stream on Netflix. Thanks to "Planet Earth" and "Blue Planet," David Attenborough's voice will be forever linked to footage of the great outdoors. In "Our Planet," the latest nature series with Attenborough at the helm, that familiar voice both stands in awe of nature and leans in hard with a message: The wonders onscreen are imperiled by humans.

We had one disastrous war in the Middle East. Don’t start a new war with Iran.

Texto completo: March 20 marked the 16th anniversary of the start of the Iraq War. It’s an appropriate time to remember the value of diplomacy in advancing America’s national security interests. And there is no better example of smart diplomacy than the Iran nuclear agreement, which blocked Iran’s paths to a nuclear bomb without putting a single American life in harm’s way.
As a former technical sergeant with the United States Air Force and recipient of the Nuclear Deterrence Operations Service Medal, I fully appreciate the gravity of what a nuclear Iran could mean. I also have no desire to see American service members needlessly put in danger. The Iran deal exemplified the critical role and brilliance of our nation’s diplomatic arm.
President Donald Trump intentionally violated the Iran deal by reimposing unilateral sanctions, even though Iran is complying. Trump’s careless violation of our obligations risks unraveling the very deal so many fought to create. The next president should reverse this reckless decision and re-enter the Iran agreement, for American security and the security of our allies.
12 years to negotiate
The nuclear deal was a triumph of international diplomacy. It took the U.S., Great Britain, France and Germany 12 years to negotiate. The sobering reality is that before the deal was signed in 2015, Iran was on the brink of a nuclear bomb. The U.S. and allies imposed severe economic sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table and convinced Iran to end its dangerous nuclear activities. In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran submitted to the most intensive monitoring regime ever negotiated, ensuring that its nuclear activities remain peaceful. The relief of sanctions was our international promise that Trump is intent on breaking.
Trump, claiming Iran was not complying, reimposed nuclear sanctions, violating our commitment under the agreement. However, the president’s claims have no basis in reality. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel recently testified to Congress that Iran is not conducting nuclear weapons work. This assessment is shared by the Israeli intelligence community and by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has inspectors on the ground in Iran’s nuclear facilities.
The only person who shares the president’s conviction is his national security adviser, John Bolton. Yet Bolton is hardly a credible source. As the top arms control analyst for President George W. Bush, Bolton advocated for the Iraq war, claiming Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and ignoring evidence to the contrary. Bolton supported the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran agreement and now claims that Iran “continues to seek nuclear weapons,” despite clear evidence that Iran is complying. Bolton’s claims about Iran do not reflect the facts, but they do reflect his role in the Iraq war and his advice, laid out in a New York Times op-ed, “to stop Iran’s bomb, bomb Iran.” We should not let a warmonger lie to us (again) and undermine 12 years of courageous work.
A reckless and dangerous decision
Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal was reckless and dangerous. It has severely damaged our relationship with our European allies who helped broker this deal. The U.S. role as a global leader is not based solely in our military might but in our economic influence and in our ability to conduct diplomacy with democratic allies in Western Europe. By withdrawing from the Iran deal and threatening to sanction our allies if they do not do the same, the Trump administration has undercut both our economic and our diplomatic relationships.
Trump once sent a bizarre, all caps tweet threatening Iran with “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.” As Sen. Amy Klobuchar says, “our front line troops, diplomats and intelligence officers … who are out there every day risking their lives for us … deserve better than foreign policy by Tweet.” She is absolutely right.
The Trump administration’s disdain for diplomacy and over-reliance on crude military force has damaged America’s standing on the global state. We cannot and we must not bludgeon our way through foreign policy. We need the next president to restore our role as a world leader, trusted partner and committed advocate for diplomacy and democracy. Klobuchar has already taken a good step by committing to the climate accord — and I applaud her for that. As her constituent, I urge her to take the next crucial step of committing to rejoin the nuclear agreement. Not only is it the right choice for America and for our allies, it is the only choice that keeps our nation safe from a nuclear threat from Iran.

Who is this guy?
You're supposed to be able to tell something about a man from looking over his books. But I can't make this guy out. We are told the owner of the house we have rented in a Swiss village is French and spends only a few weeks a year here. That suggests he is immensely wealthy, but the fact that he finds it convenient to rent out his house suggests that he is not illimitably wealthy. He has good taste: Everything is just so. There isn't anything in the house—I know I am supposed to call it a "chalet," but that feels a little precious—to compete with the views of the Alps.
Except the books. A different kind of man might have gone with books-by-the-yard (by the mètre?), hidebound and stately and not intended for reading. But this guy has real books. With the exception of a few French titles, they are almost all in English and evince a deep, curious, respectful and very un-French interest in the minds and doings of les Anglo-Saxons.
He's not a young man. Here is a midcentury mind: "Caen: Anvil of Victory," dictators, inflation, Bertrand Russell, psychoanalysis, the Cold War. Two subjects are splendidly overrepresented: diplomacy and its fraternal twin, espionage. If this gentleman has one biography on a subject, he has four of them—a completist and an obsessive with an interest in intelligence, treachery and high affairs of state. There are a half-dozen books by and about Henry Kissinger, as well as biographies of Talleyrand, Lloyd George, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. There are five books about the Cambridge spies Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt, and a big pile of Graham Greene novels.
So a diplomat or a spook maybe? Maybe. But not an amoralist. His library contains an entire shelf of Isaiah Berlin, C.S. Lewis's collected essays, Dietrich Bonhoeffer's prison letters and "Ethics," and a good selection of and on Orwell and Tolstoy. No Machiavelli.
On money, which he must think about a little: Two biographies of John Maynard Keynes and one of Morgan, Ron Chernow's "The House of Morgan," books on financial panics, and "Understanding Finance." Also: "Do You Sincerely Want To Be Rich?" I think that one worked out for my friend, given the view.
Fiction is segregated in a loft, with low chairs and a reading lamp in the shape of a St. Bernard dog with a keg of brandy around his neck. (We are near the St. Bernard pass.) There's middlebrow ephemera (John Grisham) but mostly those wonderful old Penguin paperbacks with the orange covers—a wall of these looks like happiness to me—and you could spend a year contentedly reading through them: "The Dean's December," "Wide Sargasso Sea," "A Writer's Notebook," "Friends and Heroes," "A House for Mr. Biswas" and many more.
Books on three walls, and a picture window with a view of mountains covers the fourth. A paraskier comes over a peak in the distance. Madness. I know where I belong in this scene: right here.
The mystery man's life has many peculiar pleasures and eccentricities. At some point, he felt compelled to acquire a biography of the barrister Gilbert Beyfus, who represented Liberace and specialized in salacious divorce and slander cases. Down the shelf from that are two copies of "Solti on Solti" (some of us keep two or three copies of certain books in case one needs to be loaned out), Pablo Casals's "Joys and Sorrows," and David Cecil on Max Beerbohm.
I imagine for myself a comfortable exile here among these books. The great men of every generation have rejoiced in the entanglements of their times and in the passions and excitations of public affairs. I have no aspirations of that sort. Maybe it is laziness in me, or even cowardice, but I am at the moment tired of my country, its people, their rages and ecstasies, their talk. That I don't speak the language here is a relief: Strangers' conversations are to me human Muzak in French, and they intrude on my attention no more than does a Carla Bruni song.
If I had the means, I would buy the house and everything in it—especially the books. (I might take a pass on his paintings.) For the moment, that is not an option. I know I should go and read those books instructing me how to realize my sincere desire to be rich.
But I also know that I am going to sit down with a Saul Bellow novel I'll be reading for the fourth time. I open "The Dean's December" and am treated to a clipping from the May 8, 1984, edition of the New York Times, "The axeman melloweth" by D.J.R. Bruckner, distinguished veteran of Richard Nixon's enemies list—an interview with Saul Bellow occasioned by "The Dean's December." Bellow is partly at odds with himself: "How could I be anything but a dissenter?" he asks. But also: "I am getting rid of the melioristic and reforming side of myself. Like many American writers, I was always pulling for something. I wanted to add my mite to the general improvement fund. But I am much less concerned now. I have done my duty by democracy."
It is impossible for me to fault that sentiment. I am sure my host did his duty, too—affairs of state, cloak-and-dagger, whatever. And the prospect of doing one's duty from this room, among these books, under these mountains—that doesn't seem like duty at all.
Who is this guy? I don't know. But I do wonder what he's reading now.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a two-minute video released Wednesday, defended past behavior of close contact with women that has come under recent scrutiny, but also said he's able to change.
The response from Biden, who is laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run, came a day after two more women shared stories of encounters with him that they alleged were inappropriate. Their comments followed similar complaints from two other women.
"I want to talk about gestures of support that I've made to women and some men that have made them uncomfortable," Biden said, seated on a couch and speaking directly to the camera. "I've always tried to make a human connection that's my responsibility, I think ... it's the way I've always been, it's the way I try to show I care about them and listening."
Biden continued, saying he is going to be "mindful" of people's boundaries going forward.
"The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. I get it, I get it, I hear what they're saying and I understand it," he said. "I'll be much more mindful, that's my responsibility, and I'll meet it."
Biden stopped short of apologizing for his past behavior, instead circling back to his previous defense that politics is about human connection.
Questions about Biden's behavior with women have flared since last Friday when Lucy Flores, a politician in Nevada, shared her first-person account of an alleged incident with Biden at a campaign event when she claims he kissed the back of her head.
Since then, Amy Lappos alleged Biden rubbed noses with her at a fundraiser, and on Tuesday The New York Times published stories of two more women who allege Biden touched them in ways that they say were not appropriate.
Biden's propensity for being affectionate, once brushed off as "Biden being Biden" is now being viewed through a #MeToo lens, and it could prove problematic for his expected presidential run.
But Biden's defenders point to his work sponsoring the Violence Against Women Act and combating sexual assault on campus as examples of how he's led on these issues throughout his career.

Elon Musk’s compensation at least 40,000 times more than median Tesla worker

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Texto completo: Pushing penalty is warranted
Good for Judge Darvin Zimmerman for imposing a two-day jail sentence (“Woman sentenced in viral Moulton Falls bridge-shoving incident,” March 27) rather than agreeing to the recommendation of no jail time for Tay'Lor Smith for pushing Jordan Holgerson off the Moulton Falls bridge. Her egregious action in causing serious injuries to Holgerson warranted such a disposition of the matter.
Now, if only the Chicago prosecutor could get their act together regarding the Jussie Smollett case.

Fracked gas is destructive
Do you know that the fossil fuel industry is trying to build massive fracked gas projects in our state? These include a Liquefied Natural Gas facility in Tacoma, and the world's largest fracked gas-to-methanol refinery in Kalama, right along the banks of the Columbia River. If built, the Kalama methanol refinery would become the state's largest climate polluter by 2025.
Ending the use of fracked gas is the next big climate fight. The process of fracking involves injecting toxic chemicals into the earth, which can leak into the groundwater and contaminate our drinking water, endangering our health. After extraction, fracking continues to be deadly and environmentally damaging — from pipeline explosions to the greenhouse gases produced by transporting and burning it. Fracked gas is destructive from extraction to consumption.
Gov. Jay Inslee has championed policies to limit climate pollution and promote clean energy, but he has yet to publicly oppose fracked gas infrastructure projects proposed for the state. He needs to hear from you.

Support organ transplants
The Children's Organ Transplant Association has been removing the financial barriers for families facing transplants for more than three decades. Right here in Vancouver, a group of caring and committed volunteers are working hard to do just that for the Bolster-Samples family.
Jade Samples, age 18, waits for a kidney transplant. Samples' family has turned to COTA for assistance, support and guidance. COTA funds help with expenses such as food and lodging while the family is at the transplant center; transportation to and from the transplant center; co-pays, deductibles and medications, and assistance with household expenses while a parent is out of work during the time of the transplant. All of these expenses add up quickly and can stand in the way of a child receiving a life-saving transplant. Transplant-related expenses last a lifetime due to anti-rejection medications, follow-up visits and sometimes another transplant.
You can help.
April is National Donate Life Month. Every day, 20 people die waiting for an organ transplant in the United States. One organ donor can save eight lives. Jade Samples needs you to go to www.RegisterMe.org and sign up to be a designated organ and/or tissue donor, and to support COTA in honor of her at www.COTAforJadeS.com.

New parking meters don't add up
The State of the City 2019 annual report highlights that Vancouver's Parking Services replaced coin-only parking meters with pay stations as one of 12 major accomplishments. Define accomplishment.
I prefer supporting local businesses. It is actually easier for me to drive through the Starbucks lane on Jantzen Beach or stop at a different coffee shop in Northeast Portland to get my morning coffee on the way to work. But I'd rather support our local Compass Coffee downtown by picking up a cup to go.
In order to support them, I have to park on the street, walk to the pay station midblock, obtain a parking receipt, walk back to my car to place said receipt on the dash, and then go into Compass for my coffee. This adds time and hassle. When in a rush, I've been known to skip the pay station and get my cup to go. In that 5-minute span I've been both warned and ticketed. A $37 cup of coffee isn't worth it.
I understand the city's desire for parking meter revenue. But at the expense of supporting downtown businesses? Are the pay stations hindering greater tax revenue on business sales with the short-sighted parking revenue?

Nobody believes tired drivel
The mainstream media in America has zero credibility. We've all known it for a while, but the breathless hyping of Trump/Russia collusion, the non-stop reckless accusations, the deliberate spreading of unverified malevolent gossip has exposed the mainstream media for the left-wing propagandists that they are. The New York Times, The Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, please just go away, or at least write your op-eds in the comic section where they belong.
How many times do we have to be subjected to “so called” journalism that claims Brett Kavanaugh is an unrepentant rapist, Nicholas Sandmann “smirks” at Native Americans because he has a MAGA hat on, and Jussie Smollett was just beaten up by white supremacists. Just stop. Nobody believes your tired drivel anymore. Thank god for Trump and the courage he has to do what's best for America when so many others slither in their swamp.

Inattentive or simply evil?
Illegal immigration is not the core problem. It is a symptom of the much deeper problem of regional instability caused by failed American attempts at “democratization” exacerbated by a failed war on drugs in Central and South America.
We Americans trained and armed rebels then set them loose on their own people. America needs to take responsibility. We need to love our neighbor as ourselves. If Americans are not ashamed of the despicable way we treat our neighbors and their children, then we are either not paying attention or are simply evil.

Pushing tech companies to get beyond the straight and narrow

Texto completo: The technology sector doesn't have the best track record when it comes to the treatment of people who aren't straight white men.
Uber settled a lawsuit last year over allegations that women and minorities employed by the ride-service company faced harassment and discrimination. Last fall, The New York Times reported that Google protected three executives accused of sexual misconduct, prompting a nationwide walkout by employees.
By contrast, there hasn't been much research and reporting on what the sector is like for members of the LGBTQ community, especially those who identify as transgender, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming. But the anecdotal evidence is discouraging.
“If you think being a woman in tech is hard, try being nonbinary in tech," Lianna Newman, a software engineer in Washington, D.C., said.
Newman, who identifies as nonbinary and does not use pronouns, described workplaces that were uninviting or outright hostile to nonbinary people.
But there are efforts to make the sector more inclusive of those who don't adhere to strict gender norms both in the United States and elsewhere. Some of that work is happening in Boston.
A recent hackathon billed as TechTogether Boston drew about 600 participants to Boston University's Agganis Arena. In 2018, the first year the event was held, it was called SheHacks, and marketed heavily toward women. This year, organizers opted to remove “she" from the name and promote the event to equally to women and nonbinary people.
“We did have a very long conversation about what our policies are, how can we make the event more inclusive," founder Fiona Whittington said. Ultimately, organizers decided “she" was not representative of all of the people they wanted to feel welcome.
Logistics were also taken into account. This year's event had gender-neutral bathrooms; last year's didn't.
“It was just a natural change," said Gefen Skolnick, another organizer who worked on the event. “We allow anyone to come to the hackathon, but we want to make it feel like you are welcome. It's the difference between telling someone you can be somewhere versus making them feel like they can be somewhere."
TechTogether isn't the only event trying to carve out a space for transgender people in tech.
Last year, a conference held in England called Non-Binary In Tech welcomed nonbinary people who were interested in the tech scene, while a summit held last March in San Francisco, called Transform Tech, focused on ways to make the sector more inclusive for transgender people. And an event called HackHer413 billed itself as the first hackathon in Western Massachusetts exclusively for women and nonbinary people.
Anuva Kalawar, communications manager for the international advocacy group Out in Tech said efforts to make tech more inclusive largely originate with transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming activists.
“This kind of organizing has happened for a number of years," Kalawar, who identifies as transgender and nonbinary, said. “I think it's having a ripple effect in more spaces as trans rights become more and more discussed and more and more known in the public."
As an example, Kalawar cited an entrepreneurship panel for transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people put together by Out in Tech at Google in Washington, D.C.
Newman, the software engineer, heads the organization's D.C. chapter and participated in that panel. Newman said it provided attendees with a better idea of how to navigate the workplace and the tech sector at large.
“A lot of people appreciated it," Newman said.
Retention can prove challenging in an industry that has a reputation for being unwelcoming to outsiders, according to Michelle Glauser, founder of the nonprofit Techtonica, which provides training and job-placement services for women and nonbinary people in the San Francisco Bay Area. Glauser said her organization also runs inclusion workshops for employers.
“We don't want our graduates running away screaming from tech, because that happens a lot with underrepresented people in tech," she said. “They end up leaving just because it doesn't feel worth their emotional health to stay."
Newman's experiences seem to reflect that.
“I love tech. I love the work that I do," Newman said. “But I haven't really been able to focus on it, honestly."
But even though the industry remains a challenging place for nonbinary, transgender, and gender nonconforming people, Out In Tech's Kalawar believes advocacy and activist groups are making a difference.
“We're going to see the industry change, but [tech companies] need support from advocacy groups," they said.

Texto completo: Conor McGregor announced his retirement on Twitter last week, but the former UFC champ is still looking to pick a fight.
“I've decided to challenge Hollywood actress Mark Walhberg [sic] next," McGregor tweeted Saturday night, whiffing on both the actor's name and gender. “A fight for all the shares!"
Why McGregor, who, according to The New York Times, is under investigation in Ireland for alleged sexual assault, chose to challenge Wahlberg is unclear. But the “shares" he mentioned seem to refer to Mark Wahlberg 's partial ownership stake in the Ultimate Fighting Championship empire.
Back in 2016, Wahlberg told TMZ he might be willing to sell the mixed martial arts fighter a piece of his stake if McGregor “cut the check." But by June 2018, Wahlberg told TMZ Sports there was no deal on the table.
“I need my piece" of the UFC, Marky Mark said, before sliding into his white Rolls Royce.
As of Monday afternoon, Wahlberg had yet to respond to McGregor's tweet.
One Twitter user advised McGregor to watch the 2005 film “Four Brothers" — in which Wahlberg plays a vengeful son — and take back the challenge.
“I'll smack him and his 4 brothers around," McGregor replied. “It wouldn't be the first crew of brothers i've smacked around. Check the history books. The UFC history books." JENNI TODD

I always want to be eating meatballs at Anchovies

Texto completo: God knows I love a restaurant where the pasta is made from hand-milled flour and the service is as polished as the decor and I feel like maybe I'm in Italy, not Boston at all. But then I also love a restaurant — I probably love this restaurant even more — that has been around forever, that has a crowded bar and eccentric regulars and dark wood booths bathed in the glow of the fruit-themed stained-glass lights overhead.
I always want to be eating meatballs at Anchovies.
At this South End institution (it's impossible to write about the place without using that phrase), the drinks are strong, the food is laced with garlic and ladled with marinara, and each main course comes with an old-school house salad on the side. There are always specials — a lasagna of the night, maybe made with ground beef and spinach; baked ziti with chicken, hot sausage, smoked mozzarella, and an array of vegetables. You could order an appetizer of burrata with tomatoes and basil, or a chopped salad, but let's be honest: Your table is going to want the Italian nachos, a pile of crisp corn chips topped with braised short-rib ragu, ricotta, and pepperoncini. It's a comical cultural adaptation, and it's delicious.
The linguine with meatballs and the chicken parm offer a satisfaction so predictable it's soothing, but there are also sleeper hits on the menu. A friend ordered the chicken marsala with penne recently, and I silently doubted this decision, and then it came and it was also satisfying. You can get linguine with littlenecks either in a white wine and garlic butter sauce or with marinara, and there is no wrong choice; the steaming bowl arrives with another bowl plonked on top of the pasta, to be removed and used as a receptacle for the shells. The food here is both better than it has to be and not so good that it distracts you from the business of having some drinks and being with your people.
Those people might be anyone. There are customers of all social stations and ages, sports bros and students and gay couples and townies. The kitchen is open until 1:30 a.m., and the later it gets, the more it feels like bizarro world Cheers, the brick walls hung with taxidermy, old signs, and assorted bric-a-brac. There's always a crush of regulars at the ornately carved mahogany bar. “Oh my God! You should have called me. I would have reserved a seat for you," a bartender says to someone trying to squeeze in. I spot a woman I once did jury duty with at a table with her entire extended family, multiple generations having dinner together. I brought my son here when he was a toddler. Anchovies was my friends' regular date night going back decades . They came for the dry martinis, and in truth they stayed for the dry martinis, but the reasonably priced food and warm welcome never hurt.
It is nice to be able still to go out for dinner and a beer in the South End for less than $50. All of the entrees here cost $18. For most customers, this probably just seems like a deal. For the Jew pilgrimaging to Anchovies, it is auspicious: In gematria, the Hebrew system of numerology, 18 is significant because it's the sum of the letters that spell “chai," or life; Jews often give gifts or donations in $18 increments. I am entirely willing to pay my bill that way, and to believe that Anchovies is some kind of mystical vortex, where all comers are welcome and time is elastic.
Because they don't make them like this anymore, kiddo. Anchovies feels like the old South End, or an old South End, the one I think of as the real iteration of this neighborhood — a quirkier, gayer place with less money and more artists; the one where I once went to a wild party at a space called the Cloud Club, where Amanda Palmer played in the courtyard garden, and at the top of the building there was a glass dome filled with cushions you could lie on and look out at the surrounding rooftops. This is nostalgia speaking, I know. Ada Calhoun is the author of “St. Marks Is Dead," a history of the New York street she grew up on: “If you're complaining about the East Village, or New York in general, being dead, I think it's worth considering the possibility that, yes, it is over — for you," she once wrote in The New York Times. “But for plenty of others, the city is as full of potential and magic as it was in 1977. Or 1964. Or 1992. Or whenever you last walked down the street and felt like it belonged only to you."
I can still go to Anchovies. I can still go to the Delux. You know what I really miss? Pho Republique. I guess the food was good, but I don't remember it with any clarity — there were ribs we liked, I think? What I remember is that it was dark in there, that what light there was had a reddish cast, that you could be there comfortably even when you didn't want to be seen. It felt like home, and it practically was: At one point I lived in the building overhead, and when I called down for takeout, I felt like Eloise.
Some restaurants, once they're gone, you miss like characters in the story of your life. May Anchovies never disappear. I just couldn't take the meatball-size hole in my heart.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT PROVISION COULD TEST STRENGTH OF THE NRA

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby, has settled on its next target on Capitol Hill: blocking Congress from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, a 1994 law that assists victims of domestic and sexual violence.
The House is set to vote on the legislation this week; the law expired in February. But the bill includes a new provision - aimed at curbing sexual violence by expanding law enforcement's ability to strip domestic abusers of their guns - that the NRA does not like. The measure closes the so-called boyfriend loophole by barring those convicted of abusing, assaulting or stalking a dating partner or those subject to a court restraining order from buying or owning firearms.
Under current federal law, those convicted of domestic abuse can lose their guns if they are - or were formerly - married to their victim, live with their victim, have a child with their victim or are a parent or guardian of their victim. The proposed provision would extend those who can be convicted of domestic abuse to include stalkers and current or former boyfriends or dating partners.
Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the NRA, said that for "many of those 'offenses' - and I'm using air quotes here - the behavior that would qualify as a stalking offense is often not violent or threatening; it involves no personal contact whatsoever." She argues that the new provision is "too broad and ripe for abuse."
"Like if you were sending harassing messages to somebody on Facebook, to somebody you never met or somebody you dated five years ago," she said, adding, "How it's written right now, you could be convicted for a misdemeanor stalking offense for a tweet that causes someone emotional distress and then you would be prohibited from owning a firearm."
Others find the NRA's argument far-fetched. "A single tweet or Facebook message, without significant other conduct, would ordinarily not be enough" to result in a conviction for stalking, said David Keck, director of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms, which provides guidance to law enforcement and governments on implementing firearms prohibitions, but takes no position on the new domestic violence act provision.
And times have changed for the gun lobby. A wave of freshman Democrats in Congress were elected on a promise to enact new gun restrictions, and they proudly campaigned against the NRA
"The No. 1 way that women are being killed with guns is by their beloveds, their boyfriends, their significant others," said one of those freshman Democrats, Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia. "I am not paying attention to the rhetoric of the NRA because I can't be distracted. What's most important is putting forth good legislation to save as many lives as we can." Ms. McBath's son, Jordan Davis, was shot to death in 2012.
Roughly half of all female homicide victims are killed by what experts call "intimate partners" - meaning current or former spouses or dating partners - according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And about half of intimate partner homicides involved dating relationships, according to Mr. Keck.
The "boyfriend loophole" provision, he said, is "a refocus on should we be just looking at domestic partners or should we be looking more broadly at intimate partners?"
Studies also show that domestic abusers with guns inflict a disproportionate amount of violence on their partners, and that the victims are overwhelmingly female. Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun safety group. Roughly three-quarters of all intimate partner murder victims were also victims of stalking by their partners, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime.
"The share of homicides committed by dating partners has been increasing for three decades," said Shannon Watts, who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group that supports tighter gun laws, in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. "Women are now as likely to be killed by dating partners as by spouses with guns."
The reauthorization bill has one Republican co-sponsor, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, is urging Congress to extend the expired law for the rest of the year to continue funding services to survivors at current levels. Ms. Baker, of the NRA, accused Democrats of "playing politics" with the bill by inserting the so-called boyfriend provision as a "poison pill" so that Democrats can portray Republicans who vote against it as anti-woman.
The NRA has decided to "score" the vote on the Violence Against Women Act, meaning it will keep track and publish how lawmakers vote in an effort to either reward or defeat them in the next election. While the move is not likely to keep the bill from passing the House, it does make it more likely that the "boyfriend loophole" provision will be stripped from the act when the measure arrives in the Senate.
"Anybody who votes for this should take the outrage of the NRA and wear it proudly," said Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat of Michigan, who drafted the provision as a separate bill and fought for it to be included in the Violence Against Women Act.

In These Ratings, President Scores High for 'Aggressive' and 'Mean'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has long been focused on measuring his brand, obsessively reviewing television ratings, cataloging his magazine covers and fixating on polls.
But Mr. Trump may not like how his brand is faring in one important metric: his "E-Score," a number compiled by E-Poll Market Research that is not publicly available, but which marketing executives, network television stations and advertisers rely on to figure out which personalities appeal to audiences -- and which do not.
Like the Q Score, which measures the appeal of celebrities, the E-Score calculates awareness and appeal of individuals in the public eye. But it also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes.
In terms of those attributes, Mr. Trump was most often described as "aggressive" (48 percent) and "mean" (38 percent), according to his scores from December that were obtained by The New York Times. He also scored high for being "insincere," "confident" and "creepy." But he scored between 0 and 4 percent for the attributes of "sexy," "impartial," "handsome" and "physically fit."
About 29 percent of people described Mr. Trump as "overexposed." And his overall strong positive appeal is 14 percent, compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 39 percent.
Among adults over the age of 55, Mr. Trump consistently held more positive appeal than among those who are younger. Mr. Trump also consistently held more positive appeal with men than with women, across all age groups.
Marketing, advertising and entertainment executives pay E-Poll Market Research an annual subscription of $17,000 and up to access its database, allowing them to analyze the views of American consumers and assess the marketing effectiveness of each celebrity rated. The company, which has about 10,000 profiles in its database and surveys about 1,100 online participants every week, started tracking Mr. Trump when he was a television personality on "The Apprentice," according to a spokesman, Randy Parker.
"We do not approve of the use of E-Poll's data in this story and cannot confirm or deny the information you were given," he said.
In 2010, during the heyday of "The Apprentice," Mr. Trump's Q Score showed he was more popular with African-American and Hispanic audiences than he was with white audiences, according to "Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and the Nationalist Uprising," by the journalist Joshua Green.
Back then, advertisers viewed Mr. Trump as a symbol of multiculturalism, according to Mr. Green's book. But Mr. Trump no longer has an updated Q Score because he left the entertainment industry; the company Marketing Evaluations stopped tracking him in the winter of 2015.
"He definitely had the profile of a 'love to hate' personality going into the election," said Henry Schafer, executive vice president of the company. "He had one of the lowest positive Q Scores and one of the highest negative Q Scores. It looks like he just continued doing that up until today."
Mr. Schafer said the key to Mr. Trump's success was "extremely high awareness," even if much of it was negative. "You always have a portion of the population that enjoys that kind of reality, and that's his base," he said.
Officials in the Trump White House also receive E-Scores, in part because networks often want to know how those officials are perceived.
Ivanka Trump, the president's elder daughter, has about 70 percent name recognition, compared with 35 percent for her husband, Jared Kushner; 37 percent for Kellyanne Conway, a White House counselor; and 37 percent for Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, in a reminder of the overwhelming celebrity power of her last name. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Conway's scores were from May, while Ms. Trump's and Ms. Sanders's score were compiled in December.
In terms of facial recognition, Ms. Trump scored 47 percent, slightly higher than Ms. Conway and Ms. Sanders, the most public-facing administration officials, who both scored a 32 percent for facial recognition.
Ms. Trump's overall strong positive appeal was 12 percent, compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 21 percent. While Ms. Trump was more disliked than liked among every age group by men and women alike, she consistently had a slight edge with men over women.
Ms. Trump is most popular among adults over the age of 55 and least popular with adults between the ages of 18 and 24.
In a list of attributes that celebrities are graded on, Ms. Trump was most often described as "attractive" (32 percent), "beautiful" (28 percent) and "glamorous" (25 percent). She ranked lowest on "funny" (1 percent), "can identify with" (2 percent) and "exciting" (3 percent).
That was higher than the ratings for Mr. Kushner, whose overall strong positive appeal was 6 percent and whose overall strong negative appeal was 36 percent. Mr. Kushner rarely appears on television and has no social media profile. But he is a constant figure in the news, given his broad portfolios and influence in the White House.
Mr. Kushner scored highest for the attributes of "insincere" (29 percent), "creepy" (27 percent) and "overexposed" (22 percent). He was lowest in terms of "exciting," "glamorous" and "emotional," rating 1 percent in those categories.
Ms. Conway, a regular presence on network and cable television touting Mr. Trump's accomplishments and criticizing the way he is covered, had a strong positive appeal of 9 percent and a strong negative appeal of 43 percent.
Ms. Sanders, who has phased out the regular White House press briefing, which often had contentious back-and-forths with reporters, and is now more often seen in friendlier venues like the morning show "Fox & Friends," ranked somewhat higher, with a strong positive appeal of 19 percent and a strong negative appeal of 28 percent.
The scores show the public views Ms. Sanders as more of an honest broker than Ms. Conway, who became infamous in the administration's early days for coining the phrase "alternative facts."
Ms. Sanders scored 15 percent for "trustworthy," compared with Ms. Conway's 8 percent ranking in the same category. Ms. Conway was described by 31 percent of respondents as "insincere," compared with 27 percent for Ms. Sanders.

Texto completo: CORRECTION APPENDED. FAIRFAX, Va. -- A Virginia judge on Monday temporarily sealed divorce records for Stephen Moore, President Trump's presumptive nominee for the Federal Reserve board, adding to the tax and child-support drama surrounding the pending nomination.
A Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County issued a temporary injunction sealing the 2011 divorce records at the request of Mr. Moore's former wife, Allison Moore. The court order does not list Mr. Moore as opposing the request. The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on the merits of keeping the documents under seal.
Those records, posted online Monday by The Guardian, which first reported details of the divorce, show that a judge found Mr. Moore in contempt of court in March 2013 for failing to pay more than $330,000 in spousal support, child support, attorney's fees and a one-time fee to his ex-wife. Mr. Moore had failed to pay six consecutive months of child support -- and only a small fraction of the nearly $19,000 a month he had agreed to pay his ex-wife in the divorce settlement -- at the time of the ruling.
According to the records, Mr. Moore failed to respond to repeated requests from the Virginia court to make payments and did not show up for a deposition in the case. The court ordered him to sell his home to raise money to pay the debt and forced him to set up an automatic bank transfer each month. After Mr. Moore paid $217,000 toward the debt, Ms. Moore asked the court to revoke the order for Mr. Moore to sell his home, which it did.
The divorce case is the latest twist in the nomination saga of Mr. Moore, who is in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over $75,000 in back taxes, which are related to his child and spousal support payments.
Mr. Trump said last month that he would nominate Mr. Moore, a campaign adviser who, like Mr. Trump, was a loud critic of the Fed's interest rate increases last year. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Moore had not been formally vetted by the White House. The administration has not yet submitted his nomination to the Senate.
In her 2010 divorce complaint, Ms. Moore accused Mr. Moore of "emotional and psychological abuse" during their 20-year marriage, and accused him of carrying on an adulterous relationship that he was "neither discreet nor inconspicuous" about. The complaint said Mr. Moore had left receipts for dinners with his mistress around the house and that he purchased a T-shirt for his lover with the words "Doing It."
In his response, Mr. Moore said he did not contest anything in Ms. Moore's petition.
Neither Mr. Moore nor Ms. Moore responded to repeated requests for comment over the weekend or on Monday.
Mr. Moore is a longtime champion of tax cuts, deregulation and other conservative economic policies. He is a former editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and the founder of the Club for Growth, which advocates lower taxes. He has held shifting positions on monetary policy over the years, including endorsing a return to the gold standard and, when President Barack Obama was in office, criticizing the Fed for leaving interest rates low in an effort to stoke economic growth.
Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Moore has pushed for lower rates. In December, angered by the fourth rate increase of the year, he called for the Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, to step down or be fired.
Mr. Trump has lauded Mr. Moore's views on the Fed, but it is unclear whether he could win Senate confirmation.
Last year, the I.R.S. filed a lien against Mr. Moore related to the $75,000 in back taxes. Mr. Moore, in an interview last week with The New York Times, described that lien as a "huge miscalculation" by the agency.
It is unclear whether the $75,000 tax lien relates to the child- and spousal-support-payment delinquencies laid out by The Guardian.
Mr. Moore said in an interview on Thursday that, for a single tax year, he had claimed both the value of his alimony, which at the time was deductible for all divorces, and the value of his child support payments, which are not. He said the child support amounted to about $18,000, which, given his tax bracket, worked out to about $6,000 in taxes that he owed but did not pay. He blamed the error on his accountant.
But Mr. Moore said he was not simply hit with a back-tax bill. After an audit, he said, the I.R.S. deemed his return for that year "fraudulent" and disallowed other deductions. With penalties and fees, the amount came to more than $75,000, he said.
Mr. Moore said he and his current wife had tried for years to resolve the issue with the I.R.S., including dispute resolution, but had not heard from the agency in nearly two years.
A prominent critic of Mr. Moore's nomination, the University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, said he was deeply troubled that Mr. Moore had been held in contempt of court given that he could soon hold a seat on the Fed.
"For a Fed governor, your credibility is an important asset," Mr. Wolfers said. "Putting someone in a position of trust who has been in contempt of court could easily create difficult situations, particularly in an institution like the Fed, which at least during the crisis had to invent new responses on the fly while making sure they were legal."
White House officials were adopting a wait-and-see approach on Monday before deciding whether to go through with the nomination, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal White House conversations.
Mr. Trump, these people said, remains personally fond of Mr. Moore and values his loyalty, but has been surprised by the criticism of Mr. Moore and the negative reaction among some Senate Republicans, who were angered by Mr. Moore's previous comment that the president should fire Mr. Powell for raising interest rates. Mr. Moore has since apologized for that statement.
Questions have also arisen over Mr. Moore's tenure at The Wall Street Journal, including whether he wrote editorials that referred to groups that paid him to give speeches.
In May 2013, for example, Mr. Moore spoke at the Civitas Institute, a nonprofit conservative research group in North Carolina. He was paid more than $3,000 for an honorarium and expenses, said Brian Balfour, executive vice president for Civitas. The next month, Mr. Moore wrote an editorial about tax cuts in the state and approvingly quoted Civitas's former president. In July, in another editorial criticizing liberal protesters at the state's capital, Mr. Moore cited a Civitas analysis of financial statements from groups supporting the protests.
According to a Journal spokesman, editorial board members are "allowed to accept compensation for speeches from nonprofit organizations if they are approved in advance and do not overlap with the member's coverage area."
Mr. Moore's predicament did not come up during a round of discussions on Monday at the White House between Mr. Trump and his economic team, according to a person familiar with the discussion, who also requested anonymity. The discussions, this person said, were focused on rebooting a repeal of Obamacare and included a presentation by Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, warning against the possible damage to the economy of closing the border with Mexico.
Appearing on CNBC on Monday morning, Mr. Hassett was not asked about the records, but called Mr. Moore "a great guy."
Mr. Hassett suggested that Mr. Moore would likely avoid the public spotlight in coming days.
"When you're getting ready for Senate confirmation, you have to focus 100 percent on that," he said. "I expect that's what we'll see from Steve going forward."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Correction: April 2, 2019, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the Federal Reserve's actions last year with regard to interest rates. It increased rates. It did not cut them.

Hot for hot dogs — BYU students relish the chance to promote wieners as winners

Texto completo: Orem • Hot dogs are in crisis.
Away from the ballpark and next to the hamburger — their flashier fast-food cousin — the frankfurter seems boring and unhealthy.
What the link sausage needs now is a real-life Don Draper who can make the wiener a winner again.
A team of advertising majors from Brigham Young University has accepted the challenge.
And just like the fictional Sterling Cooper agency from the popular “Mad Men” television series — minus the booze and smokes — they have created a multimillion-dollar campaign to help make the hot dog top dog.
The 12-member Provo team is among nearly 200 student groups nationwide that will present campaigns to judges as part of the 2019 National Student Advertising Competition (NSAC).
The contest, sponsored by the American Advertising Federation, gives college students a chance to participate in a real-world case study that will help them find jobs after graduation.
For this year’s contest, the world’s largest hot dog chain, Wienerschnitzel, challenged students to change public perception of the hot dog.
Students conducted consumer focus groups and surveys. They used their research to develop an ad strategy and then put it into action through a yearlong campaign that includes a mix of television and radio spots, billboards and social media.
The students even had an imaginary $25 million budget to work with, said Kevin Kelly, the BYU advertising professor who is overseeing Utah team.
Kelly, along with team members, met with The Salt Lake Tribune at the Orem Wienerschnitzel to talk about the contest while wolfing down hot dogs with various toppings from sauerkraut to bacon.
In previous years, students have helped promote products for large national brands, including Pizza Hut, Kellogg’s, Coca-Cola, Nissan, Yahoo and The New York Times.
But changing perceptions is much more difficult than product promotion, said Kelly. “It’s a strategy that some companies use when they are the leader,” he said. “Lifting the whole category elevates them, too.”
The students had their work cut out for them. Most Americans think hot dogs are made with slimy, low-budget meat trimmings and filled with sodium, fat and nitrates — which, if eaten often, cause health problems.
"They think it’s a processed, mystery meat thing,” explained BYU team member Mitch Horne. "It’s not.”
Unlike the hot dogs of yesterday, he said, many varieties today are made from quality cuts of meat, including 100 percent beef or poultry. They also have lower sodium content.
In some cases, “the hot dog is the same healthwise as a turkey sandwich,” added Nate Blakely.
Nutrition experts may debate that fact.
Wienerschnitzel’s original deluxe dog in a steamed bun — and topped with tomato slices, chopped white onions and a pickle spear — has 290 calories, 14 grams of fat and 11 grams of protein, according to the company’s online nutrition facts.
Subway’s nutritional information shows its six-inch turkey sandwich on wheat bread has 250 calories, 3 grams of fat and 18 grams of protein.
Not surprisingly, the BYU students had the negative image of the hot dog before the NSAC project.
“We had the same perception,” said team member Amy Wilson. After spending hundreds of hours — and consuming dozens of hot dogs, “now we are raving about hot dogs.”
The students wouldn’t divulge details about their campaign. They did say that, in post-testing, people found their ads agreeable and their perceptions changed.
“The competition shows how you can change the culture,” said Izzie Nelson.
That was the case for teammate Sierra Breshears. “After eating that hot dog,” she said, wiping the mustard from her lips, “I really believe in our campaign.”
The teams had to submit their campaign books by the end of March. In April, they will travel to one of 15 regional competitions to sell their plan to judges. BYU will compete in Boulder, Colo., on April 27 against teams from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming.
If the Cougars win, they will move on to the semifinals in May and, if successful, possibly the finals in June.
They have a shot. BYU is known for preparing students for the advertising world. Each year, the school’s AdLab, an agency housed within the College of Fine Arts and Communications, produces campaigns for national clients from Amazon to Nike and brings home numerous college-level awards.
“We’re very successful placing students [in jobs] all over the country,” Kelly said.
BYU’s highest NSAC finish was fifth, but it has won the regional competition several times, said Kelly, including last year, when students created campaigns for Ocean Spray.
All 12 members of BYU’s NSAC troupe are juniors and had to compete against other AdLab students to make the squad.
Philip Lamb, the general manager at the Orem Wienerschnitzel, hopes the students succeed, especially if the attention attracts a younger generation to his restaurant, which is frequented by older adults.
“It’s great to have the exposure and for them to come up with new ideas,” he said, noting that hot dogs aren’t made like they use to be.
“They’re healthy,” he said. “I have one almost every day.”

At 71, She’s Never Felt Pain Or Anxiety. Now Scientists Know Why.

Texto completo: She had been told that childbirth was going to be painful. But as the hours wore on, nothing bothered her - even without an epidural.
“I could feel that my body was changing, but it didn’t hurt me,” recalled Jo Cameron, who is now 71. She likened it to “a tickle.”
Later, she would tell prospective mothers, “Don’t worry, it’s not as bad as people say it is.”
It was only recently - more than four decades later - that she learned her friends were not exaggerating.
Rather, there was something different about the way her body experienced pain: For the most part, it didn’t.
Scientists believe they now understand why. In a paper published Thursday in The British Journal of Anaesthesia, researchers attributed Cameron’s virtually pain-free life to a mutation in a previously unidentified gene. The hope, they said, is that the finding could eventually contribute to the development of a novel pain treatment. They believe this mutation may also be connected to why Cameron has felt little anxiety or fear throughout her life and why her body heals quickly.
“We’ve never come across a patient like this,” said John Wood, the head of the Molecular Nociception Group at University College London.
Scientists have been documenting case studies of individuals who experience little or no pain for nearly 100 years. But the genetic mutation that seems to be responsible for Cameron’s virtual painlessness had not been previously identified.
The study emerged amid major developments in the emotionally charged debate over how to responsibly treat pain. On Thursday, New York state filed one of the most sweeping legal cases yet against the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid OxyContin.
And it was yet another reminder that we need less-addictive alternatives for chronic pain, said Dr. Stephen G. Waxman, a neurologist at Yale and author of “Chasing Men on Fire: The Story of the Search for a Pain Gene.” Waxman was not involved in the recent paper but he also studies people who have rare mutations that alter their experience of pain.
“Each of these mutations teach us something, and point to a particular gene as a potential target for new and more effective pain medications,” he said.
The sequence of events that led scientists to investigate Cameron’s genes began about five years ago. She was living a happy, ordinary life on the banks of Loch Ness in Scotland with her husband, she said. After a hand operation, a doctor seemed perplexed that she was not experiencing any pain and did not want painkillers.
“I guarantee I won’t need anything,” Cameron recalled telling Devjit Srivastava, a consultant in anesthesia and pain medicine at a National Health Service hospital in northern Scotland and one of the authors of the paper.
A few follow-up questions revealed that Cameron was unusual. At 65, she had needed to have her hip replaced. Because it had not caused her pain, she had not noticed anything was amiss until it was severely degenerated. Cuts, burns, fractures - these did not hurt, either. In fact, it often took the smell of burning flesh or her husband identifying blood for her to notice something wrong. She also reported that eating Scotch bonnet chili peppers left only a “pleasant glow.”
Srivastava referred her to University College London’s Molecular Nociception Group, a team focused on genetic approaches to understanding the biology of pain and touch. They had some clues for her. In recent decades, scientists have identified dozens of other people who process pain in unusual ways. But when Dr. James Cox, a senior lecturer with that group and another author of the new paper, inspected her genetic profile, it did not resemble that of others known to live without pain.
Eventually he found what he was looking for on a gene the scientists call FAAH-OUT. All of us have this gene. But in Cameron’s case, “the patient has a deletion that removes the front of the gene,” he said. Additional blood work confirmed this hypothesis, he said.
Cameron said she had been shocked by the interest in her case. Until her conversation with Srivastava, pain was not something she thought about. Perhaps it helped that even though she burned and cut herself quite often, her injuries rarely left scars - something else that scientists believe is connected to the mutation.
A number of articles have been written about parents of children with similar conditions. Many live in fear that without pain, their children won’t learn how to avoid hurting themselves. Her parents never made it an issue, she said. She suspects this may be because she inherited the mutation from her father.
“I can’t remember him needing any painkillers,” she said. “I think that’s why I didn’t find it odd.”
Scientists are also intrigued by Cameron’s extraordinarily low anxiety level. On an anxiety disorder questionnaire, she scored zero out of 21. She cannot recall ever having felt depressed or scared.
“I am very happy,” she said.
The researchers said they would now focus on trying to better understand how FAAH-OUT works so they can design a gene therapy or other pain intervention around it. Turning a discovery of this sort into an actual pain or anxiety treatment requires many steps, many years and many millions of dollars. It’s rare for a product to emerge.
But it’s not unprecedented, Waxman said. As a reminder of how an individual with an unusual genetic makeup can shape the future of medicine, he pointed to statin drugs.
“They were developed largely on the basis and discovery of incredibly rare families where everyone was having heart attacks in their 20s,” he said.
Whether it will be Cameron’s mutation or another individual’s mutation that directs the future of painkillers, it’s too early to say.
“But I’m reasonably confident that the lessons we are learning from the genes involved in pain will lead to the development of an entirely new class of pain medications,” he said.

Texto completo: "I don't think you could really prepare for what happened with that movie. It was such a perfect storm of a streaming platform, a streaming original, a huge movie star and a strange, weird tale."
Josh Malerman
author of 'Bird Box'
Don't look! Josh Malerman is trying to scare us silly again.
Just kidding. You can open your eyes. The metro Detroit author of "Bird Box," which became a Netflix movie and pop-culture sensation in 2018, is simply doing his job by writing stories that hook readers with their chilling setups and shocking twists.
And he's busier now than a blindfolded Sandra Bullock trying to steer a rowboat away from lethal danger.
Malerman's latest psychological thriller, "Inspection," debuted last week. The novel is about 26 young boys, each named for a different letter of the alphabet, who are being raised in an isolated tower by a megalomaniacal figure called D.A.D.
The book's setting is a secluded northern Michigan forest, a shout-out to home that's typical of Malerman, a West Bloomfield High and Michigan State alum who resided for a while in New York City before returning to Oakland County.
Malerman also has a sequel to "Bird Box" coming out in October. Although the details are under wraps, it's titled "Malorie" (aka the character played by Bullock in the "Bird Box" movie).
And that's not counting the two film projects that he'll be producing. On one of them, he'll double as the screenwriter.
So what is life like for Malerman in a post-"Bird Box" world?
"I'm not sure I have wrapped my mind around it," he says, referring to the movie's 80-million household views on Netflix and the immense buzz it earned on social media, late-night TV and other water-cooler places.
Malerman says he was in northern Michigan when "Bird Box" hit the streaming site. The response to the film was so huge that it fueled sales of the 2014 novel and wound up making him a New York Times best-selling novelist.
"I don't think you could really prepare for what happened with that movie. It was such a perfect storm of a streaming platform, a streaming original, a huge movie star and a strange, weird tale. In my more lucid moments, I accept that. ... In other moments, I'm still, 'Wait, what's happened?' "
Rock 'n' roll novelist Malerman, who started writing "Bird Box" back in 2006, had lived with the book for more than a decade by the time the movie arrived (with a screenplay by Eric Heisserer, who wrote "Arrival").
"I can't help but almost feel like 'Bird Box' is a friend of mine that's doing really well and I'm very, very happy for them,'" he says with a laugh.
Malerman's journey as a novelist began with him writing rough drafts for novels and short stories while touring as a singer-songwriter with his Detroit band, the High Strung. His original goal was to complete a whole book. Before "Bird Box" was published in 2014, he had written 14 novels without trying to sell them.
He describes his new book, "Inspection," as a sort of "mad-scientist story" that delves into issues like gender and child development through a plot line that takes the concept of helicopter parenting to insane extremes.
The title comes from the daily ritual that occurs every morning as the boys are examined for signs of strange, unfamiliar diseases.
"I started 'Inspection' to stay in shape. I had just finished another rough draft of a different book. I was like: 'I don't want a lot of time off. I don't want six months to go by and I didn't write anything. So hey, (I'll) keep writing a little,' " recalls Malerman. "It turned out much better than what I had written before it."
"Inspection" has several mysteries to unravel, one of which is the purpose of a dreaded room in the tower called the Corner, where ... well, it's not clear exactly what happens there, but the boys live in fear of it. The possibilities seem as horrific as the unknown creatures in "Bird Box" who are deadly to those who look at them.
Malerman's "Bird Box" follow-up, "Malorie," is set eight years after the end of the first book, and it's pretty much a given that readers will find out more about Malorie and the monstrous beings that plunged global society into chaos. (There's no news to reveal yet about a film adaptation, according to author.)
For the writing of "Malorie," he rented the third floor of a majestic house in Detroit's Boston-Edison neighborhood, the same location where he worked on "Bird Box."
"I wanted to know what this would feel like," he says, describing how he sat at the same desk as the first time.
Next up: Producing Next on Malerman's to-do list is producing movies. He and his manager, Ryan Lewis, have a production company called Spin a Black Yarn. They are working on two projects with Atlas Industries, a production house formed by two Detroit-area filmmakers, Sean O'Grady and Bill Stertz. One of the projects is a film adaptation of "Black Mad Wheel," Malerman's 2017 novel about a Detroit band that becomes involved with a military assignment to track down a menacing sound in the African desert.
As if that workload weren't enough, Malerman staged a theatrical reading from "Inspection" last week in the chapel at Detroit's Masonic Temple. The performers wore papier-mache heads created by his fiancee, Allison Laakko, to portray the characters. The wardrobe and setting brought to life the Body Hall scenes where D.A.D. lectures the boys.
Stay tuned, because there are certain to be more good scares to come.

Texto completo: Don't look! Josh Malerman is trying to scare us silly again.
Just kidding. You can open your eyes. The metro Detroit author of "Bird Box," which became a Netflix movie and pop-culture sensation in 2018, is simply doing his job by writing stories that hook readers with their chilling setups and shocking twists.
And he's busier now than a blindfolded Sandra Bullock trying to steer a rowboat away from lethal danger.
Malerman's latest psychological thriller, "Inspection," debuted last week. The novel is about 26 young boys, each named for a different letter of the alphabet, who are being raised in an isolated tower by a megalomaniacal figure called D.A.D.
The book's setting is a secluded northern Michigan forest, a shout-out to home that's typical of Malerman, a West Bloomfield High and Michigan State alum who resided for a while in New York City before returning to Oakland County.

SULLY A PRESIDENT'S SERVICE DOG NOW SERVES HUNDREDS OF VETERANS

Texto completo: The Dec. 2, 2018, photograph taken in Houston was a stark portrait of sadness: A yellow Labrador retriever lies in front of the flag-covered casket of President George H.W. Bush.
The dog's head was on the floor between his front paws. On his back was a vest identifying him as a service dog.
When the photo ran in newspapers around the world, citizens of a nation grieving the death of the former president were intrigued - and charmed, I think - to learn that President Bush spent the last six months of his life with a dog trained by America's VetDogs (www.vetdogs.org).
There is no doubt that 2-year-old Sully was saddened by the loss of his partner.
"You could see the emotion on Sully's face," said John Miller, president and CEO of America's VetDogs in Smithton, N.Y.
Soon people were falling in love with Sully. His Instagram account @SullyHWBush has 280,000 followers. He received the American Kennel Club's 2019 AKC Paw of Courage Award "in recognition of his loyalty, dedication and distinguished service."
President Bush, a highly decorated World War II Navy aviator, said before he died that he wanted Sully to continue to serve veterans rather than living with any of the many Bush family members who love the dog.
Sully joined the facility dog program at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., as a Navy hospital corpsman second class, bringing comfort and joy to patients and staff. The staff at VetDogs' Long Island breeding and training facility want Sully's fans to know that he is happy and he is loved.
"He is a very resilient dog, and he is now helping hundreds of veterans," Mr. Miller said.
Sully was born July 14, 2016. He lived with a puppy-raising family until November 2017 when he started his training. He was partnered with President Bush in June 2018.
The Bush family loves dogs, and they wanted the former president to have a service dog, said Valerie Cramer, Sully's trainer.
"President Bush was torn about getting a dog. He was concerned that he would be taking a dog away from a veteran who needed and deserved one," she said. "Of course President Bush deserved a dog, and we sent him photos of Sully."
Although veterans pay nothing, it costs $50,000 to train each service dog. People who donate $6,000 get naming rights. A group of Long Island residents who collected many small donations named this one after Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger. They chose that name not because Mr. Sullenberger safely landed a commercial airliner on the Hudson River in 2009, but because he had been an Air Force pilot. It was serendipitous that the dog went to another military pilot.
Sully's Instagram includes a photo of the dog meeting his namesake. There are also images of Sully with President Bush and with former President Bill Clinton.
Many service dogs work at Walter Reed, and none of them are overworked, Ms. Cramer said. Sully goes to the hospital two or three days a week, and each day he has two 90-minute "deployments." In his off-duty hours, he lives like a regular pet with the family of "a valued hospital employee" who was not named for security reasons.
"He has always been an adaptable dog, very relaxed, totally engages with people," Ms. Cramer said. "He is a gentle soul who was perfect for a 94-year-old gentleman."
"Sully's job was to spend 24 hours a day with the president. At night he slept in a dog bed at the foot of the president's bed."
America's VetDogs was created in 2003 by the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind, which was founded in 1946 to meet the needs of soldiers who lost their sight in World War II.
Both organizations place 75-100 dogs with soldiers and veterans each year, Mr. Miller said. The demand for dogs greatly outstrips the supply. The waiting list for a dog is 18-24 months.

Texto completo: Jimmy Butler will have a homecoming that could feature many more boos than cheers.
The 76ers will visit the Timberwolves on Saturday. It will be Butler's first game in Minnesota since he was traded to the Sixers on Nov. 12 with Justin Patton for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a 2022 second-round draft pick.
Last year, in his only full season in Minnesota, Butler helped lead the Timberwolves to their first playoff appearance in 14 years. But Butler, who can opt out of the final year of his contract this summer to become a free agent, didn't endear himself to Timberwolves fans right before the start of this season. Shortly before training camp, he told the team he wanted to be traded.
Butler did play 10 games this season with the Timberwolves before being dealt. A Minnesota team that had such high expectations after last season enters the weekend at 33-41.Earlier this week, he told the New York Times, "They are going to boo me." Then he added, "I would boo me, too."

Letter: Sen. Lee needs to make climate change a bridge issue

Texto completo: For a senator who has demonstrated the admirable ability to work across the aisle, I was surprised to learn about Sen. Lee’s speech mocking the Green New Deal. I was especially puzzled by his proposal to have more babies as his best solution to climate change.
Fortuitously, five days before Lee’s speech, Paul Hawken delivered the keynote address for the Intermountain Sustainability Summit at Weber State University. Mr. Hawken is renowned for his New York Times best-selling book "Drawdown," in which he and 270 of the world’s top scientists identified the 100 most impactful actions to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gasses. They found the seventh most impactful solution to be “family planning.” “Fall in love, get married and have some kids” is nowhere among the 100 actions.
As a member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Sen. Lee is in a position to have a huge influence on climate policy. I ask our senior senator to make climate change a bridge issue, rather than a wedge issue. I want to hear a Senate speech in which he outlines a conservative, science-based policy that addresses climate change. In doing so, he will support the building of healthier, more vibrant and stronger communities.

Texto completo: Maybe Baltimore is not
the best place for Preakness
As a resident of Baltimore County, I am just as passionate about the Preakness Stakes as any citizen of Baltimore City. Naturally, I appreciate and support sincere efforts to keep the Preakness in Baltimore and preferably at Pimlico. Nevertheless, I will not permit my passion for keeping the Preakness in Baltimore to stand in the way of the bold reality of the situation. Namely, neither the city or the state is able, at this point, to offer a viable and/or financially responsible plan to keep the Preakness at Pimlico. The sooner this glaring reality is accepted and understood, the better for Baltimore.
The next best thing to keeping the Preakness in Baltimore is keeping the Preakness in Maryland. However, it appears from various reports by local news outlets that some city politicians have taken the position that if Baltimore cannot have the Preakness, then Maryland cannot have it. Indeed, in spite of this, nature will only extend and prolong the city's suffering and waste precious time that is needed to get the city back on the road to economic recovery and prosperity. Recently, Mayor Catherine Pugh has resorted to initiating personal attacks on track ownership, filing lawsuits and otherwise denying the inevitable.
Rather than resorting to such negative tactics, why not negotiate with track management, in cooperation with the state, so that the state can potentially acquire the Pimlico property and prepare swift and prudent plans to develop the property? It is essential to reinvigorate the surrounding community before even more economic hardship is inflicted upon the west side of Baltimore. There are numerous prospects for the future of the Pimlico property. While the expansion of Sinai Hospital is already being considered, the state and the city should consider Pimlico for the new site of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, expansion and/or relocation of certain departments of the University of Baltimore, and many other opportunities. I urge city lawmakers to replace the negative energy with economic dynamism with the goal of leading the city to a quicker recovery.

Can't believe Pugh
or Trump
I wanted to believe our president when he claimed there was no obstruction. I want to believe our Mayor Catherine Pugh that there was no back door deals with the University of Maryland Medical Center ("Baltimore Mayor Pugh to hold news conference on Healthy Holly book deal 'as soon as possible,'" Mar. 26).
Suffice it to say, I'm sadly disappointed in both after some extensive research, some conducted by The Sun.
I don't know who or what to believe anymore.
Clark Brill
U.S. attorney should investigate Mayor Pugh
Mayor Catherine Pugh has been taking a beating in the media. Is there any wonder why? Could it be she has not been able to get a handle on the crime problem in Baltimore? Could it be that her selection of police commissioners for the Baltimore City Police Department - until now - has proven to be terrible? Could it be she has been unsuccessful in dealing with the city's failing, dysfunctional public school system?
Could it be she got her hand caught in the cookie jar with regard to her children's book deal scheme with the University of Maryland Medical System? Mayor Pugh's reactions and responses to this book-gate scandal are illuminating. She borrows a page from President Donald Trump by calling the investigations into her transaction a "witch hunt." She asserts that she pays her taxes and files everything yet she refuses to provide copies of tax records related to the book deal. She returns $100,000 from the overall amount of $500,000 to the University of Maryland Medical System. If she did no wrong, why is she giving the money back?
Furthermore, the mayor was required to recently amend seven years of ethics forms she filed when she was in the Maryland Senate because her "Healthy Holly" children's book information was not reported. Her defense consists of calling it an error and claiming not to be perfect.
I am calling for the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland to conduct a thorough investigation to determine whether or not Mayor Pugh has engaged in criminal behavior.
Ralph Jaffe, Baltimore
Baltimore needs better leadership
Baltimore needs "The Donald," as in William Donald Schaefer.
National publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times are hurling invective's right and left. The 4 P's - Pugh, Preakness, poverty, and police - are dragging us down. I share the positive thoughts of Toby Bozzuto in The Sun of opening the hidden lotus of Baltimore ("'No mud, no lotus' in Baltimore," Mar. 24).
Spring is barely, summer feels endless, fall is almost, winter is death. The corruption of the best things give rise to the worst. Time for a rebirth.
I still love Baltimore, but enough is enough, we need better local governance.
Blake Goldsmith, Baltimore

Texto completo: The career of children's book illustrator Melissa Sweet of Portland will be celebrated at this year's Carle Honors gala in New York City in September.
Presented by the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Massachusetts, the Carle Honors recognize creative vision and dedication in the field of picture books and children's literature.
The awards celebrate artists, mentors, funders and presenters who bring picture-book art to big audiences. Past recipients include Paul O. Zelinsky, Maurice Sendak and Ashley Bryan.
"It's an august list," Sweet said. "When I got a phone message, I was just speechless. I think the first thing I said was, 'Oh my goodness, I am in really good company here.' "
Her second thought was, "I am just getting started. It's an incredible acknowledgement for a body of work, but you always want to feel the best is yet to come. I am over the moon and grateful."
She has collaborated with writers on numerous projects and illustrated many award-winning books, including Caldecott Honor winners "The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus" and "A River of Words: William Carlos Williams." "A Splash of Red: The Art of Horace Pippin" and "Balloons Over Broadway: The True Story of the Puppeteer of Macy's Parade" - both won Sibert and Orbis Pictus awards. Her New York Times bestseller "Some Writer! The Story of E.B. White" also won an Orbis Pictus Award. In all, she has illustrated more than 100 books.
She is known for her colorful collages, her use of words and text in her art and a playful imagination that presents itself with fun, spirited illustrations that quickly convey emotions and experiences, as well as her willingness to tackle daunting biographical subjects in children's books. Nicholas Clark, founding director of the Eric Carle Museum in Amherst, Massachusetts, called Sweet "the consummate draftsman" with "a wonderful ability to really bring these artists and these authors and these wordsmiths alive in two- and three-dimensional ways."
Clark said there was "virtually no discussion among the committee" about whether Sweet deserved the award. "She has a portfolio that is incontestable."
Other winners this year are Reforma, a national association that promotes literacy among Latinos; the Chihiro Art Museum in Tokyo, which is dedicated to illustrations for children's books; and David Saylor, an executive with Scholastic Trade Publishing Group and founder of graphic novel imprint, Graphix.
The Carle Honors will be held Sept. 26 in New York, and the event functions as a fundraiser for the museum. In addition to the recognition, recipients receive a high-quality digital print of a butterfly from Eric Carle's book, "The Very Hungry Caterpillar."

FAA to revamp aircraft construction oversight, official says

Texto completo: The Federal Aviation Administration plans to significantly revamp its oversight of airplane construction this summer after questions were raised about how it manages inspections done by the industry, according to testimony prepared for a Senate subcommittee hearing on Wednesday.
The testimony by Calvin Scovel III, the Transportation Department's inspector general who monitors the FAA and other agencies, said his office has found management weaknesses with a number of the FAA's oversight processes over the years.
The comments come as the agency is under increasing scrutiny for its flight approval of the Boeing 737 Max jet. Two of the jets have crashed in the past six months in Indonesia and Ethiopia with deadly consequences, and investigators are examining the role of flight-control software that Boeing designed to prevent aerodynamic stalls.
FAA oversight and its program to allow manufacturers and airlines to have their own employees do inspections will be examined at Wednesday's hearing by the Senate Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee.
While the agency has made improvements, it plans by July to develop new evaluation criteria for training and company self-audits, Scovel wrote in his prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press.
"While revamping FAA's oversight process will be an important step, continued management attention will be key to ensure the agency identifies and monitors the highest-risk areas of aircraft certification," Scovel wrote.
Also in prepared testimony, the acting FAA head defended his agency's certification of the 737 Max and its initial resistance to ground the planes until all other major aviation regulators around the world had done so.
Daniel Elwell, also will say Wednesday that Boeing submitted proposed changes in key flight-control software to its 737 Max jetliner in January. He says the FAA is still reviewing the aircraft manufacturer's plans for the software update and more pilot training. He calls FAA's review "an agency priority."
Elwell's testimony, first reported by the Seattle Times, could renew questions over the FAA's response to safety concerns about the Max aircraft after the deadly Oct. 29 crash in Indonesia and another in Ethiopia on March 10, nearly seven weeks after Elwell says Boeing submitted its proposed changes.
FAA spokesman Gregory Martin said Tuesday that the Boeing submission in January was preliminary, not final. He said the FAA has not received Boeing's completed software improvements.
Boeing is updating software designed to protect against aerodynamic stalls, in which planes can lose lift from the wings and fall from the sky if the nose points too high. A company official provided more details on work to update the flight-control software, which was not part of previous 737 models.
Software designers considered "a broad range" of pilot skills "to ensure that normal airmanship skills are sufficient to control the airplane," said the official, who spoke anonymously because the changes have not been made public.
Investigators in Ethiopia expect to issue a preliminary report this week on a plane crash that killed 157 people. But a final determination of the cause of the accident may take months.
Boeing said the changes will include protection against faulty readings by sensors. Erroneous measurements are suspected of triggering flight problems on the Lion Air jet. Regulators say the Ethiopian Airlines Max jet followed a similar flight path, including erratic climbs and descents before crashing minutes after takeoff, and those similarities were an important part of their decision to ground the roughly 370 Max 8 planes around the world.
The New York Times reported Monday that pilots from five airlines tested current and updated software on a Boeing flight simulator. During a test that recreated conditions on the Lion Air flight, the pilots had less than 40 seconds to override the software before the plane uncontrollably plunged toward the ground, the newspaper said, citing two unidentified people involved in the testing.
Pilots can flip one switch to reverse a move by the software to point the nose down, and they can disable the software by flipping two switches at their knees.
Pilots involved in the simulator testing followed those steps and kept the plane under control using the current anti-stall software, the newspaper reported. The Lion Air pilots, on the other hand, had received little training on the system, and it was only after the plane crashed that Boeing first notified pilots of the system's existence.
Jason Goldberg, a pilot who has flown the Max 8 and is spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing American Airlines pilots, told the AP that the anti-stall system "has significant control over the aircraft -- it can pitch the nose down very significantly."
Goldberg said it was "inexcusable for Boeing to omit this information from the pilot manuals for training. It's a serious breach of trust."
A Southwest Airlines Max 8, one of 34 in the carrier's fleet, had to make an emergency landing shortly after takeoff Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, cutting short a flight to a short-term aircraft storage lot in California. The plane was not carrying passengers.
The airline and the FAA said the plane had a problem with one of its engines, not the flight-control software.

Today's Highlight in History:
On this date:
In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon sighted present-day Florida.
In 1625, Charles I acceded to the English throne upon the death of James I.
In 1964, Alaska was hit by a magnitude 9.2 earthquake and tsunamis that together claimed about 130 lives.
In 1968, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man to orbit the Earth in 1961, died when his MiG-15 jet crashed during a routine training flight near Moscow; he was 34.
In 1977, 583 people were killed when a KLM Boeing 747, attempting to take off in heavy fog, crashed into a Pan Am 747 on an airport runway on the Canary Island of Tenerife.

In 1995, "Forrest Gump" won six Academy Awards, including best picture and a second consecutive best actor Oscar for Tom Hanks; Jessica Lange won best actress for "Blue Sky."
In 2006, Al-Qaida conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui (zak-uh-REE'-uhs moo-SOW'-ee) testified at his federal trial that he was supposed to hijack a fifth airplane on Sept. 11, 2001, and fly it into the White House.
Ten years ago: President Barack Obama launched a fresh effort to defeat al-Qaida terrorists in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, ordering in 4,000 more troops. A suicide bomber set off an explosion at a packed mosque in Pakistan near the Afghan border, killing at least 48 people. The rising Red River broke a 112-year record and threatened the dikes fortifying Fargo, N.D. The main suspect in the Phoenix serial shooter attacks, Dale Hausner, was sentenced to death for six murders that had put the city on edge for nearly two years. (Hausner committed suicide in an isolation cell in June 2013.)
Five years ago: Face to face at the Vatican for the first time, President Barack Obama and Pope Francis focused on their mutual respect and shared concern for the poor. The U.S. Air Force took the extraordinary step of firing nine midlevel nuclear commanders and announcing it would discipline dozens of junior officers at a nuclear missile base, responding firmly to an exam-cheating scandal. A judge in Missoula, Montana, sentenced Jordan Graham to more than 30 years in prison for killing Cody Johnson, her husband of eight days, by pushing him from a cliff in Glacier National Park.

Texto completo: GOP congressman reads from Hilter's 'Mein Kampf' on House floor to blast Democrats
WASHINGTON – A Republican member of Congress quoted Adolf Hitler on the House floor in an attempt to blast Democrats over the results of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible conspiracy with the Trump presidential campaign.
Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks read from Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in an attempt to bash Democrats and the media, alleging they had pushed a "big lie" to smear Trump during the investigation.
"A big lie is a political propaganda technique made famous by Germany's national socialist German Worker's Party," Brooks said Monday. "For more than two years, socialist Democrats and their fake news media allies, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, Washington Post and countless others, have perpetrated the biggest political lie, con, scam and fraud in American history. "
The poster collection of Utah's Mike Lee: Senator uses Star Wars posters, image of Reagan riding a dinosaur to blast Green New Deal
Brooks railed against Democrats, citing from a four-page letter Attorney General William Barr sent to members of Congress on Sunday. The letter summarized the conclusions of Mueller's lengthy investigation and explained that Mueller did not find conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. Mueller could not determine whether President Donald Trump attempted to obstruct justice by impeding the investigation, according to the letter.
After reviewing the evidence, Barr determined no criminal charges would be filed against the president.
Brooks railed against Democrats for pushing the Russian conspiracy for years and the media for helping give them a voice.
He called for Democrats and the media to apologize for the "fraud and scam committed" but said he recognized that some would be more likely to "double down and propagate even more big lies because doubling down is essential to big lie theory. "
"In that vein, I quote from another socialist who mastered big lie propaganda to a maximum and deadly effect," Brooks said before starting to read Hitler's words on the House floor.
He started, "In the big lie, there is always a certain force of credibility because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus, in the primitive simplicity of their minds, they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie. "
'A complete and total exoneration': Mueller report: Criminal investigation moves to political realm as Barr summarizes for Congress
Opinion: 5 lingering questions about Mueller report summary
"Who is this big lie master? That quote was in 1925 by a member of Germany's National Socialist German Workers Party," he said. "That's right. Germany's Socialist Party, more commonly known as the Nazis. The author was socialist Adolf Hitler in his book, 'Mein Kampf. '"
Brooks' emphasis on socialism in Germany appeared to be an attempt to link socialism with the Democratic Party — even though Nazis were not, in fact, socialists. They, along with Hitler, were fascists, essentially the opposite of socialists. Hitler was the leader of the Nazi Party that initiated World War II and was central in the death of millions during the Holocaust.
While on the House floor, Brooks also called on Americans to reject "America's socialists and their fake news media allies" or "succumb to the danger that lurks and horrific damage that results. "
Brooks' office did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.

Texto completo: Plane crash investigations take months, but an early report on the ill-fated Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 may be released within days.
That’s the assessment of Mussie Yiheyis, spokesman for Ethiopia’s transport ministry, who said a high-ranking government official will announce the preliminary result of the probe into the March 10 accident that occurred outside the capital city of Addis Ababa.
“A date has not been set, but it will be released later this week,” Yiheyis told the Associated Press on Tuesday. “The U. S. National Transportation Safety Board, France’s BEA and an Ethiopian Transport Ministry department have been conducting the investigation. It has been conducted as per International Civil Aviation Organization rules and regulations. ”
The crash has drawn widespread attention not only because it claimed the lives of all 157 people aboard, but also because of its similarities to an Oct. 29 accident involving a Lion Air plane that plummeted into the Java Sea off Indonesia, killing its 189 passengers and crew.
Both tragedies involved the new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and in both cases the planes went on erratic flight paths that prompted the pilots to make a desperate, futile attempt to return to the airport shortly after takeoff. Within days of the second crash, the jets were grounded worldwide.
One that was getting transported to a storage facility north of Los Angeles had to make an emergency landing Tuesday afternoon at the Orlando airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
“The crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 8701, a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, declared an emergency after the aircraft experienced a reported engine problem while departing from Orlando International Airport in Florida about 2:50 p. m. today,” the FAA said in a statement. “The aircraft returned and landed safely in Orlando. No passengers were aboard the aircraft, which was being ferried to Victorville, Calif. , for storage. The FAA is investigating. ”
On Monday, Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam told the Wall Street Journal that he believes the stall-prevention system known as MCAS, a new feature on the MAX models that debuted in 2017, was activated on his company’s doomed flight.
More: Are pilots outside the U. S. getting the training needed to fly jets, including Boeing 737 MAX 8?
Warning: Reports say Boeing will add warning light to aid pilots after Ethiopian 737 MAX crash
Investigators believe the MCAS’ response to a faulty angle-of-attack sensor was a factor in the Lion Air disaster and likely in the Ethiopian Airlines crash as well.
At a testing session attended by pilots from five airlines Saturday, Boeing re-created the conditions encountered by the Lion Air crew in a simulator, and also presented the same scenario with updated software meant to allow the pilots more control over the automated system.
The New York Times, citing two unnamed sources, said pilots discovered they had less than 40 seconds to rectify the problem and avoid disaster under the old system.
In a statement on the company website Monday, GebreMariam refuted reports that the pilots of Flight 302 were not trained on the new aspects of the MAX 8, saying: "After the Lion Air accident in October, our pilots who fly the new model were trained on all appropriate simulators. ”
More: American Airlines to cancel 90 flights every day through most of April
GrebeMariam expressed support for the carrier's partnership with Boeing but did not address whether Ethiopian intends to go through with its order of 25 more MAX planes.
Last week, Garuda Indonesia announced that it would cancel its order of 49 MAX 8 jets.
"Let me be clear: Ethiopian Airlines believes in Boeing,'' GrebeMariam said in the statement. "More than two-thirds of our fleet is Boeing. . . . Despite the tragedy, Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines will continue to be linked well into the future. ''
Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg responded with a Tuesday web post expressing appreciation:
"All of us thank Ethiopian Airlines for their commitment and share their resolve to doing everything possible to build an even safer air travel system,'' Muilenburg said.
Boeing is updating the MAX series software and has invited more than 200 pilots, technical experts and regulators to its factory outside Seattle for a briefing Wednesday.

Texto completo: After nearly 40 years as a reporter and editor at The New York Times, Susan Chira will depart next month to become the editor in chief of The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice issues.
In her new role, Ms. Chira, a senior correspondent and editor covering gender issues for The Times since 2016 and a member of a team that won a 2018 Pulitzer Prize for coverage of workplace sexual harassment, will succeed Bill Keller.
Mr. Keller, whose own 30-year run at The Times included eight years as the paper's executive editor, joined The Marshall Project at its founding in 2014. Since then, he has guided it to a bevy of awards, including a Pulitzer Prize and two National Magazine Awards.
Upon Ms. Chira's arrival, Mr. Keller will become a board member while pursuing teaching opportunities at Princeton University and Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, N.Y.
Ms. Chira was chosen as Mr. Keller's successor after a monthslong search, during which more than 20 people were interviewed for the position.
"It's such an exciting opportunity to join something that, although so new, has already accomplished so much," she said in an interview on Monday. "I think the ambition that we all share is that it's already made an impact, and we can widen the lens."
Working out of offices about a mile north of The Times's Midtown Manhattan headquarters, Ms. Chira will oversee stories about America's courts, police departments, prisons and more. She said that she hoped to help The Marshall Project dig more deeply into injustice stemming from race, ethnicity and gender, and to pursue more investigative projects.
Marshall Project reporters, often working with other news outlets, including The Times, have investigated how law enforcement authorities handle rape cases, the practice of solitary confinement and private companies that profit from transporting prisoners.
Conceived in 2013 by Neil Barsky, a onetime hedge fund manager and former reporter for The Wall Street Journal, The Marshall Project is financed by donations and grants from the Roy and Patricia Disney Family Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Its current budget is $7.2 million.
Named for Thurgood Marshall, the former Supreme Court justice, the organization is often compared to ProPublica, another nonprofit journalism organization that teams up on articles with other publications. The Marshall Project began with 26 employees; it now has 38, with 26 in the newsroom.
"We've reached the point where we don't think of ourselves quite as much as a start-up," Mr. Keller said in an interview. "We're doing all these grown-up things like making sure that we have policies on paid leave and sexual harassment, the things you would sort of take for granted when you're brand-new, but we're at the stage where you have to institutionalize them."
Ms. Chira started her career at The Times as a trainee on the metro desk in 1981 after graduating from Harvard. Since then, she said, she has had "the most wonderful time" covering topics like education and business, reporting from Tokyo and writing a book about motherhood.
She is, according to Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, "one of the finest editors I've known."
"We will miss her, but it is great for journalism that she will be running something as important as The Marshall Project," he said in a statement.
Ms. Chira was one of the longest-serving foreign editors in the history of The Times, managing more than 50 correspondents and overseeing reporting that won several Pulitzers. She is also known for encouraging other journalists in their careers and recently developed a mentoring program at The Times.
At The Marshall Project, she said, she plans to make diversity a priority in recruiting. Many employees of The Marshall Project are early in their careers, Mr. Keller said, "the kind of environment perfect" for Ms. Chira.
"She's got quality journalism in her DNA, and I've watched her work with lots of people," he said. "She has a gift for getting the best work out of people."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy" (front page, March 25):
Let me get this straight: Numerous members of Donald Trump's campaign and family had contacts and meetings with Russia-connected individuals; they repeatedly lied about and tried to cover this up; Jared Kushner tried to set up a private, unmonitored communication link with the Kremlin; Mr. Trump met alone with Vladimir Putin without any American officials present; and Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Putin and attempted to undermine NATO.
If there was no fire, as the Mueller report allegedly determined, what was behind all the smoke? Americans deserve to know.
Harlan Kosson
Pittsford, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Re "A Cloud Over Trump's Presidency Is Lifted" (news analysis, nytimes.com, March 24):
A cloud has not lifted. The special counsel showed a storm of proven criminality surrounding a president and his campaign, delivering 34 indictments that resulted in seven guilty pleas and jail time for top presidential advisers. Among those indicted were Russian intelligence officers and other nationals and three Russian companies. And numerous investigations continue under federal and state prosecutors. These are the results that should be broadcast.
By not acknowledging and addressing this, the president makes cleanup messier and further weakens American leadership and its inspirational role in the world. That the president and others consider this a triumph is itself a cloud.
Jeffrey Ainis
Alhambra, Calif.
To the Editor:
Robert Mueller's report doesn't make Donald Trump any less a racist or liar. It doesn't explain his love for dictators, his disdain for American allies or his contempt for intelligence agencies, the press and confirmed science. It certainly doesn't make him unimpeachable. In fact, there's no vindication for Mr. Trump simply because the Mueller report failed to find a Trump-Russia conspiracy. Mr. Trump is still a very real threat to our democracy, and Congress should do everything in its power to stop him.
Janis Adler
Portland, Ore.
To the Editor:
Re "Mueller Demurs So Barr Makes a Key Decision" (front page, March 25):
There is much speculation as to why Robert Mueller chose not to reach a conclusion as to whether President Trump committed obstruction of justice but explicitly declined to exonerate him. Allow me to join in that speculation by suggesting that it may have been an extraordinary act of patriotism and self-restraint by this uncommonly heroic and honorable special counsel.
He may have recognized that if he found that the president committed obstruction, Attorney General William Barr would have rejected that finding, either because in briefing the attorney general that became clear or because of the attorney general's known hostility to an obstruction charge from his unsolicited 19-page memorandum to the Justice Department before his appointment.
The special counsel may have sought to avoid the divisive consequences of a futile recommendation. If this was the case, it only underscores the wrongfulness of Mr. Barr's refusal to recuse himself.

To the Editor:
The Mueller report is now finished, and I am ready to put it behind us. Yes, there are lots of questions left open and lots of legal proceedings that may occur. But it is now as clear as it's ever going to be that whatever judgment lapses or foreign intrusions occurred in the 2016 election, there is little evidence that indictable offenses were committed by the president.
I think it is time for the president to act presidential -- thanking Robert Mueller and the Justice Department for their professionalism, and urging people on all sides to get on with life and the business of governing. Crowing by one party and continued grubbing around in the carcass of the dispute by the other only distract from more important work we have to do.
William R. Andersen

To the Editor:
The New York Times, the rest of the hate-Donald Trump media and the Democrats owe President Trump and the country a sincere apology. I, for one, am not holding my breath waiting.
Gerald Katz
Edwards, Colo.
To the Editor:
President Trump says the report is "total exoneration." Now, wouldn't it be refreshing if he dealt with Russia's attempt to fiddle with America's election results? If he is determined to be a real leader, he should be expressing his outrage as an American, and actively seeking ways to punish Russia and to protect the results of future elections.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump only recognizes threats to his own reputation. The integrity of our democracy isn't even on his radar.
Howard Schmitt
Green Tree, Pa.
To the Editor:
How can it be concluded that there was no conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign given that President Trump was never cross-examined by the investigators, the content of Mr. Trump's private meetings with Vladimir Putin has never been disclosed, and Mr. Trump's subordinates, including Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, lied to the investigators?
Richard Joffe
New York
To the Editor:
I strongly suspect that most Republicans, if they are honest with themselves, are more relieved right now than anything else. If they believed President Trump to be capable of colluding with Russia, what does that say about Mr. Trump? What does that say about Republicans?
Cyd Joan Cheek
Knife River, Minn.
To the Editor:
Attorney General William Barr has incorrectly concluded that an obstruction of justice charge against the president could have no validity absent a finding of an underlying crime. The United States Code's obstruction statute does not contain that requirement. The statute merely codifies the importance of deterring those who, with wrongful intent, would interfere with the pursuit of justice. Congress will doubtless make its own determination whether the president obstructed justice.
William C. Ibershof
Mill Valley, Calif.
The writer is a former federal prosecutor.
To the Editor:
Wouldn't it be glorious if we had a president who could say: "I'm glad we had this investigation. The results prove that our democracy works." Instead, Attorney General William Barr's summary emboldens our would-be tyrant to go after his "enemies." What a tragedy!

Piers Morgan goes full Trump and predicts 2020 re-election: Collusion 'was all fake news’

Texto completo: Former CNN anchor Piers Morgan said that special counsel Robert Mueller’s finding there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia “completely” vindicated President Trump.

“So it was all fake news … ” Morgan began his column Monday on the Daily Mail website. In a headline homage to Trump's own rhetoric, the column was billed: "The Russia collusion hoax was a disgraceful fake news witch-hunt that shames all of Trump’s deranged enemies in the media, the FBI and Hollywood and has probably ensured their worst nightmare - his re-election."

Morgan, 53, lambasted the media for fueling the “fake frenzy” and call those who predicted the investigation would bring down Trump “very stupid.” Although the former editor of the Daily Miirror, a left-wing tabloid, and an outspoken advocate of gun control, Morgan has consistently drawn attention to Trump's populist appeal and predicted his 2016 presidential victory.

He singled out the New York Times and the Washington Post , accusing the newspapers of pushing “viciously partisan Russiagate coverage,” as well as BuzzFeed for publishing the infamous dossier on Trump’s alleged ties to Russia.

Morgan, a friend of Trump's who worked with him on "The Celebrity Apprentice," said cable news networks such as CNN and MSNBC were “even worse” in their coverage. “They were just exposing their own bias and news-judgement-twisting hatred of Trump,” he wrote.

Fox News deserves the most credit for its coverage of the investigation, he said.

“Their much-vilified prime time anchors Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have repeatedly picked apart and rubbished the Russia collusion claims - and they were right,” Morgan wrote.

Attorney General William Barr wrote a four-page letter to Congress on Sunday summarizing Mueller’s findings in his nearly two-year investigation.

Mueller determined the Trump campaign did not conspire with the Russians to win the election. He did not provide a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice, though Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined there was insufficient evidence to bolster an obstruction charge.

Texto completo: On the opening night in 2013 of Terence Blanchard's first opera, "Champion," the folks at Opera Theatre of St. Louis immediately asked the six-time Grammy-winning jazz trumpeter to write another one.
Blanchard agreed. His second opera, "Fire Shut Up in My Bones," opens June 15 at OTSL.
Blanchard came to town Tuesday to preview the new work and take part in a panel discussion on race and the arts and the need to broaden opera's appeal.
"All different types of people will come," he says, "if you make it relevant to them."
"Fire Shut Up in My Bones" is based on the 2014 memoir of the same name by New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow, with a libretto by screenwriter Kasi Lemmons. It's co-sponsored by Jazz St. Louis and will feature an entirely African-American cast.
Heather Hunt-Ruddy is the head of client experience and growth for Wells Fargo Advisors. She's been on the board of OTSL for the past five years. Wells Fargo is among the organizations providing financial support for the production, and she'll be attending the opera with 150 of the company's African-American financial advisers.
"The stereotype of opera is not cutting-edge," Hunt-Ruddy says, but she's become enthusiastic about the art form. "I'm hoping to broaden the participation of people who might go to the opera."
She says that Wells Fargo is also "hoping we'll encourage other corporate leaders to join us in helping to facilitate conversations that need to happen."
Wells Fargo has a regular series of "Courageous Conversations" on topics including race, gender and sexual orientation: "We believe that our team members need to be able to be themselves at work," Hunt-Ruddy says. On Tuesday afternoon at its downtown offices, a "Courageous Conversation" was opened up to nonemployees for the first time.
A panel -- Blanchard; hip-hop artist Bates; Gene Dobbs Bradford, the president and CEO of Jazz St. Louis; Wells Fargo senior vice president David Dawkins; and violist Joanna Mendoza of the Arianna String Quartet -- discussed "Race and the Arts" in front of a big crowd.
Mendoza noted that she's seen more diverse audiences at performances by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra recently, along with more women and people of color in ensembles. In terms of musical styles, "We have a tendency to (pigeonhole) things. Ultimately, we're sharing emotions that we find in all of these genres."
Bradford suggested that the norms of concertgoing can make people feel out of place.
"We have to make people feel comfortable," agreed Blanchard, noting that "Champion" has sparked diverse audiences wherever it's been performed. "We have to make a mandate to do new works, and get audiences used to it."
Said Bates: "We have to meet kids where they're at." She also emphasized the importance of including women across the board, "in all genres of music. It's important to include all kinds of people -- all colors, men, women, LGBT."
Blanchard spoke up for exposing kids to classical music. "I'm a product of corporate financial programming," he said. "Those programs allowed me to have a passion, and act on that passion. That's how I got to go to a symphony, through a corporate program. There was one black guy in the orchestra, and I watched him all through" the performance.
With "Fire Shut Up in My Bones," there's a lot to be excited about. "Champion" is probably the best thing so far to come out of OTSL's successful "New Works, Bold Voices" initiative of world premieres; it's had a half-dozen presentations since its St. Louis premiere.
"Fire" marks the company debut of soprano Julia Bullock, a St. Louis native who's taken the world of serious music by storm. It's being shaped by artistic director James Robinson, who's one of the best when it comes to new opera.
"I am very excited about this," says OTSL general director Andrew Jorgensen. "Charles Blow's story is meaningful, intimate and operatic."
The title comes from the Hebrew Bible's book of Jeremiah, 20:9-11. It's Blow's account of growing up black and poor in the small town of Gibsland, La., the youngest of five boys. There's violence in his tale; he was sexually abused, at the age of 7, by a family member, and his mother was known to pack a pistol. There's also a deep well of love.
"This story of Charles' youth is deeply intimate and inspiring," Jorgensen adds. "I take my hat off to him that he did it in such a public way; I admire him for telling his story and for letting us tell it."
The idea of using Blow's memoir, Blanchard says, came from his wife and Robinson, who had both read the book. "I read it and thought about it and decided it was a powerful story to tackle."
He says he "didn't want to write music that was indicative of the South. That was too easy." Instead, he made use of a bluesy guitar "as spice. It's melodic, with a blues essence."
As with "Champion," "Fire" was workshopped, getting feedback from the singers. "Learning all the voices is still a big challenge for me," Blanchard says. "I hadn't had sopranos in 'Champion.'"
He fell into the common trap of writing a lot of high-flying music for them, which wears out voices; Robinson told him to rethink that.
"I want to save singers' ability to do it," he says, noting that, much like playing the trumpet, "it's about pacing yourself."
Soprano Karen Slack appreciates that. Slack sang the role of Emelda Griffith when "Champion" was produced in San Francisco and was invited by Blanchard to take part in "Fire." She will create the role of Billie, Blow's mother.
"She's an amazing woman," Slack says of her character, "strong, brilliant, family-oriented. She's a fierce woman -- fiercely brave, fiercely passionate -- all the things most women have the capacity to be."
She read the book and libretto and realized "this is the blackest libretto I've ever read, but in a positive way. I've never seen a picture of African-American life (in the 1970s) so brilliantly done. It's going to be an important work; it's going to be produced."

Commentary: What really counts when selecting a college

Texto completo: Last week, 50 members of America’s upper crust were charged with a variety of federal crimes tied to gaining access to top schools such as Yale and Stanford. We were reminded that the college selection process is one of many systems in our country tilted in favor of the wealthy and, in some cases, a process subject to gross abuse.
This development saddens me, though I am not surprised. Starting with the 1983 publication of U.S. News & World Report’s “America’s Best Colleges” rankings, higher education has become increasingly obsessed with status and wealth, and we’ve brought the public along for the ride.
Just as our society has become marked by increased income inequality, higher education reflects that division. Highly selective Ivies such as Dartmouth, Yale and Princeton enroll as many students from the top 1 percent of the income scale as from the bottom 60 percent. Yet the joke may be on those disgraced members of the elite. As economists Suqin Ge, Elliott Isaac and Amalia Miller note, male students who attend selective universities experience no positive effect on their career earnings.
Following World War II, colleges and universities were massive engines of class progress. The GI Bill accelerated mobility. Now, our most prestigious institutions more often reinforce class distinctions. But it doesn’t have to be so.
Institutions such as my own have long embraced higher education’s access mission. More than a quarter of students who attend Westminster College are eligible for Pell Grants, federal support awarded to those in the lowest income bracket. Our public state universities and community colleges also play crucial roles in creating pathways to a degree.
But why is our culture so fascinated with the so-called “top” schools? A few years back, a mother and a daughter appeared in my office looking for some advice about the college selection process. The daughter was only in ninth grade, but her family was anxious to get a jump on being prepared.
As the two sat down, the young high schooler announced proudly, “I want to go to Harvard!”
I said, “How wonderful. Tell me why you’ve chosen that school.”
A long silence ensued.
The moment was illuminating, for it indicated that no adult had ever sought to question the child’s pick, nor had she ever thought to identify reasons. It was self-evident that Harvard was a good choice.
Such parenting strategies are unfortunate, for the college selection process should be all about the fit between the student and school. What is a great match for one is a poor fit for another.
As The New York Times reported last year, the most popular class at Yale was one on happiness, because students who had made themselves so miserable trying to gain admission didn’t have a game plan for how to enjoy themselves. The article also cited a 2013 report noting that more than half of Yale students had sought mental health care during their time at the university.
Times columnist Frank Bruni points out that it’s less important where you go than how you go to college. Put another way, the choice of a college is far less important than the student who is going — motivated, excited, passionate students are going to be successful at hundreds of different institutions, a fact I have witnessed for over 30 years in the business.
As dean of an honors college, I spend an enormous amount of time with ambitious parents and their equally motivated teenagers talking about their plans for college. It’s enjoyable work visiting with families who are hopeful and excited about the next four years. Yet these conversations are also freighted with anxiety, since they turn on questions such as, “Is my ACT high enough?” and, “How much is tuition?”
Nowhere is the nature of the relationship between a child and a parent more apparent than when a family walks through my office door to discuss college selection. Who leads the way with questions? What kind of trust is evident in the relationship? Are parents out in front of their children trying to seek advantage — as we saw in this week’s sordid cases — or are they serving as supportive, loving, honest partners in the process, accepting their children fully as themselves?
Trust me, that story is far more important than a high SAT score or the number of AP classes on a transcript.
Richard Badenhausen is dean of the Honors College and interim provost at Westminster College and president of the National Collegiate Honors Council.

Texto completo: Among those worthy of celebrity status in mid-19th century America were rugged gunslingers whose reputations were often built on myths and legends borne of truth and tragedy – and one who reached the heights of notoriety was Wild Bill Hickock.
New York Times bestselling author Tom Clavin adds to his collection of historical nonfiction with "Wild Bill: The True Story of the American Frontier's First Gunfighter," examining in detail the life and rowdy times of this iconic American figure.
Notoriety gained from the press made Hickock a nationally known figure, and thus, placed a target on his back for hotshots who wanted to make a name for themselves as the man who would take him down.
A quick-draw artist who was known for his accuracy and courage when it came to gunfights, Hickock became a lawman at 20, and went on to hold the titles of Army scout, federal marshal and Union spy. It would be a bullet that would end his life at age 39.
Clavin has served as a newspaper and web editor, magazine writer, TV/radio commentator and reporter for the New York Times. Among his career credits are awards from the Society of Professional Journalists, the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation and the National Newspaper Association. His books include "Dodge City," "The Heart of Everything That Is," and "Valley Forge." Clavin lives in Sag Harbor, New York.
"Wild Bill Hickock," whom you describe as the "first post-Civil War celebrity of the West," was well-known as America's first gunfighter during the 1800s – but his real name wasn't even Bill. Tell us how James Butler Hickock became popularly known as "Bill" – and how he earned the legendary title of "Wild".
Two separate events resulted in "Wild Bill." The first and less dramatic is he had a brother who called himself Bill – his real name was Lorenzo – and probably as a joke when traveling together on a steamship on the Missouri River they called each other Bill. Lorenzo disembarked, "Jim" Hickok pushed on, and passengers called him Bill, and he got comfortable about this.
The "Wild" part happened after he entered a saloon fight on the side of a bartender outnumbered 6-to-1, and onlookers thought that was a wildly gutsy thing to do. From 1861 on, he was Wild Bill Hickok.
Why do you say in your Author's Note that it was a "gullible and impressionable public" that made Wild Bill bigger than all of the legendary frontier figures (like Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett and Kit Carson) who came before him?
There had always been a hunger back East for tall tales about frontier figures, but the public became especially ravenous after the Civil War when the American frontier exploded with seemingly limitless potential. Hickok cut a romantic, larger-than-life figure and had a distinctive look and there was a bigger than ever number of readers. All this combined to almost overnight elevating him to superstar status.
It was a Harper's New Monthly Magazine article in February 1867 that first spread Hickock's name and legend across the nation, making him nationally famous at age 29. What effect did that article have on Hickock's life?
The article made him very famous. He could not have been prepared for that but he sort of took his fame in stride. Hickok did not seek attention, but he didn't hide from it either. He was mostly a modest man but a part of him enjoyed being almost a mythical figure. The downside was much of his fame was as a best-in-the-West gunfighter, making him a target for those younger and possibly faster who wanted to take that title. For the rest of his life he had to wonder which bullet had his name on it.
Briefly, for what exploits was Wild Bill best known?
Though we don't have a lot of details, his years as a spy behind Confederate lines were full of exciting exploits. Obviously, being a gunfighter who could shoot faster and more accurately than any man he encountered. And especially when marshal of Abilene in Kansas, Hickok became the prototype of the two-fisted and two-gun frontier lawman. And he was the most well-known of Western plainsmen.
"Wild Bill," was described as "the handsome, chivalrous, yet cold-eyed killer who roamed the prairie, a kind friend to children and a quick-drawing punisher of evildoers." He died at age 39, and you liken his life to a Shakespearian tragedy. Explain how that comparison fits.
Hickok fits into that tragic mold dating from Euripides in Ancient Greece and elevated by Shakespeare of the hero who attained heights, but flaws felled him. The West changed fast around Wild Bill Hickok, and he was unable to adapt — and he was a gunfighter going blind.
Like many tragic heroes in literature, he sensed his days were short and life had been unfair, but he courageously accepted what was to come. Hickok was an honorable man ultimately dealt a bad hand.

Texto completo: $500,000 TO GET your kid into an elite college? Not cool. But when news about Operation Varsity Blues came out, psychologists and parenting experts who've been following trends recognized it for what it was: just the latest outrageous example of bad parenting they've been observing for decades.
While the dollar signs were supersized, experts say that the bribes reveal the excessive lengths some parents will go to protect their kids — and by extension, themselves — from the burn of failure.
Parenting in America has become an extreme sport. By comparison, the late-20th century “helicopter" version, in which moms and dads hovered around their progeny, always at the ready with a Band-Aid or a cookie, seems mild. (Remember the proverbial trophy for every child and the over-the-top fifth-grade graduation ceremonies? How quaint.)
Now in the 21st century, we're seeing a new kind of parent, one who will go to even greater lengths not just to protect their kids, but to smash every perceived obstacle in their path to minimize failure and create the illusion of success. It's called “snowplow parenting," and it's driving a lot of parents into questionable situations, some downright illegal.
Snowplow parenting was identified as a generational phenomenon as early as 2004. That's when Jean Illsley Clarke, Connie Dawson, and David Bredehoft studied 1,195 participants and that year published the results in the book, “How Much Is Enough? Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Children." In the book, they describe three types of parenting errors: over-doing (failing to teach the concept of “enough"); over-nurturing (doing things for children that they should be doing for themselves, or allowing children to think only about themselves); and soft structure (failure to establish rules in order to shield children from the consequences of their behaviors, including their impact on family and society).
Researchers have found that parents' increasingly elaborate efforts to protect their children from every possible disappointment has caused more harm than good: Coddled children lack the ability to tolerate life's normal frustrations and disappointments. (For an off-the-charts example, see Ethan Couch and the case of affluenza.)
Later, when the victims of snowplowing — the kids — try to figure things out as adults, they discover they can't handle even the most minor challenges. Psychologists are now dealing with an entirely new kind of patient who can't cope with normal setbacks, like losing a job or being unable to afford the latest gadget. What's worse, these formerly overprotected adults sometimes exhibit self-mutilation and other violent and/or anti-social behaviors. Hara Estroff Marano, a longtime editor-at-large at Psychology Today, was compelled to issue this warning: “Wake up America." Marano's 2008 manifesto “A Nation of Wimps: The High Cost of Invasive Parenting" documented a nationwide epidemic of immaturity and emotional fragility.
Why are parents flailing? Some snowplow parents admit that their behavior is a way to address their guilt for spending too much time away from their kids. (The number of work hours among all classes has increased over the past few decades.) But snowplowing is also the natural result of greater competition for fewer resources. In America, we are experiencing reduced opportunities at all levels, even among the most affluent. According to Chapman University's 2017 survey of fear in Americans, more than half of participants feared “not having enough money for the future," a feeling undoubtedly exacerbated by a steady stream of messages from advertisers telling us that what we have is inadequate.
An entire industry has developed around stoking parents' fears. Since 2004, the “Marketing to Moms" conference (known as “M2Moms") has been held annually to train marketing professionals to pick apart new mothers' every aspiration and fear, and then calculate how best to prey on those feelings in hopes of nabbing some of the more than $2 trillion American mothers spend annually.
Many educators have tried to correct course. While she was a dean at Stanford, Julie Lythcott-Haims witnessed the snowplowing up close. She observed parents in near-constant cell phone contact with their offspring; parents showing up to help their adult children enroll in classes; parents contacting professors and meeting with their children's advisers. Lythcott-Haims left the campus in 2012 to write “How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," hoping to reach parents earlier in the parenting game. That same year, Jessica Lahey's book, “The Gift Of Failure," aimed at helping parents navigate the middle school years. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni tried to assuage parents caught up in the college-admissions mania with “Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania."
In spite of attempts to get parents to chill, the pressure to protect, along with the rise of social media (which allows us to present a highly edited version of our lives to the world), has created a maelstrom of hyper-insecurity powered by ever more irrational ideas about “success."
And here's how we get to the bribing and cheating: Snowplow parents' greatest fear is that their coddled progeny will, at some, point fail. Of course, everyone stumbles in this world. But the irrational concern of the snowplower takes us straight to the dozens of one-percenters who were indicted last week. No doubt many of them were overindulgent parents who worried that if their overprotected children received that college rejection letter — a rite of passage for most Americans — it would deal a crushing blow to their puffed-up teenage egos.
Worse, the rejection letter would signal the incursion of the cruel world on artificially happy homes, precisely the kind of setback these snowplow parents have spent the last 17 years sheltering their kids from.
In this context, is it any wonder that the most affluent Americans have resorted to lying, cheating, and bribing to protect their kids at all costs? When you value the appearance of success rather than actual accomplishment, all's fair in love and college admissions.

Texto completo: With increased muscular strength and flexibility surrounding your knees, the better they bear their load. Muscles are shock absorbers; the stronger they are, the better they can offload the hips and knees and the better your joints will feel.
As sore knees stiffen, the muscles around the knees tighten as well. This soft tissue tightening often amplifies knee pain. A foam roller is a terrific, low-cost option that can be used at home to improve flexibility and reduce pain through a process known as myofascial release.
Foam rollers are inexpensive and available at most sports stores or online. Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company, suggests that the AmazonBasics High-Density Round Foam Roller 36″ is a good choice for most people: It provides the firm density experts recommend at a very affordable price. DR. JORDAN METZL Here are two exercises you can try.
HAMSTRINGS ROLL
1. Place a foam roller under your right knee, with your leg straight. Cross your left leg over your right ankle. Place your hands flat on the floor behind you.
2. Roll your body forward until the roller reaches your glutes. Then roll back and forth over the roller.
3. Repeat with the other side.
GLUTES ROLL
1. Sit on a foam roller with it positioned on the back of your right thigh, just below your glutes. Cross your right leg over the front of your left thigh. Put your hands behind you for support.
2. Roll your body forward until the roller reaches your lower back. Then roll back and forth.
3. Repeat on the other side.

How to stem ‘subscription creep’

Texto completo: From Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime to Blue Apron, Birchbox and beer of the month, your debit or credit card statements are likely littered with subscriptions that are costing you dearly.
Not that all subscriptions are bad.
You might be happy to pay a monthly fee to work out at the gym or type in Microsoft Office 365. But maybe the benefits of subscribing to credit monitoring or razors by mail were, uh, more fleeting.
Recurring charges can be insidious, some eating away at your wealth when you don’t value the subscription anymore. Three $30-per-month subscriptions don’t sound like much until you realize they total nearly $1,100 per year.
Inertia leads to a dozen free trials morphing into mainstays on your Mastercard. (Maybe not much longer, though. Mastercard has said it will require merchants to get your approval to proceed with charges after a free trial ends, although it applies only to physical-product subscriptions, like home-delivered sampler boxes .)
“The situation with subscriptions could end up being death by a thousand cuts when it comes to your budget,” says Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
Adding to the problem are so-called gray charges, deceptive and unwanted credit and debit card charges that stem from misleading sales and billing practices. They total more than $14 billion a year among U.S. cardholders, or $215 each, per a 2013 study by industry research firm Aite Group.
Here’s how to spring-clean recurring charges so you can spend on things that matter to you more.
• Subscription audit. Job No. 1 is to identify recurring charges. Scan recent payment statements, including credit cards, debit cards or online accounts, like PayPal. Go back 12 months to catch auto-renew annual subscriptions. Don’t ignore the analog world: lawn mowing, home security monitoring, pest-control service and memberships in social and professional organizations. Some credit card issuers, like Citi, identify recurring charges in your online account.
• Multiply by 12. A frog in a stovetop pot of water will complacently boil to death if you raise the temperature slowly, the saying goes. Accumulating monthly subscriptions is similar. To feel the full impact, multiply monthly charges by 12 to get an annualized idea of what you’re spending. If you see yourself keeping the subscription five years, do that math too. Then, a seemingly insignificant $30-per-month expense becomes $1,800.
“On the surface, subscription costs may seem minimal, but when you add them up it can really pinch your monthly budget,” says Paul Golden, spokesman for the National Endowment for Financial Education. “If you’re putting subscriptions on your credit card, is that hindering your ability to pay off your balance each month? If so, this is a red flag.”
• Reassess value. Do you use and value the subscription? A gym membership is perhaps the best example of a noble subscription gone wrong - when you quit going but continue paying.
Ask yourself if a subscription saves you money or time. Has it lived up to its promise? Does a delivered subscription box bring you joy or guilt?
“It’s a good idea to do a subscription evaluation on a regular basis - perhaps a couple of times a year,” Golden says.
• Is it redundant? If you have cable or satellite TV, plus Netflix, YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video, you have overlap. “There are so many redundancies across those platforms that you’re more or less paying for the same service over and over again,” McClary says.
The same assessment goes for streaming music services, cloud storage and phone services. Are you hanging on to a landline for no reason?
• Opt to share. Can you legitimately share a subscription? “Some of these subscriptions offer a buddy pass,” McClary notes. YouTube TV allows family groups to share subscriptions, and certain New York Times subscriptions come with a bonus subscription to share. Some families choose to group their wireless phones on a single plan to lower costs.
Don’t forget about freebies at your local public library, which can substitute for subscriptions: digital access to books, audiobooks, movies, music and magazines.
• Downgrade. Downgrading or subscribing seasonally can work, too. Can you downgrade from the premium to free version of software or website access? Are you getting value from your credit card’s annual fee? You can probably downgrade to a fee-free card with the same issuer and keep your long credit history.
• Cancel. Liberally pause or cancel services . You can always restart and re-subscribe later. You might even receive a discount offer to return.

Amsterdam to ban tours of red-light district

Texto completo: LONDON - Amsterdam is to ban guided tours of its notorious red-light district, the latest move by the city to tackle overcrowding and improve working conditions for prostitutes in the area,
"We are banning tours that take visitors along sex workers' windows, not only because we want to prevent overcrowding in the red-light district, but also because it is not respectful to sex workers," Udo Kock, Amsterdam's deputy mayor, said in a statement Wednesday.
"It is outdated to treat sex workers as a tourist attraction," he added.
The ban will come into effect Jan. 1, as will bans on free tours and on soliciting visitors to take part in tours, the statement said.
Although Amsterdam, the Dutch capital, has distinctive cultural gems - galleries, museums, restaurants and its iconic canals, to mention just a few - for decades, tourists have also been attracted to the city for marijuana and prostitution, both of which are largely legal there.
But its popularity as a relatively low-cost, versatile destination has seen the number of visitors rise to the asphyxiating level of about 19 million a year.
The overcrowded streets and rowdy behavior of some tourists have increasingly posed problems for Dutch officials. More than 1,000 guided tours pass through the Oudekerksplein - the main square in the red-light district - every week, city officials said. But the crowds have not been beneficial for prostitutes, who tend to be gawked at by visitors while potential paying clients are put off.
The city said that residents and local businesses in the red-light district "experience disturbances caused by groups of tourists" and that 80 percent of the prostitutes consulted said that the tours"had a negative effect on their business."
"In addition, sex workers still experience severe problems with participants of guided tours, such as rude behavior and unwanted photographs," authorities said.
Niek Prast, manager of Strawberry Tours, a small company that organizes guided visits to Amsterdam, said that if the government went ahead with the ban, it would be "a bit of a disaster" for his business.
"I get what they're trying to achieve," he said, "but I think that the government wants to see how far they can go; I think they're waiting for the reaction," he said in a telephone interview Thursday.
He also said the move was unlikely to solve the problem - and could even make things worse.
"It's not like no guided tours, no people - the people are still going to go to the red-light district," he said. "And no one will be there to tell them 'please be quiet, please behave' or to educate them about not taking pictures and being respectful."
Authorities on Wednesday also unveiled related measures to. manage tourism, all of which will apply from Jan. 1. They included cutting the maximum number of participants in guided tours of the city to 15 per group, instead of 20; making official accreditation a prerequisite for guides; and introducing an additional tax on tour participants.
Before the ban begins, the city will start to curb tours in the red-light district: Starting April 1, they will not be allowed to take place after 7 p.m. (they are currently allowed until 11 p.m.).
The steps follow several others that Amsterdam authorities have taken to try and regulate overeager, and often inebriated, tourists.
Last year, the administration of Femke Halsema, Amsterdam's mayor, announced a set of such measures, which included rigorous street cleaning; on-the-spot collection of fines up to 140 euros, or about $160, for public urination, drunkenness or excessive noise; and a marketing campaign to persuade visitors to respect the city and its rules.
Mascha ten Bruggencate, a city administrator who had been tasked with carrying out the policies, said last fall that there was an obvious place to start.
"The red-light district is symbolic of the problem," she told The Times.

Texto completo: During the month of April, the Batavia Public Library, 10 S. Batavia Ave., will present the final three programs in the "One Book, One Batavia" series.
This year’s selection is "Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Mankind’s First Journey to the Moon" by Robert Kurson.
"One Book, One Batavia" is an annual community-wide reading program presented by the Batavia Public Library in cooperation with Batavia High School and co-sponsored by the Friends of the Batavia Public Library.
No library card is needed, however advance registration is required. To register, call the reference desk, (630) 879-1393, ext. 200, or visit www.bataviapubliclibrary.org.
On Monday, April 1, Michelle Nichols will present "A Lab Aloft: The International Space Station" at 7 p.m. Nichols is the director of public observing at the Adler Planetarium and a Jet Propulsion Laboratory ambassador.
The International Space Station is a cutting-edge Earth-orbiting laboratory where astronauts from all over the world live for six months at a time and conduct amazing experiments.
What is life like aboard this enormous spaceport? How does science research benefit humanity on Earth? Take a behind-the-scenes tour of the ISS without having to leave your seat!
Nichols also will present "Through the Eyes of Hubble" at 7 p.m. Monday, April 8.
The Hubble Space Telescope has had more impact on astronomy and the public’s awareness of astronomy than any other telescope in history.
This presentation will highlight some of the well-known, and not-so-well-known, images and science from the last 27 years of Hubble’s mission — and a sneak peek at Hubble’s 2018 replacement: the James Webb Space Telescope.
For the final program in the series, William Higgins will present "New Horizons" at 7 p.m.Monday, April 15. Higgins is an engineering physicist at Fermilab and a Jet Propulsion Laboratory ambassador.
The destinations of New Horizons, a spacecraft launched in 2006, are more distant than any other yet explored.
Its dramatic flyby of Pluto in 2015 revealed fabulous landscapes, a remarkable atmosphere, and a family of frigid moons. It kept moving onward for a billion miles.
On New Year’s Day 2019, New Horizons encountered the tiny asteroid-like object 2014 MU69, a frozen body that’s been dubbed "Ultima Thule."
At the edge of the Solar System, for years to come, the NASA mission will continue through a region known as the Kuiper Belt.
‘Rocket Men’ book By August 1968, the American space program was in danger of failing in its two most important objectives: to land a man on the Moon by President Kennedy’s end-of-decade deadline, and to triumph over the Soviets in space.
With its back against the wall, NASA made an almost unimaginable leap: it would scrap its usual methodical approach and risk everything on a sudden launch, sending the first men in history to the Moon — in just four months.

Texto completo: Air crash experts gathered in Ethiopia to analyze voice and data recorders from a Boeing 737 Max jetliner as controversy over the model's safety intensified after two fatal disasters in less than five months.
Experts from Ethiopia, the U.S., France and the European Union will study cockpit voice and flight data recorders, the Ethiopian Transport Ministry said Thursday in an emailed statement.
The U.S. Transportation Department has meanwhile ordered a full audit of the Max's 2017 certification. The Justice Department is also using a grand jury to help gather information. Weeks after a brand-new Lion Air 737 Max crashed in October in the waters off Indonesia, investigators representing the two departments and the FBI began digging into the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of a software system linked to the accident and why Boeing Co. didn't flag the feature in pilot manuals.

Boeing has said it will soon release a software update and further pilot training guidelines for the Max that will address concerns. The New York Times said the manufacturer will stop charging for a safety feature the two foreign 737s lacked. That feature, called the disagree light, is activated if a plane's sensors are at odds.
The inquiry into the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, software, has taken on new urgency since an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 fell from the sky in a similar fashion to the Lion Air plane minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on March 10.
In the aftermath, regulators around the world grounded the popular Boeing model.
For months, U.S. investigators have been digging into a range of matters related to MCAS, said people familiar with the probe who asked not to be identified because it is confidential. Representatives of Boeing and the federal agencies declined to comment.
"If I were a prosecutor, I would be looking at mail and wire fraud," said Gene Rossi, who spent three decades trying civil and criminal cases for the U.S. Justice Department. He said investigators are likely to examine whether documents related to the 737 Max exchanged between the FAA and the company contained any falsehoods and whether Boeing executives made any false statements to regulators.
"It could be a treasure trove -- if it's there -- but if I were a prosecutor I would definitely look at it," said Rossi, who now is with the Washington law firm Carlton Fields and is not involved in the Boeing investigation.
One facet of the investigation is exploring why pilots were widely unaware of the system, said a person familiar with it. There's no explanation of MCAS, or the steps needed to counter it, in U.S. and European pilot manuals. Boeing reasoned that pilots were already drilled to counter similar behavior by the 737's horizontal stabilizer by running through a checklist and flipping two center console switches. The FAA reviewed Boeing's analysis and agreed.
The MCAS does make an appearance in American Airlines Group Inc.'s flight crew operations manual -- in a section that lists acronyms.
The system had baffled the Lion Air pilots by pushing their plane's nose downward dozens of times, exerting more and more force until they lost control. The software patch was supposed to counteract the changed center of gravity on the Max, which boasts larger and more powerful engines than its 737 predecessors.
The MCAS intervenes automatically, without a pilot's knowledge, when a single sensor indicates the aircraft may be approaching a stall. The so-called angle-of-attack vane on the Lion Air plane provided a faulty reading.
In the case of the doomed Lion Air jet, the same aircraft was saved from disaster the day before the crash when an off-duty pilot told the crew how to disable the stall-prevention MCAS software.
Indonesia confirmed that a third pilot was in the cockpit.
With pressure mounting on Boeing over the troubled jet's certification process, establishing the cause of the Ethiopian tragedy has become crucial.
While Ethiopia is leading the investigation, a spokesman for France's Bureau of Inquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety said Wednesday that three of its experts would travel to Ethiopia to participate after the agency downloaded the flight data and cockpit audio recordings in Paris. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the FAA and Boeing were also invited, he said.
Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee has also offered to aid Ethiopian authorities, Chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said at a news briefing in Jakarta on developments in its investigation into the Lion Air crash.
Ethiopian Airlines had said the initial decision to send the so-called black boxes to France for decoding was strategic after the FAA was left isolated in the days after the crash, arguing that the Max should continue flying after other authorities had already grounded it. The French civil aviation safety agency has handled other major disasters in the past, including Air France Flight 447, which was lost in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, and Germanwings Flight 9525, which was flown into a mountainside in 2015 by its co-pilot.

The losers running for Democratic nomination

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Look at the losers running, or considering a run, for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I don’t mean that pejoratively. I mean it literally.
Beto O’Rourke’s presidential candidacy is the ultimate expression of the participation trophy culture on the left. It used to be you had to win on the state level before taking the national stage. Barack Obama won a Senate seat from Illinois before immediately declaring his intention to run for president. At the time, that was considered pretty audacious. He hadn’t accomplished anything in the Senate before he decided on a presidential run. But at least he won. O’Rourke lost his race to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., last year. He got a participation trophy. Apparently, he thinks that qualifies him to be the leader of the free world.
Well, he must have some accomplishments other than almost winning a Senate seat, right? Not really. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was flummoxed when asked what O’Rourke had accomplished in Congress, saying he “brought a great deal of vitality” to his work “preserving our planet and protecting our people.” (In fact, O’Rourke passed a single bill, H.R. 5873, which renamed a courthouse in his hometown of El Paso.) Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa was questioned by Ed Henry on Fox News, “What would you say is Beto O’Rourke’s top accomplishment that he brings to the table?” Hinojosa could not name a single one. “I’m not even talking about Congress,” Henry said. “What has he done in his life?” “Your question is meaningless,” Hinojosa replied.
So, if O’Rourke hasn’t accomplished anything, he must at least have some clear ideas of what he wants to accomplish in the Oval Office, right? Nope. The Post reports that “unlike candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who launched their campaigns with clearly articulated policy platforms, O’Rourke focuses more on sweeping calls for unity and pitching himself as the best antidote to the country’s toxic politics.” The motivation for his run, apparently, is him. As Vanity Fair’s Joe Hagan explains in a recent profile, O’Rourke “can’t deny the pull of his own gifts.” He tells a reporter, “Man, I’m just born to be in it.”
He’s not the only statewide loser taking the national stage. Stacey Abrams lost the governor’s race in Georgia in 2018, yet national Democrats tapped her to deliver the official rebuttal to the State of the Union -- a task normally given to those who actually won their races. And now, The Post reports, she is considering a race for president as well. “I think that I am a skilled communicator,” she said. “I think I’m a very good thinker. No, I know I’m a good thinker. I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience.”
Foreign policy experience? She served as minority leader of the state House of Representatives. Her official bio lists her as “former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations” (a temporary membership for young people) as well as “a Council on Italy Fellow, a British-American Project Fellow, a Salzburg Seminar-Freeman Fellow on U.S.-East Asian Relations, a Salzburg Seminar Fellow on youth and civic engagement and a Yukos Fellow for U.S.-Russian Relations.” That might qualify her for an entry-level job at a left-wing think tank, but it hardly qualifies her to be commander in chief. Even O’Rourke can claim experience on the House Armed Services Committee.
Democrats point out that President Trump had never won statewide office before running for president. That’s true. But he also had not run for state office and lost. He ran as a successful outsider, not as a failed insider. And unlike O’Rourke, he had actual accomplishments -- including a multibillion-dollar real estate empire.
This is not to dismiss O’Rourke’s chances. He raised a whopping $6.1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate, just edging out Sanders’s first day haul of almost $6 million. That is the best of any Democrat running for president so far. As the New York Times noted, “In a single day online, he raised nearly a quarter of what Barack Obama, then a senator, did in the entire first quarter of 2007.”
Apparently, Democrats like losers. We’ll soon see if one can win the presidency.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former FBI Director James Comey said in an opinion piece on Thursday that he did not want President Donald Trump to be impeached from office, writing that forcing him from office would only deepen the divide in the nation.
"I do have one hope that I should confess," Comey wrote in the New York Times. "I hope that Mr. Trump is not impeached and removed from office before the end of his term. "
Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017 from heading the FBI and overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, also wrote about what he hopes to see from the final report by special counsel Robert Mueller, appointed after Comey's firing, about Russia's role in the 2016 election.
He wrote that he was not "rooting" for Mueller to show that Trump "is a criminal," adding "I'm also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to 'clear' the president. "
"I'm not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work, charge whatever cases warrant charges and report on his work," Comey wrote.

While not taking any position on Trump's fate within the report, Comey did take a stand against calls for his impeachment, writing that while he believes that "Trump is morally unfit to be president," an attempt to oust him from office would further divide the country.
"If Mr. Trump were removed from office by Congress, a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup, and it would drive those people farther from the common center of American life, more deeply fracturing our country," he wrote.
Since the 2018 midterm elections, where Democrats took control of the House, the issue of impeachment has been a focal point and something that has divided members, including many progressives who oppose the president.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told USA TODAY on Monday that impeaching Trump would be "a gift to the president. "
"You're wasting your time, unless the evidence is so conclusive that the Republicans will understand," Pelosi, D-Calif. , told USA TODAY. "Otherwise, it's a gift to the president. We take our eye off the ball. "
The speaker said, instead of impeachment, Democrats needed to stay united in pushing through legislation that they campaigned on, such as addressing rising health-care costs and creating jobs. Pelosi said some House progressives have "wanted to impeach the president since the day he got elected. "
Comey said that instead of impeachment, the American people should be the ones to say whether the president should no longer hold office. That, he said, should be left up to the 2020 election.
"We need a resounding election result in 2020, where Americans of all stripes, divided as they may be about important policy issues — immigration, guns, abortion, climate charges, regulation, taxes — take a moment from their busy lives to show that they are united by something even more important: the belief that the president of the United States cannot be a chronic liar who repeatedly attacks the rule of law," Comey wrote.
Comey and his firing have been a lightning rod of contention throughout the investigation, specifically over concerns whether his dismissal constitutes obstruction of justice by President Trump. Trump has continued to repeatedly criticize the former FBI head, most recently in a tweet Wednesday evening where he accused Comey of leaking information about the Russia investigation.
Comey appeared in December before Congress in a closed-door session to testify about the Russia investigation and his decision not to prosecute former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server in 2016.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Mueller investigation. Heard of it?
After a year and 10 months of suspense, special counsel Robert Mueller is apparently nearing the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
It’s been a long time coming.
Thirty-four people have been indicted since Mueller opened his review in May 2017, including some of President Donald Trump's closest advisers and Russian intelligence operatives. Mueller’s investigation has already revealed many details about a sophisticated effort to influence the election and a campaign trying to benefit from that work.
But what his final report will look like remains a mystery.
Here’s your guide on what to expect from the Mueller report, whenever the moment we’ve all been waiting for arrives:
What will be in the report?
Mueller’s confidential report will explain why he filed the charges he did during the investigation, and why he might have declined to bring charges against anyone else. It could be short.
Sorry, but you probably won't see the report
After all the anticipation (and nail biting), you probably won’t get to see the Mueller report. At least for a bit.
Why? Justice Department rules require that Mueller submit a “confidential” report when his work is done. From there, his boss, Attorney General William Barr, gets to decide what happens. (Barr is the guy who will decide what the public can see, and when). The only thing Barr is required to reveal is whether Mueller’s bosses ever overruled him.
Trump has said he doesn't have a problem with the report becoming public.
More: Robert Mueller has spent two years investigating Trump, and he hasn't said a word. It's possible he never will.
Will we ever hear from Mueller himself?
Those who know him are betting on no.
Mueller isn’t required to make public statements about his work, according to Justice Department rules, so he doesn’t need to deliver a public record of his findings.
Plus, he’s stayed quiet since he was tapped in May 2017 to head the probe, despite intense public interest and scrutiny (including from the president).
Those who know Mueller say he's reluctant to speak publicly even when the circumstances seem to require it, so he's unlikely to do on his own at the end of this saga.
So, will Barr make the report public?
That's TBD.
Barr told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing in January that he wanted to be transparent, but he couldn't commit to releasing Mueller's report in full. Neither was he clear on whether he would permit Mueller to testify to Congress about his work, something Democratic lawmakers have hinted they might request. Some of what’s in the report could be information that’s required by law to remain secret. Instead, Barr has suggested he will prepare his own summary.
The claws are coming out
Congress wants to see Mueller’s findings and is preparing for a fight to see it.
Lawmakers from both parties — yes, both Republicans and Democrats — plan to press for access not just to the report but also to the evidence he gathered during the investigation. The demands would almost certainly set up a battle between Congress and the Justice Department.
More: What happens after Robert Mueller delivers his report? Congress braces for legal and political battles.
More: Rep. Adam Schiff: Democrats could sue if Robert Mueller's Russia report isn't made public
In particular, newly powerful House Democrats are exploring ways they could force the administration to turn over findings and evidence it might prefer to keep secret.
“We expect the full report," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N. Y. , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "If we don’t get it, we’ll do what we have to do to get it. If that means subpoenaing it, we’ll subpoena it. "
Republicans have also embraced the idea of obtaining Mueller's conclusions. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he expects a report that will reveal no wrongdoing by Trump. The House voted 420-0 in March to insist that they get a complete copy of whatever Mueller turns in.
Will that be the end?
No.
Mueller is just one of many potential legal problems for Trump and his inner circle. The list of investigations encircling the president seems to be growing by the day.
More: Michael Cohen's testimony prompts a new question: In web of Trump investigations, is anyone safe?
Both the targets and the total number of investigations is unknown, but we know various probes have examined Trump's campaign, family, charity foundation, inaugural committee and his businesses.
In New York:
The state attorney general subpoenaed two banks this week for financial records relating to several Trump Organization projects, the New York Times reported.
Federal prosecutors are still investigating campaign-finance violations within Trump's campaign even after his former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violations stemming from hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen has said he made the payments at Trump’s direction.
Cohen said he’s been in “constant contact” with federal prosecutors in New York about other investigations, but wouldn’t elaborate.
Trump’s inaugural committee was subpoenaed in February as part of an investigation into the group’s fundraising activities.
State authorities in New York have been investigating Trump's private foundation.
In Washington and Maryland:
Attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging Trump violated the Constitution's Emolument's clause, which bans gifts and payments from foreign governments. The case could allow officials some insight into Trump's business dealings and potential conflicts of interests.
In Congress:
Lawmakers are just getting started. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee opened a sweeping investigation this month into Trump and his associates, requesting documents from 81 "agencies, entities, and individuals" connected to the administration and Trump's private businesses.
The House Oversight Committee is also examining a wide array of topics, including Trump's communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House efforts in a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, whether Trump played any part in securing top-secret security clearances for members of his family and whether Trump violated the Constitution by accepting profits from foreign governments. The Committee welcomed Cohen earlier this month, then laid out an investigative road map that could include other Trump Organization employees.
The House Intelligence Committee is expanding its own investigation of Russian election interference.

Mosque attack shows need to regulate Facebook

Texto completo: Some 13 years ago, I alerted the higher education community about the misuse of a new social medium, noting that 20,247 of 25,741 students at Iowa State University were already registered, although many faculty and administrators had never heard about it.
The piece, "Facing the Facebook," appeared in The Chronicle of Higher Education. Here's an excerpt:
"On many levels, Facebook is fascinating — an interactive, image-laden directory featuring groups that share lifestyles or attitudes. Many students find it addictive, as evidenced by discussion groups with names like 'Addicted to the Facebook,' which boasts 330 members at Iowa State. Nationwide, Facebook tallies 250 million hits every day and ranks ninth in overall traffic on the Internet."
In late 2005, when I researched Facebook for my Chronicle piece, the platform boasted 5.5 million users. In 2012, Facebook surpassed 1 billion users. It tallied 2.32 billion active users at the end of 2018. If you count the company's WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, that figure rises to 2.7 billion.
That's a lot of power and profit. Facebook revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 rose 30 percent to $16.9 billion with profits rising 61 percent to $6.9 billion, according to the New York Times.
In 2008, during the Great Recession, we learned about banks being "too big to fail." When it comes to Facebook and our reliance on it, the platform may be too big to fail, given how many of us rely on it to interact with family, colleagues and friends.
As we learned last week in New Zealand, terrorists use it too, livestreaming a horrendous attack in which at least 50 people were slain while they worshipped in mosques.
Coincidentally, at about the time of the attacks, Facebook was promoting artificial intelligence meant to flag content violating community rules. The company touted its AI system's ability to distinguish a broccoli from a marijuana bud.
That same AI-sniffing system allowed the terrorist video to remain on the platform for 17 agonizing minutes.
That happened because Facebook is designed to share and sell with icons ready to post content on other social media, blogs and websites. Users are equipped, too, with applications for screen shots and video editing, all done instantaneously with a preprogrammed click or touch of a screen.
The mosque video quickly crossed platforms to Twitter and YouTube. As the New York Times noted, the platforms' AI systems could not outmatch human cunning smitten with an impulse to gawk at lurid images. Video and screen shots of carnage were shared and uploaded to networks around the globe. Worse, automated systems kept on sharing the content because it was "trending."
We should be distressed at the consequences of our collective digital interactions. Likewise, we should be alarmed by horrendous terrorist attacks. Perhaps we have become too accustomed to their frequency.
The point here is that social media has numbed us to such extent that we often cannot see how much we are using it, allowing the platform to shape our perceptions of each other and the world.
How much are you using Facebook? Go to "Privacy and Settings" on your smartphone and scroll down to "Your Time on Facebook."
You might be alarmed at the daily stats.
The New Zealand livestream is a tipping point. We need to face the Facebook anew for its several security breaches invading our privacy, for its spread of fake news undermining our democracy and for its lack of accountability when bad actors weaponize the service to spread hate with users as accomplices.
There are no easy fixes. In a previous Iowa View, I recommended that we build a new relationship with internet applications, requiring technology- and media-literacy education in schools and teaching the emerging generations about social media's influence on perception and our values as a community, state and nation.
We might go a step further. Congress should institute laws that regulate these social media behemoths that seem too big to fail, even though, time and again, they have failed us.

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King declined to give a definitive answer about whether white societies are “superior” to those that are nonwhite.

King, R-Iowa, was asked the question by 63-year-old Mary Lavelle, a constituent, in northern Iowa earlier this week, according to the New York Times.

“I don’t have an answer for that. That’s so hypothetical,” King told her. “I’ll say this, America is not a white society — it has never been a completely white society. We came here and joined the Native Americans.”

“I’ve long said that a baby can be lifted out of a cradle anywhere in the world and brought into any home in America, whatever the color of the folks in that household, and they can be raised to be American as any other. And I believe that every one of us, every one of us, is created in God’s image,” he said.

Lavelle said the question was prompted by anti-immigrant language used in the manifesto of the New Zealand suspect accused of killing 50 people in mosque attacks last week.

Republicans removed King from his committee assignments earlier this year after he questioned why the phrase “white supremacy” had become offensive. Some Republicans went as far as calling for his resignation from Congress, but King refused to step down and insisted his comments were mischaracterized.

Catherine Rampell: Alan Krueger's work on happiness was remarkable

Texto completo: Illustration Catherine Rampell Washington Post

When I first learned of Princeton University economics professor Alan Krueger's tragic passing over the weekend, I thought about happiness.
Sure, most people would probably associate this intellectual giant and longtime public servant with his work on the minimum wage. In a paper looking at cross-state labor markets, he upturned decades of conventional wisdom that said raising the minimum wage would necessarily reduce employment. His finding that a higher wage floor could actually increase jobs for low-wage workers has become a staple of Econ 101 syllabuses.
Or perhaps people think of his work exploiting strokes of luck (season of birth, Vietnam draft numbers) to reveal how randomly assigned additional schooling could affect earnings. These and other pioneering papers — which inspired an entire generation of economists to look for similar "natural experiments" — probably would have won him (and his co-authors) a Nobel Prize in the coming years.
Or maybe you've heard about the rock-star job he did as chair of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Or the rock-star job he did studying, well, rock stars. Or some of the other eclectic, off-the-beaten-path subjects that his omnivorous curiosity led him to, including: terrorism, the gig economy, Super Bowl tickets, offshoring, the digital divide or the relationship between income inequality and mobility (which he popularized as "the Great Gatsby Curve").
But, for me, his happiness research was top of mind. The cause of his passing hadn't yet been made public; in retrospect, maybe I wanted to think about this sunny stretch of research to keep from entertaining the dark possibility that his sudden death at 58 might be because of suicide, as his family would later confirm. Or maybe I was just thinking about it because it was the subject of one the last major assignments he gave me more than a decade ago, when I was his undergraduate research assistant. Stories of Alan's fundamental decency are legion, but let me personally attest: He was a terrific and unpretentious boss.
In fact, it was not until my junior year or so — when he invited me along to a TV interview — that I grasped what a big shot I was working for (and that perhaps I should stop showing up to his office in my ratty Snoopy-themed sweatpants). I cringe to recall, as a nobody 19-year-old, scribbling (likely unsolicited) suggestions in red pen across an op-ed he was drafting. But he was not the type to throw his weight around. I think he just laughed. He may have even used my suggestions.
In the years since, Alan served as a mentor, friend and generous advocate. In many ways, I owe my journalism career to him — not least because he suggested me when he heard the New York Times was expanding its economics coverage as the financial crisis erupted.
So why, all those years ago, was Alan studying happiness, a topic that usually falls under the fiefdom of psychology, not the dismal science? I don't know whether Alan felt he had a personal stake in the subject; right now, it's hard not to wonder, though he never said anything to me indicating this was the case. Then, as now, the research looked mostly like the perfect microcosm of what made Alan's scholarship so remarkable: That is, it was clever, resourceful, interdisciplinary, unorthodox and, most of all, public-spirited. Working with a team of elite psychologists, Alan measured what conditions and activities make people happy (both in the moment and in retrospect). He was interested in why lottery winners, paraplegics or others who experience a sudden change in life circumstances often returned to their previous levels of contentment. And how much cultural norms affected self-reported levels of happiness. (Are the French actually more miserable than Americans?)
To some economists, investigating happiness probably seemed silly. But Alan saw it as a central mission of his discipline. The whole point of economics is to figure out how, in a world of scarce resources, we can make people's lives better. And how is that possible without investigating and measuring their well-being — not their wages or the stuff they buy, but whether they are happy ? Efficiency, gross domestic product, other "traditional" economic metrics — these were at best intermediate goals, or imperfect proxies, for the overarching objective of human welfare. And Alan always had his eyes on this prize.
Alan found creative ways not only to study important problems but also to evangelize his findings. At one point, when academic-research-as-metaphor-for-the-human-condition looked like a trendy Broadway genre, Alan and I even discussed writing a play inspired by his happiness work.
The play never got off the ground, alas. But the plan was quintessential Alan: He was a scholar motivated to use every tool in his kit to leave the world a bit better than he found it. And for all the heartache those who loved him are now suffering, that's what he did.

Texto completo: For most people trying to figure out how to send their kids to college, the bribery-laced admissions scandal recently revealed by the Department of Justice is sickening. But even more so, it is tragic.
The DOJ has secured indictments against an array of 1-percenters including CEOs and actors, along with some college coaches and administrators. The wealthy suspects are charged with paying up to $1.2 million to guarantee their kids’ acceptance into elite colleges.
Beyond the absurdity of it - the student beneficiaries already have advantages far beyond almost all other applicants - is that the slots secured through bribes are thus denied to students who might have gained them by merit.
A 2014 study by economists Alan Kreuger and Stacy Dale, cited in The New York Times analysis feature, the Upshot, found that admission to an elite college did nothing to alter the prospects for students already in position to succeed because of other factors.
Admission made a huge difference, however, to good students from poor families because the elite schools provided them with social capital to which they otherwise would not have access.
For a kid in the top 1 percent, social mobility isn’t dependent on being admitted to Yale. But for a smart kid from the bottom 20 percent, admission to an elite school could accelerate him up the ladder.
Yet, as a policy matter, the gravest concern about college admissions usually involves affirmative action programs that attempt to open opportunities to students for whom it would make the greatest difference.
Policymakers should use the scandal as a lens on the need to make college accessible and affordable.

Texto completo: I used the free photo sharing site Flickr for a long time. It's where I uploaded most of my photos over the past 14 years. But then I got an e-mail from Flickr threatening to delete my pics unless I was willing to pony up $50 a year.
So I looked to see how many pictures I had on Flickr. I logged in and scrolled through more than a decade of memories: snapshots of my road trip to Van Buren, Maine; my visit to the “Goonies" house in Astoria, Ore.; vacation adventures in Hawaii, Miami, New Orleans . . . so many memories. All told, there were nearly 7,000 images and videos chronicling my travels, and Flickr was holding them for ransom.
A red box appeared on my computer screen. It was a message from Flickr, reminding me that from now on their free accounts would be limited to 1,000 photos or videos, and unless I paid up, my account would be purged on Feb. 5. It was a not-so-gentle reminder that online cloud services can change their pricing at any time — or go out of business entirely, and take all your precious photos with them.
SAVE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA
Just because you've uploaded your latest pics to Facebook, Flickr, or any other website doesn't mean they're safe, according to Sara Day Thomson, a spokeswoman for the Digital Preservation Coalition, a UK-based nonprofit that's dedicated to safeguarding digital content.
Social media sites, she explained, “are designed for sharing, not archiving."
“Holding all this data is expensive for platforms — keeping those massive servers up and running is a huge expense," she said. The bottom line: They don't have an incentive to hold onto your photos if they're not making money.
“These conditions make your social media content very vulnerable to loss," she said.
So what can you do to make sure your travel photos and other digital keepsakes survive for the next generation?
There's really only one solution: Download everything from your social media accounts.
That's what I ended up doing with my Flickr account. Instead of forking over 50 bucks, I chose to download all of my photos and videos.
Thomson says you should do this with all of your social media accounts. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google all offer the option of downloading your data (just log in and go to “settings," and you'll be on your way to preserving your digital legacy).
After you download your stuff from each account, make a backup copy. And then make this a regular habit.
“Social media marketing professionals or other highly active users should download their data every three to six months," said Thomson.
For more casual users, downloading every six to12 months should do, she said.
“Just set a reminder so you don't forget," she said.
DON'T GET STUCK WITH LOW-RES IMAGES
When it comes to social media, another thing to keep in mind is photo quality (or lack thereof). Every time you share a photo on social media, the chances are good that your image is getting compressed. Facebook automatically resizes and reformats every photo, which reduces the quality of the image.
But there is a way to upload higher resolution images and videos to Facebook. If you're using Facebook's mobile app on your phone, go to the account settings and choose to upload photos and videos in HD.
To do this on an iPhone, tap the menu button at the bottom right of the screen, scroll down and tap “settings and privacy," then choose “settings." Scroll down to “media and contacts" and then open “videos and photos," and make sure the “upload HD" button is switched to green.
If you're using an Android phone, open the Facebook app and go to “settings and privacy," then select “settings," and tap “media and contacts." Then choose “upload photos in HD" and “upload videos in HD."
DRIVES DON'T LAST FOREVER
You should always keep multiple copies of your important photos in different locations. That means if you have a photo on your phone and a copy living in the cloud, you should back it up on an external hard drive or thumb drive, too.
But as time goes on, you'll need to update those back-ups. Don't wait to move your files off of an old thumb drive — take the time to transfer them to a new device while you still can.
“Digital storage devices go out of date fairly quickly," Thomson said. “Some go out of date more quickly than others — flash drives have a very short life span and are extremely vulnerable to damage — though some are better than others."
She added, “Even external drives, which are sturdier, will fail after a while."
If you're using an external hard drive that's three to five years old, it's probably time to upgrade, according to Thomson.
And don't forget to label your storage devices. Take it from me: you don't want to end up with a drawer full of unidentifiable USB drives. Write up a cheat sheet that describes what each drive looks like and what it contains. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later.
CLOUD STORAGE
Brian X. Chen is a consumer technology reporter and author of the Tech Fix column for The New York Times, and he's tried out several different ways of managing smartphone photos. When it comes to cloud storage, he recommends using Google Photos to back up pictures. He says it's also an easy way to organize your pics.
Google Photos “takes advantage of artificial intelligence to help you organize and dig up photos," said Chen. “You could search for photos by typing in the word 'dog' and bring up all your photos of dogs, for instance."
There are plenty of other cloud storage options out there, too (such as iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon Drive, Box, or MediaFire). Just make sure you read the fine print, because pricing and restrictions on storage can vary, depending on which service you choose.
For example, Snapfish allows unlimited storage for your photos, as long as you purchase at least one Snapfish product each year (it could be a single 4x6 print — which is not a bad deal, as long as you remember to do it). Shutterfly, on the other hand, also promises free unlimited storage, which sounds great, until you read their fine print, and realize they don't offer full-resolution downloading.
Even if you find the perfect cloud storage solution for your needs, just remember that the services offered by these companies can change at any time, according to Thomson.
“Companies merge or go out of business — make sure you're aware of changes to the services offered by the cloud storage provider you use," she said. “If services change for the worse or go out of business, get your data to safety and move it to a more reliable cloud storage provider."
PRINT 'EM
Another way to preserve your favorite photos is to go old-school, and make hard copies that you can actually hold in your hand.
“There are plenty of printing services that do this if you don't have your own printer," said Chen. “I'm a big fan of framing my favorite photos via an app called Keepsake. You just upload your photo through the Keepsake smartphone app and pick a frame, and the photo ships to you framed. It's not very expensive, the frames look attractive, and framed photos always make a great gift for people."
And you don't have to spend much to print your photos the old-fashioned way, either. Snapfish, York Photo, and Walmart have prices that start as low as 9 cents per print. Slip the prints into an album, pop a couple in frames, or make a collage.
Another creative way to preserve your vacation remembrances is to put them in a photo book. Snapfish, Shutterfly, and Google are among the many companies that offer easy templates that you can use to design your own custom photo books. Be sure to take advantage of sales, too — Snapfish and Shutterfly regularly offer discount codes that can save you a bundle.
Put all your favorite photos from 2018 into one book, and you'll have a year of your travels nicely organized. Then make it an annual tradition. It's a fun way to make sure your vacation memories are preserved for many years to come.

Ethical hypocrisy in action

Texto completo: Democratic party strategists have made a staple of identity and grievance politics to harvest minority and female votes.
But when it comes to maintaining political power, party leaders seem content to gloss over their own members' offenses, at the expense of their most loyal supporters.
Sadly, too many media outlets beyond Hampton Roads seem willing to give them a pass.
Revelations earlier this year that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook page featured pictures of men in blackface and a KKK robe quickly led to calls from Democratic leaders for the governor's resignation.
But when two women surfaced accusing Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexually attacking them, and Attorney General Mark Herring admitted to his own blackface yearbook experience, the denunciation fever waned.
Staying true to the Democrats' zero tolerance policy would turn over the governor's mansion to a Republican, House of Delegates Speaker Kirk Cox.
Democrats would not even entertain allowing Mr. Fairfax's accusers a hearing in the Virginia legislature, fearing a media circus like that orchestrated by their U.S. Senate colleagues against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Faced with retaining power, or fidelity to the sensibilities of blacks and the #MeToo movement, Virginia Democratic leaders chose power.
But that is minor league compared to how Democratic leaders allow their radical wing to smear American Jews, a bastion of Democratic support, and Israel, a long-time ally and the Middle East's sole democracy.
Ilhan Omar, the Somali immigrant who became a congresswoman this year, repeatedly offends Jews as well as non-Jewish politicians with Tweets attacking Israel and its supporters. She repeatedly uses code words Jews say echo old smears that they have outsized influence and are disloyal to America if they support Israel.
When House members pushed for a resolution condemning Rep. Omar after more inane outbursts two weeks ago, left-wing Democrats including Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders rallied to her defense.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi portrayed Ms. Omar as a naive young immigrant who didn't understand the impact of her words.
But Ms. Omar's rants date back at least to 2012, when she Tweeted "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."
She was an up and coming political force at the time, so Minnesota State Sen. Ron Latz invited her to a meeting at his home with other Jewish Democrats to explain how such behavior and words could be viewed as anti-Semitic.
"We explained to her how hurtful, and factually inaccurate, they were," Sen. Latz told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. "Most of us came out of that conversation very troubled by the answers we received."
Given a chance to censure Ms. Omar for her current behavior, House leaders watered down the motion by not naming her and including condemnations of "Islamophobia" and racism, neither of which were at stake. She was even allowed to keep her position on the foreign policy committee.
Contrast that to the Republican reaction in January when Iowa Rep. Steve King made comments defending white supremacists: He was stripped of his committee assignments and unanimously condemned by the House.
When the New York Times, Des Moines Register and Time Magazine reported on King's punishment, they noted his history of racially insulting comments and questioned why Republicans had not moved sooner.
They might now ask Democrats the same.

Nate Silver: FiveThirtyEight will now cover Andrew Yang as a 'major' candidate

Texto completo: Polling analyst Nate Silver said Tuesday it's time to take Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang seriously.

"Andrew Yang has crossed the threshold where we consider him a major candidate," Silver said in a tweet linking to a story on his site titled "How Andrew Yang Could Win The 2020 Democratic Primary." Silver founded the polling aggregation site FiveThirtyEight.

Yang, who announced his candidacy over a year ago in The New York Times, has largely remained under the radar until his appearance on comedian Joe Rogan’s show last month. Since his appearance, Yang has grown an online following that calls itself the Yang Gang, and has helped him reach the Democratic National Committee’s requirements to reach the first debate in June.

Silver's endorsement of Yang’s campaign as a major 2020 player is another big step for Yang, as FiveThirtyEight is considered one of the top polling aggregation companies in the world. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight gave Donald Trump the highest percentage chance of winning the presidency of any polling model tracked by the The New York Times, even as many news outlets attacked Silver for overestimating Trump’s chances.

Silver and FiveThirtyEight are not the only election forecasters taking Yang seriously. Betting markets have Yang as high as a top five candidate for the democratic nomination over Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.

Would March Madness fans bet legally if they could?

Texto completo: The NCAA men’s basketball tourney starting this week will inspire 47 million Americans to wager $8.5 billion, Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, proclaims during a Monday conference call with the media.
More money will change hands during a few weeks of the tournament than the total value of goods produced and services provided in the nation of Haiti during an entire year. Nearly twice as many people bet on the tournament known as March Madness as they do on the Super Bowl.
"Americans like to bet on sports, and Americans do bet on sports," Miller says, adding that a survey shows only 4.1 million of those gamblers place bets legally with casino sportsbooks in Nevada or the seven states (Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) that legalized sports betting since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it possible.
Anyone in Illinois or those other states without legal sports booking who plunks down 5 bucks and fills out a bracket predicting the outcomes for all 68 teams in an office pool or with friends is breaking the law, although arrests are practically nonexistent.
"Most people don’t even know the activity they are participating in is illegal," Miller says. The American Gaming Association, the gambling trade group representing casinos, pushes the idea of making gambling on sports, including contests with amateur college athletes, legal in all states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has touted the idea as a way to help raise funds in Illinois, and bills to make that happen are brewing.
"Unlike any other sporting event in the country, March Madness attracts millions who fill out brackets, make casual bets with friends or wager at a legal sportsbook, which Americans can now do more than ever before," Miller says.
I first became emotionally invested in the March Madness tournament as a kid in 1969. Having played out a simulation of the final game on my driveway hoop a hundred times, I was confident my Purdue Boilermakers and superstar shooter Rick Mount were going to vanquish a UCLA team led by center Lew Alcinder. UCLA won 92-72, Alcinder went on to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mount went on to open a hunting and fishing store in his hometown of Lebanon, Indiana, and I learned that those of us who follow our hearts instead of our heads aren’t going to do well picking winners in NCAA tournaments.
That didn’t stop me from picking an all-Hoosier Final Four whenever possible, selecting from teams such as Indiana, Purdue, Butler, Notre Dame, Indiana State and Valparaiso. That gave me a few champions (thanks, IU) in the 1980s, and some stunning upsets (thanks, Butler and Valpo), but never a complete bracket that finished in the money. When The New York Times first gave readers a chance to fill out a bracket online, my picks after Day One had me among the top 25 people in the nation. By Day Two, I had fallen out of the top 1,500.
I haven’t even bothered to fill out a bracket in recent years, which makes me a winner (or at least a non-loser).
People want to bet on March Madness, and they do it illegally if they don’t have a legal option, Miller says.
Even if Illinois legalizes sports betting through the proper channels, people might still participate in illegal office pools because it’s more fun losing money to a co-worker than to a giant gambling institution. Miller adds that the casino industry spends $300 million on "responsible gaming" programs to recognize and help people for whom gambling is a problem.
My problem with gambling today is that I did enter a free online bracket pool and my simulation has Purdue, the only team from Indiana, winning the championship game 92-72 over Michigan State.

Texto completo: The NCAA men’s basketball tourney starting this week will inspire 47 million Americans to wager $8.5 billion, Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, proclaims during a Monday conference call with the media.
More money will change hands during a few weeks of the tournament than the total value of goods produced and services provided in the nation of Haiti during an entire year. Nearly twice as many people bet on the tournament known as March Madness as they do on the Super Bowl.
"Americans like to bet on sports, and Americans do bet on sports," Miller says, adding that a survey shows only 4.1 million of those gamblers place bets legally with casino sportsbooks in Nevada or the seven states (Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) that legalized sports betting since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it possible.
Anyone in Illinois or those other states without legal sports booking who plunks down 5 bucks and fills out a bracket predicting the outcomes for all 68 teams in an office pool or with friends is breaking the law, although arrests are practically nonexistent.
"Most people don’t even know the activity they are participating in is illegal," Miller says. The American Gaming Association, the gambling trade group representing casinos, pushes the idea of making gambling on sports, including contests with amateur college athletes, legal in all states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has touted the idea as a way to help raise funds in Illinois, and bills to make that happen are brewing.
"Unlike any other sporting event in the country, March Madness attracts millions who fill out brackets, make casual bets with friends or wager at a legal sportsbook, which Americans can now do more than ever before," Miller says.
I first became emotionally invested in the March Madness tournament as a kid in 1969. Having played out a simulation of the final game on my driveway hoop a hundred times, I was confident my Purdue Boilermakers and superstar shooter Rick Mount were going to vanquish a UCLA team led by center Lew Alcinder. UCLA won 92-72, Alcinder went on to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mount went on to open a hunting and fishing store in his hometown of Lebanon, Indiana, and I learned that those of us who follow our hearts instead of our heads aren’t going to do well picking winners in NCAA tournaments.
That didn’t stop me from picking an all-Hoosier Final Four whenever possible, selecting from teams such as Indiana, Purdue, Butler, Notre Dame, Indiana State and Valparaiso. That gave me a few champions (thanks, IU) in the 1980s, and some stunning upsets (thanks, Butler and Valpo), but never a complete bracket that finished in the money. When The New York Times first gave readers a chance to fill out a bracket online, my picks after Day One had me among the top 25 people in the nation. By Day Two, I had fallen out of the top 1,500.
I haven’t even bothered to fill out a bracket in recent years, which makes me a winner (or at least a non-loser).
People want to bet on March Madness, and they do it illegally if they don’t have a legal option, Miller says.
Even if Illinois legalizes sports betting through the proper channels, people might still participate in illegal office pools because it’s more fun losing money to a co-worker than to a giant gambling institution. Miller adds that the casino industry spends $300 million on "responsible gaming" programs to recognize and help people for whom gambling is a problem.
My problem with gambling today is that I did enter a free online bracket pool and my simulation has Purdue, the only team from Indiana, winning the championship game 92-72 over Michigan State.

Texto completo: Durante la preparación del juicio a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , los fiscales federales sellaron varios temas relacionados con sus testigos, principalmente cooperantes, que pudieran afectar su credibilidad al ser cuestionados por los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa.
Los abogados del New York Times y de VICE News presentaron mociones para exigir que se diera a conocer esa información que se ocultó en la mayor parte del proceso que ocurrió entre el 5 de noviembre de 2018 y el 31 de enero de 2019.
Uno de los primeros documentos revelados fue parte del testimonio previo de Alex Cifuentes , exsocio de Guzmán Loera, quien reveló que el mexicano pagó por menores de hasta 13 años para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas en sus escondites en las montañas de Sinaloa.
Sin embargo, hay más secretos por revelar, debido a la presión jurídica de los medios mencionados. En enero, el juez Brian Cogan determinó que se diera a conocer esa información y los fiscales elaboran una lista de qué darán a conocer paulatinamente.
“Los fiscales federales revelaron parte de los documentos del juicio de ‘El Chapo'” , informó Keegan Hamilton, reportero de VICE News. “El material incluye información adicional de Alex Cifuentes y las actividades sexuales de ‘El Chapo’ con menores de edad”.
#BREAKING @vicenews: Prosecutors just unsealed a new batch of court documents from El Chapo's trial.
The material includes additional info on witness Alex Cifuentes and Chapo's "sexual activities with underage partners"https://t.co/Gk8QSKAZwU pic.twitter.com/QVRpDFNQiL
— Keegan Hamilton (@keegan_hamilton) March 15, 2019
“Un hilo sobre la secrecía en el capo del Chapo: En enero el juez Cogan, respondiendo a abogado del NYT, ordenó a la defensa y a fiscales revelar algunos de los muchos, muchos documentos en el caso”, señaló el periodista Alan Feuer , del Times.
A thread about the ongoing secrecy in the Chapo case:
In January Judge Cogan, responding to lawyers from the NYT, ordered the defense and prosecution to unseal some of the many, many secret documents in the case. The two side created a schedule (see below.) The judge endorsed it. pic.twitter.com/6BSU4Gnd0H
— Alan Feuer (@alanfeuer) March 16, 2019
Los documentos compartidos por Hamilton establecen una lista de temáticas sobre las cuales los fiscales no querían que se hablara en la corte, ya que pudo afectar la credibilidad de sus cooperantes. Los representantes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos indicaron que los hechos no estuvieran directamente relacionados con las acusaciones contra Guzmán Loera, por lo que eran irrelevantes para el juicio.
Por ejemplo, se menciona al cooperante CW1 –identificado como Cifuentes– y la violencia doméstica contra su esposa, incluso agresiones durante su embarazo, así como sus interés sexual en menores indistintamente del sexo.
En el punto se menciona la complicidad sobre asuntos sexuales que Cifuentes mantenía con “El Chapo”, pero no se brindan mayores detalles.
“Actividades sexuales de CW1 y demandadas con socios menores de edad (miembros del Cártel de Sinaloa)”, indica el documento. “El acusado también busca interrogar a CW1 acerca de detalles altamente escabrosos concerniente a la actividad sexual que él y el acusado tuvieron con parejas menores para dos razones: (1) presenta una inconsistencia con la forma en que CW1 vio el tratamiento de otros menores, a saber, hombres jóvenes entre las edades de 16 y 17 años ; y (2) lleva en la relación de CW1 con el acusado, aunque el acusado busca limitar el testimonio acerca de su propia persona “, indica el documento en referencia a que los abogados de Guzmán Loera quería desacreditar a Cifuentes sin afectar a su cliente.
También se habla de sacar a la luz aquellos temas relacionados con esoterismo y el culto a sectas como los Illuminati, la vida extraterrestre, así como homicidios desconocidos y otros casos que pudieran afectar a cooperantes y al propio Guzmán Loera, lejos de los 10 cargos en su contra por los que fue hallado culpable.
La sentencia de “El Chapo” está programada para el 25 de junio, pero en las siguientes semanas se espera que los abogados presenten una solicitud de nuevo juicio, luego de que un jurado revelara que no se siguieron las reglas ordenadas por el juez Cogan.

Texto completo: El economista Alan Krueger , quien fuera asesor financiero de los expresidentes Barack Obama y Bill Clinton se suicidó este fin de semana a los 58 años de edad. La noticia de su fallecimiento la anunció este lunes la Universidad de Princeton (Nueva Jersey) donde el economista impartía clases. Más tarde, la familia del difunto hizo público que Krueger había acabado con su propia vida .
En la mañana del sábado, la policía de Princeton encontró el cuerpo sin vida del profesor en su propia casa . Poco después del anuncio del fallecimiento, tanto Bill Clinton como Barack Obama expresaron públicamente su admiración hacia Krueger como economista y servidor público y mostraron sus condolencias hacia su familia.
“Alan Krueger fue un economista brillante para el interés público ” -dijo en Twitter el expresidente Clinton. Y resaltó la investigación de Krueger que desembocó en la subida del salario mínimo . Entre 1994 y 1995, durante la administración Clinton, Krueger fue el economista jefe del Departamento de Trabajo.
Según indicó el rotativo The New York Times, donde Krueger colaboraba habitualmente, el economista investigó la relación entre el salario mínimo y el desempleo . Su conclusión fue que que establecer una cantidad no reducía el empleo de aquellos trabajadores con menor renta. Recientemente, como también resalto Clinton es su tweet, estudió el papel de la epidemia de los opiáceos -emergencia nacional desde 2017- en la reducción del empleo entre los hombres .
Alan Krueger was a brilliant economist for the public interest—from his research proving that raising the minimum wage doesn't increase unemployment, to his recent work showing that America's opioid epidemic has increased it. My thoughts are with his family. We lost him too soon.
— Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) March 18, 2019
Por su parte, Barack Obama dijo en declaraciones que “ Estados Unidos había perdido un economista brillante y muchos de nosotros a un amigo querido “. El expresidente también resaltó que la política económica de Krueger estaba enfocada en “mejorar la vida de la gente”.
Krueger fue asesor de Obama durante la crisis financiera de 2008 y también durante su posterior recuperación . También fue subsecretario del Tesoro y más tarde presidente de Consejo de Asesores Económicos de la Presidencia estadounidense.
Según el Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EEUU (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés); las muertes por suicidios, drogas, medicamentos y alcohol alcanzaron un máximo histórico en 2017: más de 150,000 personas, una cifra que dobla la de 1999 .

Kids aren't growing up: Shocking new poll says parents are killing kids' life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
Meet the 'lawnmower parent,' the new helicopter parents
What type of parent are you? Lawnmower? Helicopter? Attachment? Tiger? Free-range?
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of young people ages 18 to 28.
Parents contacting their adult child's boss
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor’s appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn’t sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child’s grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
Growing up means making mistakes
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
“The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid,” Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's difficult for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you’re doing it in high school, you can’t stop at college,” she said. "If you’re doing it in college, you can’t stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life. "
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own lives. "You can’t just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

Seeking Clues Behind Trump's Weekend Twitter Barrage

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- There was no golf. There were no meetings. There were no activities, other than a rare visit to church. So President Trump did what he could do: He tweeted.
Since his election, Mr. Trump has averaged about 16 tweets per weekend, according to a New York Times analysis of his tweets as collected by the Trump Twitter Archive website. But last weekend proved to be an unusually active 48 hours online for Mr. Trump: From Friday morning to Sunday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted over 50 times, counting the retweets that amplified supporters who have limited public reach on their own.
Ensconced in the White House, Mr. Trump saw enemies everywhere, and his tweets reflected that, stoking new tensions and nursing past grievances.
He took on "Saturday Night Live," which on March 16 aired a rerun from Christmas, and suggested that the Federal Communications Commission "look into" late-night shows and examine them for anti-Trump bias. He accused Senator John McCain, who died of brain cancer last year, of collaborating with Democrats and claimed that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was "last in his class" at the Naval Academy. (Mr. McCain actually graduated fifth from the bottom.) And he defended Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News opinion hosts who have been under fire for making bigoted statements, encouraging Fox executives to "stay strong" in the face of criticism.
Mr. Trump's advisers have shared with him data showing that even his supporters do not like the tweet storms, and have advised him to act more "presidential" as his re-election campaign draws nearer. At rallies, even die-hard Trump fans who arrive early dressed in "MAGA" gear admit that while they are willing to overlook the president's online musings, they would prefer seeing fewer of them.
Mr. Trump often likes to buck the advice he gets, and it was clear over the weekend that he was trusting his gut again, and going his own way.
"Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country," he said in a tweet on Sunday that appeared to be directed at Fox executives who had temporarily removed Ms. Pirro from her Saturday night slot after she suggested that Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, may practice Shariah law.
"The losers all want what you have, don't give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die!" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He also singled out two weekend Fox News anchors, Arthel Neville and Leland Vittert, who are less opinionated than the late-night hosts who double as the president's personal friends and informal advisers, asking rhetorically whether they were "trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse."
Later on Sunday, he shared a homemade meme from a little-known Twitter user, who goes by the handle @LonewolfnDuke, which depicted him as "an American president having to fight an American government to protect American citizens."
But it was unclear what had provoked the president's flurry of activity, and even advisers were searching for the normal cues that set him off: White House officials performing poorly on the Sunday show circuit, or the president's delayed distillation of negative coverage from the week before.
Mr. Trump on Friday was rebuked by Senate Republicans, 12 of whom voted with Democrats against a national emergency to build a border wall. But the border barely figured into Mr. Trump's weekend tweets, which appeared to be driven more by idle hands and an empty weekend schedule.
People who spoke with Mr. Trump on the phone over the weekend said he seemed to be in good spirits. Others who communicated with him said he had spent some time railing privately against Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director. But they also said he appeared to be a little aimless, and the outpouring seemed to be more driven by a lack of structure. Mr. Trump had skipped his regular weekend trip to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, because of a family commitment that kept him grounded in Washington.
There was a four-hour lull in Mr. Trump's online activity on Sunday, when he left the White House to visit St. John's Church for St. Patrick's Day. But for the most part, the president -- bored, agitated or both -- appeared to spend the weekend online.
Mr. Trump shared with his 59.1 million followers a report circulating on right-wing sites that Minnesota Democrats had grown unhappy with Ms. Omar, and accused a "Democrat" union leader in Ohio of standing in the way of putting an idling General Motors plant in the state back into operation.
Jack Posobiec, a Trump supporter known for advancing conspiracy theories on Twitter, including "Pizzagate," marveled that his messages were being retweeted by the leader of the free world. The president shared two tweets initially sent by Mr. Posobiec, one a local news article about an MS-13 gang stabbing, and another criticizing CNN over a segment examining the links between Mr. Trump and white nationalism.
"I realize the president's just reading my Twitter account going through the tweets," Mr. Posobiec said in a 13-minute video he posted analyzing the experience. "Let's see what else he's up to today."
As is often the case, there was a correlation between what appeared on Mr. Trump's Twitter feed and the programming on Fox News. The weekend tour into conspiracy theories kicked off on Friday, when Mr. Trump elevated a nascent movement that calls itself "Jexodus," the brainchild of a conservative Jewish activist that describes itself as a group of "proud Jewish millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics."
"The 'Jexodus' movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, although there is no evidence to suggest that Jewish voters have been deserting the party. But Mr. Trump appeared to be reacting to an appearance on "Fox & Friends" by the group's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Pipko, a former model and Trump 2016 campaign staff member.
Brian Ott, who studies the effects of rhetoric at Texas Tech University and is the author of a book studying Mr. Trump's tweets, said the president appeared to have become less concerned with the consequences of his messaging.
"Not only is it already getting worse," Dr. Ott said, "I don't think we've even seen the tip of the iceberg yet. As these investigations begin to close in on him, really his only play is to stoke vitriol and violence."
Tweeting has also become a normal part of how the president circumvents the news media and his own advisers to communicate to the public what is on his mind. But the weekend whirlwind was so unusual that it created its own mini news cycle, with targets using their own platforms to respond and aides fielding questions from reporters about the president's mental state.
Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, defended him on Monday morning after her husband, George Conway, spent the weekend raising concerns about "Narcissistic Personality Disorder" and said on Twitter that Mr. Trump's "condition is getting worse."
"No, I don't share those concerns," Ms. Conway told reporters outside the White House.
Meghan McCain, a host of "The View" and the daughter of Mr. McCain, said the attacks -- which included a presidential retweet of a woman who claimed that "Millions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain" -- only made her feel bad for Mr. Trump's family.
"I can't imagine having a father that does this on the weekends," Ms. McCain said.

Texto completo: The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies. New Jersey is not immune. More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud. Welcome to the new normal. Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age.
Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches – affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies – and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records – more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password – that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
At a hearing in Trenton last month, Gerard Keegan, vice president for state legislative affairs with CTIA, a trade association for the wireless communications industry, argued that the proposals would have unintended consequences and could undercut many of the products and services that people enjoy.
"Many news sites, online content providers, apps provide those services and products free of charge because they are supported by advertising," Keegan said.
"To force those companies to still provide those services and products to consumers who won't share identifying information with advertisers is wrong and will possibly lead to those companies' being shut down in the state."
The future of the bills remains uncertain, but their introduction reflects a growing awareness among residents and lawmakers about how information shared online can be used, abused or stolen.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said. "Make that decision carefully. Give it the thought and provide it the internal weight that it deserves."

U.S. and China Seek April Deadline, But Tariffs Hang Over Trade Talks

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The United States and China are pushing for a summit meeting in late April to complete a trade deal, while negotiators are still grappling over its terms and how they should be enforced.
Although much remains unsettled, one thing is becoming clear: The Trump administration will continue to hold the threat of tariffs over Beijing to ensure that it lives up to whatever commitments it agrees to in the final deal. That approach is prompting concern among American businesses that the economic damage and uncertainty caused by President Trump's trade war could persist even once negotiations are resolved.
On Friday, a report commissioned by the nation's biggest business lobbying group showed that the Trump administration's tariffs are actually damaging an industry the levies were intended to protect. The report, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Rhodium Group, a research firm, said that Mr. Trump's tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods were eroding the competitiveness of the America information technology sector -- including companies that manufacture computers, electronics and telecom equipment, as well as provide services like cloud computing, computer-aided design and customer relations.
The report estimated that the tariffs, if they remain in place, would reduce United States gross domestic product by at least $1 trillion within 10 years. The American G.D.P. was about $20.5 trillion in 2018.
The business community, along with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, have been critical of Mr. Trump's tariffs but they have been willing to carry the costs of Mr. Trump's trade war if it brings about needed change. Executives across industries say they support efforts by Mr. Trump to reset an economic relationship that has too often put United States companies and workers at a disadvantage.
"There's no cheap way to pursue these kinds of policy objectives," said Daniel Rosen, a founding partner of the Rhodium Group, a research firm with extensive experience in China, and one of the authors of the report.
Businesses have long complained of unfair treatment in the Chinese market, including pressure to hand over valuable technology and discrimination against foreign companies operating there. The Trump administration has calculated that China's hacking intrusions and coerced acquisitions of technology cost American companies at least $50 billion a year alone.
But it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's final deal will achieve the kind of change that would make the fight worth the cost. American negotiators have been pushing China for more substantive economic changes than it seems willing to accept, including rolling back subsidies to Chinese companies and lowering barriers to foreign competition.
China's lawmakers last week passed a sweeping rewrite to its laws on foreign investment. While the reforms are a nod to Mr. Trump's concerns, some China experts criticized the language as overly broad and say it represents only a step toward the kind of more transformative changes that are needed.
The president has insisted he could "walk" if America does not get what it wants from China. But he also wants to avoid further roiling a jittery stock market, which has fallen on news of a prolonged trade war, and to limit economic damage ahead of the 2020 election.
That is prompting concern among Republican lawmakers and American businesses that Mr. Trump could ultimately accept a weak deal that includes high-profile purchases of American products like liquid natural gas and soybeans but only vague and ultimately unenforceable commitments in more important areas of structural reform.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump lauded the Chinese as "very responsible and very reasonable," and said there would be news on China "one way or the other" over the next three to four weeks.
"We could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory fairly easily here," said Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist. He said that the president had succeeded in amping up leverage on China, but that the administration risked squandering that leverage for a deal that focused primarily on product purchases.
"Nobody thought Trump would be able to pull it off -- he has," Mr. Bannon added. "Now you might throw it away."
The administration had been pushing toward a signing summit meeting with Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping to resolve the trade conflict at the end of March. But outstanding differences over how the two sides would roll back their tariffs and enforce their agreement have prolonged the talks.
In a meeting last week, the president huddled with Vice President Mike Pence, the trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and other advisers to discuss whether China is serious about offering concessions or if it was merely paying lip service to Mr. Trump, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Thursday that the administration was "pleased with the progress" of the talks and that "a lot of documents" were moving back and forth but acknowledged that a signing ceremony this month was out of the question.
"We still have more work to do," Mr. Mnuchin said. "It's more important we get the right agreement and not rush it, but we're working diligently to try to do this as quickly as possible."
The Chinese are now pushing for Mr. Xi's trip to take the form of a state visit to Washington, though plans are still in flux, people with knowledge of the discussions said.
Susan Shirk, chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, said it would take negotiators time to test which of the objectives the Chinese were able to give ground on, and which they were not.
"If my supposition that this is actually a more professional negotiation, a more serious one, is correct, then it's not surprising it would need more time," Ms. Shirk said. "It doesn't mean things are bad."
Mr. Trump's summit meeting in February with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which ended abruptly when Mr. Trump felt the other side was not producing enough concessions, may be another reason the United States-China event has been pushed back. The Chinese are wary of sending their president halfway around the world only to return empty-handed. They have been trying to iron out the details beforehand.
"We don't need another U.S.-North Korea summit, where so much was left unresolved, and in which both sides were hoping through the force of personality to persuade the other side to their viewpoint," said Gary Locke, an American ambassador to China during the Obama administration. "You need all the minutiae negotiated ahead of time."
A final deal could also be stymied by America's insistence that it be allowed to use tariffs against China if Beijing does not uphold its end of the agreement. China is pushing for the United States to lift all the tariffs the administration has already imposed and there is concern among Chinese officials about agreeing to a deal that does not remove all the tariffs or that allows the United States to impose additional levies in the future.
Mr. Trump has previously suggested the United States could keep some tariffs in place, even if a deal is reached.
"Without the tariffs, we wouldn't be talking," Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in January.
In testimony before Congress last week, Mr. Lighthizer declined to specify whether the administration would lift all of its tariffs when a deal is struck, or hold some of the levies in place and roll them back only once China accomplishes certain reforms. People familiar with Mr. Lighthizer's thinking say he prefers the latter approach, but he could yet be overruled if the White House is eager to secure a deal.
In China, the tone has turned more positive, potentially presaging a conclusion to the talks. Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer spoke with Vice Premier Liu He by phone on Thursday and made "further substantial progress" on the text of the deal.

Texto completo: DAYTON, Ohio - Every Sunday from March to October, Larry Weinstein plans music for people here in Daytot, on the towering Deeds Carillon which rises above the city's south side. Suspended between four limestone columns, the carilon's 57 bells cover two octaves and play in response to Weinsteh's touch on a keyboard.
The 15 story tower is a beloved landmak. It is also one of many extra-large exhibits at Carillon Historical Park, a 65-acre open-air museum focusing on technology and nnovation.
Openair museums, as their name inplies, display their collection soutdoors, often because of the size of the artifacts - thought here is a wide variety in subject matter. A museum in Japan features a hotel entrance and lobby. In Germany, prehistoric hones can be toured.
While the size of the exhibits can be jaw-dropping, the museums an not simply guardians of the thngible. Their curators say they are demonstrating the birth of in idea, acknowledging a developmental pivot point or preservingan era.
Greenfiold Village
Opened in 1929, Greenfield Village in uburban Detroit is actually jus one part of a complex of museuns and schools assembled by Henry Ford (and known togethe as the Henry Ford). The villagels arranged like a small American town, using historic buildirgs, vehicles and equipment collected from all over the United States.
The 13 large artifacts in the museun demonstrate America's transiton from agriculture to industy, and highlight the history of he people who designed, worked or lived in them.
"Ford wanted to remember the hard work and values of creating a country like America, and he wanted those to be preserved so people could learn from them," said Patricia Mooradian, the president of the Henry Ford.
For example, the tenacity required to endure and challenge slavery is explained through audio recordings of slave stories, piped into the small cottages where they lived on South Carolina's Hermitage Plantation.
Visitors can tour Thomas Edison's Menlo Park laboratory and see how the inventor's first experimental electric-lighting system was put into use at the Sarah Jordan boarding house, where his lab workers lived.
Exhibits like these "provide a unique immersive educational experience," Mooradian said. "Don't ignore the power of an artifact. When I can put my hands on something, that memory stays with me."
Visitors can interact with the exhibits by watching wool be spun or by moving around the village in a historic steam train. Sometimes, museum presenters explain the artifacts using iPads and other technology and prod people to consider how they, too, can comribute to society.
"Our whole museum is about the future," Mooradian said. So when visitors are impressed by someone in the past, "they can think, 'I can do that, too.'"
Carillon Historical Park
Greenfield Village may also own the original home of Orville and Wilbur Wright, Dayton's most famous sons, but Carillon Historical Park has the 1905 Wright Flyer III, the brothers' first "practical airplane."
In addition to the Wright brothers, there were many others in Dayton who played important roles in the industrialization of America. They called themselves the "Barn Gang" because they worked in the backyard barn of the engineer and inventor Edward Deeds. That barn, now part of the museum, was the workshop for ideas like car ignitions and refrigerators and calculators.
The Wright Flyer III, which is a national landmark, is perhaps the museum's most famous exhibit. But the exhibition space is important as well because figuring out how to show it off was also Orville Wright's idea. He designed the circular structure that gives visitors a 360-degree view of the. Flyer.
"It was the world's first pilot's last project," said Alex Heckman, vice president for museum operations.
In another tribute to the longevity of some inventions, a 150-year-old brewery at the park still makes beer using original methods and serves food - so the exhibit does double duty as the museum cafe.
Skogar Museum
The recorded history of Iceland spans more than a millennium, but its transition from an agricultural feudal state to modern society was compressed into just seven decades.
"For 1,000 years, daily life basically did not change much," said Andri Gudmundsson, the managing director of the Skogar Museum on Iceland's southern coast.
His open-air museum features several reconstructed turf homes - rustic stone and sod-roofed dwellings that Icelanders repeatedly rebuilt and reused for centuries.
Residents and tourists "are often dumbfounded and fascinated" by the homes, Gudmundsson said, often finding it "hard to believe people used to survive here in these conditions."
During the concentrated period of development that began after World War II, thousands of turf homes were destroyed, according to Sigurjon Baldur Hafsteinsson, a professor of museum studies at the University of Iceland. This was not only to make way for modern buildings but also because Icelanders were embarrassed by the difference between Iceland and other European cultures with multiple layers of developmental history.
"Today I would say that opinions of Icelanders are changing toward a more favorable appreciation," Hafsteinsson said. Now, turf homes tell a story of the rugged resiliency of the nation's Viking descendants.
Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen
Thousands of years ago, people lived in wooden cabins perched above lakes in areas that are now Germany and Switzerland. Scientists believe that the homes were constructed on a foundation of wooden piles driven into the lake bed.
The remnants of these lake homes and other artifacts from 4,000 to 850 B.C. are part of the five-acre, open-air Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen, also known as the Lake Dwelling Museum, on Germany's Lake Constance. Twenty reconstructed lake homes depict life in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.
A walk along the elevated footpath above the lake allows visitors to get a feel for life in this prehistoric community. In 2006, two German families got a chance to do more than use their imaginations: They were invited to move in for two months as part of the television series "Stone Age - The Experiment."
In an article addressing the educational value of the museum, Gunter Schobel, the museum's director, said, "Dry scientific data are not themselves appealing to the public.
"A visitor these days is able to discriminate between an artificial theme park and the authenticity of an open-air museum that explains the present through the reality of the past.

Texto completo: NEW ORLEANS - Le Musée de f.o.C. is devoted to the story other free people of color of New Orleans, as told by their descendants.
Kim Colanan, 29, a curator at the nuseum whose grandmother was born three block from Le Musée, says that he sees it as a "reminder of who built the city cultually, politically and econonically," even as the Black population of the surrounding Tremé-Lafitte neighborhood dropped to 64 percentfrom 92 percent after Hurrrane Katrina.
Before the Civil War, free people of color made up a higher proportion of the population in New Orleans than anywhere else in the United States. At the time of the Lousiana Purchase, free Blackresidents made up about 30 percent of the city's population, largely because Fench and Spanish officials had allowed enslaved people to purchase their freedom.
Le Music de f.p.c. is on the first foor of a grand, white-pilared mansion on Esplanade Avenue. Two hundred years ago, French-spaking Afro-Creole free people of color owned much of the property along Eplanade, a broad boulevarcshaded by massive, gnarbed live oak trees.
Free people of color, or gens de coleur libre, were highly educated, though their occupations didn't always relect that. Some held proninent positions - as conposers, artists, artisans - but their primary occupations were carpentes, cigar makers, shoemakers, laborers and deliverymen. They also played anotable role in the city sugar industry in the early 800s, after thousands of fee people of color arrived torn the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now Hait.
"In this area, free people of color eft their fingerprints one very thing," said Beverly Itanton McKenna, a newspaper publisher who founded the museum in 2008 with her husband, Dwight McKenna.
In the museum, the history is told through rooms hung salon-style with documents, paintings and photographs that shed light on the French and Spanish colonial eras and enslavement, the Civil War and Reconstruction. Alongside sculpture in the museum's front parlor stands a sizable portrait of Louis Charles Roudanez, the pioneering Paris-educated physician and Civil War-era publisher whose spirit guided the McKennas' vision for the museum.
Despite the grandeur of the setting and its deep history, the museum's name reflects the humiliations that free people of color, no matter how wealthy, endured before the Civil War. In documents, their racial status was abbreviated in lowercase letters: f.p.c. They couldn't vote or hold public office, couldn't establish organizations without permission. In many of the painted portraits women wear tignons - head wraps that a Spanish governor began requiring of all women of color in 1786 - as a way of indicating inferior status.
The museum's tours, which are by appointment only, are led by one of about a dozen docents, almost all of whom have roots within the city's community of free people of color. When docent Delores Heglar, 71, is giving a tour, she likes to spend a little extra time explaining the Louisiana Purchase and its devastating effect on the city's free people of color.
"Think of it this way," Heglar said. "I'm a lawyer. I can practice freely. I have money in the bank. If a white person commits a crime against me, I can go to court. I can move freely around the city, whether I'm slave or I'm free. But once the United States purchased Louisiana and Louisiana becomes a state, I have to carry papers wherever I go. I can no longer speak in court. I have to have a white person represent me, even though I have more money than he does and my law degree is probably better."
In other American cities, these racial restrictions might have seemed routine. But in New Orleans, free people of color had already experienced freedom, Heglar said. "So naturally, if you put your thumb on me, I'm going to find a way to resist."
And many did resist. During Reconstruction, free people of color were the driving force behind Louisiana's progressive constitution in 1868, which gave equal civil and political rights to all Black men and established a state-funded, racially integrated public school system.
After Reconstruction was scrapped, a committee of New Orleans activists, including a shoemaker, Homer Plessy, plotted a legal case against racially segregated train cars, an 1892 effort that backfired with the U.S. Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, ushering in the Jim Crow era across the Deep South.
Then in the 1960s, descendants of the same New Orleans community fought, once again, for voting rights and school integration, in ways that led the nation.
In the days after Hurricane Katrina, the McKennas founded Le Musée de f.p.c. in the same spirit, as a remonstrance to arguments that many of the city's poorest Black citizens should not return. By that time, they had collected a lifetime of documents, photographs and artwork. Not a scrap of it was ruined in the waters that flooded 80 percent of the city after the storm.
"To us, it was a sign that we should open our collection and share it with people who are not familiar with this rich history," McKenna said. "You could say, in a way, that it's been hidden from us."
Today, inside Le Musée de f.p.c, walls and shelves reveal rarely seen documents - manumission papers granting freedom to former slaves, property records showing that one-third of the French Quarter was once owned by people of color and, finally, a replica of a petition that was hand-delivered in 1864 to President Abraham Lincoln by two prominent free Black men from New Orleans, Arnold Bertonneau and Jean Baptiste Roudanez, the brother of Louis Charles.
The petition, signed by more than 1,000 free men of color, asked Lincoln to enact universal suffrage for Black men. "We are men, treat us as such," the petition read.
The president met with the two men, told them that their suffrage was up to the state of Louisiana, and then wrote a letter to Louisiana's governor urging him to allow some Black voters.
On a side wall of her museum, McKenna displays a photograph of her great-grandmother, who was born into slavery in Giles County, Tennessee, in 1860. Below it hangs a photo of her father as he graduated from Meharry Medical College in Nashville in 1929. By 1933, her father became one of the first two Black men elected to the Indiana State Legislature.
"This is who we are," McKenna said. "This is our story."

Texto completo: This week's question: Consider this your 365-day warning: On March 17, 2020, Illinois, Florida and Arizona will hold presidential primaries, becoming the 22nd, 23rd and 24th states to do so.
What storylines should we be paying close attention to between now and then? That's the question we posed to this week's panel in part one of a two-Sunday miniseries.
DONNA BRAZILE
Former DNC chair became first African-American woman to direct a major presidential campaign (2000, Al Gore)
"Democrats aren't divided on what they want -- fair and honest elections, economic opportunity, human rights for all, universal health care, action on the environment and an America engaged with our allies to defend ourselves.
"The candidate to watch is the one who can best articulate how to achieve all that.
"The candidate to watch is the one who won't just be the next president, but will be the future president, with everything that 'future' implies."
KARL ROVE
aka 'The Architect' -- George W. Bush's nickname for the strategist credited with the 43rd President winning two terms
"Keep an eye on the reaction of college-educated suburbanites to the unfolding presidential campaign.
"Traditionally Republican-leaning, they provided Democrats their winning numbers in the 2018 House races and could determine the outcome in a number of close battleground states in the 2020 presidential race."
JIM VANDEHEI
Co-founded Politico in 2006, Axios in 2017
"To me, few things matter more than how voters -- and ultimately, lawmakers -- grapple with the unprecedented power of the big tech companies.
"Do we regulate them, do we break them up, or do we leave them alone?
"With artificial intelligence and machine learning upon us, our ability to tame -- and make the best of -- technologies that can change the world is an existential challenge."
MIKE MURPHY
A-list GOP political media consultant, 'Meet the Press' regular
"I will be watching the growth in real wages. That's what people will really be thinking about when they vote next November.
"I will also be watching to see if the Democratic party will evolve from all this silly uber-progressive self-indulgence at the start of their primary process toward a more pragmatic 'it's all about beating Donald Trump' viewpoint as the primaries really start next January."
MARY FRANCES BERRY
Former chair, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
"Immigration and refugee policy is an issue worth following.
"The west, including the United States, needs a comprehensive review to meet current needs. Court decisions inhibiting the implementation of current policies just exacerbate the polarization around the issue.
"Given demography, climate change, economic inequality and repressive and corrupt governments, migration will likely increase.
"Gun control is good, but it won't stop the violence. In Britain, knives are used."
JENNIFER DUFFY
Senior editor, Cook Political Report
"Among the current Democratic field, is there a candidate who can successfully bridge the divide between the progressive and more establishment wings of the party?
"That's the question."
BOB DALLEK
1955 UI grad and presidential historian, won 1979 Bancroft Prize for his book on FDR
"I'm most intrigued by two questions: How did we get here or why would voters find someone with zero political experience worthy of being president?
"A second question is: What long-term effect will his administration have on the presidency?
"I will try to answer the first question in a book I am writing: 'How Did We Get Here? From TR to Donald Trump.'"
RICK DAVIS
John McCain's national presidential campaign manager in 2007-08
"The story line I'm watching this election cycle is: Where will the suburban women go?
"Suburban women fueled the rise of the GOP in the post-Nixon era. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and his son all benefited from a decisive GOP edge with those soccer moms. Even Candidate (Donald) Trump got his fair share of those voters against the first major party woman candidate for president.
"But in 2018, those suburban women voters opposed the Trump pitch that the midterm was all about him and voted decisively for the Democrats nationally and locally.
"What happens next with suburban women will decide the 2020 presidential election and most down-ticket races. It's too early to tell where they will land, but government shutdowns and investigations are not a good start.
"They have already voted once in mass against a great domestic economy. Will they do it again, potentially giving the White House, Senate and House of Representatives to the Democrats?
"Stay tuned."

"Women played a crucial role in the 2018 midterms, with more running and more actually winning elected office than ever before.
"But they also played a crucial role in engagement. They marched, they phoned their congressperson, they protested, they ran phone banks out of their kitchens, they knocked on doors. It was unprecedented.
"I am curious to see if that sort of engagement will result in a woman on the ticket in 2020 and ultimately in the Executive."
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN
New York Times columnist wrote 'Too Big to Fail,' co-created Showtime's 'Billions'
"I see the issue of inequality and questions about capitalism versus socialism being the biggest force in the 2020 election.
"We're already starting to see the beginning of that debate play out."

Controversial author of 'the truth about marijuana' to speak in Colorado Springs

Texto completo: Starting at The Denver Post before a decade at The New York Times, Alex Berenson left journalism to launch his fiction career, bursting onto the scene with “The Faithful Spy.” Inspired by his war correspondence, his first mystery thriller was a bestseller.
He continued with a popular series. “Honestly, I was getting paid very well to write those books,” he says from his Hudson Valley, N.Y., home. “It’s funny when people accuse me of doing this for the money. I get paid a lot more to write fiction than to write nonfiction.
“But this is something I feel I need to do. That’s why I’m doing it.”
By “this,” Berenson means his deep dive back into nonfiction. As for accusations, he has faced many since January’s release of “Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.”
The Nation and Rolling Stone called the book “fear-mongering” and “trolling,” respectively. Vox wrote it off as “an exercise in cherry-picking data and presenting correlation as causation.” But The Marshall Project, the nonpartisan investigative reporting center, deemed it “an intensively researched and passionate dissent from the now prevailing view that marijuana is relatively harmless.”
Berenson also was blasted in an open letter by 75 scholars and clinicians for “irresponsibly and dangerously claim(ing) a causal link between marijuana use and increases in rates of psychosis and schizophrenia.”
Which is all disappointing to Berenson, who will state his case in Colorado Springs and Denver this week during talks sponsored by The Gazette, Colorado Politics and Children’s Hospital Colorado.
If You Go
Alex Berenson will be in Colorado Springs and Denver this week to talk about his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence."
• Noon to 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at Springs' Warehouse Restaurant, 25 West Cimarron St.
• 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, 2201 East Dry Creek Road, free and open to public
• Noon to 1:30 p.m. in Denver at the History Colorado Center at 1200 North Broadway
The opioid epidemic has come in the profiting wake of companies such as Purdue Pharma, “and now a for-profit community has sprung up for the use of” marijuana, Berenson says. Fellow journalists should be asking harder questions, he says. “It’s crazy to me that that hasn’t happened.”
He expected the criticism but not the personal attacks — the suggestions to get his kids high and the harassing calls to his wife, a forensic psychiatrist. It was her repeated mentions of marijuana in violent cases that made Berenson curious in the first place. He previously considered himself “a libertarian” on pot, having smoked “a handful of times in college and after,” he says. “I didn’t particularly care about it one way or another.”
He expected controversy before he even typed the prologue, which establishes the book as an argument and, in his words, “not balanced.” Berenson’s stance is further announced by the title, a nod to “Reefer Madness.” (The early propaganda film originally was called “Tell Your Children.”)
Yes, Berenson knew users wouldn’t appreciate his book.
“People have a really strange attachment to this drug,” he says. “I think most people who use alcohol, if they’re using it every day and certainly if they’re using it all day every day, they’re going to acknowledge, you know what, maybe I have a little problem with this.
“And by the way, if you’re using cocaine or heroine or methamphetamine like that, you’re not even gonna tell people. But cannabis people are proud to tell you they wake and bake.”
Berenson, a 1994 Yale graduate, cites a 2017 study by the National Academy of Medicine that said “cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk.” In a New Yorker piece stirred by Berenson’s findings and titled “Is Marijuana as Safe as We Think?”, Malcolm Gladwell wrote that the committee’s statement was “one of its few unequivocal conclusions.”
But committee member Ziva Cooper took to Twitter in January to say “we did NOT conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia.” She wrote that since the report, “we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use” and that cannabidiol “improves outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.”
Berenson has stood by his reporting. After his wife switched the light bulb in 2016, he went to London to meet with concerned psychiatrists at King’s College, among scientists around the world he interviewed. He pulled records from several states and nations. He came to the Colorado prison holding Richard Kirk to talk at length with the man who blamed a marijuana edible for shooting and killing his wife in 2014.
Berenson says he could have reported longer. “But my feeling was, I don’t need to do that, I don’t need to reinvent the wheel here, because science is really clear. And this is a really important issue for public health ... It’s more important that I get it out.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - A U.S. Navy veteran held in Iran, the first American known to be detained since President Donald Trump took office, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, his lawyer said Saturday.
Mark Zaid told the Associated Press that Michael White was convicted on charges of insulting Iran's supreme leader and posting private information.
Zaid says he learned of the sentence from the State Department, which in turn learned of it from the Swiss government, which looks over American interests in Iran.
Iranian state media have not reported the sentence, which was first reported by the New York Times.
White, of Imperial Beach, California, went to Iran to see a girlfriend he met online and had booked a July 27 flight back home. He never returned.
Families given earth from crash
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Grieving family members of victims of the Ethiopian air disaster are being given sacks of earth to bury in place of the remains of their loved ones.
Officials have begun delivering bags of earth to family members of the 157 victims of the crash instead of the remains of their loved ones because the identification process is going to take such a long time.
Families are being given a 1 kilogram (2.2 pound) sack of scorched earth taken from the crash sites, members of two different families told the Associated Press. An Ethiopian government official confirmed this. All insisted upon anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
"The soil came as it became impossible to identify bodies and hand over remains to family members," one family member said. "We will not rest until we are given the real body or body parts of our loved ones."
Forensic DNA work has begun on identifying the remains but it may take six months to identify the victims. However, authorities say they will issue death certificates within two weeks. The victims of the crash came from 35 countries.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."

Texto completo: Christopher McDougall, a well-known Peach Bottom author who runs and writes about it, has a publication date for his next book and this time it has an interesting twist: running with donkeys.
McDougall, who wrote two previous books about running and survival called "Born to Run" and "Natural Born Heroes," regularly runs with unusual exercise partners. He's run barefoot with members of the Tarahumara tribe in the Copper Canyon in Mexico as well as with Amish runners along Lancaster County's country roads and parkour crews on London streets (and Lancaster). But now he's found another running partner in a donkey named Sherman.
McDougall's latest book "Running with Sherman: The Donkey with the Heart of a Hero" is set to be released on Oct. 29.

Tweet:
"Running with Sherman" is thundering toward the starting line: as of today we've got a cover and release date. Look at that cutie....
Running with Sherman: The Donkey with the Heart of a Hero by Christopher McDo... https://t.co/PiNeCFNup9 via @amazon
— ChristopherMcDougall (@ChrisMcDougall) March 12, 2019
------------
The book, according to the blurb on Amazon, details McDougall's experience rehabbing a neglected donkey named Sherman and then training with it for a burro race competition in Colorado.
In 2016, McDougall posted a series about running with Sherman on the New York Times website.
McDougall was interviewed in 2015 for LNP's Sunday magazine. At that time, he hinted that his next project would be about human and animal connections.

Conservative lawyers steal page from progressive playbook

Texto completo: For liberals, legislative defeats are just a temporary setback until the real battle begins in court.
Whether it’s environmentalists shutting off water to Central Valley farms or the ACLU demanding sex changes for prisoners, left-wing groups have long used the courts to advance their political agenda. Now, the Resistance has taken it one step further with 46 taxpayer-funded state lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Conservatives have been quick to criticize activist judges legislating from the bench and slow to match the left’s artful use of lawfare as a political tactic — until now. Conservatives are slowly awakening to the importance of lawfare and how legal challenges can thwart the progressive agenda.
What can conservative lawfare accomplish?
Harmeet Dhillon, my RNC counterpart and California RNC committeewoman, just filed suit seeking to prevent the powerful teachers’ unions from taking dues via mandatory paycheck deductions/
Dhillon is following last year’s Janus decision, which restored the First Amendment rights of thousands of union workers. The National Education Association lost 72,325 dues-paying members. More than 6,000 teachers left the New York State United Teachers. According to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, 86,000 workers in California dropped their unions over the past year. That’s a 5 percent net drop in union enrollment.
“Until Janus, California’s government unions could force public servants to pay the unions,” explains Mark Bucher, founder and CEO of the California Policy Center, which has helped educate union members about their rights. “That coercion allowed union leaders to collect $2.7 million per day — about $1 billion per year. No other political player in the state even comes close, and that makes our union leaders the unelected rulers of California.”
Conservative lawfare is challenging fake news peddled by the mainstream media. Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student unfairly vilified for attending a pro-life march, filed suit against the Washington Post and CNN for “using its vast financial resources to enter the bully pulpit by publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles … to smear a young boy who was in its view an acceptable casualty in their war against the president.”
News reports that Sandmann’s attorneys have “sent preservation letters to more than 50 media organizations, celebrities and politicians — including The Post, The New York Times, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and actors Alyssa Milano and Jim Carrey — the first step in possible libel and defamation lawsuits.”
Last year’s Supreme Court 7–2 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop gave the owner permission to refuse certain services based on his First Amendment claim of free speech and free exercise of religion. The conservative lawfare Alliance Defending Freedom took the case to the Supreme Court, defeating the ACLU.
Harmeet Dhillon represented the Young America’s Foundation and Berkeley College Republicans in their legal challenge to UC Berkeley’s censorship of conservative speakers Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and David Horowitz. Under the settlement, UC Berkeley not only changed its “Major Events Policy” and security fee schedule but also paid out $70,000 in attorney’s fees. My firm along with Freedom X 1st Amendment pioneer Bill Becker represent several injured participants at the Berkeley riots when Milo attempted to speak.
Conservative lawyers throughout the country are fighting battles defending the First, Second and Fifth Amendments with success. Nonprofit law firms such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, the libertarian Center for Individual Rights and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty are making dramatic legal precedents and proliferating. George Mason University renamed its law school the Antonin Scalia Law School. Spontaneously, hundreds of lawyers and firms are building a nationwide movement of conservative lawfare warriors to challenge the progressive agenda. This is a big step toward developing a national network of conservative and libertarian lawyers to share tactics toward defeating the left.

Commentary: Joke’s on them. Bribing your way into Yale is a waste of money

Texto completo: Any parents who bribed and cheated to get their kids into elite universities would be buying into a pervasive misconception. It's easy to assume that because students from elite schools make more money (they do), that going to those schools is what causes them to make more money. This is wrong.
How do we know? When researchers have investigated the value of going to a top high school or college, they've found the long-term financial benefits are, as one paper says, "comparable to zero." That is, students with the same abilities and ambitions will do equally well whether they go to an elite college or not. It's the kids who make the school - not the school that makes the kids.
In one telling study, a team of Princeton University economists followed students of comparable test scores and grades who applied to the most elite high school in the Boston area - Boston Latin. Some were admitted and others were rejected. The researchers also looked at comparable students accepted and rejected by second-tier selective high schools in the Boston area.
Boston Latin boasts much higher average SAT scores than second-tier schools, and those in turn boasted of higher SATs scores than the nonselective schools. The implication is the quality of education at these elite education boosts SAT scores.
But when the economists compared students with similar grades and test scores at the time they applied to high school, they found their later SAT scores were indistinguishable, whether they went to Boston Latin or not. The economists did the same comparison between similar students applying to second-tier schools and those attending unselective high schools, and again found SAT scores were indistinguishable.
The findings suggest there was absolutely no SAT advantage to going to the better schools. The higher average SATs in Boston Latin were probably caused by the selection process; the schools only admitted kids who did well on other tests, and those other test scores correlate to SAT scores.
This is all laid out in the book "The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success," which I've been rereading. As the author, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, wrote: "We've established that, as a group, the Boston Latin kids do perform better when compared to their counterparts. … What the data tells us, though, is that the difference … is not because the school enhances their performance. It's because high achievers continue to excel no matter what education a school offers."
Another pair of economists, one also at Princeton University and the other at the research firm Mathematica, demonstrated that going to an Ivy League school doesn't help people make more money. They found it's more likely that Ivy League schools select for the kinds of students likely to make more money as adults.
In an initial study in 2002 and a follow-up study published in 2011, they compared students at Ivy League schools to those who were accepted but chose, perhaps for financial or personal reasons, to attend less selective colleges. In the second study, they also included students who had applied to Ivy League schools but were not accepted.
On average, Ivy League graduates come out earning twice as much as graduates of less selective schools, but when the researchers compared only students who were accepted into the Ivy League, there was no difference between those who went and those who did not, provided those rejected graduated from some other college.
The 2011 study, which was popularized in this New York Times column, showed that future financial success for comparable students didn't even hinge on where they were accepted, but did correlate with where they applied. The researchers speculate that applying to Harvard shows ambition, and ambition is correlated to financial success.
If the Ivy League bribery scandal played out as prosecutors suggest, with parents paying off officials, then some of the applicants deserve sympathy — for they are, like everyone else, limited by their own talents and ambitions. And those honest families trying to follow the rules can take heart that even if the cheaters hadn’t been caught, they wouldn’t have bribed their way into anything of lasting value.

Media amplifies New Zealand shooting suspect's 'manifesto,' giving mass killers a platform

Resumen: A mass killer doesn't want to be remembered as just some nut. Coverage of their personal writings and so-called 'manifestos' indulge that delusion.

Texto completo: Many of the details surrounding the hideous slaughter of dozens of innocent victims at a pair of New Zealand mosques are still unclear. However, one key element — the underlying motivation for the attack — is distressingly obvious, outlined in a lengthy diatribe filled with hatred for minorities and immigrants as well as those who endeavor to assist and protect them.
I have only skimmed the online document by the alleged gunman, identified as 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant. Despite the vague title, “The Great Replacement,” it doesn’t take very long to become sickened by this man’s ugly ideas and explicit directives for like-minded white supremacists to execute specific politicians on the left.
It has become fairly common for mass killers, both the political and pathological, to post online or by mail an explanation for their crimes. Through letters, manuscripts, or videos, they want us to know that they have a bonafide reason for murder — by their way of thinking, it is justifiable homicide. They do not wish to be seen or remembered, if deceased, as just some nut who killed innocent strangers for no good reason.
Read more commentary:
New Zealand mosque massacre proves social media giants don't deserve their power, freedom
Facebook, YouTube and social media are failing society. Pull their ads until they change.
Blame social media for making us more hasty and emotional. Can we fix this?
Besides my abhorrence for the substance, it is hardly worth my time to read “The Great Replacement” from cover to cover. I get it, the author feels marginalized and wronged because he is being denied advantages supposedly promised by virtue of his race.
Media coverage gives killers a platform
Various social media have taken appropriate steps to remove the hater’s online footprint. Unfortunately, the conventional media is giving this undeserving hate monger a platform and a wide audience by quoting from sections of the document. Thanks to telling excerpts, millions around the world are now aware of this man’s apparent point of view, far more than the limited readership of his vitriol posted online in advance of the killing spree.
It is also inappropriate to label documents like this as a “manifesto. ” It is a term typically used with regard to an important political statement crafted by a public official or a person of prominence, not a mass murderer.
This practice started when the Washington Post and New York Times published, under coercion, Theodore Kaczynski’s 35,000 word thesis, which actually was titled, “The Unabomber Manifesto. ” Since then, the term has been regularly misapplied to killer communiques.
Charleston, South Carolina, mass killer Dylann Roof himself indicated that the media should stop characterizing his writings as a manifesto. As for “The Great Replacement,” the word “manifesto” appears just once in the entire document, but not in the context of describing the work.
Don't overplay a killer's biography
I have long insisted that the news media should indeed publicize the names and images of mass killers, a position contrary to a large number of my colleagues in criminology. That limited information hardly promotes celebrity. However, following up with excessive details about the killer’s lifestyle and belief system tends to humanize the assailant and can invigorate others of like minds.
In addition to downplaying the words of a hate monger, we shouldn’t overstate the notion that the alleged New Zealand gunman was “inspired“ by Dylann Roof or even Norway’s Anders Breivik. He may have endorsed their ideas and respected their violent acts that were designed to eliminate a hated minority group. But he certainly didn’t need them to establish his own murderous plan. The concept of killing a perceived threat or enemy is hardly a modern-day creation.
In the coming days, we should hear heart-wrenching stories about the victims — what they believed in and what they meant to family and fellow worshipers. We already understand the detestable ideology that prompted this hate crime. We need not know more about the assailant’s biography, as that would serve no real purpose and literally add insult to injury.

Resumen: Despite some softness over the last few weeks, U.S. stocks are still considered a safe haven relative to the rest of the world, said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The S&P 500 has been holding within 2,750 and 2,850 points the past couple of weeks and isn't likely to break out of that range until there's a major change in the trade talks, Federal Reserve policy or other another major market-moving development, said Ioana Martin, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. The Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. homes slumped 6.9 percent in January, a possible sign that would-be buyers paused during the government shutdown even as mortgage rates continued to decline.

Texto completo: U.S. stocks indexes barely budged Thursday as the market's three-day winning streak stalled.
The benchmark S&P 500 index finished essentially flat as losses in communications, industrial and health care stocks outweighed gains in financial and technology companies. Several retailers and homebuilders also declined.
Reports of a criminal investigation into Facebook's data-sharing practices weighed on the social media giant's shares.
The market was coming off a solid three-day rally as it reclaimed some of the momentum it had in January and February.
Investors are still waiting for some more news on U.S.-China trade negotiations before they feel comfortable pushing the market much higher. Media reports had stoked hope that a summit would take place this month, but no concrete announcement has been made.
Despite some softness over the last few weeks, U.S. stocks are still considered a safe haven relative to the rest of the world, said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
"We're still the lead sled dogs here, we're pulling the global economy along," he said.
The S&P 500 index slipped 2.44 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,808.48. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 7.05 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,709.94.
The Nasdaq composite dropped 12.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,630.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 6.25 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,549.63.
Major indexes in Europe finished higher.
The S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow and Russell 2000 are showing double-digit gains for the year so far.
Still, investors spent Thursday in a wait-and-see mode, keeping a close watch on global trade issues and continuing to mostly brush off the chaos surrounding Britain's exit from the European Union, its key trading bloc.
The S&P 500 has been holding within 2,750 and 2,850 points the past couple of weeks and isn't likely to break out of that range until there's a major change in the trade talks, Federal Reserve policy or other another major market-moving development, said Ioana Martin, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
"Unless we have any additional catalysts or any meaningful change in communication from the Fed or from the trade front, it's difficult to see how we could break outside of that range," Martin said.
Take-Two Interactive Software led the slide in communications companies. The stock slid 3.8 percent.
Facebook fell 1.8 percent after the New York Times reported that its data-sharing practices are now under criminal investigation.
The investigation into how it sells data is the latest in a list of privacy scandals the social media company faces. Its privacy practices have already been scrutinized by The Federal Trade Commission. The company and its CEO have also faced Congressional inquiries.
Boeing fell 1 percent. The stock has slumped throughout the week as nations and airlines ground its newest 737s over safety concerns. A second deadly crash over the weekend involving its 737 Max 8 and safety concerns stunted the company's stock gains.
Retailers were among the big decliners Thursday.
Tailored Brands, which owns Men's Wearhouse, plunged 25.1 percent after giving investors a surprisingly weak first-quarter profit forecast. The company has been trying to increase sales at both Men's Wearhouse and its Jos. A. Bank stores, but is facing a tougher retail market.
Shares in other apparel retailers also fell. L Brands dropped 3.1 percent, while Gap gave up 1.8 percent.
Dollar General slid 7.5 percent after the company's fourth-quarter profit fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The discount-store operator also gave investors a weak full-year profit forecast.
Rival discount chain Dollar Tree dropped 1.9 percent.
The Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. homes slumped 6.9 percent in January, a possible sign that would-be buyers paused during the government shutdown even as mortgage rates continued to decline. The report also showed sales prices declined 3.8 percent. Homebuilder stocks were mostly trading lower following the report. Hovnanian Enterprises dropped 2.5 percent.
Technology companies and banks led the gainers. Apple rose 1.1 percent and Wells Fargo added 0.9 percent.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.63 percent from 2.61 percent late Wednesday.
The dollar strengthened to 111.73 Japanese yen from 111.05 yen on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.1300 from $1.1329.
The price of U.S. crude oil rose 0.6 percent to settle at $58.61 a barrel, while Brent crude dropped 0.5 percent to close at $67.23 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline declined 0.4 percent to $1.85 a gallon, heating oil slid 0.4 percent to $1.98 a gallon and natural gas picked up 1.2 percent to $2.86 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The price of gold fell 1.1 percent to $1,295.10 an ounce, silver dropped 1.8 percent to $15.17 an ounce and copper lost 1.5 percent to $2.89 a pound.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Aleksej Gubarev is a Russian technology entrepreneur who runs companies in Europe and the United States that provide cut-rate internet service. But he is best known for his appearance in 2016 in a dossier that purported to detail Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election -- and the Trump campaign's complicity.
Mr. Gubarev's companies, the dossier claimed, used "botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership."
On Thursday, new evidence emerged that indicated that internet service providers owned by Mr. Gubarev appear to have been used to do just that: A report by a former F.B.I. cyberexpert unsealed in a federal court in Miami found evidence that suggests Russian agents used networks operated by Mr. Gubarev to start their hacking operation during the 2016 presidential campaign.
[Read the report here.]
His networks also appear to have been regularly used by cybercriminals and Russian agents to conduct other attacks, such as an assault on Ukraine's power grid in 2015, the report found.
Yet the report stops short of directly linking Mr. Gubarev or his executives to the hacking, as asserted in the dossier. As Anthony Ferrante, the report's lead author and a former F.B.I. agent, noted in a deposition: "I have no evidence of them actually sitting behind a keyboard."
Mr. Gubarev has insisted that neither he nor his businesses knowingly took part in the Russian hacking. He backed up his denials by filing a defamation lawsuit against BuzzFeed, the first news organization to publish the dossier, which became public in January 2017. The report unsealed Thursday was commissioned by BuzzFeed to fend off Mr. Gubarev's suit, which was dismissed in December when the court found BuzzFeed's decision to publish protected under the law.
Evan Fray-Witzer, a lawyer for Mr. Gubarev, said that hackers using a client's servers was hardly unique for a web-hosting company, or any tech company. Mr. Gubarev should not be held responsible for the misuse of his network by others that he neither approved nor knew about, Mr. Fray-Witzer said.
"You could say the same thing about Google's infrastructure and Amazon's infrastructure -- and no one is accusing them of hacking anyone just because hackers used their infrastructure," he said.
The report was released after months of legal wrangling by Mr. Gubarev's lawyers, who strenuously fought to keep it under wraps, arguing that it was one-sided and would unfairly tar their client. The New York Times, acting independently of BuzzFeed and Mr. Gubarev, asked the court in October to unseal all of the evidence in the case.
For all of its details of Russia's hacking, the report is unlikely to settle the questions that linger around the dossier more than two years after it became public. But for those who believe the president's loyalties are with Moscow, the report's suggestions of a link between Mr. Gubarev and Russian hacking is likely to spur new demands for renewed investigations, even as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, appears to be wrapping up his investigation.
The dossier is made up of a series of reports compiled in the summer and fall of 2016 by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who runs a firm that conducts investigations for businesses and other clients. The work was done at the behest of President Trump's political rivals, a fact that Mr. Trump and his allies have seized on in an effort to undermine the Russia inquiry by falsely claiming that it began because of the dossier.
Parts of the dossier have proved prescient. Its main assertion -- that the Russian government was working to get Mr. Trump elected -- was hardly an established fact when it was first laid out by Mr. Steele in June 2016. But it has since been backed up by the United States' own intelligence agencies -- and Mr. Mueller's investigation. The dossier's talk of Russian efforts to cultivate some people in Mr. Trump's orbit was similarly unknown when first detailed in one of Mr. Steele's reports, but it has proved broadly accurate as well.
Other parts of the dossier remain unsubstantiated, or nearly impossible to verify, such as its most salacious charge: that the Russians have a video of Mr. Trump cavorting with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel in 2013. At least one accusation -- that Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer, met in 2016 with Russian officials in Prague -- now looks false after Mr. Cohen, who has turned sharply against Mr. Trump, denied last month during congressional testimony ever visiting Prague.
The report commissioned by BuzzFeed to investigate the dossier did not set out to prove any of those accusations. It was done by FTI Consulting, a Washington-based firm, and focused solely on the accusations against Mr. Gubarev. It relied largely on analyzing internet traffic and other clues, and on digging through public records to glean insight into Mr. Gubarev's holding company, XBT, and its many affiliates, including Webzilla. Both XBT and Webzilla were named in the dossier as being used for the hacking.
While the report found no direct evidence of a direct link to the Russian hackers, it did conclude that Mr. Gubarev's web-hosting services are rife with lawlessness. His clients routinely pirate copyrighted material and spread malware, the report found, and his executives appear unconcerned with stopping them or helping authorities track them down.
Mr. Gubarev's "companies have provided gateways to the internet for cybercriminals and Russian state-sponsored actors to launch and control large scale malware campaigns over the past decade," the report concluded. "Gubarev and other XBT executives do not appear to actively prevent cybercriminals from using their infrastructure."
The evidence cited by the report included the use of I.P. addresses -- the numbered codes that differentiate individual internet connections -- run by an XBT subsidiary, Root S.A., by Russian hackers from two groups tied to the country's intelligence services, Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. The investigators hired by BuzzFeed also found that at least one of the fake links used to trick John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, into giving up his email password to hackers was traced back to an I.P. address run by Root S.A.
The report also detailed evidence that it said suggested Mr. Gubarev's companies were used in other cybercrimes traced to Russian hackers. One was a sophisticated Russian cyberfraud operation known as the Methbot scheme. It used bots -- computer programs that pretend to be people -- to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.
During the three months the scheme was running in 2016, roughly three-quarters of the internet traffic flowing through two web-hosting companies owned by Mr. Gubarev -- Servers.com and WZ Communications -- was dedicated to the scheme, the report said.
Mr. Fray-Witzer, the lawyer, said Mr. Gubarev's companies did not make a habit of prying into the web traffic of its clients, and could not have known what its servers were being used for. But, he added, Servers.com and WZ Communications shut off internet access for those behind the Methbot scheme as soon as they found out about it, and saved all of the hard drives for any investigators who wanted to examine them -- none have.
Asked about the numerous lawsuits that have claimed that Mr. Gubarev's companies were used to trade in copyrighted material, Mr. Fray-Witzer offered the same argument: Web-hosting companies are not typically held responsible for the traffic that flows through their servers, and Mr. Gubarev should not be held to a different standard.
In any case, Mr. Fray-Witzer said, the dossier accused Mr. Gubarev "directly of having been involved in the hacking of the D.N.C.," not of running networks used by thieves and criminals.
"Because they couldn't prove the allegations that they actually made about our client," he continued, "they pivoted to say, 'Well, your infrastructure was used from time to time to do bad things."'

Texto completo: Johnson & Johnson's shares dipped on Thursday after a jury in California ordered the company to pay more than $29 million to a woman who claimed that asbestos in its talc-based powder products had caused her cancer.
In rendering its verdict in Alameda County Superior Court on Wednesday, the jury found that Johnson & Johnson knew about the potential risks that its baby powder was contaminated, but failed to warn the woman, Teresa Leavitt.
Ms. Leavitt, a resident of San Leandro, received a diagnosis of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of internal organs that is associated with asbestos, in August 2017. Her lawyer, Joseph D. Satterley, said she had used Johnson & Johnson talc products for more than 30 years.
The jury awarded Ms. Leavitt $22 million for her pain and suffering, $5 million to compensate her family members, nearly $1.3 million for her medical costs and $1.2 million for her lost wages, Mr. Satterley said.
Johnson & Johnson said in a statement that it was disappointed with the verdict, citing "serious procedural and evidentiary errors in the proceeding," and that it planned to appeal. As in past cases, which the company has fought with mixed success, it said decades of testing showed that its baby powder did not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Its shares fell 1 percent in trading on Thursday.
More than 13,000 plaintiffs have sued Johnson & Johnson over what they say are cancers caused by its talc products. The New York Times reported last year that the company had spent decades trying to keep negative information about the potential risk of asbestos contamination from reaching the public.
Ms. Leavitt's complaint claims that Johnson & Johnson has, since the early 1900s, "possessed medical and scientific data that raised concerns regarding the presence of asbestos in talcum powder and that demonstrated the existence of health hazards to those exposed to asbestos-containing talcum powder products."
Johnson & Johnson said in a regulatory filing last month that it had received subpoenas from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for more details about its talc products.
In July, a jury in Missouri awarded $4.69 billion to 22 women who claimed that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson products, including its signature baby powder, caused them to develop ovarian cancer. In December, the company lost a motion to reverse the verdict. The company's appeal is pending.
Talc is used in more than 2,000 products, including many beauty and personal-care products, according to government data. The Food and Drug Administration warned this month that it had found asbestos in cosmetics sold by Claire's, a retailer geared toward teenagers. The company said it had stopped selling all talc-based products, including those cited by the agency, and planned to destroy its existing inventory. It also said it had stopped making talc-based cosmetics last year.
On Tuesday, the House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy heard testimony about potential asbestos contamination of talc-based personal care products. An epidemiologist from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle testified that talcum powder significantly increases the risk of cancer.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The tech company mentioned in a dossier detailing President Trump’s alleged ties to Russia may have been used by Russian agents to hack the Democrats, new evidence suggests.

The infamous dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele claimed Internet service providers owned by Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev used “botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct ‘altering operations’ against the Democratic Party leadership.”

A report by a former FBI cyberexpert unsealed Thursday in federal court in Miami found evidence that indicates Russian agents used Gubarev’s networks to hack the Democratic National Committee and the campaign chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, according to the New York Times.

The networks were also likely used by Russian agents and other malicious actors to attack Ukraine’s power grid in 2015, the report said.

The report did not directly link Gubarev or his executives to the hacking, as Steele’s dossier did.

“I have no evidence of them actually sitting behind a keyboard,” the report’s author, Anthony Ferrante, said in a deposition.

Gubarev has denied that he and his businesses knowingly were part of the Russian hacking.

The tech entrepreneur filed a defamation lawsuit against BuzzFeed, the first news outlet to publish the dossier. BuzzFeed commissioned the report released Thursday to counter Gubarev’s lawsuit, which was dismissed in December.

Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm, was paid by the conservative Washington Free Beacon to conduct research on Trump and other candidates during the Republican presidential primaries. When the outlet’s interest in the research lapsed, Fusion GPS approached a law firm for the Clinton campaign and the DNC and offered to continue its research. That information was compiled by Steele into a 35-page dossier that contained salacious allegations against Trump, including that Russian intelligence operatives filmed Trump with prostitutes urinating on a Moscow hotel bed.

Many of the claims in Steele’s dossier have yet to be verified. The report commissioned by BuzzFeed did not seek to prove any of the accusations except those against Gubarev.

“Because they couldn’t prove the allegations that they actually made about our client,” a lawyer for Gubarev said, “they pivoted to say, ‘Well, your infrastructure was used from time to time to do bad things.’”

“You could say the same thing about Google’s infrastructure and Amazon’s infrastructure — and no one is accusing them of hacking anyone just because hackers used their infrastructure,” he said.

Texto completo: When BuzzFeed published the so-called Trump dossier authored by Christopher Steele on the evening of Jan. 10, 2017, David Kramer, a longtime associate of the late Sen. John McCain, called BuzzFeed reporter Ken Bensinger in a panic.

“The first words out of my mouth were, ‘You are gonna get people killed!'” Kramer recalled telling Bensinger over the phone.

“Why? How?” Bensinger replied.

“By posting this, you will put people's lives in danger … Please take it down," Kramer said.

The dramatic phone call between Kramer and Bensinger was revealed when a federal court unsealed the December 2017 deposition given by Kramer — a former State Department official who met with British ex-spy Christopher Steele and shared the memos that comprised the dossier with Bensinger, first reported by the Daily Caller on Thursday.

Steele, who would author the series of memos that would come to be known as the "Trump Dossier," was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS in the summer of 2016 to provide them with information on then-candidate Donald Trump.

Kramer testified that he originally met Bensinger for 45 minutes to an hour on Dec. 29 at the McCain Institute Office in Washington, D.C., where Kramer was a fellow. He spoke to Bensinger at the behest of Steele, who had worked with Bensinger during a FIFA corruption investigation with which he’d assisted the FBI.

Kramer said he had already briefed a number of journalists on the compilation of unverified investigative memos put together by Steele.

When they met, Kramer said Bensinger already seemed to have some idea of what was in the Steele dossier memos: “He said that they were very interested in this, that they had heard about it, they had not heard about it from me initially, and were interested in looking at it and doing some investigative reporting on it.”

During the meeting, Kramer emphasized the unverified nature of the information in the memos and said: “I’m not in a position to verify or refute this, but that it seemed to me to be serious enough to be looked at in a professional way, and that professional journalists were arguably in a position to look into the matter.”

Kramer testified it was his understanding from Steele that “this was only supposed to have been released or posted and published if it had been verified.” Kramer "stressed to him the sensitivity of it … that it had to be handled very carefully. And he agreed.”

According to Kramer, Bensinger “said he wanted to read” the memos but that Bensinger also “asked if he could take photos of them on his — I assume it was an iPhone.” Kramer said he asked him not to.

Kramer said he expressed concern with photographs being taken: “I said to him that even though I'm a bit of a Luddite, I don't understand technology, I always worry that things electronically like that could inadvertently be spread around, and I said that that would not be good.”

Bensinger replied that “he was a slow reader, he wanted to read it.”

Kramer then walked out of the room for half an hour, leaving Bensinger alone with his camera phone and the unverified material: “I said, you know, I got a phone call to make, and I had to go to the bathroom, so I'll let you be because I don't read well when people are looking at me breathing down my neck, and so I left him to read for 20, 30 minutes.”

It was during this time that Kramer said Bensinger photographed all 35 pages of the dossier. Kramer claimed Bensinger never told him about publishing the dossier and that he didn’t know photos had been taken of it until BuzzFeed published it. He said if he’d known BuzzFeed would publish the dossier then he never would’ve shown it to Bensinger.

A few weeks later, Kramer said he was meeting with yet another journalist, Julian Borger of the Guardian, when a CNN report on the dossier came onto the TV in front of them. Kramer said his reaction to the CNN story was, “Holy shit.”

Kramer found out that BuzzFeed had published the dossier a few hours later when Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, called him and simply said, “BuzzFeed has posted the document.”

Kramer also spoke with Steele that evening. He testified Steele was “shocked” and said “this wasn't supposed to happen this way.”

When Steele asked Kramer how this could’ve happened, Kramer said he didn’t know. When Steele asked Kramer if this had happened because of him, Kramer said: “I denied it.” In fact, on the day of the deposition, Kramer insisted he still had not admitted to Steele that he was the one who gave Bensinger a copy of the dossier.

Along with Kramer's deposition, the court has also ordered unsealed the deposition of Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy and author of the dossier who was hired by Fusion GPS during the 2016 presidential campaign to conduct research. Steele’s dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's potentially compromising ties to Russia, was used in the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign and was used to obtain FISA warrants.

Simpson also allegedly tried to pass Steele's memos along to a number of journalists, including Michael Isikoff of Yahoo! News. Fusion GPS was paid in 2016 by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm.

The depositions were ordered unsealed by Judge Ursula Mancusi Ungaro of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The defamation lawsuit was brought by Aleksej Gubarev against BuzzFeed and its editor-in-chief Ben Smith. Gubarev is mentioned in Steele’s dossier, which alleged that Gubarev was involved in election interference and hacking the Democratic Party in 2016.

Gubarev argued these allegations were untrue and that BuzzFeed had never bothered to check with him before publishing. BuzzFeed ultimately prevailed, and the lawsuit was dismissed in December 2018. Ungaro ordered the depositions that Steele and Kramer had given during the case to be unsealed no earlier than March 14.

In his deposition, Kramer said he became aware of Steele and his research from a man named Andrew Wood, a retired British diplomat, at the Halifax International Security Forum in November 2016. He later linked up with Steele and Simpson, who were interested in sharing the information about President-elect Trump with McCain.

Kramer said he became aware that they had already spoken to the New York Times about the dossier, but "nothing came of that conversation."

Not long after Kramer showed the dossier to McCain, who then spoke to the FBI about it, Kramer said he began to hear from the media.

"How they knew my role, I don't know," he said in his deposition. "I did not reach out to them. But they were aware that I had given it to Senator McCain."

Ultimately, Kramer said he was in contact with more than a dozen journalists, including Bensinger, Carl Bernstein, ABC News' Matt Mosk and Brian Ross, the Guardian's Julian Borger, McClatchy's Peter Stone and Greg Gordan, Mother Jones' David Corn, NPR's Bob Little and Rachel Martin, the Wall Street Journal's Allan Cullison, and the Washington Post's Tom Hamburger, Rosalind Helderman, and Fred Hiatt.

Bernstein, who now works with CNN, was listed as a co-author of the initial report on Jan. 10 about the dossier. Kramer said he met Bernstein at Steele's request and that Fusion GPS likely didn't know about it.

Kramer said he also discussed the dossier with Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.; Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia Affairs; and Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary for Russian affairs at the National Security Council under former President Barack Obama.

Kramer also said Steele showed him a piece of paper showing the names of the dossier's sources and that he recognized some them due to his background familiarity in Russia.

The names of Steele's sources have not been publicly confirmed to this day.

Yes, Trump is a target of ‘harassment’

Texto completo: President Donald Trump often complains that he is the victim of "presidential harassment" — or, as he sometimes puts it, "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" The president’s adversaries, of course, dismiss his protests as self-interested whining. But the fact is, Trump has a point. He is the target of an extraordinary combination not just of federal law enforcement and congressional probes, but a long list of less-discussed but potentially consequential investigations by state and local prosecutors and regulators. Together, it adds up to a pile-on of unprecedented proportions — by and large the work of blue-state Democrats.
Recently the New York State Department of Financial Services, the agency that regulates the insurance business, issued what The New York Times called an "expansive subpoena" to Aon, the insurance broker for the president’s companies. The agency leapt into action after former Trump fixer Michael Cohen told the House that Trump had at some point inflated his assets to an insurance company. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and faces serious questions about the truthfulness of his latest testimony, supplied no details. None were needed. "The subpoena that was served on Aon contains no indication that the company or any of its employees engaged in misconduct," the Times reported. "Nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry by state regulators." Also in New York, the State Department of Taxation and Finance announced last October that it is investigating Trump’s taxes going back at least 20 years.
Speaking of state law enforcement, the recent New York attorney general race was virtually a contest to see which candidate could vow to go after Trump the most aggressively. Outside of New York, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia are suing Trump, accusing him of violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Then there is the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan. Prosecutors there are said to be investigating the Trump Organization’s finances, the funding of the Trump inauguration, and the funding of the Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have long viewed Trump’s tax returns as a sort of Holy Grail of Trump investigations. Beyond that, there is the House Judiciary Committee’s recent decision to demand documents from 81 people associated with Trump — a request so wide-ranging that even some Democrats worry that their party’s investigators have overreached.
The point is, the scrutiny directed at the president from all sides — not oversight of his administration or even investigations into his election — so far exceeds anything in the past that it could well qualify as presidential harassment. Democrats would no doubt respond that Trump is singularly corrupt, or that he brought it all on himself. He did not. What has happened is that Democrats, in Congress and in some key blue states, saw investigation as a way to weaken a president they never thought would be elected and want to ensure is not re-elected in 2020. And Trump, with the most extensive business history ever brought to the presidency, presented a lot of avenues of investigation. When he complains about harassment, he has a legitimate case to make.

Livability: Cincinnati has 'top-notch infrastructure.'

Texto completo: In a new study by Livability, Cincinnati ranked No. 25 out of 100, and while we can't argue that Cincinnati is a great place to live, there are some questions about the infrastructure score.
Livability said Cincinnati has "top-notch infrastructure" in their Top 100 Best Place to Live in 2019 rankings.
Come again?
"In fact, Cincinnati scored the highest for infrastructure among all of Livability's Top 100 cities for 2019. Why? It's super easy to get around here, with options ranging from the Cincinnati Bell Connector streetcar system to the popular Metro bus service, which brings 20 percent of the downtown workforce into the city each day." — Livability.com
Hey, Livability, take a look at this New York Times story about the Brent Spence Bridge, our beloved and feared 57-year-old bridge, that needs to be replaced.
According to The Enquirer's Scott Wartman, the federal government won't pay for more than one-third of the $2.5 billion Brent Spence Bridge project. That means Ohio and Kentucky will have to come up with at least two-thirds of the money, maybe more. But neither governor has committed to a plan yet.
(Remember in 2017, when the U.S. Department of Treasury released a report ranking the replacement of the Brent Spence Bridge as one of America's top transportation infrastructure megaprojects, but nothing got done?)
Nor did Livability likely read The Enquirer's coverage of issues with the Cincinnati Bell Connector, like that time the streetcar collided with a Metro bus.
The streetcar turned 2 last year, and there are a few big takeaways from the second year around the tracks, according to transportation reporter Hannah Sparling. Ridership numbers are down from early projections, down from revised projections and down compared to year one. Blockages are up. In fact, the Cincinnati Metro is responsible for 39 percent of the blockages from January through August 2018. (That problem has since been fixed).
Not to mention the Columbia Parkway landslides, truck bottlenecks on I-71/I-75 and public pushes for a bus levy to improve services. And, of course, the Western Hills Viaduct literally had a piece of concrete fall off and smash into a truck.
Livability did get a few things right, Cincinnati's climate in six words or less, "Wildly variable – hot, cold, rainy, snowy" and our love of Graeter's and Skyline Chili.

Guac and the meaning of life When we last left Pastor Dave Jahn of Advent Lutheran Church, he was offering drive-through blessings for motorcyclists. The eclectic Jahn is back this time to discuss "The Big Questions" in front of a nice bowl of salsa at a Mexican restaurant.
Jahn will lead a no-holds-barred discussion of faith's gnarly issues during weekly sessions at 7:30 p.m., March 13 to April 10 at Fiesta Azteca, 6765 N. Wickham Road, Suntree. He is using the guac and the chips to more comfortably and casually engage with believers, non-believers and seekers.
"Compared to all that there is to know, even the most brilliant among us knows nothing, so we need to begin every discussion with humility and openness," he said.
The Lutheran minister has been an open-minded student of the mysterious and sacred, scientific and secular, for more than 50 years and is the author of "Faith on the Edge of the Universe."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The New York attorney general has subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank related to three large loans the bank extended to President Donald Trump's company in recent years - and a fourth loan that Trump sought to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills, according to two sources familiar with the subpoenas.
Those subpoenas signal a new inquiry by state regulators into the Trump Organization's financing.
The subpoena follows congressional testimony by Michael Cohen - Trump's former lawyer and fixer - that Trump inflated his net worth in documents he sent to Deutsche Bank while seeking loans.
The German bank also was crucial to Trump's real estate business in the last few years before he ran for president, extending him more than $360 million worth of loans since 2012. The loans let Trump buy new properties and refinance old ones, despite his history of corporate bankruptcies and disputes with lenders.
In all cases, the loans came not from Deutsche Bank's main commercial lending division, but rather from a smaller office of the bank that manages money for high net-worth clients.
Deutsche Bank had received requests for documents from the House's Financial Services and Intelligence committees. This new inquiry seems to signal that New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, is investigating the same loans.
A spokeswoman for James declined to comment Tuesday. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.
Deutsche Bank issued a statement Tuesday saying only, "We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations."
Last week, another New York state agency - the Department of Financial Services, which oversees insurance - issued a subpoena to Trump's longtime insurance broker, Aon.
Cohen had testified that the same kind of inflated financial statements were used by Trump in an attempt to lower his insurance premiums.
The Deutsche Bank subpoenas were for documents related to three Trump properties, all bought with loans from the bank, the sources confirmed.
Trump received $125 million from the bank to buy the Doral golf resort outside Miami. He got $170 million to build the Trump International Hotel inside a federally owned building in Washington. And he got about $69 million from the bank in 2014 to refinance old Deutsche Bank loans on Chicago's Trump Tower.
In addition, the sources said, the subpoena asks for documents related to Trump's attempt to buy the Bills in 2013 - a deal that did not materialize.
During his congressional testimony last month, Cohen provided copies of "statements of financial condition," which he said were sent to Deutsche Bank in pursuit of a loan for that purchase.
"Did the president ever provide inflated assets to a bank in order to help them to obtain a loan?" Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., asked Cohen.
"These documents and others were provided to Deutsche Bank on one occasion when I was with him in our attempt to obtain money so that we can put a bid on the Buffalo Bills," Cohen said.
The "statements of financial condition" are not rigorously audited financial documents. According to a cover letter on one of the documents, they represented Trump's own estimates about what he was worth and what he owed.
Cohen said these statements exaggerated the income Trump received from commercial properties. They also included a valuation of one property - a mansion Trump owns in suburban New York - at $291 million, when local assessors put the value around $19 million.
In one statement from 2013, Trump doubled his own estimate of his net worth, by declaring that his name brand alone was worth $4 billion.
The subpoenas issued Monday were first reported by The New York Times. The Times also reported that Investors Bank, a New Jersey institution, had been subpoenaed for a 2010 loan it extended to the Trump Organization related to Trump Park Avenue, a residential building in Manhattan. That bank did not respond for requests for comment Tuesday.
Deutsche Bank became one of Trump's main lenders over the last 12 years - a time when Trump was trying to shake off corporate bankruptcies and return to his previous fame as an ambitious real estate developer.
Trump began buying many properties in cash, without any public record that he'd borrowed the money. And, when he did borrow money, his financial-disclosure forms show, he relied heavily on three lenders.
One was Ladder Capital Finance, a New York investment firm that employs the son of Trump's longtime aide Allen Weisselberg. That company largely loaned Trump money to refinance existing commercial buildings in New York.

Then there was Deutsche Bank, where the private-wealth office funded new projects and refinanced Chicago's Trump Tower.
Trump's other big lender during this period, according to his financial-disclosure documents, was a company called "Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC." Trump's disclosure document says he owes this company more than $50 million, due to a 2012 transaction involving Chicago's Trump Tower.
But Trump owns "Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC."

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, the first Latina to anchor a PBS “Frontline” report, will give the 50th Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture next month in Riverside.
Hinojosa is executive producer of “Latino USA,” a Peabody Award-winning program aired on National Public Radio. She has worked for CNN, PBS, CBS during a 30-year news career. Hinojosa’s 2011 “Frontline” report, called “Lost in Detention,” analyzed alleged abuse at immigrant detention centers.
Her topic will be “Latinos in the Media.” The free lecture is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday, April 9, in UC Riverside’s University Theatre. Reservations are suggested and free parking will be in Lot 6 on campus.
“This is a time of unprecedented emphasis on the Latino diaspora in the national media of the United States, and I look forward to the unique insights and rich historical knowledge that Ms. Hinojosa will be able to share with our UCR campus community,” UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox said in a UCR news release.
The lecture is named for Howard H “Tim” Hays Jr., the former longtime owner and publisher of The Press-Enterprise. His son, Tom Hays, created an endowment to ensure the lecture series continued after his father’s 2011 death.
Hinojosa will join the long list of journalists who have delivered the lecture. They include Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee and Marty Baron from the Washington Post, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, CNN President Tom Johnson, former Wall Street Journal Publisher Karen House, Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, former Los Angeles Times editor Davan Maharaj, and Ray Suarez from the PBS NewsHour and Al-Jazeera.
Hinojosa has won four Emmys; the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Reporting on the Disadvantaged; and the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club for best documentary for “Child Brides: Stolen Lives,” the release states.
She has been a syndicated columnist for King Features/Hearst and written two books: “Raising Raul: Adventures Raising Myself and My Son,” and “Crews: Gang Members Talk with Maria Hinojosa.” Hinojosa, born in Mexico City, was raised in Chicago.

Texto completo: If Joe Biden announces his candidacy soon, he may enter the race as a front-runner, trailed closely by Senator Bernie Sanders, according to a pair of recent polls that have shown the former vice president ahead among Democrats in Iowa as well as nationwide.
A Des Moines Register/CNN poll released on Saturday found Biden leading the still-forming 2020 Democratic presidential field, with 27 percent of likely Iowa caucus-goers describing him as their first choice. Trailing closely behind, and well within the 4.9 percent margin of error, is Senator Bernie Sanders with 25 percent of support.
And nationwide, Biden enjoyed the support of 29 percent of Democratsin a January poll of registered voters.
The Monmouth poll, which had a 5.5 percent margin of error, found Democrats were highly focused on candidates' electability: 56 percent of respondents said they would back a candidate that had a better chance of beating President Trump in the general election, even if they did not agree with that candidate on most issues.
One trouble spot for Biden is in New Hampshire, where Sanders is leading the pack with 26 percent of respondents in a February University of New Hampshre poll calling him their preferred candidate. Biden was close behind, with 22 percent. Fourteen percent of voters said they were undecided in the poll, which had a sampling error of 6.3 percent.
Biden has not yet committed to joining the 2020 Democratic field and has not made visits to early primary states, but a recent New York Times report indicated that the former veep is 95 percent committed to launching a campaign.
Before any balloons drop, it's worth revisiting where the nomination races stood this early in previous election cycles.
A Public Policy Polling poll released April 1, 2015 found former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker leading the field for the 2016 nomination with 20 percent support, followed by Bush at 17 percent and Cruz at 16 percent. Donald Trump, who announced his candidacy the following month, was not mentioned at all.

Texto completo: Jose Del Real is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently deployed along the border. Each week in the newsletter Crossing the Border, they'll be sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who spend time on both sides of it. This dispatch is from San Ysidro, Calif., and Tijuana, Mexico.
Floating above the cactus-pear cocktails and gourmet tacos, a green mosaic rises above the plaza just on the Mexico side of the Tijuana border: ESTACION FEDERAL. There are Edison-bulb patio lights and metal fire pits. Textures of reclaimed wood and succulents. In the back, a food truck doubles as a southwestern mural, a blur of orange and yellow and purple.
This Instagram-ready commons in chaotic Tijuana is the brainchild of Miguel Marshall, a cross-border entrepreneur whose vision of a binational border between Mexico and the United States has grown even more resolute in the era of President Trump. He is the chief executive of Centro Ventures, a Tijuana-based real estate development company that is creating work-and-living spaces like this, with carefully curated food, coffee, co-working units and even Airbnb lofts.
Mr. Marshall's entrepreneurial work has earned him cachet among business leaders in Mexico and the United States. He has been designated as one of Tijuana's "global shapers" by the World Economic Forum, which holds the annual gathering of world economic leaders in Davos, Switzerland.
Estacion Federal is just a five-minute walk from Mexico's El Chaparral border crossing, "a little south of south San Diego, a little north of north Tijuana," as the spot is promoted online. Mr. Marshall sees it as a prototype for rejuvenating the city -- part artistic community, part commuter waypoint and part gastro-utopia.
His vision is to bring Americans and Mexicans together for good food, drinks and conversation.
This project is partly grounded in his biography. Mr. Marshall was born in San Diego but grew up in Tijuana. He was named after his father, Michael Marshall, but his parents gave him the Spanish-language version of the name so he would not be bullied in Mexican schools.
"I'm a border baby," he said with a laugh.
For several years, the border across the Southwest has been in the midst of an economic boom, with new businesses and stores springing up to serve middle-class Mexican customers who have permission to cross into the United States on day trips. The problem Mr. Marshall sees is that much of the investment along the border, at least in California, has happened on the American side.
In San Ysidro -- San Diego's border district, on the American side -- visitors can find hundreds of businesses, from big outlet malls to small family shops.
On the Mexican side, by contrast, there are miles of run-down homes and parking garages. The neighborhood does little to show visitors Tijuana's vibrant culture, Mr. Marshall said, or to entice Americans to venture south.
"First impressions matter," said Mr. Marshall, who slips repeatedly between Spanish and English when he talks. "The cross-border lifestyle, we're trying to brand that as a way of living."
The small Estacion Federal plaza offers vegetarian tacos, pizza, carefully sourced coffee and a cocktail bar. It is all highly curated.
On a recent Friday evening at the Cereus Bar, patrons from both sides of the border wore skinny jeans and leather jackets. The aesthetic was familiar -- classic American hipsterdom by way of a CB2 catalog -- augmented by the sounds and smells and tastes of gourmet Mexico. One of the signature cocktails is a prickly-pear drink made from the juice of cactus fruit -- known as "tuna" in Spanish -- sourced at Mercado Hidalgo, the famed farmers' market in Tijuana. It is the most expensive item on the menu: 130 pesos, or a little less than $7.
Mr. Marshall said he hoped to draw an American clientele to his plaza, but he also wants Cereus to be a neighborhood bar. He envisions young people leaving work in San Diego and stopping at the pizza and taco shops before a night out in Tijuana's nightclub district.
"The best of both worlds," he said.

The House resolves to play nice

Texto completo: Welcome to Inside Desert Politics, your guide to the happenings in Coachella Valley, California and national politics. I'm Marie McCain, your host.
In this week's edition, a freshman Democratic congresswoman's criticism of Israel leads to accusations of anti-Semitism and exposes deep divides among the Dems.
Normally, I aim to start off this newsletter with a blurb about something of interest that happened at the beginning of the week. But, Thursday's passage of a resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives denouncing anti-Semitism and any form of bias or bigotry prompted a serious change of plans on my part.
If for some reason you haven't heard about this — say, because you've just returned from visiting an alternate universe where everyone loves everyone else and never, ever, ever says an unkind word about any other person — here's an overview.
The measure was drafted at the behest of veteran lawmakers who wanted to ensure there would be no repeat, without consequences, of controversial remarks that had been made by Minnesota's freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar.
Approved 407-23, with 234 Democrats (including the Coachella Valley's own Rep. Raul Ruiz) and 173 Republicans voting yes, 23 Republicans voting no and a lone present vote from Iowa Republican Steve King, it was also meant to ease the rifts within the Democratic Party that had been exposed by Omar's comments.
Since February, Omar, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee has made a series of statements some people consider to be anti-Semitic. She is an outspoken critic of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as that country's treatment of neighboring Palestine.
In response to a tweet about House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy's threat to punish her because of her criticisms of Israel, Omar tweeted: "It's all about the Benjamins baby." Her detractors say that remark dredges up negative stereotypes of Jews.
In another instance, Omar stated that GOP lawmakers were being paid by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee for their support of Israel. And in another, she implied that American Jews have a "dual loyalty" to this country, as well as to Israel.
Omar, who is one of the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress, has apologized for her "about the Benjamins" comment. But she has yet to walk back her later statements, which she insists were mere criticisms of Israel.
Besides offending Jews nationwide, her comments rankled Democrats and Republicans alike.
In an opinion piece published by CNN, Democratic Reps. Brad Schneider of Illinois, Elaine Luria of Virginia and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey explained why they believe Omar's statements were offensive and anti-Semitic.
"The dual loyalty canard is one of the more common and most pernicious attacks used to discredit 'the other,'" the representatives said. "It was deployed in the last century against Catholics like Al Smith and John Kennedy. It's used today to vilify immigrants, minorities, and people of non-Christian faiths, including both Jews and Muslims.
"As Jews, we have a unique understanding that anti-Semitic tropes, and in particular accusations of dual loyalty, has led to pogroms, expulsions and death on a grand scale. We also understand that the pernicious idea that Jews cannot be faithful to our country has been an excuse to marginalize and exclude us from full and equal civic engagement. It now seems to be an argument that we should not be advocates for a strong U.S.-Israel relationship."
Omar's supporters, though, contend her comments have been misconstrued and are in no way anti-Semitic.
"There is absolutely nothing anti-Semitic about calling out the noxious role of AIPAC ... which spends millions each year to buy U.S. political support for Israeli aggression and militarism against the Palestinian people," according to a statement on the website JewswithIlhan.org. "As the NYC chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace summed up: 'Accurately describing how the Israel lobby works in this country is not anti-Semitic.' The never-ending smear campaign against Ilhan Omar is racism and Islamophobia in action."
Nevertheless — in order to keep the peace in the Democratic Party and shrink the gaping divide created by Omar's statements — a deal was struck.
According to media reports, Omar had offended the older, longer-serving Jewish lawmakers, but she was being supported by a contingent of younger, black lawmakers, who believed she was being treated unfairly.
A resolution condemning anti-Semitism would be drafted and brought to the House floor for a vote. Initially, that was the only bias the measure would address.
But the contents of the resolution were expanded after members of the black caucus pointed out that black folks had endured years of racism, which had never been denounced by an official congressional resolution. Pretty soon lawmakers had added in every kind of bias, bigotry and prejudice that exists.
The one thing the resolution did not contain was Omar's name.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, according to The New York Times, told reporters: "It's not about her; it's about these forms of hatred."
Ummm ...OK.
Now, to be clear, the passage of this resolution does not mean it can be used to regulate the behavior of the American public. It is not a law.
It is meant to establish a kind of decorum among the members of the House of Representatives so that they might work together with minimal conflict.
Do you think it will work? Is it reasonable to believe a resolution like this could do that?
I'd like to hear what you think. Email me your thoughts, ideas or any questions you might have about this topic: marie.mccain@desertsun.com.

Let LGBTQ form a new denomination

Texto completo: I am going to make a lot of people angry today, but why not stir the pot once in a while. I also will use lots of numbers and many people's eyes will gloss over with that.
The United Methodist Church (UMC) had a convention in St. Louis ending on Feb. 26. One of the very controversial items on the agenda was the church's position on same sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy.
Two plans were on the agenda.
The Traditional Plan continued the church policy of banning same sex marriages and not ordaining LGBTQ pastors to lead congregations world-wide. This has been the position since 1972 when the UMC first formally addressed the issue. The other One Church Plan accommodated same sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy.
The Traditional Plan won with 53 percent of the vote with 47 percent voting for The One Church Plan. The UMC church leaders in Africa were strongly against the One Church Plan and voted accordingly. They had about 30 percent of the total votes cast.
The UMC is the third largest Christian denomination in the U.S. and has about 14 million members worldwide. The New York Times said 12 million and the Chicago Tribune said 16 million, so I split the difference. You can't believe anything you read these days if simple data like this cannot be confirmed by two of our major newspapers. They both agreed that 7 million are in the USA. That is about 2 percent of our population.
Why am I even writing about this? I am not a member of the UMC and have no dog in this fight.
According to a Gallup poll in 2017, about 4.5 percent of the U.S. population consider themselves part of the LGBTQ community. If the UMC church in the USA has 7 million members, and its population includes 4.5 percent LGBTQ people, that is 315,000 individuals. That is a lot of people, but still just 4.5 percent. However, these members feel strongly their point of view should govern what the 95.5 percent of the people should accept. Do you see anything wrong with this picture?
There are umpteen Christian denominations in the U.S. and if the 4.5 percent of the UMC want to endorse same sex marriage and ordination of LGBTQ pastors that is easy to accomplish. Just create another Christian denomination and get on with it. Don't continue to push the 95.5 percent to their point of view. OK, I understand that 47 percent of the delegates supported the agenda of the 4.5 percent. They too would be welcome to join the new denomination. There will still be 7 million adherents to UMC teachings and most practices.
The important thing is to do this without rancor and in the spirit of Christian love. This type of accommodation has occurred in other Christian denominations. Reasonable people should be permitted to disagree on important issues without demonizing each other. Just agree to disagree and move on.
The LGBTQ community has a much larger say in our national discourse than their numbers should reasonably justify. However, they have passionate members and the support of most national media, Hollywood and the arts so their influence is magnified many fold. I can tolerate their lifestyle and actions without malice most of the time. However, I really do mind being poked in the eye when their views and actions are forced on me - part of the 95.5 percent.

Gribben's new three-volume set is based on earlier research, much of it in Hartford. Volume 1 is being released by NewSouth Books. mathtwainhouse.org/events or 860-247-0998.

Texto completo: Piccolo's executive chef, Damian Sansonetti, is chuckling in the background. Despite his efforts, I can hear him over the speakerphone.
I've just asked his wife, pastry chef Ilma Lopez, what inspired her to put smoked walnuts on a dark chocolate budino ($12) - an addition that pitch-shifts the tones of the custard-like dessert from bittersweet to the brink of savory.
It turns out, it was a spontaneous choice.
"Damian is laughing because he always calls me 'Last-Minute Lopez.' Forget Rachael Ray. He likes to say I can go from 'No way' to 'OlÃ©!' in 30 minutes," she says, laughing herself now. "Anyway, I totally stole the smoked walnut idea from one of his dishes at Chaval (the couple's West End restaurant)."
I ran into those same walnuts again on my second recent meal at Piccolo - a return visit to see how the 20-seat, Southern Italian restaurant had changed after a short winter hiatus. Over a week, Lopez and Sansonetti expanded their concise menu two-fold, adding a half-dozen small plates and snacks, as well as a roster of fresh pastas now available as full- and half-portions.
And this time around, I spotted the nuts in a savory dish (albeit one named for the wrapped confections they resemble). Here, the smoke and volatile oils add an almost bacon-like overtone to brown butter drizzled over chard-and-ricotta-filled Caramelle pasta ($13), a substantial appetizer-sized dish.
Fruitful crosstalk occurs not just from one menu to another, but across both of the couple's Portland restaurants. Even though Chaval's focus is firmly French and Spanish, its influence has bled over into Piccolo, and vice versa.
You can see it in Piccolo's newly refreshed interior design, where cooler, whiter lighting underlines the more mature space's passing resemblance to its much livelier sibling. Piccolo's architecture itself now also tells a story of transition and boundary-breaking, with murals by Rebecca Volynsky that cross from wall to ceiling, giving the illusion of a camber overhead - or her arrangement of long rectangles and organic, seed-like glyphs into a dynamic form that evokes figure skaters gliding past the dining room, mid-arabesque.
While the restaurant remains as low-key and romantic as it was when this paper first awarded it four-and-a-half stars in 2013, the recent miniature revamp represents the first time that everything at Piccolo works in concert to showcase the personalities (separate and together) of Sansonetti and Lopez.
Take the Midollo (bone marrow, $15). At Chaval, topped with a French tartare of beef, it's a standout. Piccolo's version is a little less outrÃ©, but clearly dreamed up by the same brain. Sansonetti and chef de cuisine Luke Aberle roast oxtails, reserving the fat they release to paint triangles of griddled Southside Bakery sourdough. They then top the soft marrow with micro-celery and puffed farro that brings crunch to a dish whose usual Achilles heel is its texture.
Plating, too, is frequently expressed in reflexive verbs that bridge both menus and restaurants. In particular, the Del Mar ($29), a Sicilian-style scallop preparation that features sweet, licoricey fennel purÃ©e, pine nuts, swollen golden raisins and Browne Trading Company shellfish "so pristine, you cut them open and you can see them still quivering," Sansonetti said. Arranged with orthogonal half-moons of delicata squash and frills of bracing frisÃ©e, the dish looks like a leisure-class version of Chaval's autumn vegetable entrÃ©e.
When I asked about the similarities in plating, Lopez gave credit to Aberle. "He's a super technician and he takes everything we tell him to heart. I guess Damian's plating style is rubbing off on Luke," she said. "That happens when you work with someone for a while. You start to take on their style sometimes."
There are unique dishes on the menu at Piccolo, however, like Lopez's fantastically tropical passionfruit cake ($8), a twist on the aforementioned budino, but this time the same thick custard is enhanced with a little cornstarch, then baked - not chilled - turning it into a stout sponge that tastes like the love child of a jiggly Japanese pancake and a clafoutis.
Or the plain-sounding Funghi ($13). If you order it expecting a plate of roasted mushrooms, you're in for a shock when the dish - essentially a bitter-greens salad of brown-butter-vinaigrette-dressed Castefranco radicchio and a gloriously runny sous-vide egg - arrives. Pierce the yolk, and it emulsifies with red wine vinegar to produce a second, Carbonara-like dressing for the greens and roasted mushrooms. An extraordinary dish.
Three snack-sized plates are just as good: skinny roasted eggplants the width of an '80s necktie, topped with ricotta, orange and oven-roasted tomatoes ($8); crisp-fried lozenges of polenta ladled with slow-melting perlini (marble-sized balls of fresh mozzarella), an Italian riff on poutine ($6); and Sansonetti's crostino of grilled sourdough slathered with a purÃ©e of house-made 'Nduja and oven-dried tomatoes ($7). Be forewarned: Under the spreadable cured meat and tangy stracciatella di bufala runs an undercurrent of fiery heat from Calabrian chilis.
Best to have a glass of one of the restaurant's new wines close to hand. My favorite is the Casa Comelli Refosco ($11), a funky, yet still-fruity red with enough acid structure to pair with most of the menu's plates. And at $34 for a bottle, it is also a good bet if you and a guest plan to order a few of Piccolo's handmade pastas.
Among these are square-cut, squid-ink spaghetti dishes that the kitchen changes frequently. On my first visit, the spaghetti nero was served with spigarello (a flat-leafed cousin of broccoli rabe) in a "Bolognese" of ground swordfish belly meat, all topped with green olives ($26). A decent dish, it lacked a hit of brightness to counteract the deep minerality of the squid ink.
I also found it on the tough side of "al dente," which is the default style at Piccolo. Undercooking works best for pastas in wetter sauces that absorb more liquid at the table, like the strascinati ($17/$26): a flat-and-veiny, orechiette-esque shape. Finished in a sweet sugo of charred tomatoes and onions simmered for hours with pork shoulder from Breezy Hill Farm, it is a dish built to help you make it through the winter.
But if I were hibernating, I'd probably take Piccolo's polpette alla Calabrese ($15) with me: three pork, beef and 'nduja meatballs snuggled into a nest of the softest coarse-ground polenta I have ever eaten. To transform the jagged, golden shards of cornmeal, the kitchen starts the polenta in cold water and heats it slowly before letting the mixture bubble and sputter for the better part of 45 minutes. Sansonetti's restraint with dairy might be his secret weapon. By going easy on the finishing touches of mascarpone and butter, where other chefs might not, he keeps the focus on the corn itself.
Over in the pastry kitchen, Lopez is engaged in her own dairy-driven metamorphosis. Here, she deploys a dazzlingly crystal-free fior di latte gelato ($6) as her agent of transmutation. She carefully lowers a single scoop into a chilled rocks glass, depositing it onto the surface of a shot of bitter, herb-forward Pasubio amaro - like making an affogato in reverse. As the gelato drools cream into the liqueur, it softens any harshness, leaving behind the aroma of pine needles and wild blueberries.
It is a pointless, chicken-and-egg question to try to work out who was first struck by the inspiration to use a bit of dairy as a catalyst for innovation, and in which kitchen it happened. Perhaps it's best not to try.
"For Damian and I to work together, I don't get into his menu, and he doesn't get into mine," Lopez said, teasingly. "And it works out. We're still married!"
"There are absolutely things that Ilma has done that we've stolen (for the savory menu). One of the best things about our relationship is that we can have that collaboration, even if we're not trying to. It just happens," Sansonetti said.

Texto completo: AUSTIN - To polite applause, Howard Schultz pushed his case for independent centrism. Nearby, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) made an impassioned case for breaking up the country's biggest technology companies. A few blocks away, former congressman Beto O'Rourke was mobbed after sitting through the premiere of a documentary about his unsuccessful 2018 Senate campaign.
In short: The 2020 circus had arrived at the hipster-techie festival that is South by Southwest.
SXSW has long been a destination for music, technology and film. But in recent years, it has grown increasingly political. The left-leaning millennial crowd here - riding in on a fleet of electric scooters - is highly sought by candidates in the Democratic primary trying to create viral moments and seeking the sheen of authenticity.
"I am pleased to be the P.T. Barnum," said Evan Smith, chief executive of the Texas Tribune, which was hosting most of the political events.
For the first time in this presidential campaign, most of the Democratic candidates were gathered in the same place. Over barbecue, craft beer and tacos, they took turns selling their vision for the party, and the United States.
Over the course of the weekend, many sat for an hour-long interview. Most dodged questions about whether President Trump should be impeached, said they are eager to see special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report, and heaped praise on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who sometimes seemed to overshadow them all.
Warren drew one of the largest and most enthusiastic crowds, and defended a proposal she outlined Friday to break up companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)
"The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits - boohoo," she said.
She paused when asked whether Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had tried to discourage her from running, saying, "Bernie and I had a private dinner. My view is that dinner stays private."
She made clear that, unlike Sanders, she is not a democratic socialist.
"Bernie has to speak to what democratic socialism is," she said. "All I can tell you is what I believe. And that is there is an enormous amount to be gained from markets. That markets create opportunities."
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) touted her bipartisan credentials, highlighting the Republicans she has worked with and referencing the late senator John McCain at least three times. She promoted her ability to win in conservative areas and outlined how she would run against Trump.
"I will use humor," she said, providing as an example her response to his tweet making fun of her snowy announcement speech. "You know what I'd like to see? How your hair will work in a blizzard, Mr. Umbrella Man."
The first question she faced was about her alleged tough treatment of staff. She directly addressed an anecdote in a New York Times profile about her, which claimed she had once gotten upset at a staffer for not getting her a fork for a salad while on an airplane. Instead, she ate the meal with a comb.
"The comb story was me sort of doing a mom thing," said Klobuchar, a mother of one. "I didn't have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a 'MacGyver' move."
"I know I can be tough on people," she added. "Sometimes too tough, that I can push them too hard, that I can always do better."
Asked if such criticism was sexist, she said, "I'm not going to go there . . . I just can't waste my time analyzing it."
In addition to several prominent Democrats, the festival attracted Bill Weld and John Kasich, who are both mulling a run against Trump in the Republican primary.
Kasich, a former Republican governor of Ohio who ran for president in 2016, outlined his support for combating income inequality, passing comprehensive immigration reform and fighting climate change. He ridiculed the president's "boneheaded decisions" and reveled in the number of women in office.
He also noted that he was sidelined during the 2016 Republican debates - "I was so far off in the wings that I felt like a Ugandan swimmer at the Olympics." He said he still feels that way in today's Republican Party.
"The party, it's just - it's gone backwards," he said.
He seemed fed up with politics - "a pox on all their homes" - even as he left open the possibility of another presidential run.
"I don't know what I'm going to do," he said. "I'm not into Hail Mary. I run when I think I can win. We assess things. About every week or every day. I'm not closing anything down. I just don't know yet. Who knows what's going to happen?"
Schultz, who has been weighing whether to run as an independent, was the first speaker of the day.
"I've come to the conclusion that the two-party system for all too long now is broken," he told a full ballroom. "The level of polarization and revenge politics has reached a level where we are on the clock as a country."
Schultz criticized many Democratic proposals as unrealistic, saying the candidates are living in an "Alice in Wonderland" fairy tale. He said taxes need to be raised, but he wouldn't say by how much. He would leave that to "people a lot smarter than me."
He used a question about whether he supports abortion rights to say that he does, before turning, unprompted, to religion.
"The country is ready for a Jewish president. I'm not running as someone who is Jewish, I'm running as an American who happens to be Jewish."
He railed against socialism, even though at one point he struggled to define it.
"For us to start moving toward a level of socialism is such an extreme position and so inconsistent with the values and heritage of this country," he said. "And that is what Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing - to try to defeat Donald Trump with an extreme proposal."
If either one is the nominee, he said, Trump will be reelected.
With Democrats represented by a donkey and Republicans by an elephant, he was asked what animal he wanted to represent him. He shrugged, saying he was open to suggestions.
"Unicorn!" shouted someone in the audience.
Interviews with nearly a dozen conference attendees as they vaped, disembarked from scooters and ordered cappuccinos suggest the race is, for now, wide open. Few people named a favorite.
"This conference is so socially aware of itself, and trying to make things more impactful," said Will Johnson, a 34-year-old commercial director from Los Angeles. "I have a hard time trusting the political agenda. It doesn't speak to where we are right now. If feels like it speaks to something that once was. It's a show. I get sick of the show without any results."
He's intrigued by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and O'Rourke, largely because he's ready for generational change.
"I felt the Bern," he said. "But now it's like ahhhh - I don't know, man."

Texto completo: As you grumble about your lost hour of sleep this morning, just remember: Don't blame Benjamin Franklin. Despite legend, the nerdiest Founding Father did not invent daylight saving time. (He did, however, suggest cities wake residents earlier on summer mornings by the sound of cannon fire, so perhaps it's best he didn't get his way.)
No, the reason you may have an extra cup of coffee Sunday is because of World War I. And golf.
Changing clocks in the summer was first proposed around the turn of the 20th century by two guys who came up with it separately, though for the same reason. New Zealander George Hudson and Englishman William Willett both wanted more time after work in the summer for their sunlight-required pastimes - in Willett's case, hitting the links, and in Hudson's, collecting bugs. And really, why let time itself keep you from your hobbies?
Neither man's proposal gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of World War I. The Germans were the first to do it, on April 30, 1916, as a way to save on coal-powered lighting in factories. British politicians moved to follow suit two days later and had set their clocks forward by the end of May. Most other European countries weren't far behind.
Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving time. But railroad companies, afraid that confusion around the time change could cause a deadly crash, were adamantly opposed. So were farmers, who worked by the sun anyway and did not want interactions with the clock-keeping world to get screwy.
"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time." This was especially hard on dairy farmers, who would have to start milking cows in the dark to meet train schedules for delivery.
"Plus, the sun, beside giving light, it gives heat, and it drives off the dew on a lot of the things that have to be harvested. And you can't harvest things when they're wet," Prerau said.
The stockbrokers won; a bill passed Congress and President Woodrow Wilson signed it. But the first nationwide time change was set for March 31, 1918 - Easter Sunday. Newspapers published instructions on how and when to set clocks forward, and churches posted signs out front warning parishioners.
The Chicago Tribune called it "a lie that will benefit you and your country," which is a pretty weird way to put it.
At 2 a.m., a reception at Madison Square Garden marked the occasion, and at the U.S. Capitol, a few senators stayed awake with the sergeant-at-arms to reset the Ohio Clock.
The next day, things went surprisingly smoothly. "Some churchgoers were an hour late, but no baseball games were called on account of darkness," reported the New York Times. "Those looking to the sky at nightfall expecting to see a miracle were disappointed."
By the next year, the war had ended, and many thought daylight saving time should end too, Prerau says. Lawmakers representing farmers introduced nearly two dozen bills to repeal it; one Mississippi congressman urged "Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God's time and tell the truth!"
A New Jersey congressman who supported it told people to think of the veterans coming home from the war, "Are they not deserving of the extra hour of recreation?"
A repeal sailed through the House, cleared the Senate and landed on Wilson's desk. He vetoed it, saying it could cause an economic downturn.
A vote to override the president's veto failed, but haters were unbowed. They passed another repeal bill, which was vetoed again. But this time, they were better prepared, getting the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate needed to override the president. (All this happened in a month; Congress used to be productive!)
Daylight saving time was dead.
So if they got rid of it, then why are you late to brunch now ?
Well, it never went away entirely. Cities such as New York and Pittsburgh passed their own daylight saving time laws, and it was brought back nationally for a little while during World War II. As The Washington Post's Michael S. Rosenwald has written, all the time laws among cities and states got so messed up that in Iowa there were 23 different daylight saving dates, depending on what town you were in.
In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson finally smoothed it out, making daylight saving time the law of the land.
The result? You may be tired Sunday morning, but in the evening you will have an extra hour to collect bugs.

Texto completo: In November, walking through “100 Years and Counting,” the look-at-us, we’re-back show at the Minnesota Museum of American Art’s new space in the Pioneer Endicott, we saw a familiar face: “Brian, Williston, ND,” Alec Soth’s portrait of an oil field worker. And we thought – Alec Soth! Where have you been? We haven’t heard a word about you in ages. Same when we saw Soth’s “Prom #1: Cleveland, Ohio” on the wall at the Walker in its new exhibition “Five Ways In.”
Then this, last week in the New York Times: “A Year of Quiet Contemplation Led to the Rebirth of Alec Soth’s Photography.”
As the article says, Soth took a break. He meditated and pursued “an entirely different and private kind of art making.” He was happy. (It’s interesting that his final assignment before going on hiatus was taking photos for a story about a laughter yoga workshop in India.) Alarmingly, per the Times, “He thought his photography career might be over.” Then, “after a year of quiet contemplation, Mr. Soth decided to return to the life he knew. This time, he resolved to figure out how to photograph people in a way that felt right.”
We’ll see what that meant and how it played out next Friday, March 15, when Weinstein Hammons Gallery will hold an opening reception for “Alec Soth: I Know How Furiously Your Heart Is Beating.” This exhibition of new large-format photographs will be the Minneapolis-born and based photographer’s fifth solo show with the gallery.
Taken over the course of a year in cities across the globe – indoors, in people’s homes – the images depict domestic intimacy rather than geography or nationality. The title is a line in Wallace Stevens’ poem “The Gray Room.” Here’s the whole (short) poem, if you’d like to read it. The poem could easily be a description of an Alec Soth photograph. From the Weinstein Hammons: “Soth expresses poetic mysteries unleashed from the quiet encounter in a stranger’s room beholding the fragile enigmatic beauty of another person’s life.”
“I Know How Furiously Your Heart Is Beating” will run in three cities at the same time, with ours opening first. The New York show will open March 21 and San Francisco on March 23. Note that the Weinstein Hammon is a small, street-level space in southwest Minneapolis. It’s likely to be a squeeze on opening night. 6-8 p.m. Free.
The picks
Tonight (Friday, Mar. 8) at the O’Shaughnessy: Toshi Reagon: “I Have Seen the Good Worlds.” Especially if you have plans to see “Octavia E. Butler’s Parable of the Sower – The Concert Version” when it comes to the O’Shaughnessy on April 26 (one performance only!), catch this free talk by Toshi Reagon, who created the new opera with her mother, Sweet Honey in the Rock founder Bernice Johnson Reagon. Her lecture is described as “notes on Octavia E. Butler’s ‘Parable of the Sower’ and the Art of Prediction as Activation.” 7 p.m. Free, but tickets are required. P.S. Today is International Women’s Day.
Sunday at Hamline’s Sundin Hall: “Music of Desolation.” You may think you need bright, bubbly, poppy tunes to make winter’s woes go away. But what if what you really need is music that’s bluer than you? Yet somehow lifts you up and over the drifts and the ice dams because it’s so darned beautiful? On Sunday, violinists Young-Nam Kim and Leslie Shank, violists Sally Chisholm and Tom Turner, cellists Silver Ainomäe and Jane Cords-O’Hara, pianist Timothy Lovelace and mezzo soprano Adriana Zabala will test this theory in a program that includes music by Respighi, Ervin Schulhoff and Paul Schoenfield and the premiere of John Harbison’s Viola Sonata. 4 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25/20; students free with ID).
Monday at 900 Hennepin: “Trailblazing Women: In the Spirit of Harriet Tubman.” Performance artist Hester Moore, channeling Tubman, will share songs and stories of slavery, struggle, freedom and hope at this one-night, all-ages fundraiser for the Minnesota African American Heritage Museum and Gallery. The night of performances also features J.D. Steele and the MacPhail Community Youth choir, vocalist Annie Mack and the WE WIN Institute Drummers. Reception with performers at 5 p.m., performances at 6:30. Suggested donation $15. FMI and RSVP. 900 Hennepin is Hennepin Theatre Trust’s event center next door to the Orpheum; most recently, it was home to Solera.
Monday at the Dakota: Benny Green and Veronica Swift. The pairing of an iconic jazz pianist with an up-and-coming jazz vocalist is not always the world’s best idea. This may be the rare exception. We’ve heard the tracks Green and Swift recorded together for Green’s new album, “Then and Now” (his 20th as leader) and know that Green thinks highly of Swift, since this is the first time he has ever recorded with a singer. (He told the Marin Times that Swift is “the greatest straight-ahead jazz talent I’ve seen emerge this century.”) Swift, 24, has the right genes; she’s the daughter of bebop pianist Hod O’Brien and jazz vocalist Stephanie Nakasian. In 2015, she won second place at the Thelonious Monk Jazz Competition. And she first performed with Jazz at Lincoln Center at age 11. 7 and 9 p.m. FMI and tickets ($20-40).
Tuesday at Minneapolis Central Library: Talk of the Stacks with Adam Makos. In March 1945, Clarence Smoyer was a young gunner with the U.S. Army’s 3rd Armored division, fighting to capture the German city of Cologne. More than 70 years later, he’s tormented by the thought that his shot led to the death of a young German woman – a scene caught on film by an Army photographer. Historian and New York Times best-selling author Adam Makos tells the story in his latest nonfiction book, “Spearhead: An American Tank Gunner, His Enemy, and a Collision of Lives in World War II.” Here’s a CBS Sunday Morning feature you’ll want to watch before you go. Doors at 6:15 p.m, program at 7. Sales and signing to follow. Free.
Tuesday at the O’Shaughnessy: Anoushka Shankar. Master of the sitar in many settings – classical, pop, progressive, Latin, chill – Shankar is touring with her new album, “Reflections,” which cherry-picks tracks from her 20-year career. Tuesday’s concert will be an ideal introduction if you don’t already know her and a satisfying refresher if you do. Six-time Grammy nominee Shankar has been playing sitar all her life; she learned from her father, the late Ravi Shankar, who shot to fame in the ’60s when he taught George Harrison how to play. Oh, and her half-sister is Norah Jones. Shankar will share the stage with Ojas Adhiya (tabla), Pirashanna Theyarajah (mridangam), Ravichandra Kulur (flute), Danny Keane (cello, piano) and Kenji Ota (tanpura). 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($21-45).

U.S. Tracked Journalists and Activists Working Near the Southern Border

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- In an attempt to determine who was behind the caravans that were bringing large numbers of migrants from Central America to the southwest border, the Trump administration created a list of activists and journalists whom they subjected to additional scrutiny when they entered the United States last year.
Federal immigration authorities faced criticism on Thursday after an internal government document, obtained by NBC 7 San Diego, suggested that immigration activists and journalists were specifically singled out for extra screening at border entry points by the United States and Mexican governments.
Many of those on the list had traveled with the migrant caravans as they arrived in Mexican border cities from Central America to seek asylum. Others on the list, according to lawyers representing them, had provided legal assistance or aid to migrants, but had not traveled with the caravans at all.
Customs and Border Protection officials said they had identified people because they may have had information in connection to assaults against Border Patrol agents that took place last November and in January, but said that gathering this type of information was standard.
"C.B.P. does not target journalists for inspection based on their occupation or their reporting," Andrew Meehan, the agency's assistant commissioner of public affairs, said in a statement, adding that C.B.P. "has policies in place that prohibit discrimination against arriving travelers and has specific provisions regarding encounters with journalists."
Nonetheless, the inspector general for the Homeland Security Department opened an inquiry last month, with C.B.P., "to ensure that all appropriate policies and practices were followed."
In Washington, lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee sent a letter on Thursday to Customs and Border Protection criticizing the list and said it raised serious legal and constitutional questions.
Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said that targeting reporters or advocates for secondary screening and extended detention on the basis of their work was a violation of their rights. Ms. Bhandari said the A.C.L.U. was monitoring developments in the cases and exploring all legal options.
"The implications of this are really disturbing," she said. "It is unconstitutional for the government to target people for punishment or retaliation solely based on their first amendment protected activity."

Go Nakamura, a freelance photographer whose work has appeared in The New York Times and who was on the list, said he had suspected for several months that his name had been flagged to immigration officials.
In an interview Thursday, he recalled being stopped by Mexican authorities in late December while he was near the border fence in Tijuana to take photographs of migrants. The officers asked to see Mr. Nakamura's passport, something he had not experienced during other lengthy assignments on the border, he said. He thought it was strange when the officers took photos of his passport on cellphones.
Mr. Nakamura, an American citizen, tried to re-enter the United States several days later, and initially faced routine questions. He was asked about his background, where he lived, where he went to school. He was also asked about when he began working as a photojournalist.
But the questioning began to alarm Mr. Nakamura when an officer pulled out a document with pictures of about 10 to 14 faces and asked him to identify them.
"They asked me if I recognized any of the faces," Mr. Nakamura said. "I didn't, so I said no. The officer who showed me the papers, she was asking me if I was connected with the organizers of the caravan. She was like, have you met the organizers or do I know the organizers?"
"I felt like they thought I was a spy or something," Mr. Nakamura said.
Kitra Cahana, a freelance photographer on the list whose work has also appeared in The Times, said she was barred from entering Mexico on Jan. 17 while she was en route to photograph another caravan of migrants traveling through the country. As she was about to board a flight from Montreal to Detroit, she scanned her passport at a pre-clearance machine, which printed out a picture with an "X over my face." She was taken into secondary questioning in Montreal, but was ultimately allowed to board her flight.
In Mexico City, she was again detained. That time she was held for about 13 hours, she said, before being officially denied entry to Mexico.
Mexican authorities confiscated her American passport and cellphone during that period. She was escorted to a flight back to Detroit. Later that month, on Jan. 26, she said she tried to cross into Mexico from Guatemala, and was denied entry.
Ms. Bhandari said there were specific rules outlined by the Justice Department that the government must follow when questioning journalists, which, she said, Customs and Border Protection may have violated.
"The existence of these dossiers can have a real chilling effect," Ms. Bhandari said. "It can suggest to other journalists that if they dare to report on activities that are embarrassing to the United States government, you too can be singled out for this harsh treatment."

For Democrats to win, they must avoid leftist mythmaking

Texto completo: At 29, with her Puerto Rican heritage, megawatt smile and 3 million-plus Twitter followers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies the rising power of younger female nonwhite digital natives in American politics. If Hillary Rodham Clinton, or HRC, reflects the past, AOC foreshadows the future.
But as a role model for Democrats who desperately want to defeat Donald Trump, AOC is not A-OK. She represents New York City, one of the most liberal cities in the country, and as a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, her radical views on issues like "Medicare-for-all" and a "Green New Deal" fall far outside her party’s mainstream — let alone the national consensus. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 18 percent viewed the term "socialist" favorably.
"There is, without a doubt, a myth that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez somehow represents the narrative of Democratic primary voters in the country," Democratic pollster John Anzalone told The Washington Post. "Almost half of them identify themselves as moderates or conservatives."
Moreover, she reflects an intolerant impulse among Democratic leftists to purge the party of moderate heretics. After 26 of her fellow House members voted with Republicans to make it harder for undocumented immigrants to purchase guns, AOC threatened to put them "on a list" for primary challenges.
"Since when is it OK to put you on a Nixonian list?" Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus, protested in the Post. "We need to have a big tent in our party, or we won’t keep the House or win the White House."
The myth Anzalone identifies has bedeviled the Democratic Party since the death of Franklin Roosevelt 74 years ago. Liberals do form a critical component of the party’s "big tent" coalition, and no Democratic nominee can win the White House without their support. That’s why the far-too-late and far-too-grudging endorsement of Clinton by Bernie Sanders (or BS) was so damaging.
That said, Democrats cannot capture the presidency or either branch of Congress by lurching leftward. A candidate in the AOC/BS mold would be a hero in New York, California and Massachusetts — and a disaster in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which handed Trump the presidency in 2016 and will be critical again next year.
Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, stressed this point to The New York Times: "The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare-for-all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands."
Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, added: "If you want to lock up Pennsylvania for a Democrat, the more moderate Democrats are the key."
The numbers support them. A Gallup poll in January reported that 35 percent of Americans call themselves conservatives, the same number that identify as moderates. Only 26 percent are self-described liberals, the same portion who chose that label in 2016 exit polls.
It’s true that within the Democrats’ ranks, the percentage of liberals is rising, hitting 51 percent this year according to Gallup. But pragmatists still dominate the party. Fifty-four percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the party to "move closer to the center" while 41 percent "would rather it shift further left."
The same tension between purists and pragmatists is playing out in the House, where the AOC types are calling for the rapid impeachment of the president. But Democratic leaders are taking a much slower approach, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, insisting that impeachment must meet a "very high bar."
No president has ever been removed through impeachment (although Richard Nixon probably would have been the first, had he not resigned). The bar is and should be "very high."
But denying a president a second term through the ballot box is quite common, and in fact happened three times in five elections between 1976 and 1992. That bar is much lower and well within the reach of Democrats if they can avoid the mythmaking of leftists like AOC and BS and focus on political reality.

Texto completo: NEW YORK – A state regulator has subpoenaed an insurance provider for The Trump Organization, opening a new front in the widening investigations focused on President Donald Trump, his business, family, and White House administration.
Aon, a London-headquartered financial services company that is one of the world's largest insurance brokerages, said it was served a subpoena on Monday by the New York Department of Financial Services.
Donna Mirandola, Aon's vice president of global content marketing, confirmed the subpoena. The insurance brokerage intends to cooperate with the request but would not "comment on specific client matters," she said in an email response.
Another person with knowledge of the subpoena confirmed that the request sought records of communications involving Aon, Trump and his company, as well as internal documents for related insurance coverage. The person declined to be named because the subpoena had not been disclosed publicly.
A spokeswoman for The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The New York action, combined with moves by the Democratically controlled House, represents the latest in a series of new investigations that could target Trump through the second half of his White House term.
News about the subpoena, first reported by The New York Times, comes less than a week after former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen testified at a congressional hearing that his ex-boss inflated the value of his financial assets to obtain more favorable insurance rates and loans from banks.
Separately, the House Judiciary Committee on Monday requested records from 81 "agencies, entities and individuals" linked to the Republican presidential administration along with Trump's family members, present and former associates and his private businesses.
Additionally, the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday announced new hires, including a former federal prosecutor with expertise in battling Russian organized crime. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , who chairs the panel, has signaled plans to continue an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Criticizing the new investigations, Trump tweeted on Tuesday that Democratic House committee chairs "have gone stone cold CRAZY" and "won't get ANYTHING done for our Country!"
More: Trump immigration policy under scrutiny at simultaneous congressional hearings
More: FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb resigns
Special Counsel Robert Mueller also is focused on Russian interference with the presidential election; his report could be imminent. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have investigated Cohen, hush money payments to women who said they had sexual affairs with Trump, and other matters.
The New York regulator is part of the administration of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent Trump critic. The Department of Financial Services oversees all insurance companies that do business in New York, as well as many banks, credit unions and consumer credit reporting agencies.
The regulator does not have review authority over Trump or his business, nor does it have prosecutorial power. However, the regulator can refer findings to law enforcement authorities.

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- At first, Saudi Arabia was an adventure for Bethany Vierra.
An American from Washington State, she taught at a women's university, started a company, married a Saudi businessman and gave birth to a curly-haired daughter, Zaina.
But since the marriage went sour and she sought a divorce, she has been trapped. Because of the kingdom's so-called guardianship laws, which give men great power over women, she is unable to use her bank account, leave the country, travel with her daughter or seek legal help, according to her cousin, Nicole Carroll.
"She is completely stuck," Ms. Carroll, 37, said by phone from Dublin, Calif. "She is out of options."
Ms. Vierra, 31, is now divorced, but her ex-husband let her residency expire, meaning she has lost access to her bank account and cannot get authorization to leave the country, Ms. Carroll said. Their 4-year-old daughter cannot travel without her father's permission, meaning that even if Ms. Vierra finds a way to leave the kingdom, her child may have to stay behind.
Ms. Carroll decided to publicize her cousin's case because she believed the family had nowhere else to turn and hoped that speaking out would encourage someone to help her, while also shedding light on what she called "an unfair system."
Saudi Arabia's restrictions on women drew renewed international scrutiny in January, when a Saudi teenager ran away from her vacationing family and barricaded herself in a hotel room in Thailand before being granted asylum in Canada.
Under the so-called guardianship system, Saudi women are given a legal status similar to that of minors. All must have a male "guardian" -- usually a father or husband, but sometimes a son or uncle -- whose permission they need to obtain passports, pursue certain medical procedures or travel. These rules extend to foreign women who marry Saudis, like Ms. Vierra, as well as their children.
Male guardians can grant or deny permission to travel through a government app, even registering to receive text messages when any woman over whom they have oversight passes through an airport.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's day-to-day ruler, has loosened some restrictions on women, lifting a ban on driving by women and allowing them into sports stadiums. Last month, he named a princess, Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan, as the new Saudi ambassador to Washington.
When asked on "60 Minutes" last year whether men and women were equal, Prince Mohammed said: "Absolutely. We are all human beings, and there is no difference." Asked about guardianship in another interview, he said he wanted to "figure out a way to treat this that doesn't harm families and doesn't harm the culture."
But rights advocates say guardianship makes women and men profoundly unequal and leaves a woman with little recourse if she ends up with a controlling or abusive guardian.
"They are trying to put an image out there that they are giving more rights to women, but if they really want to do that, they need to get rid of guardianship," Ms. Carroll said.
Ms. Vierra moved to Saudi Arabia in 2011 to teach at a women's university while doing research for a graduate degree, Ms. Carroll said. Friends introduced her to a Saudi businessman who had been educated abroad and seemed supportive of her ambitions. They married in 2013, inviting friends to a destination wedding in Portugal.
"At the beginning, it seemed really great," said Ms. Carroll, who was the maid of honor. "He was charming and loving and generous and kind. She felt like she had met somebody who was on the same page as her."
The marriage produced the daughter, Zaina, but eventually grew rocky. Ms. Vierra's husband often lost his temper, shouting and swearing at her in front of Zaina, Ms. Carroll said. Ms. Vierra asked for a divorce, which men in Saudi Arabia -- but not women -- can grant by merely speaking a few words. For more than a year, he took no action on her request.
Under Saudi law, which is based on Islamic Shariah, a woman can request a cancellation of the marriage contract if the man is not living up to his duties. Last year, Ms. Vierra filed a request with a Saudi court based on her husband's emotional and verbal abuse. Her husband swore in court that she was lying and that he had divorced her more than six months earlier, an argument that the judge accepted, Ms. Carroll said.
Even after the divorce, her ex-husband remained the sponsor of Ms. Vierra's residency, as well as the guardian of her and her daughter, Ms. Carroll said. In December, he refused to give them permission to travel, meaning that they missed Christmas with Ms. Vierra's family.
Last month, he let Ms. Vierra's residency expire, making her presence illegal in Saudi Arabia, Ms. Carroll said. Without valid residency, she cannot travel, go to the police or get access to her bank account, meaning that she cannot pay her business expenses or employees' salaries.
Under a new Saudi law, women in her position can get residency for being the parent of a Saudi citizen. But only Ms. Vierra's ex-husband can get the documents needed for her to obtain such a status, Ms. Carroll said, and he has refused to do so.
And while Zaina is a dual Saudi-American citizen, Saudi Arabia recognizes her only as a Saudi. This means that, since the child's father is her guardian, even if Ms. Vierra can find a way to leave the kingdom, Zaina cannot go with her unless he grants permission.
Ms. Carroll shared Ms. Vierra's story on the condition that her ex-husband's name not be published; Ms. Carroll said she feared provoking his family and endangering her cousin. When contacted by The New York Times, Ms. Vierra confirmed the general outlines of her story but declined to comment further for fear of exacerbating her situation.
Her ex-husband did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking comment.
A State Department official declined to comment on Ms. Vierra's case, citing privacy rules. But the consular information page for Saudi Arabia on the State Department's website notes that even non-Saudi women need a male guardian's permission to leave the country and that the United States government "cannot obtain exit visas for the departure of minor children without their father/guardian's permission."
It also says that when foreigners divorce Saudis, "Saudi courts rarely grant permission for the foreign parent to leave the country with the children born during the marriage, even if he or she has been granted physical custody."
That leaves no clear exit for Ms. Vierra and her daughter, whose American relatives fear that the family will remain split up.
"She has no recourse," Ms. Carroll said. "Everyone keeps asking: 'What next? What next?' But there is no what next."

Trump Organization’s insurance broker subpoenaed

Texto completo: The Trump Organization’s longtime insurance broker was subpoenaed Monday by New York state officials, according to a new report.

The insurance company, Aon, has attracted scrutiny as part of an investigation conducted by the New York State Department of Financial Services and may refer potential illegal activity to prosecutors. The subpoena requests documents pertaining to Aon’s work with Trump and the Trump Organization over the past decade, including copies of all exchanges among Aon, Trump, and the Trump Organization, the New York Times reports.

The subpoena also requests all internal documents from Aon concerning Trump and his organization, contracts and agreements between the parties, and compensation for Aon employees who managed the Trump Organization account, an anonymous source familiar with the matter said.

Even so, the subpoena does not suggest that Aon participated in any misconduct. Aon must respond to the subpoena by March 19.

Just last week, Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen claimed that the Trump Organization exaggerated the value of its assets to insurance companies.

“To your knowledge did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked Cohen last week during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing.

“Yes,” Cohen said.

Specifically, Cohen pointed to Trump Organization officials such as chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg who could share more details.

The Trump Organization and Aon did not respond to requests for comment from the Times.

The Trump Organization is being investigated by federal prosecutors over hush money payments Cohen made to two women who alleged they had affairs with Trump. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations regarding the payments and was sentenced to three years.

Texto completo: Desde hace varios meses, la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional ( NSA , en inglés) ha cerrado un sistema que analiza los registros de las llamadas y mensajes de texto de los estadounidenses.
Según un alto asesor republicano del Congreso, el programa que ha provocado disputas sobre la privacidad y el estado de derecho desde los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001 ha sido detenido y el presidente Donald Trump no pedirá que sea reactivado, publicó el New York Times.
Oficialmente, el sistema no ha sido concluido, indica el Times, ya que expirará a fin de año, según el asistente, Luke Murry , asesor de seguridad nacional de la minoría en la Cámara.
La administración del presidente George W. Bush inició el programa a fin de evitar ataques terroristas, luego del 9/11 . La existencia del programa fue revelado hasta 2013 por el contratista Edward Snowden .
A través del sistema, los analistas de inteligencia han tenido acceso a registros masivos de llamadas y mensajes de texto de los estadounidenses con el objetivo de detectar posibles planes terroristas. No está claro cuántos ataques se evitaron con el programa.
Tampoco hay certeza de su continuidad, algo que el presidente Trump podría solicitar al Congreso, aunque Murry lo desconoce y afirma que el programa no ha sido utilizado desde hace seis meses, debido a que la NSA enfrenta problemas de autoridad para recopilar las llamadas y mensajes.

Texto completo: Maine Democrat comes under fire from gun control group and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Maine Democrat comes under fire from Rep. Ocasio-Cortez
With votes last week against more gun control and in favor of a proposal to help crack down on undocumented immigrants, Maine Democrat Jared Golden is drawing fire from his party’s left wing.
Golden’s opposition to expanded background checks spurred supporters of the measure to run advertising accusing him of siding with the gun lobby while his backing of a GOP-sponsored amendment to bolster the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raised hackles from at least one of the party’s most high-profile newcomers.
Golden is among a small group of Democratic lawmakers whose votes have upset liberal firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York, enough for her to speak out against them.
She said she is unhappy with a small “moderate wing,” which includes Golden, because its supporters opposed California Democrat Nancy Pelosi for speaker, supported compromise on President Donald Trump’s proposal wall and backed ICE.
Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group devoted to what it calls “common sense” gun regulation, has taken out at least 135 social media advertisements in the past few days on Facebook alone to go after the first-term, 2nd District member of Congress.
In its ads, the group insists Golden “failed us” and “sided with the gun lobby” in his opposition to background checks on most private gun transfers and for another bill to give the FBI more time to carry out the checks before a sale goes through.
Though neither bill is expected to secure backing in the Senate — and President Donald Trump has already vowed to veto them should they reach his desk — their passage marked the first time in more than two decades a piece of major gun control legislation passed either chamber of Congress.
Golden, one of two Democrats to oppose expanded background checks, said in a prepared statement he voted against them because the proposal is nearly the same as a 2016 Maine ballot question opposed by constituents in all of the counties he represents.
“Maine isn’t Chicago, Washington or New York,” he said. “For many of my constituents, access to firearms is a necessary part of daily life, and we have a tradition of responsible gun ownership.”
Everytown responded to the win by targeting eight lawmakers who voted against the bill, including both Democrats who opposed expanded checks: Golden and Collin Peterson of Minnesota. It said it planned to spend $200,000 assailing the bill’s opponents in swing districts.
“For those elected leaders who put the gun lobby ahead of the safety of their constituents, we’re sending a clear message: Do so at your own peril,” the president of the group, John Feinblatt, said in a prepared statement.
The pro-gun control group said Golden voted against the proposal “even though background checks reduce gun violence and save lives.”
In one of the ads against Golden, Everytown called on 2nd District voters to “let him know how disappointed you are that he put the interests of the gun lobby over the safety of his constituents.”
Golden, though, did not hesitate to defend his vote.
“Mainers in every county in my district were very clear: They don’t support expanding background checks to make some transfers between friends and family illegal,” he said Monday. “This one-size-fits-all approach to gun control doesn’t work for our state.
“Special interest groups can ignore the will of Mainers in the 2nd District all they want, but I stand by my vote and I stand with my constituents.”
Mainers rejected virtually the same proposal when it reached the 2016 ballot as a citizens’ initiative, with the 2nd District voting it down by a nearly 2-1 margin.
It is not just Golden’s vote on the gun measure that is drawing criticism.
Before the final vote, Golden also sided in favor of an amendment pushed by Republicans aimed largely at putting swing district representatives like him on the hot seat.
The GOP’s amendment called for ICE to be notified whenever undocumented immigrants barred from possessing firearms attempt to purchase one.
That amendment passed 220-209, serving to add the proposal to the overall bill that Democrats enacted shortly afterward with only a smattering of Republican support.
In seeking the amendment, U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, said anyone voting against the notification provision would be “voting to allow someone who should not have a firearm to get away with it and not be prosecuted for it.”
But a senior Democratic legislator, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, called the amendment “a total red herring” that was not needed.
Nadler told colleagues if someone fails a background check “because he is illegally in the country, that means the system knows he is illegally in the country.”
“So what is the point of reporting him?” Nadler asked. “He has to be in the system as illegally in the country in order to fail the background check.”
Nadler said the amendment was merely a bid by the GOP “to try to mix up the immigration issue with the gun violence issue, and they really have nothing to do with each other.”
Necessary or not, the provision was included in the final version of the background checks legislation endorsed by the House.
Some activists were angry Democrats helped hand the GOP a win that bolstered ICE.
According to the The New York Times, Ocasio-Cortez “implored moderates to vote against the Republican-led motions and, in an implicit threat, added that she would make it clear to liberal activists which members supported the Republican measures.”
On Twitter, the lawmaker said she was “upset that 26 Dems forced the other 200+ to vote for a pro-ICE provision at the last min without warning” because “I think an agency that pins children down + forcibly injects them w/ antipsychotic drugs shouldn’t be given more power.”
“We can have ideological differences and that’s fine,” she said in another tweet. “But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right, and said as much in a closed-door meeting.”
Ocasion-Cortez also mentioned “the same small splinter group of Dems” that sought to block California Democrat Nancy Pelosi from the speakership and “fund the wall during the shutdown when the public didn’t want it” had voted for the ICE amendment.
Though Ocasion-Cortez did not cite any names, Golden voted against Pelosi, favored compromise to end the shutdown and backed the controversial amendment.
Golden has repeatedly vowed to do what he thinks is best for his rural, sprawling district regardless of what Democratic leaders and activists want.
He is expected to face a tough re-election challenge in 2020, perhaps from the Republican he defeated last year, ex-U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who served two terms before losing in a cliffhanger in the first ranked-choice voting election for a federal office.

Texto completo: LAKE BUNYONYI, Uganda -- Samuel Muriisa thinks he is ready for Ebola, but he is not.
Mr. Muriisa, 74, is the most widely respected omushaho wekishaka, or traditional healer, in this area. He is aware -- but only vaguely -- that Ebola is raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose border is just 20 miles away.
"Let it stay in Congo," he said. "We seldom see Congo people here. Let it not come."
Jolly Twinomuhwezi, 60, one of his three wives who acts as his triage nurse, said she would send away anyone with bleeding eye sockets or fingernail beds, which she had heard were the chief Ebola symptoms.
She is dangerously wrong; most Ebola victims never hemorrhage, and in those that do, it is a late-stage symptom.
Medical experts worry that such combinations of misinformation and wishful thinking are common among traditional healers who, like it or not, are the front lines of rural African medicine.
Those concerns are intensifying as the epidemic in Congo spirals out of control. Last week, Doctors Without Borders suspended its work after violent attacks on two of its treatment centers.
Across the African continent, according to the World Health Organization, there are about 80 times as many traditional healers as there are medical doctors. Millions of Africans consult healers but, studies suggest, usually do not admit it if they see doctors, too.
In Congo, doctors now fighting Ebola believe that many of their patients first get infected while visiting such healers. They may arrive at the home of someone like Mr. Muriisa with malaria, or even a cough or other minor problem, but then end up lying next to someone with undiagnosed Ebola.
In the 2014 West African outbreak, which infected more than 11,000 people, the death of a prominent healer was a crucial "super-spreader event," linked to over 300 cases.
That healer, who lived in rural Sierra Leone, died after catching the virus from one of her patients. Hundreds of relatives and admirers came from many miles away for her funeral and helped wash her body, which was presumably teeming with virus.
They then returned to their homes in Guinea and Liberia, helping ignite the worst Ebola epidemic in history.
Mr. Muriisa discussed his practice with a reporter from The New York Times and visiting members of a Canadian medical charity, Bridge to Health.
The Canadians were offering routine medical and dental care in nearby villages, not doing Ebola-related work. Nonetheless, their infectious disease specialist, Dr. Sasan Hosseini-Moghaddam, made sure triage nurses were on the alert for the virus.
Any patient with a fever who had visited Congo, or had contact with someone who did, should be isolated and not touched, Dr. Hosseini-Moghaddam told the nurses. Then the patients should be asked about diarrhea, vomiting, joint pain, red eyes and difficulty breathing or swallowing -- all potential signs of Ebola.
Of course, Mr. Muriisa has no way to do an Ebola test, or even one for malaria, which, when severe, can be confused with Ebola.
Uganda's health ministry has not given him one of its brightly colored posters illustrating Ebola symptoms that can be found tacked up at border posts and conventional clinics.
His office is a thatched mud hut decorated with shields and antelope horns. It is at the top of a steep hill above a boat landing on a reed-choked shore -- so steep that his grandsons keep a dozen polished staffs stuck in the ground to help panting visitors climb it.
To meet patients, he tops his normal attire -- a corduroy jacket and shorts -- with a cloak of what appears to be serval cat fur and a headpiece of black and white monkey hair.
Local residents said the healer was correct that few Congolese ever visit Lake Bunyonyi, which is at an altitude of 6,500 feet and surrounded by farmers, crawfish-gatherers and lakeside resorts (including Idi Amin's former summer home).
Most Congolese who traverse the border are traders headed straight for Kampala, Uganda's capital, to buy goods for resale in Congo. Also, nurses stationed at the frontier are supposed to take temperatures and turn back anyone with a fever, and Ugandan bus lines have stopped serving the Congolese cities hit hardest by Ebola, Beni and Butembo, which are 200 miles to the northwest.
But borders are permeable, and Africans who fall seriously ill may travel long distances to see the healer in their home villages, because they trust them.
Healers can spend time with patients and speak their home dialects. Mr. Muriisa's first language is Rukiga (pronounced rue-CHEE-ga). Also, healers accept payment in the currencies of the poor: vegetables, alcohol, chickens and goats.
Some very grateful patients, Mr. Muriisa said, have even given him a daughter. "She then becomes my daughter," he explained. "And maybe one of my sons will marry her."
Herbalists are also trusted because some of their teas, ointments and powders genuinely do alleviate common ills such as allergies, nosebleeds, arthritis pain or toothache.
And they sell potions to ward off curses such as lightning strikes or jealous neighbors, disasters for which Western medicine offers no remedies.
(Mr. Muriisa is an herbalist, not an omufumu, who is paid to put curses on people, according to Innocent Tumusiingize, a local dentist who led the visit and translated. The two professions have parallels elsewhere; in southern Africa, for example, they are known as sangomas and nyangas.)
Local people with H.I.V. do come to him, Mr. Muriisa said -- sometimes right after getting a positive blood test at a clinic.
He admitted that he cannot cure AIDS, but claimed to be able to slow it down -- to "make the virus drunk and weak" -- with a concoction made from the local omusikamoori tree.
He does not discourage his patients from taking conventional H.I.V. drugs. Some take them as well as his treatment, he said, but they rarely admit it.

"They fear arrest," he said. "Because the government says herbs don't work and should not be used."
He cannot cure cancer, he admitted, but he does treat snake bites. He also treats mental illness.
Typically he conspires with the family of an emotionally disturbed person to knock him or her out with a few dark seeds from the rweziringa, or thornapple, shrub.
According to a plant reference book he keeps, it is Datura stramonium, known in the United States as jimsonweed, a powerfully toxic and hallucinogenic member of the nightshade family.
"In that state, they say many things," he said. "And I can tell from their words whether it is demons or a curse making them ill, and I can decide how to treat them."
For seriously ill patients, he has two tests to predict whether he can cure them.
One requires balancing a small horn on a vertical stick; the other involves boiling a soda bottle full of green liquid to see if it changes color.
If both tests indicate the patient will die, Mr. Muriisa does not tell them, because it would be disheartening. Instead, he advises them to go to the local public hospital.
His herbal knowledge came from his father, whose grave is just outside the hut and who was the local healer for decades until his death at age 92.
But the spiritual aspect of his power, Mr. Muriisa explained, comes from an ancient African god named Kazoba Nyamahanga (which means "little sun god" in Rukiga).
Kazoba, he said, sends villagers dreams indicating who their next healer will be, and grants the chosen one the power occasionally to predict the future.
He also worshiped the Christian god, he said: "I was baptized Samuel, and I go to church -- but for me it's more like a club, someplace to see friends."
As the visit ended, Mr. Muriisa stood outside with his guests as they waited for their boat. His first wife, Joy Mazooba, 65, brought over one of their grandchildren.
"Her teeth are too brown -- could you look at them?" she asked the doctors and dentists through a translator. "And I think something is wrong with her eyes."

Texto completo: The organizing committee of FIFA announced Monday that it would recommend the use of video assistant referee technology at the Women's World Cup this summer, bringing refereeing advances introduced at the men's World Cup in Russia last year to soccer's most important women's championship for the first time. The decision, which is expected to be approved by the governing FIFA Council when it meets later this month in Miami, is a victory for women's soccer players, coaches and fans who have highlighted gender equality issues in the international game.
The technology, known by the acronym V.A.R., allows the on-field referee to consult with a colleague viewing video replays to help confirm, or overturn, close calls in a narrow set of instances. It was fully implemented for the first time at a major FIFA tournament last summer at the men's World Cup, where FIFA hailed its introduction as a rousing success.
But as the 2019 Women's World Cup came into view, FIFA repeatedly declined to confirm whether V.A.R. would be at that competition as well, turning the issue into another flash point -- alongside artificial turf fields and unequal compensation and bonuses -- in the broader gender equity debate in soccer.
On the V.A.R. point, at least, the debate seems finally to be settled.
Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, said last weekend that he supported the use of the technology at the women's event in June, stating that it was proving effective at discouraging the type of diving and playacting that often plague major soccer tournaments.
"Players now know that it's not just sufficient to have a look where is the referee, so if he doesn't see me I can simulate, because he or she will be caught," Infantino said, according to The Associated Press. "That's why V.A.R. automatically helps the fight against simulation and diving in a very efficient way."
Referees for the Women's World Cup began training with the video technology this winter at a series of seminars in Abu Dhabi and Doha. FIFA later said some had been introduced to the technology as early as 2016.
Still, as this summer's tournament in France approached, questions lingered about whether there would be enough time to get all of the untrained officials up to speed and comfortable with the protocols. FIFA on Monday said their progress had been satisfactory.
"Based on the thorough work carried out over the past few months, FIFA is happy with the steps taken and the excellent job done by FIFA's refereeing team and the female referees involved," Zvonimir Boban, the deputy secretary general of FIFA, said in a statement. "We are confident about proposing the use of V.A.R. in France to the FIFA Council, as we are very positive about its implementation."
V.A.R. technology is quickly becoming an indispensable, if still sometimes controversial, presence at the top men's competitions in the world. Many leagues and competitions -- from Major League Soccer in the United States to Germany's Bundesliga and England's F.A. Cup -- already use the system. European soccer officials announced in December that they would introduce it for the knockout rounds of this year's Champions League, the world's richest club competition.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, United States Coach Jill Ellis said she felt it was "hugely important" that the use of V.A.R. in the women's game kept pace with its spread on the men's side.
"First and foremost, we've got to fight for what's going to help the game," she said. "You can just see the benefit of it. It's proven."
Becky Sauerbrunn, a longtime defender for the United States team, and a member of its 2015 Women's World Cup champions, said that while the V.A.R. issue was far from the most pressing gender equality issue in international soccer, it symbolized the many little ways that FIFA can make the women's game feel like an afterthought.
For her, its use was just a matter of common sense.
"For me it's, why not?" Sauerbrunn said. "Why not give it to the women if you give it to the men?"

Texto completo: You know Dr. Seuss books helped make your kids smart.

And now theres a new one thats all about art!

Wait, a new Dr. Seuss book? The beloved childrens author and illustrator, whose real name was Theodor Geisel, died in 1991. But Random House Childrens Books has announced that it will publish a new book by him on Sept. 3.

According to an email: The original manuscript for Dr. Seusss Horse Museum was discovered in the late authors La Jolla home 21 years after his death, alongside the manuscript for the 2015 No. 1 New York Times bestseller What Pet Should I Get?

Seuss left notes and sketches for Horse Museum, but not a finished book. His publishers worked with Australian illustrator Andrew Joyner, whose books include The Hair Book and the Duck and Hippo series, to recreate Seuss unique visual style.

Dr. Seusss Horse Museum also reflects Seuss intense interest in modern art, and the book will incorporate full-color images of horse-themed works by such artists as Pablo Picasso, Rosa Bonheur, Alexander Calder, Jacob Lawrence and Jackson Pollock.

Dr. Seuss has been the target of some recent criticism, with studies showing that some of the images of people of color in his books use racist stereotypes. In 2017, the National Education Association rebranded its 20-year-old literacy program Read Across America, centered on his books and his birthday, which is today, to de-emphasize his work.

But he remains a beloved author, and many communities and schools in Read Across America continue to include his books. The latest NPD Bookscan bestseller list, for the week ending Feb. 16, included four Dr. Seuss books in its fiction top 10.

Dr. Seusss Horse Museum will have a first printing of 250,000 copies.

Texto completo: "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" actor Terry Crews crossed the line this weekend.
He said sorry on Sunday after tweeting that the children of same-sex parents would be "severely malnourished" when it comes to love.
The conversation that prompted the apology began more than a week earlier when Crews reacted to an opinion piece in the New York Times by human rights lawyer Derecka PurnelI. Crews initially took issue with Purnell, a woman, writing a piece called “Why Does Obama Scold Black Boys?"
"Another thing that bothers me is that this OP-ED was written by a WOMAN about how boys should be taught to grow into successful young men," he wrote. "How would she know?"
Crews, who has spoken out about his own sexual assault and has become an activist in the #MeToo movement, took heat from Twitter users who said that women have a right to speak when it comes to raising men.
Over the next week, the conversation began to evolve over the roles mothers and fathers play in their children's lives.
"I've reiterated many times that same sex couples and single parents can successfully raise a child," Crews tweeted Saturday. "But I believe paternal AND maternal love are like vitamins and minerals to humanity. No matter where you get that paternal and maternal love. MY purpose is to give paternal love. "
A Twitter user replied, "love is not gendered. a child will not starve with only one gender loving them. "
Crews's now-deleted response to the tweet was, "But they will be severely malnourished. "
On Sunday, he apologized for the eyebrow-raising comment.
"I apologize to anyone who was hurt by my 'severely malnourished' tweet. It was in response to someone who said that kids wouldn't 'starve,'" he tweeted. "It was poorly worded so I deleted it. "

'Merchants' casts grim eye on news business

Texto completo: One of the facts bemoaned by traditional journalists in the current state of the news business is that, with a growing banquet of news to offer on any given day, in any given hour, consumers are opting for boiled down listicles and scannable reads.
It's the antithesis in style to what The New York Times used to embody, particularly by its former senior editorial leader, Jill Abramson, the first woman to serve as the paper's Washington bureau chief, managing editor and executive editor – the top job in American print journalism.
But as everyone knows , Abramson didn't last long at the top; just three years. In May 2014, she was fired for allegedly poor management and being too "difficult" for even hard-boiled Times journalists to handle.
Her account of what happened as laid out in her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," is absorbing and fair – and it's likely the first section many journalists will turn to.
"There was no simple reason I was fired. I was a less than stellar manager, but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders. Most of all, I became the first woman editor at a very bad time in journalism," she writes.
Now comes "Merchants," published Tuesday (Simon & Schuster, ).
Reviews have been generally positive, mixed with sharp criticism. There already has been a contretemps over whether she accused the Times of being biased against President Donald Trump in its coverage. She batted that away as an exaggeration of something taken out of context. A fair reading backs her up.
Now she and her publisher are dealing with more serious charges of factual errors and plagiarism lodged late Wednesday in a series of tweets on Twitter by a reporter for one of the four news organizations she examines in the book, Vice – which under her gaze does not come off as a journalistic paragon.
Simon & Schuster issued a statement Thursday promising revisions if warranted in the 534-page book. Abramson also issued a statement to USA TODAY that the passages in question involve facts that were imperfectly cited in her 70 pages of footnotes. "I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested," she said.
Meanwhile, the book as published documents the crisis: Journalism may have not yet been annihilated but the barbarians are at the gate and banging hard. More news than ever is out there and more people than ever are in need of reliable information in order for democracy to function, Abramson observes.
At the same time, she reports, the journalism business model is stuttering and a steadier replacement is not yet obvious. Every news company struggles to produce a product for the digital age amid sharp staff cuts, while more consumers, marinated in "the internet is free!" assumptions, are unwilling to pay for it, Abramson says.
The author explores this grim state through the experiences of two legacy media titans, her former employer, the Times, and the Washington Post, fighting to retain their "values" in a maelstrom, and two digital titans, BuzzFeed and Vice, "improbable players" in an arena where social media drives large numbers of consumers to news.
"I was determined to capture this moment of wrenching transition – and to do it as a reporter, my first calling," Abramson writes.
She has her pet peeves: The sometimes dishonest nature of clickbait headlines, designed to capture attention but promising more than they deliver. Tedious business meetings watching PowerPoint presentations of eye-glazing data charts. The "ridiculously" few women in senior editing jobs at the Times, a deficit she is most proud of improving during her tenure.
She is alarmed about the chipping away of the traditional wall between the news side and the business side. When the new CEO of the Times told her he expected new "revenue-producing products" to come from the newsroom, she snapped, "If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor ... The truth had flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or tone."
Abramson doesn't see an entirely trouble-free future for any of her examined news organizations, despite their various successes. "All four are endangered," she warns. That even goes for the Post, which was rescued in 2013 by its "white knight," Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who bought the family-owned paper for $250 million with the idea that "restoring its glory would be a contribution to democracy."
For legacy media survivors, following the trials and tribulations of two newspapers may involve equal measures of envy, dread and schadenfreude. BuzzFeed and Vice may seem like alien entities.
Abramson traces how BuzzFeed began with a steady diet viral cat videos, but founder and "virality" genius Jonah Peretti and his team figured out how to connect with a mostly disaffected young audience through their emotions – at the "beating heart of the internet." They pioneered a new business model – native advertising – and by the end of 2011, BuzzFeed had "pivoted" to original news reporting, beefing up its reporting staff with a goal of being taken seriously.
Vice started out as a print lads mag constantly pushing the bounds of bad taste in the quest to be "edgy," which led to such outrages as "The Racist Issue." In 2017, Vice's 18 hours of footage of the deadly Charlottesville, Va., Unite the Right rally garnered a total of 50 million views and became the "defining image" of the violence, Abramson says.
Non-journalists may find "Merchants" dense and complicated, with something surprising or infuriating on every page. Journalists working today already know in their guts most of what Abramson is reporting, if not in the depressing detail she presents.
Abramson earns three stars for her thoroughness and insights, but this is not a beach read, and certainly not a happy read. Unless, of course, you believe journalists are the enemy of the people.
Jill Abramson and "Merchants of Truth" are facing charges of plagiarism.

Texto completo: In his first novel since the acclaimed "Natchez Burning" trilogy, Mississippian Greg Iles offers readers a crime thriller with a fresh setting, new characters and a whole new set of troubles – topped off with a bundle of family secrets that lead to another shocking Iles ending.
"Cemetery Road" introduces Marshall McEwan – a successful Washington, D.C. journalist returning to his hometown of fictional Bienville, Mississippi, to run the family's newspaper in the wake of his father's illness. In a story of love, betrayal, corruption, and, of course, murder, the bonds of family and romantic interests are tested beyond a breaking point – all keeping McEwan a very busy man.
The author of 15 New York Times bestsellers, Iles has seen his novels made into films and published in more than 35 countries. He is a longtime member of the "lit-rock" group The Rock Bottom Remainders and lives in Natchez with his wife and has three children.
What was it like switching gears and sitting down to write your first novel since the Penn Cage trilogy?
I really needed a break from the travails of the Cage family, and from the worst years of the civil rights struggle. My readers probably do too. The "Natchez Burning" trilogy took me the better part of 10 years to write, and I nearly died (in a serious car accident) in 2011 while trying to finish the first volume.
"Cemetery Road" is just as intense as the trilogy in some ways, but it focuses less on race, and more on the secrets hidden in marriages and extended families. The secret at the heart of this book is pretty shocking, I think, but I don't want to say more than that.
The plot of "Cemetery Road" is filled with danger, crime and surprises – not to mention many regrettable relationships – in the fictitious river town of Bienville, with main character Marshall McEwen in the thick of it. How would you describe his personality (given his past tragedies and his relationship with his father), and the tumultuous events he faces on a daily basis?
As for Marshall McEwan, I think a lot of people can relate to him. He left the small town he grew up in, worked hard for success and fame, yet now he must return home to care for a dying father he's barely spoken to in 30 years.
That's the chief difference between Marshall and Penn Cage (in the "Natchez Burning" trilogy). Penn and Tom Cage loved and respected each other all their lives, but Marshall and his father were driven apart by a family tragedy when Marshall was only 14. Marshall's father blames him for that tragedy – unfairly. I think.
Marshall returns to Mississippi more to help his mother than to care for his father, but I think we want father and son to find a way to reconcile before the end, because Marshall got a lot of his strength and stubbornness from his dad. And he needs every bit of it to handle the SOBs he faces in "Cemetery Road."
Are there any threads of truth (from Mississippi or elsewhere) that were the basis for the goings-on of the Bienville group known as the Poker Club in "Cemetery Road"?
The Bienville Poker Club absolutely grew out of stories I heard as a boy growing up in Natchez, and from talking to Mississippians from many walks of life. The people who run small Southern towns are rarely those in the official power structure. Always been that way, and probably always will be.
As Robert Penn Warren knew, corruption is deeply ingrained in our lives, even in the human spirit. And in all politics, sadly... money talks louder than anything else.
Is it possible that we will hear from Marshall McEwan again? Perhaps a sequel or a brand new direction for McEwan. Or, can you tell us of any other ideas you may be working on for your next book?
You may well hear from Marshall again. I've been working behind the scenes in Mississippi politics for about three years, and that's given me some great ideas. I also have a very twisty noir story that's perfect for Marshall and for Nadine Sullivan, another new character in "Cemetery Road."
Another ambitious book tour has claimed your schedule for the month of March – with 27 stops in 19 days! – and once again with the kickoff in Mississippi cities. Tell me about the tour.
I'm always conflicted about my book tours. I like staying home on my country place. Racing to two or three cities a day for a month will wear you out quick. But it's the only time I get out among my readers, and I always have some wonderful experiences out there. Some people travel a long way to get to my book signings, and I try to give them a great talk, as well as visit with them a bit.
Signing
Greg Iles will sign copies of "Cemetery Road" at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday at Lemuria Books in Jackson, with a reading at 5:30 p.m.; he will also sign at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, Off Square Books, Oxford; and 5:30 p.m. Thursday, Turnrow Books, 304 Howard St., Greenwood

The great hypocrisy of the Green New Deal

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed. But, hey, who’s gonna turn down free money?
The economic pain of green cronyism cuts deeper than wasted taxpayer money. When Washington steers money to — or away from — “favored” businesses or technologies, private-sector investment follow. This not only stifles competition and innovation, it also centralizes control in the hands of politicians, elites and lobbyists.
That’s the big picture. But the Green New Deal has very personal ramifications as well. It would change the way you live your life — from what car you drive, to how cool or warm you you’re your home, to what you eat.
The stench of hypocrisy makes it all that much worse.

In Winter of Extremes, Here's Another: Snowstorm on Track to Run Coast to Coast

Texto completo: By Mitch Smith and Adeel Hassan
CHICAGO -- Spring may be within sight, but as the calendar flipped to March, forecasters on Friday predicted a walloping storm this weekend, with snow and icy rain expected to coat a 2,500-mile path from Northern California to southern Maine. Rain was also forecast to drench Southern California and much of the South, from Texas to Virginia.
"I think everybody's just kind of annoyed by it," said Kent Flake, the commissioner of streets in St. Louis, where crews began treating the roads on Friday morning ahead of an expected six inches of snow.
Mr. Flake, an 18-year veteran of city government, said he could not recall a St. Louis winter with more storms. All that snow and ice, he said, have left behind about three times as many potholes as usual.
But in California, the prospect of cold, wintry weather was met with a mix of wonder, worry and -- in the mountains, where wet winters translate to great skiing and snowboarding -- glee.
In Kansas City, Mo., where up to five inches of snow and sub-zero temperatures were expected, the National Weather Service urged people to stock up on bread and milk. "We have been through this drill before," the agency wrote on Twitter.
In Peoria, Ill., where snow was possible on Saturday into Sunday, the city sought nominees for the "Golden Shovel Awards," honoring residents "who are going above and beyond to keep the sidewalks clean." And in the Minneapolis area, where the snowiest February on record just ended, according to local news outlets, March began with more snow and frigid temperatures.
Even in places where weekend snow was unlikely, the forecast did not inspire much enthusiasm. In Chicago, forecasters warned of sub-zero wind chills early next week, cold enough to cause frostbite.
Dan Parker, the public works director in Indianapolis, was not at all excited to see a forecast calling for another storm. "I don't think what went through my mind could be quoted in The New York Times," said Mr. Parker, whose overtime budget has been stretched and whose road crews have only had one weekend off since early January.
Mr. Parker said workers were continuing to patch potholes, which pocked the city's 8,400 lane-miles of street after a brutal cycle of freezing and thawing. By Saturday night, he said, it would be time to treat the roads for the coming storm.

The weather comes during a winter of extremes. In late January, Chicago broke a record for lowest maximum daily temperature at minus 10 degrees, busting its earlier record of minus 3 degrees. The city also hit a record daily low at minus 23 degrees.
A few days later, in early February, Washington, D.C., broke a 28-year record when highs reached 70 degrees, a balmy temperature more common to South Texas or Los Angeles.
Last month, though, was the first February on record that downtown Los Angeles did not reach 70 degrees, a milestone marked by light grousing from Angelenos. But when it snowed in the city last week, it prompted a flurry of delighted social media posts. And when the Bay Area got a dusting earlier this month, residents of the region got out their sleds.
According to climate experts, increasing weather extremes are in keeping with broader predictions of climate change. Severe weather -- be it precipitation or cold -- worries observers in the Golden State, where every storm brings the risk of mudslides in fire-scarred communities and flooding. Daniel Swain, a California climate scientist, said that climate change is making extreme swings between warm weather and cold weather, drought and rain, the new normal.
[Read: Both sides of the climate change debate are using extreme weather in their arguments.]
"Things are changing faster than I think has been apparent to a lot of people," he said. "It seems incremental until it doesn't."
He said he had heard stories from Californians who did not think much about wildfires -- they were just things on the news -- until they found themselves screaming at their children to get in the car before flames reached their homes. He said he had also heard from South Lake Tahoe residents who had owned their homes at lake level for decades and who said that they had noticed their yards were getting blanketed less and less frequently. So when it does snow in years like this, the contrast is more marked.
And the mere fact that such changes are detectable within a human lifetime is remarkable.
"Increasingly in California and elsewhere we're seeing anecdotes that are lining up with the physical science evidence," Mr. Swain said. "The last 30 years have changed a lot more than the previous 30 years, and we expect that the coming 30 years will change a lot more than the present 30 years."
In the Pacific Northwest, where in some places February was the snowiest month on record, the last leftover piles of gray, ice-hardened snow had just about disappeared Friday. The sun was shining in Seattle. People sighed and stripped to short-sleeved tees.
But, it turned out, winter was far from over. In parts of Oregon, the governor declared an emergency in 10 counties this week as snow and ice descended. The forecast for much of Oregon and Washington in coming days calls for a mix: It will be sunny in places, but continue to be colder than average, so some stubborn slush piles could last.
Across the country in southern New England, back-to-back storms were forecast for the weekend. A low-pressure system was expected to move in on Saturday morning, bringing several inches of snow to parts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Boston, where snow that had fallen earlier this week had just begun to melt on Friday, was expected to receive three to six inches on Saturday, while six to eight inches were predicted for some areas south of Boston.
Lenore Correia, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston, said the snow would be wet and sticky, especially along the coast and in southeast Massachusetts, making driving conditions worse and increasing the likelihood of felled trees, downed power lines and power failures.
So much snow is also bad news for anyone who has to shovel it. "A lot of people end up hurting their backs," Ms. Correia said.
Mitch Smith reported from Chicago, and Adeel Hassan from New York. Reporting was contributed by Kendra Pierre-Louis from New York; Kate Taylor from Cambridge, Mass.; Kirk Johnson from Seattle; and Jill Cowan from Los Angeles.

Texto completo: T.M. Landry College Prep Academy, a private school in Breaux Bridge that gained national attention last year when its highly touted success stories were challenged in a New York Times investigation, was planning to move to Lafayette next week, but the Office of the State Fire Marshal said that might not be the case.
And the office also said the school's current building is not up to code.
Deputies inspected the potential Lafayette space Thursday evening and called for more work to be done first.
"No occupancy is to be granted until plans are submitted, reviewed, and released by the OSFM Plan Review division and then a satisfactory final inspection conducted by OSFM deputies," according to the State Fire Marshal's Office.
The agency ordered any construction on site to cease and desist and for plans to be submitted for review regarding the change of occupancy from storage use to educational use.
"Regarding the occupying of any new location, we cannot allow a new building to open without a full certificate of occupancy, which guarantees an acceptable level of fire safety," State Fire Marshal H. "Butch" Browning said in an emailed statement.
Browning's office has been in contact with T.M. Landry, repeatedly telling the "tenants" to install a fire alarm system in the building that has served as a school for at least 100 students, according to a timeline provided by Public Affairs Director Ashley Rodrigue.
The school was notified in December 2017 of that requirement, and it was repeated multiple times through this year.
Thursday's investigation of the Lafayette property that the school was considering, reportedly a former skating rink, could impact the status of the school's current location on Rees Street in Breaux Bridge.
"Pending the outcome of this new investigation, we will re-evaluate the status of the temporary use at the school's Breaux Bridge location as well," Browning said in the statement.
School officials had informed Browning's office of a potential move to a different location on Moss Street last year.
But after no move took place by January and a fire alarm still hadn't been installed, the fire marshal asked for a plan of action with deadlines to be submitted by February, according to a timeline provided by the fire marshal's office.
As of January the school's current building needed a new plan regarding "a sprinkler system, fire alarm, new restrooms, new exits, upgrade current exits, new handicap space and renovate current bathrooms for ADA compliance," according to the timeline.
The school has been given the deadline of March 8 to either provide the state fire marshal with a timeline for moving or a plan of action for bringing the Breaux Bridge location into compliance, Rodrigue said.
It appears the school did not obtain the appropriate approval or comply to state fire codes before occupying its current building.
"Transitioning a former fabrication shop into an educational facility, by law, is extensive due to the different threats from fire and other emergencies of each of those occupancies," Browning said in his statement. "This requires prior approval and inspection by the State Fire Marshal's office before legal occupancy can occur, which did not occur in the school's Breaux Bridge location."
The school was allowed multiple emergency contingencies of "fire watch procedure" due to its multiple efforts to move, according to the fire marshal's office.
Michael and Tracey Landry founded the independent school in 2005. It is not accredited by the state Department of Education, does not receive state funding and thus is not subjected to assessments and evaluations the state gives to traditional public and charter schools.
It first received national attention for sending students to Ivy League schools, catching the eye of celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres, and more recently for claims of abuse and that college applications were falsified made public in a New York Times article in November.
A few weeks later, the school announced it had retained a New Orleans law firm to investigate the allegations raised in the article.
Former Louisiana education superintendent Paul Pastorek, now an education lawyer, was to oversee the investigation, and Greg Davis, former director of the Cajundome and Convention Center, assumed the role as chair of the T.M. Landry board of directors.
Davis said enrollment dropped to about 80 students. The enrollment was around 110 last fall and fell to around 90 students in mid-December, when the school announced the investigation.
The school founders teach at the school. Tracey Landry also is the school's principal, and Michael Landry is the director of education and development.
They were both to resign from the school's board, according to the announcement in December. School officials directed The Daily Advertiser to Davis, who did not return requests for comment.
"We have worked tirelessly to ensure the safety of the building occupied by T.M. Landry College Prep and to cooperate with the challenges the school has faced in complying with state fire safety codes," Browning said in a statement.
T.M. Landry College Prep Academy was planning to move to Lafayette next week, but the Office of the State Fire Marshal said that might not be the case.

Texto completo: ALBANY - Dozens of New York political, union and business leaders are trying to get Amazon to reconsider its decision to abandon its plans for a major campus in Queens.
They have signed an "open letter," set to run in The New York Times on Friday, asking the company to reconsider its bombshell announcement on Feb. 14 canceling the Queens project. The letter, which Newsday also obtained, says Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo "will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval, and Mayor [Bill] de Blasio will work together with the governor to manage the community development project."
Further, the Times reported Cuomo has had several telephone calls with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, pitching him to reconsider. A Cuomo aide declined to confirm the story's account but added that the governor has had multiple conversations with company officials.
Cuomo, at an unrelated event Thursday in Old Westbury, said he is endeavoring to get Amazon to reconsider - but said there is no indication the company will do so. He didn't say whether he had spoken to Bezos.
stAMAZON_letter190301
"I've had many conversations with Amazon," Cuomo said when fielding reporters' questions. "I hope that they reconsider. Up until now, we haven't seen any change in their position."
Amazon cited local opposition when it made the shocking announcement pulling out of Long Island City. Critics had decried the nearly $3 billion in tax abatements and grants offered by Cuomo and de Blasio to one of the world's richest companies. They also criticized Amazon for saying it would oppose any move to unionize workers and complained that the governor and mayor put together the offer without any local input.
Amazon pulled out of the deal shortly after a series of tense, closed-door meetings with union and state officials who thought they were making progress with the company. The company also faced a vocal opponent in Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), who represents Long Island City and who had been nominated to serve on a state panel that had power over granting some of the incentives offered to Amazon. Since Amazon canceled, Gianaris' nomination to the panel has been withdrawn.
Long Island's Democratic senators - John Brooks (D-Seaford), Jim Gaughran (D-Northport), Anna Kaplan (D-Great Neck), Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach), Monica Martinez (D-Brentwood) and Kevin Thomas (D-Levittown) - on Thursday voiced support for the effort to change Amazon's mind.
"Amazon would be an economic boon to our metropolitan region and the entire state, which is why we supported it previously,"  their statement said. "We look forward to doing whatever we can to help bring Amazon, 25,000 high-paying jobs and billions in revenue to our state."
Cuomo had lashed out at the Long Island senators, and Kaminsky in particular, for not supporting the project with enough enthusiasm after Amazon first withdrew and had partly blamed the departure on the Senate's Democratic majority.
A source close to organized labor in New York City and the Cuomo administration described the effort to lure the company back as a "full-court press."
"There is a huge appetite for it," the source said, referring to the effort to get Amazon to reconsider and adding the main movers are the politically powerful SEIU 32BJ union and several tenants groups in Queens that supported the project.
"It's too much to say Amazon is reconsidering, but they are definitely listening," the source said. "There have been several conversations ... they are definitely listening because it is coming from many different levels from heavy hitters."
The open letter to Bezos says: "New Yorkers do not want to give up on the 25,000 permanent jobs, 11,000 union construction and maintenance jobs, and $28 billion in new tax revenues that Amazon was prepared to bring to our state. A clear majority of New Yorkers support this project and were disappointed by your decision not to proceed."
The signees include several members of Congress, including Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens), multiple union leaders such as New York State AFL-CIO president Mario Cilento, business leaders including Kevin Law of the Long Island Association and developers such as Rob Speyer of Tishman

Texto completo: Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of America's leading biotechnology companies. Headquartered in Massachusetts, Thermo Fisher has become a premier provider of genetic testing equipment, courting controversy along the way as its equipment is used by police departments for dubious DNA collection procedures.

But a recent report by the New York Times has revealed that Thermo Fisher also provided the Chinese government with equipment that has allowed it to create a vast DNA surveillance program that specifically targets the Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group that is being oppressed in China.

The Chinese government believes the Uighurs are insubordinate to the ruling Communist Party and has sought to correct this through a series of alarming controls. Chief among these has been the detainment of up to 1 million Uighurs in re-education camps - or concentration camps, as most would call them - aimed at correcting undesirable political, social, and religious beliefs. Detainees are subjected to constant surveillance, forced to sing hymns praising the Chinese government, and write essays criticizing their ethnic background. They are frequently subjected to verbal and physical abuse.

Through the use of Thermo Fisher's equipment, the Chinese authorities have been able to identify Uighurs and round them up, collecting the DNA of millions of other Chinese citizens in the process.

Since the New York Times report, Thermo Fisher has announced it will stop selling genetic equipment to the Chinese government. As the world leader in serving science, read a statement from the company, we recognize the importance of considering how our products and services are used - or may be used - by our customers.

But Thermo Fisher only backed down when faced with intense public pressure. Previously, the company had lauded its gains in China, generating approximately $2.1 billion in revenue each year from that market.

There must be stronger mechanisms for blocking American companies from contributing to human rights abuses abroad. One would hope that morals alone would drive a company to such a decision, but clearly this is not the case.

Last year, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Chris Smith (R., N.J.) sent a letter to the Commerce Department asking for a prohibition on the sale of surveillance or tracking equipment to the Chinese authorities. The letter was largely ignored, but now might be the time to reconsider their request.

Texto completo: Seniors’ unprotected sex can endanger others
Robert Kraft and others who frequented the spa in Jupiter that enslaved female sex workers endanger themselves and their wives and partners. Unprotected sex by seniors who don't believe they should use protection can pass on sexually transmitted diseases to innocent partners.
NOW's Palm Beach County chapter presented a program in January about "Older Women: Sex and Health." Gloria Stein, a NOW board member, has taught safe sex precautions to people at retirement homes and assisted living facilities.
So-called "condo cowboys" who are indiscriminate and reckless in their sexual behaviors can cause disease and death in trusting partners, just as the men who frequented the spa in Jupiter pose a danger to others.

Send bill for reparations to states that seceded
Responding to the letter “Reparations for slavery should come from Democrats,” (Monday).
The writer seems to have forgotten that the red states (conservative) are the ones that committed treason and started the Civil War over the issue of slavery. It’s the losers who pay reparations, not the winners.
If he knew history, he’d know it was Germany that started and lost World War I and Germany that actually paid reparations, not any political party of Germany. Sure, the traitors from the red states should have been made to pay reparations after losing the Civil War. The problem then, as now, is that those states remain mostly takers, getting more from the federal government than they give. Also, it’s still difficult to get red-state conservatives to admit responsibility for their treasonous action in taking up arms against America. They prefer revisionist history and blame liberals, as in the letter.
Finally, Florida rushed to be the third state to secede and later to join the Jim Crow states.

Bereavement advice much appreciated
As a person trained in bereavement ministry, I was so pleased to read New York Times writer David Pogue's very well-written story, "What to say (and not to say) to someone who's grieving" (Feb. 19).
I have found that most people have the best of intentions responding to the loss of someone they knew. But their attempts at conveying helpful and consoling words often leave much to be desired — and sometimes can even be unintentionally hurtful.
Kudos to The Palm Beach Post for publishing this very helpful information. I hope many people will find it extremely useful during times when they are trying to offer consoling words to a friend or relative in grief.

Trump ordered top-secret security clearance for Kushner

Texto completo: President Trump ordered former chief of staff John Kelly to grant his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance last year, according to a new report.

Sources told the New York Times that Trump overruled intelligence and administration officials last May when they raised concerns about providing Kushner with a top-secret security clearance — an upgrade from the temporary and interim status he held earlier.

Trump’s decision prompted both Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn to write internal memos, the former documenting the alleged order and the latter highlighting his recommendation against the move and outlining the concerns regarding Kushner’s clearance status raised by the CIA.

The report directly contradicts statements from not only Trump himself, but also Kushner's wife — the president’s daughter — Ivanka Trump, and his lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell. All three have previously insisted that Kushner’s security clearance was obtained through regular procedures and that the president did not have undue influence on the process.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to address the report Thursday. “We don’t comment on security clearances,” she said.

The report comes the same week as Kushner met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the first time since the murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. The crown prince is still facing scrutiny over his alleged involvement in the death and dismemberment of the Washington Post columnist but has denied any involvement in the matter.

U.S. officials had raised questions about Kushner’s clearance because of his real estate business ties to foreign governments and investors — all of which were highlighted by an FBI background check, NBC reported. Trump has also faced scrutiny for granting two family members official positions in his administration.

Typically, a clearance is granted by the White House personnel security office after an FBI background check, with the White House counsel making the decision in any disputes. While Trump has legal authority to grant a security clearance, it is highly unusual.

In January, Trump said he “was never involved with the security” clearances for Kushner, according to the Times. “I know that there was issues back and forth about security for numerous people, actually. But I don’t want to get involved in that stuff,” Trump said.

Looming behind India-Pakistan tensions are two growing nuclear arsenals

Texto completo: Both countries see stockpiles as a means to keep the other in check
NEW DELHI - As hostilities escalate between India and Pakistan, the world is getting a taste of what a limited war between two nuclear-armed rivals might look like.
Both countries are aware of the risks. On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan explicitly referred to both countries' nuclear arsenals.
"From here, it is imperative that we use our heads and act with wisdom," Khan said. "I ask India: With the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we really afford such a miscalculation?"
Since 1998, when India and Pakistan conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests, both have worked to enlarge their arsenals - though their stockpiles remain smaller than those of countries such as France and China.
At the beginning of 2017, India had an estimated 130 nuclear warheads, up from 110 the previous year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
India has what is known as a full nuclear "triad" - the ability to deliver nuclear bombs from the ground, air and sea. Its ground-based ballistic missile, the Agni-III, has an approximate range of 2,000 miles. Its cruise missile - called BrahMos, developed jointly with Russia - can be launched from land, sea or air. Indian Air Force fighter jets have been modified to deliver nuclear bombs. India also has a 6,000-ton indigenously developed ballistic-missile submarine called the Arihant.
Although Pakistan is a much smaller country, it has a slightly larger arsenal - although it has less capacity than India to deliver such weapons. Pakistan had approximately 140 nuclear warheads in 2017, up from 120 to 130 a year earlier.
Unlike India, Pakistan's ballistic-missile range is only 1,200 miles, although there are powerful versions under development. It has no nuclear-equipped submarines.
However, Pakistan has more plutonium-production reactors than India and the capability to produce up to 20 nuclear warheads per year. The country's defense expenditure was more than 16 percent of national expenditures in 2017, far higher than India's 9 percent.
Experts say Pakistan's focus on developing short-range nuclear-capable missiles is part of a tactical mission to counter India's superior strength in ground-based armed forces.
At the height of U.S.-Iran nuclear deal negotiations in 2015, a New York Times editorial said the "biggest concern" was that Pakistan had the "world's fastest-growing nuclear arsenal."
Neither country is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, which seeks to prevent countries from developing nuclear weapons. The United States, China, Britain, France and Russia are the five declared nuclear-weapons states under the treaty - those that built and tested nuclear explosives before 1967.
Over the years, India has maintained a no-first-use nuclear policy, stating that the country will not be the first to initiate a nuclear strike and that its weapons would be used only for retaliation. But the recent expansion of its arsenal signals a possible shift in this doctrine.
Bharat Karnad, an Indian national security expert, has said India's doctrine could function differently in reality than on paper. In case of a contingency, weapons would be launched on "warning" - that is, on the detection of a signal from Pakistan, for instance - or "launched on launch," if the other side were to initiate a nuclear strike.
Pakistan's policy has emphasized "full-spectrum deterrence," which essentially means competing with India to "deter the kind of activities we have seen over the last few days," said Toby Dalton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
For security experts, the current clash between India and Pakistan is fascinating, if alarming. "This is like reality is playing out and testing deterrence theory," said C. Uday Bhaskar, director of the Society for Policy Studies and a security expert in New Delhi.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday about the "illicit acts" he says he helped Trump cover up.
In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes including campaign finance violations and lying to Congress about his work on a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.
Cohen, who once said he would "take a bullet" for Trump, made the guilty plea as part of a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.
Last year, Cohen told the House and Senate Intelligence committees that the Moscow Trump Tower development plan was scrapped in January 2016. But Cohen continued to update Trump on the project as late as June 2016, according to Thursday's court filing.
Here is a timeline of key moments in Cohen's relationship with Trump:
2007: Cohen joins Trump Organization
Cohen first came on Trump's radar after he bought a Trump World Tower apartment in 2001. He later acquired more Trump properties and helped Trump in a dispute with a condo board, prompting Trump to tell the New York Post in 2007 that "Michael Cohen has a great insight into the real-estate market. "
"In short, he’s a very smart person," Trump said.
Who is Michael Cohen?: Some see Trump's lawyer as overzealous bully. Team Trump sees an undying loyalist
2011: Trump's 'pit bull'
Cohen led the push for Trump to make a 2012 presidential run. By that time he had earned a reputation as Trump's personal "pit bull. "
"It means that if somebody does something Mr. Trump doesn't like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr. Trump's benefit," Cohen explained to ABC News. "If you do something wrong, I'm going to come at you, grab you by the neck and I'm not going to let you go until I'm finished. "
September 2015: Trump World Tower Moscow plans begin
Cohen met with Felix Sater and began working on plans for Trump World Tower Moscow, Buzzfeed News reported. Sater was a longtime Trump associate who was born in Russia and spent a year in prison for stabbing a man with a broken martini glass. Sater was suspected of money laundering and stock manipulation in 1998 but was given a pass because he was acting as a CIA informant.
October 2015: Trump signs letter of intent
Sater told Cohen on Oct. 12 that his associates would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the project and to get funding from VTB Bank, which was under U. S. government sanctions, Buzzfeed reported. The news site said Trump signed a letter of intent on the deal on Oct. 28.
November 2015: 'Our boy can become president of the USA'
Sater emailed Cohen on Nov. 3, telling him, "Buddy our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it," The New York Times reported. "I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process. "
January 2016: Cohen reaches out to Kremlin
Cohen emailed Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Jan. 16 to ask for help in getting the project approved, according to a court filing Thursday.
June 2016: Last known talk on the deal
Cohen met with Sater in the Trump Tower lobby, where Cohen said he would not be able to make a planned trip to Russia to work on the Trump Tower deal. According to Mueller's team, Cohen briefed Trump more than three times in 2016 on the status of the project, according to Mueller's team.
July 2016: Trump says he has no investments in Russia
"For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia," Trump tweets on July 26.
Nov. 6, 2016: Trump is elected president
Trump defeats Hillary Clinton in an upset. He beat his Democratic opponent with 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, although Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million ballots.
Aug. 28, 2017: Cohen gives statement to Congress
Cohen submitted a written statement to the House and Senate Intelligence committees, which said the effort "to build a Trump property in Moscow that was terminated in January of 2016; which occurred before the Iowa caucus and months before the very first primary. "
Jan. 12, 2018: Wall Street Journal reports on Stormy Daniels payment
The Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen arranged a $130,000 payment to porn star Stephanie Clifford – better known to the world as Stormy Daniels – ahead of the 2016 election in exchange for her silence about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump.
Feb. 13, 2018: Cohen says he paid Daniels himself
Cohen told The New York Times he paid Daniels with his own money and that Trump had nothing to do with it.
April 5, 2018: Trump denies knowing about Daniels payment
Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One that he didn't know about the payment to Daniels. "You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael," Trump said.
April 9, 2018: FBI seizes Cohen's files
FBI agents raided Cohen's office, home and hotel room, seizing more than 1. 3 million pieces of potential evidence.
May 2, 2018: Trump hires Giuliani
Trump hired former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani as his personal attorney.
June 15, 2018: Trump says Cohen 'not my lawyer anymore'
Trump confirmed that Cohen was "not my lawyer anymore. " He added that he "always liked Michael. And he's a good person. " Giuliani told Politico a month earlier that Cohen was no longer part of Trump's legal team.
July 2, 2018: Cohen willing to cooperate
During an interview with ABC News, Cohen did not dismiss the possibility of cooperating with Mueller's Russia investigation.
July 20, 2018: Cohen secretly recorded Trump
Media reports surfaced saying Cohen secretly recorded a least one conversation with Trump about giving hush money to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model. Three days later, court documents confirmed federal prosecutors obtained a dozen audio recordings in the files seized from Cohen in the FBI raids in April. On July 24, CNN obtained a copy of one of the recordings.
July 25, 2018: Trump responds to news of tapes
"What kind of a lawyer would tape a client?" Trump tweeted. "So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before?"
Aug. 21, 2018: Cohen pleads guilty to 8 charges
Cohen pleaded guilty to eight felonies, including fraud, tax evasion and an illegal campaign contribution. He said he paid off Daniels and McDougal to silence them before the 2016 election at Trump’s "direction" and admitted that the payments were illegal.
Aug. 22, 2018: Trump admits Daniels money came from him
Trump said in an interview with "Fox & Friends" that the money paid to Daniels and McDougal "came from me. " Trump said that since the money came from him and not the Trump campaign, the payments were not illegal. He also tweeted, "If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!"
Nov. 29, 2018: Cohen pleads guilty to lying to Congress
Cohen reached a plea deal with Mueller and pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to Congress. After the news of his guilty plea for lying about efforts to build Trump Tower Moscow, the president told reporters Cohen was a "weak person" who was "lying" to "get a reduced sentence. "
Dec. 7, 2018: Prosecutors recommend 'substantial prison term'
Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and Mueller's team submitted sentencing memos to U. S. District Court Judge William Pauley. The Southern district prosecutors said Cohen should get about 42 months, saying he “repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends. ” They also said Cohen paid Daniels "in coordination with and at the direction of" Trump.
Dec. 12, 2018: Cohen sentenced to 3 years
Pauley sentenced Cohen to a three-year sentence in federal prison for pleading "guilty to a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct. " At the hearing, Cohen said he took "full responsibility" for his acts and that "blind loyalty" drove him to cover up the president's "dirty deeds. "
Feb. 27, 2018: Cohen testifies in open hearing
In his opening statement as part of his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Cohen calls Trump a "con man," a "racist" and a "cheat. "
"Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all," reads the statement. "But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. "
Cohen also planned to present as evidence a $35,000 personal check from Trump, which he says was part of his reimbursement for the hush money he paid to Daniels.

U.S. disrupted Russian troll factory's internet during midterms

Texto completo: The U.S. military blocked internet access to a Russian entity seeking to sow discord among Americans during the 2018 midtermelections, several U.S. officials said, a warning that the group's operations against the U.S. are not cost-free.
The strike on the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, a company underwritten by an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, was part of the first offensive cyber campaign against Russia designed to thwart attempts to interfere with a U.S. election, the officials said.
"They basically took the IRA offline," according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. "They shut 'em down."
The operation marked the first muscle-flexing by U.S. Cyber Command, with intelligence from the National Security Agency, under new authorities it was granted by President Donald Trump and Congress last year to bolster offensive capabilities.
Russia's tactics are evolving, and some analysts were skeptical of the deterrent value on either the Russian troll factory or on Putin, who, according to U.S. officials, ordered an "influence" campaign in 2016 to undermine faith in U.S. democracy. Officials have also assessed that the Internet Research Agency works on behalf of the Kremlin.
Cyber Command and the NSA declined to comment.
Disruption to Internet Research Agency networks took place as Americans went to the polls and a day or so afterward, as the votes were tallied, to prevent the Russians from mounting a disinformation campaign casting doubt on results, according to officials.
The blockage was so frustrating to the trolls that they complained to their system administrators about the disruption, the officials said.
The Internet Research Agency, according to federal prosecutors, is financed by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a tycoon from St. Petersburg and an ally of Putin. Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency and a company Prigozhin runs called Concord Management and Consulting, were among 16 Russian individuals and companies that a grand jury indicted a year ago as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Another element of the Cyber Command campaign, first reported by the New York Times, involved "direct messaging" that targeted the trolls as well as hackers who work for the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. Using emails, pop-ups, text or direct messages, U.S. operatives beginning last October let the Russians know that their real names and online handles were known and they should not interfere in other nations' affairs, defense officials said.

Texto completo: "Roma" and Alfonso Cuarón won big at the Oscars on Sunday: Cuarón won best director and best cinematography, and the movie was the best foreign language film. If you remain curious about Mexican cinema, here are books that explore the industry's golden age and offer a deep dive into two directors' brains.
CABINET OF CURIOSITIES
My Notebooks, Collections and Other Obsessions
By Guillermo del Toro
256 pp. Harper Design. (2013)
Del Toro is one of the most popular Mexican directors of recent years, and in this book, he delivers an experience "akin to bouncing around inside his hallucinatory brain," John Williams wrote in The Times. There are dense illustrations from notebooks for "Hellboy" and "Pan's Labyrinth," as well as pictures of del Toro's Bleak House, where he works. The director said that his intention in releasing the book was to "open my process a little bit more" and inspire aspiring filmmakers to "embrace your passions wholeheartedly, obsessively, and enshrine images, collect them and study them as a code."
THE CLASSICAL MEXICAN CINEMA
The Poetics of the Exceptional Golden Age Films
By Charles Ramírez Berg
254 pp. University of Texas Press. (2015)
This book covers the golden age of Mexican cinema, which lasted from the mid-1930s to the late 1950s and included the work of directors like the surrealist Luis Buñuel (who was a Spaniard, but spent much of his adult life in Mexico) and Enrique Rosas, who made the classic silent film "El Automóvil Gris." Ramírez Berg explores the roots of the industry and explains how filmmakers of the time crafted a style that was distinctly Mexican.
OBJECTS OF DESIRE
Conversations With Luis Buñuel
By Jose de la Colina and Tomas Perez Turrent
Edited and translated by Paul Lenti
262 pp. Marsilio. (1993)
In the series of interviews between two Mexican critics and Buñuel transcribed in this book, the director discusses his artistic vision. "In discussing his 32 movies, Buñuel (1900-83) is charmingly temperamental in his refusal to be cornered by the exegeses of his interrogators," wrote our reviewer. In one of the conversations, Buñuel says, "For me, Surrealism was not an aesthetic, just another avant-garde movement; it was something to which I committed myself in a spiritual and oral way."

'Sacrilegious': Vandals break into Dublin crypt, steal head of 800-year old mummy

Resumen: A guide at St. Michan’s Church found the crypt badly damaged on Monday while getting the site ready for visitors, the Church of Ireland said.

Texto completo: Vandals have stolen the head of an 800-year-old mummy from a historic church in Dublin.
Besides the mummy nicknamed "The Crusader," the church said vandals desecrated several other mummies, including the 400-year-old remains of a nun. The vandals decapitated "The Crusader" and turned his body over.
“I am shocked that someone would target this ancient burial place and desecrate the remains of those lying within it," the Archbishop of Dublin said in a statement. "Not only have these individuals desecrated the sacred crypt but they have destroyed these historic mummies which have been preserved in St Michan’s for hundreds of years. "

Five burial vaults rest beneath the church founded in 1095, according to Dublin's tourism information website. Some of the mummified remains of prominent families date back to 1600.
Dublin's Archdeacon David Pierpoint said the church is upset at the damage and frustrated as the crypt needs to close. About 27,000 people visited the church last year, Ireland's National Public Service Broadcaster reported.
This isn't the first time St. Michan’s has been targeted by "sacrilegious" behavior, Pierpoint said. The crypt was previously vandalized in 1996, when three teenagers dragged mummies into the churchyard and played football with a head, the New York Times reported.
Irish police are investigating the newest incident. Some fear that the head will disintegrate in air with normal moisture levels, the Times reported, as the crypt's limestone and soil helped preserve the body.
While the motive is unclear, Pierpoint told the Times that the thieves “came prepared, with crowbars and tools,” to move solid iron and steel slabs. Church authorities do not believe the relics are in demand on any market, the Times reported.

Michael Gerson: Community 'weavers' create stronger social fabric

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Eventually, someone who writes on public policy comes up against the limits of words. There are only so many times you can urge, condemn, cajole, wheedle, praise, remind, prod, propose and coax before your vocabulary and patience both give out. This is not to say that public argumentation makes no difference. But for a columnist, that influence consists mainly of throwing 750 words over a high wall and hoping they land with a pleasing thud on some doer or decider.
Having mastered the arts of opinion writing, cultural criticism and human decency, David Brooks of The New York Times is now undertaking a project at the Aspen Institute called "Weave", designed to recognize and help people directly involved in social repair. In the work of lighting candles to push back the darkness, Brooks wants to be a lamplighter.
The metaphor Brooks prefers is textile production. Many people are involved in the unholy work of ripping and shredding our social fabric — through dehumanizing language, racial prejudice and other evidence of tribalism. The groups Brooks highlights are the weavers, laying down the warp and weft of communities. They promote community dialogue and deal with various categories of need from youth development to suicide prevention. But they share the goal of strengthening human ties, trust and reciprocity as alternatives to isolation, loneliness and despair.
I've been familiar with, and occasionally involved in, efforts to praise and encourage the work of community and religious groups providing compassionate social services. I've been involved in efforts to promote volunteer service as a method of social mixing and an alternative to the general selfishness of our culture. Brooks' effort involves a more ambitious framing, designed to be the intellectual scaffold (to employ another metaphor) on which a movement is built.
In his manifesto, Brooks argues for what he calls "relationalism" as opposed to the "hyper-individualism" of a society based on the maximization of choice and self-actualization. A critic might respond that liberal individualism has done a pretty good job as the basis for democracy, capitalism and pain-free dentistry. But Brooks is diagnosing an excess of individualism leading to "social isolation, distrust, polarization, the breakdown of family, the loss of community, tribalism, rising suicide rates, rising mental health problems, (and) a spiritual crisis caused by a loss of common purpose."
In Brooks' relationalism, the answer is not found in a political ideology, but in an alternative way of being human. In this view, success is not measured by the goods we accumulate but in the number and quality of the relationships we form. Such relationships tend to push our attention outward, toward the welfare of others. "The central journey of modern life," Brooks argues, "is moving self to service." And a rich relational life delivers a deeper, more satisfying form of happiness than consumerism. We are actually liberated by the deep commitments we make in life.
Relationalism had clear (and acknowledged) debts to the Catholic idea of the common good, to Martin Luther King Jr.'s conception of "the beloved community," to Alexis de Tocqueville's celebration of American volunteerism and to Edmund Burke's preference for the small and natural over the large and ideological. Some political conservatives may object to Brooks' critique of modern capitalism as potentially soul-destroying. Some liberals may object to his focus on incrementalism and the human scale rather than on structural injustice.
None of this makes much difference to the extraordinary weavers across the country Brooks has chosen to highlight. They are following an entirely different prompting — a love that leads beyond egotism and into the lives of others.
Brooks' message is likely to resonate precisely because it is not political. The atomizing tendency of American life does deepen and complicate problems such as drug addiction and suicide, in which isolation can contribute to a downward spiral of self-destructive behavior. But many Americans can identify with the broader challenge of loneliness, which seems to be the flip side of autonomy.
Brooks is making the case that there is already a movement of human connection in this country, among people who don't yet recognize themselves as part of one. He has served this movement by giving it a compelling, nonsectarian, nonpartisan frame, allowing diverse groups to consider themselves part of each other. In this case, the frame serves the picture well.

Texto completo: To watch Rep. Duncan Hunter on TV is to see a diligent, baritone-voiced congressman championing conservative causes and defending soldiers accused of war crimes. But on Capitol Hill, Hunter, R-Alpine, is hamstrung, stripped of committee assignments that are vital to a lawmaker’s influence and effectiveness.
Then-House Speaker Paul Ryan forced Hunter to resign from the Armed Services, Education and the Workforce, and Transportation and Infrastructure committees last August, following a 60-count federal indictment accusing Hunter and wife, Margaret, of illegally spending $250,000 in campaign funds on groceries, an Italian vacation and airfare for the family’s pet rabbit, among other personal expenses and filing false records.
The Hunters, who pleaded not guilty – Duncan Hunter denounced the charges as politically motivated – are scheduled for trial in September. Until then, Duncan Hunter, 42, whose district includes most of Temecula, is doing what he can to stay – or at least appear – relevant. “Politically, Hunter is radioactive,” said Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. “The charges against him involve sleazy corruption, not some great matter of national policy. So his influence on other lawmakers is pretty limited.
“The staff can take care of constituent services, but they typically do not (need) much involvement by the member. Yes, members can sit on the floor and cast votes, but it would be extremely rare for a single vote to decide a major measure.”
Lacking committees is “a pretty big deal,” said Robert Boatright, a political science professor at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. “Legislators without committee assignments are limited in their ability to procure benefits for their districts, and they don’t really have that much to do during the days they spend in Washington.”
“With that said, Republicans are now in the minority, so all Republicans are facing a reduction in their ability to deliver benefits for their constituents. So this is less harmful than it would have been had Republicans remained in the majority.”
It’s unclear whether Hunter’s constituents will notice or care about his lack of committee assignments. “I have noticed no difference either way,” said Temecula Mayor Mike Naggar.
Hunter declined interview requests. His spokesman, Michael Harrison, said the 10-year congressman “will continue working hard on the issues he believes are most important to both his constituents and the country as a whole.”
While being committee-less “is not ideal, it by no means is keeping Congressman Hunter from doing the work he was elected to do,” Harrison added.
Hunter represents California’s 50th Congressional District, a ruby red enclave in a deep-blue state where registered Republican voters outnumber registered Democrats by 13 percentage points.
Hunter, whose father, Duncan Hunter Sr., represented the district for almost 30 years, traditionally cruises to re-election, winning with 63 percent of the vote in 2016 and 71 percent in 2014.
He got just 52 percent of the vote last November in beating Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who out-raised Hunter and plans to run for the seat in 2020. Hunter campaign ads tying Campa-Najjar, a Christian and native Southern Californian of Palestinian and Mexican heritage, to terrorism spurred accusations of racism and fear-mongering.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put Hunter on its 2020 target list. Besides Campa-Najjar, Democrat Alex Balkin and Republicans Matt Rahn, Bill Wells and Larry Wilske have filed to run for Hunter’s seat in 2020.
Hunter isn’t the only committee-less congressman. Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, who was charged with insider trading, has no assignments, and Iowa Republican Steve King, lost his committee seats after telling The New York Times “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?”
“I suppose they can form a ‘pariah caucus,’” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, told POLITICO.
Hunter stood out before his legal woes. Named Washington’s top “Party Animal” by Washingtonian magazine in 2014, Hunter made headlines for vaping during a congressional hearing, and he was one of the first congressmen to endorse then-candidate Donald Trump.
100-day plan
Hunter is still allowed to join legislative caucuses. A list of caucus memberships on his House website includes the Congressional Wine Caucus, Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus, Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, and the House Border Security Caucus.
After being sworn in last month, Hunter announced a “First 100-Day Initiative,” which he described in a February constituent newsletter as a series of bills “to implement common-sense reforms that will benefit the lives of everyday Americans.”
They include the AMERICA Act to protect census respondents’ data, the BRAVE Act to raise the burial allowance for veteran families and the No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act, which would deny federal funds to colleges and universities that don’t cooperate with federal efforts to enforce immigration law.
The odds are against Hunter’s bills passing the Democrat-controlled House.
A Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, Hunter has come to the aid of Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of murdering an Islamic State prisoner of war, as well as Army Maj. Matt Golsteyn, a Green Beret charged with premeditated murder in the death of a suspected Taliban bomb maker.
Gallagher was charged “based on inconsistent testimony and without any physical evidence,” Hunter wrote in his February newsletter. The congressman has asked the president to review Gallagher’s case.
Regarding Golsteyn, “what I think we have here is a case of what the U.S. government would call compassionate combat,” Hunter told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday, Feb. 13.
Under George W. Bush and Barack Obama “(the government) wanted us to kill the bad guys, but in the right way, meaning they want us to kill guys compassionately and only under the rules of engagement that they say to you,” Hunter said.
Otherwise, “the U.S. government then is going to try you for murder and put you in jail, even if you’re a decorated Green Beret (or) if you’re a Navy SEAL.”
This year, Hunter has spoken to Fox News other conservative media about border security, his legislation, Gallagher and Golsteyn, the federal government shutdown and his reaction to Trump’s State of the Union Address.
He shares clips of those appearances on social media. None of the interviews posted to his Twitter account in February mention the indictment, although in a Fox News interview shortly after he was charged, Hunter said his wife handled his finances and “was also the campaign manager so whatever she did, that’ll be looked at too, I’m sure, but I didn’t do it.”
‘Can’t do it’
It’s unclear what would happen if Hunter pleads guilty or is convicted, although he likely would face pressure to resign.
Hunter could serve from behind bars, although he couldn’t vote and the House could move to expel him, said Thad Kousser, a UC San Diego political science professor. If Hunter left office before November 2020, a special election would be held to fill his seat.
Without committees, Boatright said Hunter could try to boost his influence in caucuses and informal working groups.
“Otherwise, start thinking through job options for what to do after Congress!” he said. “Or spend more time in the district (and) treat the lack of committee assignments like a sort of sabbatical.”
Hunter’s staff “will put out material making it seem as if he is doing a lot, even though he is not,” Pitney said.
“Trying to be an effective House member without serving on a committee is like trying to play in the Super Bowl without leaving the locker room. You can’t do it.”

Texto completo: Stanley Donen
LOS ANGELES - Filmmaker Stanley Donen, a giant of the Hollywood musical who through such classics as "Singin' in the Rain" and "Funny Face" helped give us some of the most joyous sounds and images in movie history, has died. He was 94.
Donen, who often teamed with Gene Kelly but also worked with Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra and Fred Astaire, died Thursday in New York from heart failure, his sons Joshua and Mark Donen confirmed Saturday.
The 1940s and '50s were the prime era for Hollywood musicals and no filmmaker contributed more to the magic than Donen, among the last survivors from that era and one willing to extend the limits of song and dance into the surreal. He was part of the unit behind such unforgettable scenes as Kelly dancing with an animated Jerry the mouse in "Anchors Aweigh," Astaire's gravity-defying spin across the ceiling in "Royal Wedding," and, the all-time triumph, Kelly ecstatically splashing about as he performs the title number in "Singin' in the Rain."
Steven Spielberg recalled Donen as a "friend" for whom life and film were inseparable.
"His generosity in giving over so many of his weekends in the late 1960s to film students like me to learn about telling stories and placing lenses and directing actors is a time I will never forget," Spielberg said on Saturday.
The filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said, "Before Stanley Donen actors sang, actors danced. He made the camera dance and the colors sing."
A 2007 American Film Institute survey of the top 100 American movies ranked "Singin' in the Rain," with its inventive take on Hollywood's transition from silent to talking pictures in the 1920s and Kelly's famous dance in a downpour, at No. 5.
Donen was asked in 2002 whether the filmmakers knew that "Singin' in the Rain," released in 1952 and also starring Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, would be revered decades later.
"You can't get through a movie if you don't think it's good," he told The Associated Press. "Certainly we thought it was good. More than that? I don't know. You don't think about that. You just think about how you can do it."
Both the film and Donen were at first underrated. "Singin' in the Rain" was initially seen as high entertainment rather than art and was not even nominated for a best picture or directing Academy Award. Donen, overshadowed by Kelly early in his career, never received a competitive Oscar nomination and waited until 1998 for an honorary award, presented to him by Martin Scorsese. He was more than ready. Donen danced cheek-to-cheek with his Oscar statuette, which he called "this cute little fella." The crowd yelled and applauded as he crooned, "Heaven, I'm in heaven," from Irving Berlin's "Cheek to Cheek."
During his acceptance speech, he explained his formula for a great musical. Bring in songwriters like Adolph Green and Betty Comden, and performers like Kelly or Astaire or Sinatra. "And when filming starts," he added, "you show up and you stay the hell out of the way."
Born in Columbia, South Carolina, Donen would remember movies - especially those with Astaire and Ginger Rogers- as a needed escape from the tensions of being one of the few Jews in his community. He took tap dancing lessons in his teens and began his show business career as a performer, dancing in the original Broadway production of "Pal Joey" at age 16. The title role was played by Kelly, and the show's success propelled Kelly into the movies.
Donen received his first Hollywood break when Kelly got him a job helping choreograph the 1944 Kelly film "Cover Girl." Over the next few years, he worked on choreography for such films as "The Kissing Bandit," starring Sinatra, and "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," starring Sinatra and Kelly, who teamed with Donen on choreography.
"Singin' in the Rain" was one of three films credited to Kelly and Donen as co-directors; the others were "On the Town," the 1949 Kelly-Sinatra musical about sailors on leave in New York City, and the darker "It's Always Fair Weather," in which three soldier friends reunite a decade later.
The co-director credits - rare in films - came out of a tense relationship between Donen and the star, who had played such an important role in advancing Donen's career. Donen would later speak resentfully of Kelly, who died in 1996, as being cold and condescending and not fully appreciative of his contributions. They parted for good after "It's Always Fair Weather," which came out in 1955.
"He could be difficult with me and everyone else," the director told The New York Times in 1996. "It was always a complicated collaboration."
Other Donen films included "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" (1954), with its superlative athletic choreography; "Damn Yankees" (1958), the remake of the Broadway smash about a baseball fan's temptation; and "Funny Face," in which Astaire teamed up with Audrey Hepburn to play a fashion photographer and his unlikely muse.
Astaire's character in "Funny Face" was modeled on Richard Avedon, and the famed photographer served as a consultant to Donen.
"Nothing is more fun than finding someone who stimulates you, and who can be stimulated by you," Donen said in John Kobal's book "Gotta Sing Gotta Dance: A Pictorial History of Film Musicals." The result, rather than just adding up to two and two, multiplies itself, and you find yourself doing much better things - you are both carried away on the crest of excitement."
Donen worked in various genres. "Indiscreet" (1958) was a light farce starring Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and "Two for the Road" (1967), with Hepburn and Albert Finney, was an unusually acerbic and tense marital comedy for its time, far removed from the carefree spirit of his musicals. (Donen himself was married five times and had an embroidered pillow in his New York apartment reading "EAT DRINK AND RE-MARRY".)
One Donen film, the chic mystery "Charade" (1963), reminded viewers of a Hitchcock thriller. "Charade" starred Hepburn as a precocious socialite whose husband has been murdered, and Grant - who appeared in four Hitchcock films - as a mysterious man who may or may not be helping her.
Donen steadfastly denied any Hitchcock influence, while adding that the master of suspense "doesn't own the genre."
Donen had three sons; the oldest, Peter, died in 2003 of a heart attack at age 50. His first wife, dancer Jeanne Coyne, later married Kelly. His fourth wife was the screen star Yvette Mimieux. Over the past two decades, his companion was the filmmaker-comedian Elaine May.
None of his more recent films approached the heights of his most famous work. The nadir may have been 1984's "Blame It on Rio," a comedy about a man (Michael Caine) who has an affair with his friend's young daughter. Roger Ebert slammed the film as "clearly intended to appeal to the prurient interests of dirty old men of all ages."
Other credits include a musical segment for the 1980s TV comedy "Moonlighting" and a stage production of "The Red Shoes." In 1999, he directed the ABC television movie "Love Letters," which starred Steven Weber and Laura Linney.
"There are limits to TV," Donen told The Associated Press in 1999. "And that's what was fun: to try to find a way to be surprising within limits. I'm always looking for limits, because then you have to be inventive."

The World’s Largest Bee Is Not Extinct

Texto completo: It has been 38 years since scientists last spotted the insect known as Wallace’s giant bee, a rare species found only in a group of Indonesian islands called the North Moluccas. With a wingspan of 2.5 inches and a body the size of a human thumb, it’s considered the world’s largest bee, and was feared extinct.
Those fears can now be somewhat laid to rest. In January, an international team of conservationists found a Megachile pluto, as the species is called, in the wild. The team captured the first-ever photos and videos of a live specimen, renewing hope for survival of the species, which is threatened by deforestation.
“It’s just ridiculously large and so exciting,” said Simon Robson, a biologist at the University of Sydney in Australia and a member of the expedition.
The discovery did not come easily. Despite the bee’s size, its rarity, remote location and nesting habits make it difficult to find.
“I personally know of at least five attempts to find the bee,” said Clay Bolt, a photographer who was part of the latest expedition.
The bees make their homes by digging holes in the nests of tree-dwelling termites, where they spend much of their time hiding.
“It was a lot of walking around the forest in 90-degree heat and the highest possible humidity looking at termite nests and chasing after bees,” Robson said. In all, it took five days of hunting for the team to find their “holy grail.”
Wallace’s giant bee is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, an English entomologist who worked with Charles Darwin to formulate the theory of evolution through natural selection. Wallace first discovered the bee on an expedition in 1859, describing the female as “a large black wasp-like insect with immense jaws like a stag beetle.” (The males are less than an inch long.)
Though Wallace didn’t seem particularly interested in the bee - he devoted only a single line to it in his journal - it became something of an obsession among biologists. The next sighting didn’t come until 1981, when Adam Messer, an entomologist, observed several in the wild and returned home with a handful of specimens that are now held in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Natural History Museum in London and other institutions.
Messer observed that the bees use their unusually large mandibles to scrape together balls of tree resin and wood to fortify their nests, and that they are relatively solitary.
Robson believes they are capable of stinging, though he wasn’t in a position to provide evidence. “We were all keen to get stung to see how bad it was,” he said, “but because we only found the one, we treated it very carefully.”
The expedition was partly funded by Global Wildlife Conservation, a Texas nonprofit that in 2017 started a global search for 25 “lost” species - animals that are not necessarily extinct but haven’t been spotted in at least a decade. In addition to Wallace’s giant bee, the list includes the pink-headed duck, the Fernandina Galapagos tortoise and the Namdapha flying squirrel.
Conservationists are concerned that deforestation threatens the survival of the bee giants. The region of Indonesia where the bees are found lost 7 percent of its tree cover between 2001 and 2017, according to Global Forest Watch.
Excited as they were to find the bee, Robson and his team worry that the sighting may be a mixed blessing. Last year, an anonymous seller sold a previously unaccounted-for specimen to an unknown bidder on eBay for $9,100. “If you can get that much money for an insect, that encourages people to go and find them,” Robson said. To help protect the bees, the team has agreed not to disclose the exact island where they made their discovery.
The plan now is for the team to return to the island and conduct more extensive research.

Texto completo: Imagine that a bunch of children are sitting around a table when a seemingly beneficent adult walks into the room carrying a plate of cupcakes. The kids burst out in excitement - until they notice a problem: There are fewer cupcakes than children.
At this point, the adult announces some ground rules. To receive a cupcake, the children will have to compete with one another. The adult will accept cash or other objects of value. Praise for the adult's kindness would also be welcome.
The kids immediately start saying nice things and digging into their pockets. But then one child has second thoughts. She quiets the room and tells the adult he's being a bully. He is bigger, stronger and richer than the kids, she says. He shouldn't make them grovel for cupcakes. The adult replies: "Fine. No cupcake for you."
If she were your child, how would you feel: proud that she took a stand, or disappointed that she didn't act in her own best interests? Cupcakes, after all, are pretty tasty.
New York recently became that disobedient child. The city damaged its own interests, or at least its short-term interests, for the sake of principle. Enough New Yorkers raised enough of a ruckus about the nearly $3 billion in tax breaks that the city and state were bestowing on Amazon that Amazon finally had enough. On Feb. 14, it announced that it would no longer be bringing 25,000 jobs to Queens. No cupcake for New York.
Yes, I know: Jobs are not cupcakes. Jobs help people build middle-class lives, which are in too short supply these days. So pretend that the adult in my story offered a Kindle instead of a cupcake. Or a college scholarship. It shouldn't change your view of the girl's rebellion.
Regardless, it's a version of what social scientists call "the tragedy of the commons" - in which people hurt their long-term interests by acting in their short-term interests. The only solution to the tragedy of the commons is to change the rules.
For years, companies have been getting the better of local governments - and taxpayers - by pitting them against one another. If a city or state won't pony up cash or tax breaks, companies threaten to go elsewhere. Boeing, Nike, Intel, Ford, General Motors, Foxconn, Royal Dutch Shell and many others have all done it. Since 1990, the combined size of these handouts has surged.
In the moment, the deals are often popular. Polls showed that most New Yorkers favored Amazon's plans for Queens. The editorial boards of both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal criticized the politicians whose complaints scuttled the deal. The front page of The Daily News thundered, "AMAZON KILLERS: Shame on these so-called progressives for rejecting 25,000 high-paying jobs & billions in taxes tech biz would've brought to city."
The deal's supporters do make some good points. Amazon's critics have used silly anti-capitalist rhetoric at times. And the deal would have modestly helped the Queens economy (and only modestly: New York is home to more than 4 million jobs, and Queens to more than 1 million). But there is a larger picture here: Corporate-relocation subsidies are terrible policy.
They do nothing to lift the country's economic growth - to create more cupcakes, as it were. The subsidies mostly redistribute income upward, from taxpayers to corporate shareholders. If every city and state justifies big giveaways based on its own immediate interests, the tragedy of the commons will never end.
Somebody needs to make a principled stand. In New York, a coalition of activists and politicians did so. They called attention to the grubbiness and secrecy of these subsidies, which are, in their own way, anti-capitalist. The deal's collapse, Greg LeRoy, a longtime advocate on the issue, told Emily Badger of The Times, is "absolutely a godsend to those of us who have been trying to reform economic development."
For decades, local politicians have felt pressure on only one side of this issue: To do whatever it takes to attract companies. As a result, those politicians have contributed, often unwittingly, to the radical rise in economic inequality.
Amazon's messy departure from New York is a victory for the other side. It should remind politicians elsewhere that their private blandishments may later turn into public controversy. It should also remind politicians that they can say no. Northern Virginia gave Amazon much less money than New York but still won tens of thousands of new jobs.
And the whole episode should energize legal efforts to fight corporate handouts. Missouri and Kansas, for example, are talking about a "cease-fire" to keep local companies from playing the two states off each other. Officials in Arizona, Illinois, New York and several other states have talked about a multistate compact known as the End Corporate Welfare Act. The federal government, for its part, could offer financial incentives to states that refuse to play the handout game.
Yes, New York's economy will be slightly worse off because of Amazon's departure. But the city deserves our gratitude. Refusing to play an unfair game is sometimes better than winning it.

Texto completo: There's a hot new consumer finance survey to help us all put our behaviors into perspective.
ValuePenguin. com, which provides advice on people's financial decisions, hired a top marketing research firm, OnePoll, to run a big, broad survey on consumer financial behavior.
Fact: Retirement saving is simple, like losing weight. Sadly, as with shedding pounds, most people just won’t do it. The cheesecake equivalents look too tempting.
Investing is slightly more complicated, like appropriate exercises that won’t injure you. But with investing, smarts or cleverness aren’t as key as wisdom — which is why brilliant 20-somethings on Wall Street screw up every decade and always have. They can’t prioritize wisdom over IQ.
Self-analysis is often off the mark. Otherwise, most folks' finances would work perfectly since they would fix what wasn't working for them. I can’t tell you how to see yourself correctly. But I can tell you how others see themselves. Then you can ponder how different you are, or aren’t.
So, where do you fit in? The new survey, called “Financial Fails ” tells the tale. For example, 20 percent of us openly admit to spending more than we earn every month. Cheesecaked! Less than one-third of us put money monthly into retirement accounts. Worse, amazingly, 12 percent of us shop online drunk. Hooched! You can’t make this stuff up.
Gauging the stock market: Are stocks a good value? A beginner's guide to finding out
HSAs: HSAs are a triple tax break that can help fast track retirement savings
Seventy percent claim to know what we make and spend — implying 30 percent don’t. Then, 25 percent don’t have a savings account, 28 percent haven’t a basic investment account, and almost 80 percent of workers don’t have a 401(k).
All this you can fix yourself. It’s simple self-discipline. I’ve written lots here on 401(k)s. In this super strong economy for employment, stronger than any in decades, if your firm doesn’t have a 401(k), you should job hop elsewhere for one, while the hopping is good.
So how do you compare to others when it comes to financial behavior?. Yes, there are exceptional entrepreneurs who create super wealth. But if that’s not you, you need to build the foundation for a sturdy retirement.
Seventy-eight percent of us worry often or sometimes about our financial situation. Generally, worrying accomplishes nothing. Part of it comes from a lack of knowledge. Here things get wacky. Categorically, younger people think they understand investing. As we age, our confidence in fathoming investing shrinks. That’s gaining wisdom! Behavioral scientists have long demonstrated humans tend toward overconfidence and that overconfidence wrecks investing.
Not only do 80 percent of people 25 to 34 years old think they understand investing — 80 percent of people 18 to 24 do, too. That is simply scary because as Bill Baldwin, my former editor at Forbes magazine, always said, “Most investment mistakes are self-inflicted. ”
In total, 30 percent of us don’t think we know how to invest. It isn’t surprising then that 29 percent of us have a financial adviser and 71 percent of us don’t. But unless you’re in the top several percent of us in wealth you probably don’t need an adviser. Over the course of any year, there is more than enough right here in USA TODAY's Money section to educate you on building the basics you need — and how to invest it all without being overly complicated.
After that it’s up to you; just like diet and exercise.

Honest dialogue needed about health care for all

Texto completo: It's been nearly 10 years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act — one of the most sweeping health care overhauls in the nation's history. The law has brought the number of uninsured people in America to an all-time low, secured protections for people with pre-existing conditions and advanced the notion that health care is a human right.
But the system was never perfect, and its fractures and stress points have become too great to ignore. The number of people who are uninsured or underinsured is rising again after two years of sabotage to the current law by the Trump administration. A Republican-led lawsuit that once seemed like a lark is threatening Obamacare's protections for pre-existing conditions. And high out-of-pocket costs, absurd hospital billing practices and ever-rising prescription drug prices have forced too many people to skip crucial treatments, avoid emergency rooms and ration life-sustaining medications.
America may be a country rich in medical innovation — a place where robots perform surgery — but it's also one where tens of thousands of people die every year because they can't afford basic care.
Both parties seem certain to make health care a significant election issue over the next two years. There are no fewer than six Democratic bills floating through Congress that would address these problems. And "Medicare for all" — a concept that describes only some of those proposals — has become both a rallying cry and a test of progressive credentials.
Most other countries use negotiating power to control health care costs; that's why prescription drugs cost so much less elsewhere than they do in the United States. But those countries accept a trade-off, inherent in this approach, that the United States has so far resisted: They forgo access to certain innovations, like pricey new drugs and medical devices whose benefits are found to be minimal.
The fight to once again remake American health care will almost certainly be brutal. Before voters can decide if they want to have that fight, candidates will need to clarify what they are selling. Only then can the nation have an honest dialogue about the risks, benefits and trade-offs ahead.

Trump and Bernie have this in common

Texto completo: Let us ponder the mysteries of socialism and obstruction of justice.
Oh yes, I can hear your groans of protest. No! I'd rather go to the dentist or have a colonoscopy.
But this will only take a minute and is as necessary to our political well-being as nasty medical procedures are to health.
Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent and longtime member of the Senate known for ambitiously running for president but very little else, has just declared that he is, no surprise, running for president. He says he is a socialist and the Democratic Party is becoming as "socialist" as he is, only most call it "progressivism."
Actually, most Americans do not like "isms," except for capitalism. Even Elizabeth "big-banks-corrupt-absolutely" Warren, the Massachusetts senator also running for president, says she is a dyed-in-the-wool capitalist. California Democrat Kamala Harris, also running, disdainfully says she is not a socialist.
Sanders immediately got $6 million from thrilled Bernie backers, making him a "front-runner." The man he would evict, Donald Trump, laughed and twittered and clapped his hands in delight.
To many Americans, socialism means overthrowing capitalism and embracing communism. It means groupthink, doing away with private ownership and absolute rule by the Marxist state.
But to Bernie and his followers, the tenets of "American socialism" are far more acceptable. Affordable health care and insurance for all, now dubbed Medicare for All. Free college tuition or at least affordable higher education. A trillion-dollar infrastructure commitment to create jobs and fix broken bridges, roads, ports, rail, airports, dams, etc. A Green New Deal to wean Americans off carbon and combat climate change. A $15-an-hour minimum wage. Higher estate taxes for the rich. A repudiation of globalism and traditional trade deals.
The problem Bernie has is that he hasn't a clue how to pay for any of these mostly laudable goals or how to get any of it done.
Trump says he likes Bernie, who applauded the tearing up of trade deals, which is causing havoc for farmers, small manufacturers and American exporters. And are costing consumers a lot of money. But if Trump could all but eviscerate Warren by disparaging her as "Pocahontas" for trying to prove she has a small amount of Native American blood (as millions do), think how Trump will trash a "socialist" if Sanders' campaign has staying power.
Which brings us to Trump and obstruction of justice.
Thanks in large measure to The New York Times, we have dozens of examples of how Trump has attempted to obstruct justice by thwarting the investigation into Russia's efforts to spread disinformation and elect Trump in 2016.
Trump has now condemned, ridiculed or dismissed the integrity of probes into Russia's meddling by U.S. intelligence and national law enforcement agencies about 1,200 times. No wonder millions of people have lost faith in their institutions.
Just as importantly, Trump has tried to subvert investigations of him and his business, such as the payoffs to women with whom he allegedly had sex.
If this were 1974, and Congress had statesmen and women who cared more about country than party, Trump would be undergoing impeachment proceedings. Trump has made Richard Nixon look like an amateur subverter of the rule of law. Trump has profited from the presidency by millions of dollars. Trump has impeded investigations and fired officials for doing their jobs. To the self-absorbed Trump, everything is about him. And he intends to be reelected.
Millions of people are waiting for special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian conspiracies, which probably won't tell us much more than we already know. If and when the report leaks, Trump's absurdly loyal base won't care what it says anyway.
Sadly, we already have dozens and dozens of examples that prove Trump is a bad president, wrong for these times and, indeed, wrong for any time. We know what abuse of power looks like. We know what incompetence looks like. We know what obstruction of justice looks like. We know what misogyny looks like. It looks like Trump.
And we know what socialism looks like. It doesn't look like Bernie Sanders, who has been accused of harassment of women, incompetence, being a blow-hard, being unable to move beyond his base, name-calling and who is doing his best to make his party unelectable.
Two politicians, one on the right and one on the left, cut, oddly, from the same cloth. Two men who like to blow up the establishment. Two men with giant egos. Neither plays well with others.

Texto completo: The Oscars air on ABC. And for those without cable, three other movies our chief critics liked in 2018 but weren't nominated are streaming.
What's on TV
THE 91ST ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. Will Netflix win an Oscar for best picture, further legitimizing streaming services as a viable outlet for A-list filmmakers? Will Glenn Close pick up her first statuette? And just how many speeches will Alfonso Cuarón end up giving? These are some of the questions wafting through the Hollywood air in the lead-up to the Academy Awards, which will go on, hostless, steeped in controversies and ready to prove (or disprove) your predictions. Look out for Jennifer Hudson singing a song from "Mary Poppins Returns," plus duets from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings; a showdown in the wide-open best supporting actress category; and the potential glory of an acceptance speech from Spike Lee, who, for the first time in his career, has a shot at the award for best director.
What's Streaming
THE RIDER (2018) Steam on Starz; Rent on Vudu. The second feature by the Chinese director Chloé Zhao blends fact and fiction to tell the story of a South Dakota rodeo champion played by Brady Jandreau, a nonprofessional actor whose character, Brady, is a fictionalized version of himself. After a head injury, Brady is warned by a doctor not to do any more riding -- a prescription that leads him to a crisis of identity and woe. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that Zhao has "a bold, exacting vision that makes 'The Rider' exceptional among recent American regional-realist films."
ZAMA (2018) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. A tale of colonialism, loneliness and an absurd llama, this 18th-century-set movie from the Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel stars Daniel Giménez Cacho as an official of the Spanish empire all but stranded in the New World. Based on the 1956 novel by Antonio di Benedetto, it follows Don Diego de Zama, a loyal bureaucrat whose requests for a transfer away from the remote colony where he's stationed become increasingly more desperate. Manohla Dargis called the movie a "cinematic marvel" in her review for The Times. She wrote that Giménez Cacho gives "an expressive yet reserved performance that pulls you in intellectually rather than emotionally."
BURNING (2018) Rent on Amazon, Google Play and YouTube. A roughly 10-page short story by Haruki Murakami extends into an 148-minute slow-burn here, by way of the South Korean director Lee Chang-dong. It's a boy-meets-girl kind of story (with Ah-in Yoo and Jong-seo Jun), one that dives headfirst into sexual pining, issues of class and jealousy. American audiences will recognize Steven Yeun (of "The Walking Dead" and last year's "Sorry to Bother You") as the third major character: a rich, unnervingly mysterious young man.

Texto completo: It’s soup weather for all, but especially for yours truly, who is trying to shake his “touch of pneumonia,” in the doctor’s phrase.
Soup has become a frequent meal, whether it’s out of a can or bag or served in a restaurant. In the past three weeks I’ve had chicken and wild rice, chicken and vegetables, tomato rice, Italian wedding, cioppino, spinach, consommé, ramen and, by the time you read this, birria.
Last weekend, I had home-cooked chicken noodle soup courtesy of reader Trudi Blair.
Blair, who figured into a 2017 column on St. George’s Church in Ontario, told me then: “Although I have nothing to prove it, I believe I am your No. 1 fan.”
She sent me a get-well card recently and included this note: “I’d love to make my chicken soup because it heals everyone and also it’s delicious.”
Chicken soup for the columnist’s soul? I’ll take it.
I phoned her that Friday. She had fresh soup for me. “I made it yesterday when it was raining and raining,” she said. It has, she said, “lots of vegetables,” chicken and baby pasta.
Describing her well-rounded concoction, Blair said: “This will give you vegetables, starch, protein and vegetables.” I guess it does have a lot of vegetables.
“Do you need crackers?” she asked.
She gave me directions to her Ontario residence and I stopped by on my way home.
Blair had made up a take-home bag for me with a plastic container of soup, a bag of low-salt crackers, a carton of Goldfish crackers, a bag of Pink Lady apples, a bag of cookies and a container of chocolates.
Worthy of note: She is 90.
As I write this, I’ve finished the soup, the crackers, the cookies and the apples, with about half the Goldfish and all the chocolates left. I can’t say I’m healed, but I’m full.
While it’s not for me to decide whether or not Trudi Blair is my No. 1 fan, especially when there’s a reader who delivered Vince’s Spaghetti to my doorstep, let me say this: I’m a fan of Trudi Blair.
Legends in Pomona
When they were in high school, future baseball greats Jackie Robinson (of Muir Tech in Pasadena) and Ted Williams (of Hoover High in San Diego) played in the 1935 and 1936 Pomona High School Baseball Tournament, sponsored by the 20-30 Club.
“At the time, this was one of the largest sporting events in the area, attracting thousands of spectators,” said Scott Schroeder, a baseball enthusiast who’s been researching the tournament.
“It’s pretty amazing that Jackie Robinson and Ted Williams were both in this high school tournament, with no idea what the future had in store for them,” Schroeder added. “They were just high school kids.”
He’s been trying to track down copies of the 1935 and 1936 programs and reputed panoramic photos of the teams. I don’t know that a mention here will help, but it can’t hurt. Schroeder can be contacted at scott.schroeder@iaml.com or at 949-278-2648.

It’s been a while since I’ve mentioned recent posts to my blog at insidesocal.com/davidallen.
Let’s see, I named my favorite films and records of 2018, shared my reading for the month of January (as did several readers), reminded you of the day in 1990 when Ronald Reagan and Bob Hope visited Chaffey College, and ate meals at Vita Italian Bar and Grill and Slummin’ Gourmet, both in Pomona, Old World Deli in Upland and Pola’s Mariscos in Montclair.
Old World is a great place for soup, by the way.

The New York Times ran an obituary for Tom Cade, leader of an effort that re-established the peregrine falcon on the East Coast after it had been wiped out by DDT. As reader Larry Wineinger brought to my attention, Cade, who died Feb. 6 at 91, saw his first falcon in the 1940s when hiking with a friend at the San Dimas Reservoir. “It whistled over our heads. It sounded like an artillery shell passing over us,” he said in 2008. “It caught our attention.”

Texto completo: Septic tanks aren’t main algae culprits
William Louda insinuates that septic tanks are a cause for algae blooms. (“Excessive fertilizer fuels algal blooms,” Letters, Wednesday)
We have limited landmass in South Palm Beach County and most of the population in Palm Beach County are near the coastal areas. I would suggest that if the government were serious about algae blooms it would limit residential multifamily building and build desalinization-type plants that can turn liquid sewage from treatment plants and storm sewers into potable water.
Agriculture irrigation and increased multifamily building population needing sewage plants discharging untreated water and storm sewage drainage are the primary culprits in estuary algae blooms — not residential septic tanks with drain fields.

Abolish Senate, Electoral College
I read with some amusement Catherine Rampell’s sarcastic column “What America really needs to do is abolish Congress” (Tuesday). She actually was half right.
The Senate and the Electoral College have become outdated institutions that should be abolished. The House of Representatives represents the people. The Senate represents the states. This powerful entity may have served a purpose when our country was established to protect the diverse needs of different states. We no longer need a federal body to do so. It serves solely to create inequality between citizens.
Likewise the Electoral College, which frequently negates the popular vote.

Air travel ‘ban’ distorts Green New Deal’s words
Regarding the letter “Democrats’ sharp turn to the left is turn-off” (Feb. 12), we must ask just how does the phrase, “to expand high-speed rail so broadly that most air travel would be rendered obsolete” (from the referenced New York Times article) turn into “programs that would stop all air travel in a decade”?
We’re playing the game “Telephone: Politics Edition.” The original words from the six-page Green New Deal proposal are: “... build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary,” which became the phrase “… most air travel would be rendered obsolete” in the Times article, which morphed into U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney’s statement “when we outlaw plane travel” and finally devolving into the letter writer’s words.
It is sad that legacy energy interests are so petrified that they need to pollute this much-needed global conversation and our thinking.
Marty Grivjack, Jupiter
Can anything productive come from Washington?
Chaos in the presidency and in Congress makes us wonder if any meaningful legislation will be passed at all. Our faith and trust in leadership of both parties has eroded, leaving us with divided government and no respite in sight.
Will the next two years be spent listening to all those Democrats who want to take on Trump in 2020?

'Green Book' pianist played and partied in Wausau

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Pianist Don Shirley, the subject of the Academy Award-nominated movie "Green Book", confronted racist Jim Crow laws when he performed in the South in the 1960s.
But when Shirley came to Wausau to perform in The Grand theater, he had to deal with another problem altogether: A guy dressed as a gorilla stepped on his birthday cake.
That's the way Barbara Lattimer of Wausau, a voice instructor at the Wausau Conservatory of Music, remembers it.
Barbara's husband of 50 years, businessman and music lover Tom Lattimer, arranged to have Shirley perform in central Wisconsin. She doesn't remember the exact year — she thinks it likely was in the early 1970s, after the era the movie portrays. But portions of that evening stuck with her for nearly 50 years, and the memories came flooding back when she went to see "Green Book."
Barbara enjoyed the movie, especially because it revived the time she met Shirley. It also brought back sweeping memories of Tom, who died in 2012 at age 75. It almost felt, Lattimer said, as if Tom were with her in the theater, or that he might show up as a character in the film.
"Seeing the film was so bittersweet for me," she said.
Tom Lattimer had a long career in business, but his passion was music. He especially loved classical and jazz piano.
A 1954 graduate of Wausau High School, Tom Lattimer was a freshman at the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia when he began to follow the career of Don Shirley. Shirley was a stand-out musician, not only because of his world-class skills as pianist, but also because of the color of his skin.
Born in Pensacola, Florida, Shirley was the son of Jamaican immigrants and was a musical prodigy, playing standard concert classical pieces at age 10 and performing with the Boston Pops at age 18, according to his 2013 obituary in The New York Times.
Shirley, who is played by Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in "Green Book," initially yearned for a career as a classical pianist. But when he was in his 20s, he was counseled that American audiences were not ready for a black classical pianist. So instead he made his name performing pop music and jazz.
Shirley started playing gigs at nightclubs and, according to the Times, "invented what amounted to his own musical genre," a blending of pop, jazz, R&B and classical styles. Tom Lattimer likely first saw Shirley perform in Philadelphia, and the pianist's style enthralled him, Barbara said: "He began to follow the career of Don Shirley and heard him play frequently in East Coast clubs."
Following the career of Shirley also meant getting to know him as a person. Tom was the type of person who could easily insert himself into conversation and widely varying situations. He just had the ability to connect with people. So he would talk with Shirley after performances, likely peppering him with questions, and gradually become a casual acquaintance of the pianist, someone Shirley would recognize and chat with.
Tom Lattimer returned home to Wausau to become a successful agent for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. and a community leader who is remembered for his support of the performing arts.
And he continued to follow Shirley's career. He collected all of his albums and whenever possible, went to see live performances. By this time he and Barbara had married, and she would sometimes go with him.
Tom also had an interest in bolstering the art scene in Wausau. He helped develop the Wausau Conservatory of Music, was a chairman for the Festival of Arts and was a leader in the effort to renovate The Grand theater and create downtown Wausau's ArtsBlock.
A costume party at The Wausau Club was truly smashing. It was natural for Tom to help arrange for Shirley to perform in Wausau.
And it was entirely in character for Tom to invite Shirley to a private party held at The Wausau Club later that evening.
Barbara remembers that it was a costume party, and Tom, after Shirley performed, went to change into a gorilla suit. "I remember Tom meeting Don, holding the head of the suit in his hand," Barbara said. "And Don was upset that he wasn't told it was a costume party. I don't know what he would have done for a costume."
Then Tom and Barbara were taken to the club via Shirley's limousine, and when he got in, Tom put his foot in a birthday cake Shirley had in the car.
But all was forgiven when Shirley got to the party. The pianist was the center of attention, with people buying him drinks and talking with him. He asked Barbara, at one point, how he ever got connected with Tom, and all Barbara could do was explain that was just how Tom was. She couldn't bring herself to tell the musician that her husband had been essentially stalking him for years.
The movie portrays Shirley as a serious, regal and sometimes difficult man who insisted on pushing racial boundaries, Barbara said. The Shirley she remembers was jovial, smiling and laid back.
But, she said, at one point in the evening Shirley did share with Tom that he had a higher purpose to his performing tours.
"He told Tom that 'what I do is not about the music. It's about civil rights,'" Barbara said. "And the movie shows that. He puts himself in danger, trying to cross these (racial) barriers."

Texto completo: Ahead of the Oscars on Sunday, we asked co-chief film critic Manohla Dargis and critic-at-large Wesley Morris for their favorite books about old Hollywood. Below are their suggestions, as well as novels recommended by the Book Review editors.
For Film Buffs
INSIDE OSCAR, 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION
The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards
by Damien Bona and Mason Wiley
850 pp. Ballantine Books. (1996)
Morris called this book, which offers a history of the awards from 1929 to 1984, "compulsively readable." When it was first published in 1986, our reviewer wrote that it is "a giddy social history of our place and time, full of statistics and the kind of utterly trivial details that, taken together, somehow assume significance, like centuries-old graffiti scratched onto the base of the Sphinx."
THE CLASSICAL HOLLYWOOD CINEMA
Film Style and Mode of Production to 1960
by David Bordwell, Janet Staiger and Kristin Thompson
652 pp. Routledge. (1985)
Dargis said this book is "essential for any movie lover," "at once a history of classical Hollywood and, as the authors put it, 'an attempt to articulate a theoretical approach to film history."'
BRIGHT BOULEVARDS, BOLD DREAMS
The Story of Black Hollywood
by Donald Bogle
432 pp. One World/ Ballantine. (2005)
In this book, said Dargis, Bogle "charts the underknown, essential, often fascinating, at times heartbreaking story of the African-Americans who helped build the movie industry (and keep it running) both in front of the camera and behind it."
For Casual Viewers
THE DAY OF THE LOCUST
By Nathanael West
238 pp. Random House. (1939)
In our reviewer's telling, West appears to believe Hollywood has "too many lost people," who "freed in their new anonymity from the restraints of the village life from which they have escaped, form a tragic chorus for the glamour boys and girls under movie contract." The book primarily follows Tod Hackett, a young artist hired by a studio to do scene design, but readers are introduced to a wide cast of characters, including out-of-work actors, parents of child performers and more.
THE BIG SLEEP
By Raymond Chandler
231 pp. Vintage. (1939)
In Chandler's first book in the Philip Marlowe series, detective Marlowe is hired by a dying millionaire to deal with a blackmailer targeting one of his two daughters. "As a study in depravity, the story is excellent, with Marlowe standing out as almost the only fundamentally decent person in it," wrote our reviewer.
PLAY IT AS IT LAYS
By Joan Didion
214 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (1970)
Our reviewer called this novel "just about perfect," saying that Didion "writes with a razor, carving her characters out of her perceptions with strokes so swift and economical that each scene ends almost before the reader is aware of it." Didion tells the story of Maria Wyeth, an ex-model adrift in California after a disastrous marriage to a filmmaker, who is attempting to rescue her daughter from a mental institution.

INSIDE TRUMP’S ENERGY DOMINANCE 2.0 AGENDA: The Trump administration is set to make opening up “bottlenecks” in the U.S. energy system the centerpiece of an updated version of the president’s earlier “energy dominance” agenda it is fleshing out.


The new focus is on barriers to entry in getting energy to market, whereas earlier versions of energy dominance focused more on increasing production and exports.


The push is meant to get more U.S. oil and natural gas to market by whatever means necessary. At the same time, though, the administration is saying that it won’t shy away from renewable energy, and is starting a new effort to make solar energy part of its grid resilience strategy along with coal.


“The administration is looking at all infrastructure bottlenecks and it’s across the board,” Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes told John in an interview Thursday night.


The agenda includes building more pipelines for moving both natural gas and oil for export and for domestic consumption, he said.


“The administration is looking across the entire country either to alleviate the bottlenecks or to get products out to port, whether its export terminals themselves or pipelines, we are constantly looking for ways to improve that,” he added.


Menezes was speaking just after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, on a bipartisan basis, resolved a major point of disagreement in siting a new liquefied natural gas export terminal, which he described as a major achievement and the first step to relieving an LNG permitting backlog. Previously, the commission had been stalled by disagreement about how to account for greenhouse gas emissions in its decision.


Republican FERC chairman Neil Chatterjee called the decision a “breakthrough.” (Read Josh’s story on the decision here.)


The updated energy agenda also includes fixing transmission lines: FERC could also be ready to resolve transmission line issues to bring more wind and solar to market, said Menezes.


“We have policies in place right now that provide incentives for transmission lines that will bring locationally-constrained renewables into the grid,” he said. FERC can approve financial incentives for transmission projects to help spur development where electricity is being held back by a lack of power lines.


The administration looks to boost batteries: The Energy Department is also spending a lot of its financial resources on battery storage, seen as key to making renewables a competitive resource with coal and nuclear power plants, Menezes said.


The department is launching a new program to increase the amount of solar energy on the grid in order to improve the power grid’s “resiliency” — which relates to the grid’s ability to bounce back from extreme weather or even a cyber attack.  


“We just did a [Funding Opportunity Announcement] on increasing solar on the bulk power system to help with resiliency,” Menezes said. “So, we are committed to renewables.”


The future is natural gas and renewables: Menezes also said that natural gas and renewable energy complement one another on the grid, and natural gas has been helping renewable energy to grow.


“That’s a great story, and we are going to continue to push for that,” he added. “The future for our electricity generation is natural gas and renewables.”


Nuclear is absent: With the exception of the Vogel nuclear power plant in Georgia under construction, the rest of the new power plants being built are all natural gas and renewables.


Menezes said the administration is “bullish” on natural gas power plants, which is a bit of a change given that the president over the summer said gas pipelines can be blown up in arguing in favor of coal as an “indestructible” form of power.


What about coal? Menezes says they still want a diverse array of energy resource, and continue to support coal, “we are very bullish on increasing renewables and natural gas domestically.”


The Energy Department is also in the beginning stages of developing a grid modeling system with the Department of Homeland Security that looks at “defense critical infrastructure,” ensuring the power generators and energy infrastructure exist that are critical to national security.


The grid modeling is being done as part of bipartisan legislation called the FAST Act that was signed into law under the previous administration, but that the Obama White House slow-walked in implementing, Menezes said.

GOING AFTER CUOMO: Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette, who also spoke to John, said if New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo ’s focus is on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, then he should allow the pipelines in dispute to pass through the Empire State.


The administration is looking at all options to resolve conflicts with New York in developing pipelines to move natural gas from the shale fields of Pennsylvania to the energy-constrained areas of New England.


President Trump recently spoke to the governor earlier this month about allowing pipelines to cross the state to provide low-cost energy to the Northeast.


“We have to fix these infrastructure issues, we have to work with the State of New York to allow gas to transit the state, so places like Boston and other places in the Northeast have access to this clean fuel,” said Brouillette.


In the most recent cold snaps in 2018 and 2019, the Northeast had used vast amounts of oil and heating fuel to meet the increased demand, which is increasing greenhouse gas emissions and making the energy system there less efficient, the deputy secretary explained. Getting more natural gas into the region would change that.


“As they continue to burn fuel oil, as in the case of Boston, we are continuing to see these emissions numbers just continue to increase,” Brouillette said.


By any means necessary: Menezes explained that the Energy Department is looking at an array of ways to get more natural gas into the Northeast, including trucking, if the pipelines continue to be delayed.


There is also the option of shipping via cargo ship from a U.S. port into Massachusetts, for example. “They have three places over there where they could probably take LNG,” Menezes said. “We are looking at all options, we’ve talked to truckers and rail lines, there’s all kinds of different ways,” he said.


He also underscored small marine cargoes for LNG under an order that Energy Secretary Rick Perry issued in 2018, which was meant to facilitate a lot of inland use of LNG.


“People think we are solely focused on the export of LNG, but there are other ways that you can get LNG around” domestically, he added. “To be sure, we are looking at every conceivable thing.”


US WILL STAY TOP GLOBAL OIL PRODUCER THROUGH 2020, ENERGY DEPARTMENT SAYS: The U.S. is on a solid trajectory to retain the title of the world's largest oil producer well into next year's presidential election season, the Energy Department said on Thursday.


The U.S. will not only maintain its lead spot as top producer, but will greatly exceed what it produced last year in both 2019 and 2020, the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly oil analysis.


Oil production will average 12.4 million barrels per day in 2019 and 13.2 million barrels per day in 2020, according to the agency, up from 11 million in 2018.


The gains in oil production will come primarily from the oil drilling taking place in the Permian shale region of Texas and New Mexico, according to the agency. But significant offshore oil production is also expected to come online in the Gulf of Mexico.


AUTOMAKERS FRET OVER TRUMP BAILING ON CLEAN CAR TALKS: Automakers fretted Thursday after the Trump administration confirmed it has bailed on negotiations with California over fuel efficiency standards.


The Automaker Alliance, which had prodded the administration to redo the Obama-era rules, urged both sides to come back to the negotiating table.


"We always knew achieving one national program would be challenging," the trade group said. "But one national program is worth striving for because it is the best way to maximize fuel economy and carbon reductions while preserving vehicle affordability and employment."


The Trump administration has proposed freezing Obama-era fuel efficiency rules for cars and light trucks, instead of raising them each year. It has also proposed revoking a waiver that California has, and other states follow, allowing it to impose fuel efficiency rules tougher than the federal one. The administration will likely finalize the rule in a similar form.


Can automakers have it both ways? Automakers, who prefer flexibility in the Obama rules, not an outright rejection, consider the Trump plan too extreme and worry about splitting the U.S. into multiple markets, where more fuel efficient cars are accepted in only parts of the country.


Global Automakers, another trade group, said Thursday it is “disappointed and concerned” that talks between the Trump administration and California failed.


Honda, the Japanese carmaker, also expressed disappointment, and insisted 'there is a credible middle ground” for the parties to reach a deal.


Environmental groups were quick to criticize the automakers for playing to both sides of the debate, and challenged them to help encourage a resolution.


“Car industry still has a choice: Stick with team Trump and get a patchwork and years of lawsuits, or oppose the radical federal rollback and work with California. It’s not too late,” tweeted David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council.


FORD TO PROBE POTENTIAL FLAW IN EMISSIONS TESTING: Ford acknowledged a potential flaw in its emissions testing Thursday, and has authorized an independent investigation.


Ford has notified the Environmental Protection Agency about the issue, after company employees reported discovering the potential testing flaw in September.


“We take the potential issues seriously and are following up with the company to fully understand the circumstances behind this disclosure,” the EPA said.


The company said it is unable to confirm yet that its computer models for evaluating fuel efficiency are inaccurate, and if it had reported bad data to consumers or regulators.


PERRY TO TOUR ARIZONA BATTERY SYSTEM AFTER UTILITY ANNOUNCES STORAGE PLANS: Energy Secretary Rick Perry is touring Arizona Public Service's Festival Ranch battery installation on Friday.


His visit comes a day after the Arizona utility announced a major battery storage initiative, with plans to add 850 megawatts of battery storage and at least 100 megawatts of solar generation by 2025.


Breakthroughs in battery storage are crucial to addressing the variability of wind and solar power, allowing those energy sources to be used when the wind is not blowing, and sun not shining.


Arizona’s plan includes adding 200 megawatts of batteries to existing utility-owned solar projects, deploying 500 megawatts of new batteries, and contracting for 150 megawatts of third-party-owned storage.

Texto completo: Emile Buzaid’s wife, Theresa, dragged him to the movies the other week. She wanted to see “Green Book,” billed as a comedy/drama. He hadn’t heard of it. Then his friend Sam Hyman stopped in the store and told Emile: “Geez, you’ve got to see this movie. It’s really pretty good,” Emile recalls.
In his 65 years, Emile has seen a lot. He was being a good husband going to the movies that day. But not far into the plot, he perked up. “Honey, I know that name,” he whispered.
Don Shirley. Halfway through the bag of popcorn he knew — “I rented a piano to him — Don Shirley!”
How improbable is that? A famous jazz/classically trained pianist who had lived in a lavish apartment above Carnegie Hall in Manhattan came to Danbury — Danbury — to rent a piano? A Steinway, of course.
Emile teases out the memory. Yes, it was the late ’60s, could have been ’67 or ’68, maybe ’69. Emile was still a student at Immaculate High School in Danbury and worked in his parents’ store, Buzaid Music Company.
“I had no clue who he was, other than successful,” Emile recounts as we sat at a card table in the reincarnation of the music store on Lake Avenue in Danbury. “A lot of artists back then spent summers in the vicinity, either up at the lake (Candlewood Lake) or Sherman, or Ridgefield; back then it was nice to get out of New York.”
The music store his parents opened in 1952, to give piano lessons to local youngsters, had grown into a destination for high-end acoustic piano sales and rentals.
And now, the polite tall man who 50-some years ago came into Buzaid looking to rent a piano is depicted in a movie up for an Academy Award on Sunday, five in fact — Best Movie, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. Mahershala Ali, as Shirley, is nominated for a best supporting actor role. Nothing against Viggo Mortensen, playing Shirley’s driver/bodyguard in the movie, but Ali should have been nominated for best actor, not best supporting.
“Green Book” is about a true friendship that developed between Shirley and “Tony Lip” Vallelonga, the Bronx bouncer he hired as his chauffeur and bodyguard for a 1962 concert tour in the South. Told from Vallelonga’s viewpoint, it is a journey through racism — both personal and societal. The movie’s title refers to a guide of places where black travelers could spend the night.
“If they can find common ground, we all can,” Director Peter Farrelly said of the film’s characters in his Golden Globes acceptance speech. “All we have to do is talk and to not judge people by their differences, but to look for what we have in common.”
Sometimes our lives shoulder with the famous, although we might not know it. Sometimes there are connections that pull on the threads of time. Let’s go back.
A child prodigy
Donald Walbridge Shirley was a virtuoso, classically trained prodigy, a musical genius (though carrying, like so many of us humans, emotional baggage) born on Jan. 29, 1927 to Jamaican immigrants in Pensacola, Fla. — his father an Episcopal minister, his mother a teacher.
He was not even 3 years old when he displayed interest in the piano and as a youth played the organ at church. “Around the time his mother died at age 9, Shirley traveled to the Soviet Union to study theory at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music and later received lessons in advanced composition at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.,” according to the site Biography.
At 18, Shirley debuted on the concert stage with the Boston Pops, playing Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat.
“But a few years later, the impresario Sol Hurok, who, paradoxically, had helped Marian Anderson break the color line as an operatic diva, told him that a black pianist wouldn’t be accepted in the United States, and pushed him to adopt a pop repertoire,” Giovanni Russonello wrote in The New York Times on Nov. 2.
By the early ’60s, he was recording for Cadence Records and represented by Columbia Artists management, which sponsored the tour with the Don Shirley Trio depicted in the movie.
“Shirley undertook his tour of whites-only theaters and parlor venues out of civic obligation — and stubbornness. He refused to be told, yet again, what he could play where,” Russonello wrote.
‘Look like you’re having a good time’
Emile’s father was a professional pianist, playing in places such as Chicago, Detroit and Las Vegas, where he met Emile’s mother, a Julliard grad with a prestigious — and not common for the time — PhD in music. They returned to Emile Sr.’s hometown of Danbury to raise a family and opened the Buzaid School of Music on Liberty Street, just off Main near the May Department store.
Right across the street, John Carvette had a competing business — selling Italian accordions with ivory keys and giving lessons to kids — Carvette School of Music. And he had a young son about Emile’s age, 7 or 8, at the time. Carvette had the savvy idea to put his young son in the picture window facing the street, playing the accordion for passers-by on the weekend.
“Son, look at that,” Emile Sr. said. “He doesn’t look like he likes it. You go in our window and play the piano — and anytime somebody comes by, look like you’re having a good time!” Emile smiles impishly, now, improvising the keys. “Hee-hee.”
And so it was that a piano-playing kid competed with an accordion-playing kid across Liberty Street, both trying to entice parents to enroll their children for lessons. (At Buzaid, the $15-a-month lessons included a piano rental.)
Emile graduated from the music program at what then was Western Connecticut State College and became a professional musician, whose repertoire included a bar in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Now he plays the organ at St. Anthony’s Church, “believe it or not.” No way does he compare his piano playing to Shirley’s talent.
I am not making a direct parallel of their lives. Their backgrounds and upbringings differ greatly. It’s more like a braided narrative of interests from across a connection in time, though Shirley died in 2013 at the age of 86.
As Emile feeds mini dog bones to Maxx, the lovable bulldog who can’t get enough, he reminisces about the days when acoustic pianos were sought-after.
Many famous people came through the Danbury store, which moved to Spring Street, then West. Liberace rented a second piano for his performance at The Palace in the mid-’60s. (“I remember he had a ring that was a candelabra,” Emile recalls with a laugh.) Zsa Zsa Gabor’s mother, who was summering in Ridgefield, rented a piano. Later years brought in Felix Cavaliere of the Young Rascals, and singer, songwriter and pianist Laura Nyro. Business was good until electronic pianos took over in the early ’90s.
Recalling meeting Shirley
“Don Shirley. I think my father dealt with him, with the rental,” Emile recalls. “For some reason, I think I was on the truck” making the delivery across the New York border to Pound Ridge or South Salem.
“My sense was, he was very polite, very straightforward. The ones that are really good are nice; the wannabes give you all the drama.”
He hasn’t listened to Shirley’s albums, but would like to someday. “Right now I’m busy playing my own stuff,” he says.
These days, Emile Buzaid Jr. carries on at the Maxx Gun and Pawn Shop on Lake Avenue, where the phone rings often enough.
He doesn’t want to talk about the gun business, as I gaze at the life-size Samurai outfit from the 1850s (enclosed in a tall glass case) near a stuffed buffalo head on the wall. “I don’t get involved in anything modern or controversial.”
Emile and Theresa, who wrote a children’s book titled “The Great Danbury State Fair A to Z,” won’t be watching the Academy Awards Sunday night, because they never do.
But Emile hopes “Green Book,” which triggered memories for him, wins lots of awards.

Re "In Attack, Trump Aims 'Enemy of the People' Directly at The Times" (news article, Feb. 21):
I know that our president doesn't read, but if he did, he might realize that the term "an enemy of the people," the title of a famous play by Ibsen, is, ironically, a badge of honor.
The play's hero, Dr. Stockmann, is attacked and isolated by his little town for daring to expose the truth: that its public baths are contaminated. He stands alone, as the town is interested only in commerce, not in truth or public health, although he is supported by his daughter, Petra, whom I had the honor of playing in a high school production. I never forgot Ibsen's lesson.
I sincerely hope that The New York Times continues to be an "enemy" -- that is, a friend of the people, or in this case, a friend of our entire democracy.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Just over 24 hours after announcing his presidential bid, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has already raised $6 million from more than 225,000 donors, his campaign said Wednesday morning.
That amount far surpasses what any of his rivals have disclosed raising after their own announcements this year.
Previously, Senator Kamala Harris of California had claimed the biggest early fund-raising haul that had been made public, with $1.5 million in 24 hours. In comparison, Mr. Sanders's campaign said its fund-raising in the first 24 hours came to $5.9 million.
Later Wednesday, President Trump's campaign cited Mr. Sanders's windfall in its own fund-raising pitch, sending a text message to supporters telling them about the $6 million that "Socialist Bernie" had raised. "Now I'm calling on you to CRUSH that number," the message said.
Mr. Sanders's early fund-raising success is not unexpected: After all, he raised well over $200 million when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 election, and his list of online donors dwarfs those of his Democratic rivals.
[Where does Bernie Sanders stand on key issues? Here's a refresher.]
But in a crowded presidential field, where candidates are eager to demonstrate the enthusiasm behind their campaigns, early fund-raising hauls offer bragging rights, at least for a moment.
A recent New York Times analysis found that Mr. Sanders began his 2020 candidacy with about 2.1 million online donors who had given him money over the last six years, an enormous lead among proven contributors that is roughly equivalent to the donor base of all the other Democratic hopefuls combined.
Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for Senate last year, has twice as many online donors as anyone running or considering running besides Mr. Sanders. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Ms. Harris each had drawn money from at least 230,000 online donors ahead of their candidacies.
A more complete view of the candidates' fund-raising will eventually be available through the Federal Election Commission. Several well-known Democratic candidates have not released early fund-raising totals, including Ms. Warren, Ms. Gillibrand and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.
Still, based on what has been made public so far, here is a guide to who can claim those bragging rights.
Mr. Sanders: $6 million in just over 24 hours
Mr. Sanders surpassed not only his rivals, but also his own performance when he announced his 2016 candidacy.
At the time, his campaign said it collected more than $1.5 million online from 35,000 donors in the first 24 hours.
While Mr. Sanders can boast of his early fund-raising success, the donor list he developed in the 2016 campaign is an enormous advantage that none of the other declared Democratic candidates can match.
The Sanders campaign said on Wednesday that its average donation mirrored the $27 average from the 2016 campaign.
Mr. Sanders received $600,000 in donations that will recur monthly, his campaign said.
Ms. Harris : $1.5 million in 24 hours
Before Mr. Sanders released his numbers, Ms. Harris had the most impressive fund-raising performance known in the primary so far.
Her campaign said it raised $1.5 million online from more than 38,000 donors in the 24 hours after she announced her candidacy in January.
The average online donation was $37, her campaign said.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota: $1 million in 48 hours
This is where the comparisons start to get a little tricky.
Ms. Klobuchar's campaign said it raised over $1 million "from online and grass-roots supporters" in the first 48 hours of her presidential bid.
But the campaign did not say how many people had donated during that period, so it is not possible to estimate the size of her average donation.
Ms. Warren: $300,000 in under 24 hours
Ms. Warren announced an exploratory committee for president on Dec. 31. That day, she raised about $300,000 from just over 8,000 donors through the online donation-processing platform ActBlue, according to Federal Election Commission records.
Those numbers work out to an average contribution of about $37. Ms. Warren formally announced her presidential bid earlier this month, but her campaign did not release information on its fund-raising after that announcement.

Texto completo: PARIS (AP) -- Chanel's iconic couturier, Karl Lagerfeld, whose accomplished designs as well as trademark white ponytail, high starched collars and dark enigmatic glasses dominated high fashion for the past 50 years, has died. He was around 85 years old.
Such was the enigma surrounding the German-born designer that even his age was a point of mystery for decades, with reports he had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938. In 2013, Lagerfeld told French magazine "Paris Match" he was born in 1935, but in 2019 his assistant still didn't know the truth -- telling AP he liked "to scramble the tracks on his year of birth -- that's part of the character."
Chanel confirmed that Lagerfeld died early Tuesday.

Lagerfeld was of the most hardworking figures in the fashion world holding down the top design jobs at LVMH-owned luxury label Fendi from 1977, and Paris' family-owned power-house Chanel in 1983. Indeed, his indefatigable energy was notable: he lost around 90 pounds in his late 60s to fit into the latest slimline fashions.
Though he spent virtually his entire career at luxury labels catering to the very wealthy -- including all of 20 years at Chloe -- Lagerfeld's designs quickly trickled down to low-end retailers, giving him an almost unprecedented impact on the entire fashion industry.

At Chanel, he served up youthful designs that were always of the moment and sent out almost infinite variations on the house's classic skirt suit, ratcheting up the hemlines or smothering it in golden chains, stings of pearls or pricey accessories. They were always delivered with wit.
"Each season, they tell me (the Chanel designs) look younger. One day we'll all turn up like babies," he once told The Associated Press.
His outspoken and often stinging remarks on things as diverse as French politics and celebrity waistlines won him the nickname "Kaiser Karl" in the fashion media. Among the most acid comments included calling President Francois Hollande an "imbecile" who would be "disastrous" for France in Marie-Claire, and telling UK's The Sun that he didn't like the face of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister.
"She should only show her back," he advised.
Lagerfeld was also heavily criticized for sending out a negative message to women when he told France's Metro newspaper that signer Adele was "a little too fat."
Despite this, he did have an under-reported soft side. He was known to be very kind to his staff at Chanel and was famous for according journalists generously long interviews after each fashion show. He also shared his unmarried life in his Parisian mansion with a Siamese cat called Choupette.
"She is spoilt, much more than a child could be," he told AP in 2013, revealing also that he would take her to the vet every 10 days overcautiously.
Lagerfeld had little use for nostalgia and kept his gaze riveted toward the future. Well into his 70s, he was quick to embrace new technology: He famously had a collection of hundreds of iPods.
A photographer who shot ad campaigns for Chanel and his own eponymous label, Lagerfeld also collected art books and had a massive library and a bookstore as well as his own publishing house. He was also an impressive linguist switching between perfect French, English, Italian and his native German during interviews at post-catwalk celebrity media scrums.
Although he spent much of his life in the public eye, Lagerfeld remained a largely elusive figure. Even as he courted the spotlight, he made an apparently deliberate effort to hide what was going on behind his trademark dark shades.
"I am like a caricature of myself, and I like that," British Vogue quoted Lagerfeld as saying. "It is like a mask. And for me the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long."
After cutting his teeth at Paris-based label Chloe, Lagerfeld consolidated his reputation in the 1980s when he revived the flagging fortunes of the storied Paris haute couture label Chanel. There, he helped launch the careers of supermodels including Claudia Schiffer, Ines de la Fressange and Stella Tennant.
In a move that helped make his a household name, Lagerfeld designed a capsule collection for Swedish fast-fashion company H&M in 2004 and released a CD of his favorite music shortly after.
A weight-loss book he published in 2005 -- "The Karl Lagerfeld Diet" -- consolidated his status as a pop culture icon. In the book, Lagerfeld, said that it was his desire to fit into the slim-cut suits by then-Dior Homme designer Hedi Slimane that had motivated his dramatic transformation.
The son of an industrialist who made a fortune in condensed milk and his violinist wife, Lagerfeld was born into an affluent family in Hamburg, Germany.
Lagerfeld had artistic ambitions early on. In interviews, he variously said he wanted to become a cartoonist, a portraitist, an illustrator or a musician.
"My mother tried to instruct me on the piano. One day, she slammed the piano cover closed on my fingers and said, 'draw, it makes less noise," he was quoted as saying in the book "The World According to Karl."
At age 14, Lagerfeld came to Paris with his parents and went to school in the City of Light. His fashion career got off to a precocious start when, in 1954, a coat he designed won a contest by the International Wool Secretariat. His rival, Yves Saint Laurent, won that year's contest in the dress category.
Lagerfeld apprenticed at Balmain and in 1959 was hired at another Paris-based house, Patou, where he spent four years as artistic director. After a series of freelance jobs with labels including Rome-based Fendi, Lagerfeld took over the reins at Chloe, known for its romantic Parisian style.
Lagerfeld also started his own label, Karl Lagerfeld, which though less commercially successful than his other ventures, was widely seen as a sort of sketchpad where the designer worked through his audacious ideas.
In 1982, he took over at over Chanel, which had been dormant since the death of its founder, Coco Chanel, more than a decade earlier.
"When I took on Chanel, it was a sleeping beauty -- not even a beautiful one," he said in the 2007 documentary "Lagerfeld Confidential." "She snored."
For his debut collection for the house, Lagerfeld injected a dose of raciness, sending out a translucent navy chiffon number that prompted scandalized headlines.
He never ceased to shake up the storied house, sending out a logo-emblazoned bikini so small the top looked like pasties on a string and another collection that dispensed entirely with bottoms, with the models wearing little jackets over opaque tights instead.
Lagerfeld was open about his homosexuality -- he once said he announced it to his parents at age 13 -- but kept his private life under wraps. Following his widely known relationship with a French aristocrat who died of AIDS in 1989, Lagerfeld insisted he prized his solitude above all.
"I hate when people say I'm 'solitaire' (or solitary.) Yes, I'm solitaire in the sense of a stone from Cartier, a big solitaire," Lagerfeld told The New York Times in an interview. "I have to be alone to do what I do. I like to be alone. I'm happy to be with people, but I'm sorry to say I like to be alone, because there's so much to do, to read, to think."
As much as he loved the spotlight, Lagerfeld was careful to obscure his real self.
"It's not that I lie, it's that I don't owe the truth to anyone," he told French Vogue in an interview.

Texto completo: PARIS -- Karl Lagerfeld, the iconic couturier whose designs at Chanel and Fendi had an unprecedented impact on the entire fashion industry, died Tuesday in Paris, prompting an outpouring of love and admiration for the man whose career spanned six decades.

Although he spent virtually his entire career at luxury labels catering to the very wealthy -- including 20 years at Chloe -- Lagerfeld's designs quickly trickled down to low-end retailers, giving him global influence.

Former supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who credits Lagerfeld as her mentor, called him her "magic dust."

"What (Andy) Warhol was to art, he was to fashion; he is irreplaceable," she said.

The German-born designer may have spent much of his life in the public eye -- his trademark white ponytail, high starched collar and dark glasses are instantly recognizable -- but he remained a largely elusive figure.

Such was the enigma surrounding the octogenarian Lagerfeld that even his age was a point of mystery for decades, with reports he had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938.

In 2013, Lagerfeld told the French magazine "Paris Match" he was born in September of 1935 -- which would make him 83 today -- but in 2019 his assistant still didn't know the truth -- telling The Associated Press he liked "to scramble the tracks on his year of birth -- that's part of the character."

Chanel confirmed that Lagerfeld, who had looked increasingly frail in recent seasons, died early Tuesday in Paris. Last month, he did not come out to take a bow at the house's couture show in Paris -- a rare absence that the company attributed to him being "tired."

"An extraordinary creative individual, Lagerfeld reinvented the brand's codes created by Gabrielle Chanel: the Chanel jacket and suit, the little black dress, the precious tweeds, the two-tone shoes, the quilted handbags, the pearls and costume jewelry," Chanel said.

The brand's CEO Alain Wertheimer praised Lagerfeld for an "exceptional intuition" that was ahead of his time and contributed to Chanel's global success.

"Today, not only have I lost a friend, but we have all lost an extraordinary creative mind to whom I gave carte blanche in the early 1980s to reinvent the brand," he said.

Chanel said Virginie Viard, his longtime head of studio, will create the house's upcoming collections, but did not say whether her appointment was permanent.

Tributes from fellow designers, Hollywood celebrities, models and politicians quickly poured in. Donatella Versace thanked Lagerfeld for the way he inspired her and her late brother Gianni Versace.

Lagerfeld was one of the most hardworking figures in the fashion world, joining luxury Italian fashion house Fendi in 1965 and later becoming its longtime womenswear design chief in 1977, as well as leading designs at Paris' family-owned power-house Chanel since 1983.

While at Fendi, Lagerfeld helped create the notion of fun fur, lending an ease to a formal wardrobe topper by adding stylized touches.

At Chanel, he served up youthful designs that were always of the moment and sent out almost infinite variations on the house's classic skirt suit, ratcheting up the hemlines or smothering it in golden chains, stings of pearls or pricey accessories.

Wit was never far behind any collection.

"Each season, they tell me (the Chanel designs) look younger. One day we'll all turn up like babies," he once told The Associated Press.

His outspoken and often stinging remarks on topics as diverse as French politics and celebrity waistlines won him the nickname "Kaiser Karl" in the fashion media. Among the most acid comments included calling former French President Francois Hollande an "imbecile" who would be "disastrous" for France in Marie-Claire, and telling The Sun British tabloid that he didn't like the face of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister.

Lagerfeld was also heavily criticized for sending out a negative message to women when he told France's Metro newspaper that British singer Adele was "a little too fat."

Despite this, he was very kind to his staff at Chanel, generous with his time with journalists and shared his Parisian mansion with a Siamese cat called Choupette.

"She is spoilt, much more than a child could be," he told the AP in 2013.

Lagerfeld had little use for nostalgia and kept his gaze firmly on the future. Well into his 70s, he was quick to embrace new technology: He famously had a collection of hundreds of iPods.

Trump asked Whitaker to put U.S. attorney in charge of Michael Cohen probe after he had recused himself

Texto completo: President Trump asked then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker late last year to put the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, a Trump ally, in charge of the investigation into Michael Cohen, after the attorney had already recused himself from the probe, according to a new report.

Whitaker, also a Trump loyalist, told the president he could not put Geoffrey Berman in charge of the investigation into the hush money payments his longtime attorney made to women alleging they had sex with Trump, citing the recusal, the New York Times reported Tuesday.

Berman, who had been appointed by Trump, recused himself because of a conflict of interest. He donated money Trump’s 2016 campaign and has ties to Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

There’s no evidence Whitaker tried to directly interfere in the New York investigation after Trump made the request, beyond telling some Justice Department associates that the prosecutors in the case needed “adult supervision,” the Times report said.

Trump denied asking Whitaker about the recusal, telling reports at the White House, “No, I don’t know who gave you that.”

Whitaker testified earlier this month to lawmakers that Trump had not pressured him over any investigations.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended Whitaker’s testimony.

“Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” she said. “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.”

Texto completo: Kaiser Permanente is opening a hospital-run school of medicine in Pasadena, announcing Tuesday, Feb. 19 it would waive tuition for its first five graduating classes in an attempt to jump-start medical careers minus the typical crushing student debt.
The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine said it has received preliminary accreditation and will begin accepting applications from prospective students in June for admission in the summer of 2020.
This will be a unique learning institution for Kaiser, which plans to waive all tuition for the full four years of school at its campus at 98 S. Los Robles Ave. Those classes — with 48 students each — will run from 2020 through 2024.
Tuition would typically cost $55,000 a year, saving each student $275,000.
“This is primarily about making sure all students, regardless of backgrounds, aren’t deterred from pursuing a career in medicine due to the prospect of going into massive debt,” said Kaiser spokesman Vincent Staupe. “This is also about wanting students to be able to choose a medical specialty that they are truly passionate about, rather than choosing one based solely off financial need.”
Kaiser hopes the strategy will prompt more students to pursue lower-paying specialties in the primary care field, or work in under-served areas since they wouldn’t be burdened with overwhelming debt.
The school will use a “small-group, case-based medical curriculum” that are designed to prepare future physicians to become collaborative leaders committed to prevention, fluent in data-driven care and adept at addressing the needs of under-served patients and communities.
Dr. Mark A. Schuster, the school’s founding dean and CEO, said the health care giant is developing a school committed to providing “outstanding patient care in our nation’s complex and evolving health care system.”
The school said it has recruited a diverse group of leaders with vast health care experience who, in turn, created a curriculum that includes three academic pillars — foundational science, clinical science and health systems science.
The school’s clinical education will take place primarily in Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in the greater Los Angeles area and in partnered community health centers.
Other medical schools at universities have taken steps recently to decrease their students’ financial burden. Columbia University, for example, is using a $250 million gift for a new endowment that will fund a range of scholarships and grants meant to ensure none of its medical students incur debt.
About three-quarters of medical school students graduate with debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges; members of the 2017 graduating class who had debt reported a median amount of $192,000.
Kaiser’s medical school has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a different process than usual because, unlike the universities that open medical schools, it is not already a degree-granting institution.

Texto completo: Former FBI general counsel James Baker testified to Congress last fall that he was told by two officials that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said a pair of Cabinet officials was "ready to support" an effort to remove President Trump from office.

Addressing a joint task force of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, Baker did not name the Cabinet officials. Baker did identify the two FBI officials who informed him of Rosenstein's talk of invoking the 25th Amendment: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, whose anti-Trump text message with ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok has fueled concern among GOP lawmakers that there is rampant bias in the FBI.

“I was being told by some combination of Andy McCabe and Lisa Page, that, in a conversation with the deputy attorney general, he had stated that he — this was what was related to me — that he had at least two members of the president’s Cabinet who were ready to support, I guess you would call it, an action under the 25th Amendment,” Baker said in a closed-door testimony, according to Fox News.

Scrutiny of Rosenstein has another high note this week as McCabe embarks on an explosive media tour to promote his new book, "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump." Speaking with CBS News' "60 Minutes," McCabe confirmed reports that Rosenstein told Justice Department officials about wearing a “wire” to record conversations with Trump and that he had discussed invoking the 25th Amendment against the president in the days after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.

The New York Times reported on Thursday it had obtained an excerpt from one of McCabe's contemporaneous memos on his interactions DOJ officials. He wrote, "We discussed the president’s capacity and the possibility he could be removed from office under the 25th Amendment." He further noted that Rosenstein examined the issue and decided that a “majority or 8 of the 15 cabinet officials" would be needed to follow through.

McCabe also said Rosenstein suggested that sympathetic Cabinet members who might join their cause included the attorney general and homeland security secretary, who at the time were Jeff Sessions and John Kelly, respectively.

The Justice Department responded to McCabe's "60 Minutes" interview, claiming his version of events was "inaccurate and factually incorrect." McCabe became the first official to go on record to say there was talk at the DOJ about undermining Trump. Rosenstein previously denied past reporting that said those discussions took place, while sources told NBC News that he was only joking about secretly recording the president.

As lawmakers on both sides of the aisle began calling for McCabe to testify, a spokeswoman for McCabe said his comments were "taken out-of-context and misrepresented" during the media tour for his book.

“At no time did Mr. McCabe participate in any extended discussions about the use of the 25th Amendment, nor is he aware of any such discussions,” Melissa Schwartz said in a statement. “He was present and participated in a discussion that included a comment by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein regarding the 25th Amendment.”

McCabe, a 21-year veteran of the FBI who briefly served as acting FBI director after Comey was fired, was himself fired on March 16, 2018, two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined that he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

He “lacked candor” on four occasions when interviewing with internal investigators, the IG report said. In April, it was revealed that the Justice Department IG had referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Federal prosecutors used a grand jury to investigate McCabe. McCabe told CBS he ordered an obstruction of justice investigation into Trump after he fired Comey in the spring of 2017.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is speaking publicly about the investigations into President Donald Trump's Russian ties and his possible obstruction of justice, telling CBS in an interview that Justice Department officials weighed asking the Cabinet to consider invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.
McCabe made the revelation during an interview with "60 Minutes" that is scheduled to air on Sunday.
In September, the New York Times reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had discussed using the 25th Amendment on Trump and that he had considered wearing a wire to record his conversations with the president. Rosenstein has strongly denied the report.
"60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley said Thursday on CBS "This Morning" that McCabe told him "there were meetings at the Justice Department in which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment. "
Pelley said those conversations took place in the time between Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, and May 17, 2017, when Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate a potential conspiracy between Russian intelligence operatives and the Trump campaign.
On Thursday, the DOJ again denied that officials considered using the 25th Amendment.
"As to the specific portions of this interview provided to the Department of Justice by 60 Minutes in advance, the Deputy Attorney General again rejects Mr. McCabe’s recitation of events as inaccurate and factually incorrect," a spokesperson said in a statement. "The Deputy Attorney General never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references. "
What to know about the 25th Amendment: It's never been used, but ex-FBI head says officials thought about it
McCabe told Pelley in an excerpt of the interview released Thursday that he met with agents looking into Russian election meddling the day after Trump fired Comey to make sure the investigation was on "solid ground" in case he was removed from his position or fired.
He said he wanted to make sure "that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace. I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground and if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision. "
More: Fired FBI official Andrew McCabe kept personal memos regarding Trump
The 25th Amendment, ratified after the assassination of President John Kennedy, outlines the procedures for the vice president to assume office. Section Four of the amendment says that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet can rule "that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. "
McCabe was fired last March by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for "an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions. " Trump called McCabe's firing "a great day for Democracy," but the White House denied any role in his ouster.
McCabe denied the allegations, which have been referred for investigation to the U. S. Attorney’s office in Washington, and blasted his firing as part of the Trump administration’s "war on the FBI. "
Trump responded to the news of McCabe's interview by calling him a "disgrace to the FBI and to our Country" who was trying to pretend to be a "poor little Angel" in a tweet Thursday. He also repeated many of his past criticisms of McCabe, who he says helped start the "Russia hoax" and was biased in favor of Hillary Clinton.
Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that "the writings of a disgraced FBI agent" won't detract from Trump's accomplishments and he said he was unaware of any talk about invoking the 25th Amendment.
"I’ve never heard any discussion of the 25th amendment by members of the government and I would never expect to," Pence told NBC News during an interview from Poland where he is attending a conference on security in the Middle East on security in the Middle East.
McCabe's "60 Minutes" interview precedes the release next week of his book, “The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. "

Russia probe: Mueller hasn't said a word about the Trump investigation. It's possible he never will.
More: Yes, the Mueller investigation is costly. But the millions seized from Manafort have it on track to break even

'It's called the First Amendment': Pundits decry Trump call for 'retribution' against 'SNL'

Texto completo: Many politicians and pundits reacted harshly Sunday after President Donald Trump railed against the media on Twitter sparked by a "Saturday Night Live" sketch that mocked his performance at a Friday White House news conference where declared a national emergency at the U. S. -Mexico border.
"Nothing funny about tired 'Saturday Night Live' on Fake News NBC!" the president tweeted. "Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!"
"THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!" he added minutes later.
A number of Trump's critics quickly fired back at what they saw as an attack on the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech.
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. said, "One thing that makes America great is that the people can laugh at you without retribution. "
'SNL': Trump slaps back after Alec Baldwin mocks his national emergency news conference
Such attacks on the media from the president have "become commonplace enough in the past two years that it no longer gets much notice," New York Times White House correspondent Peter Baker said.
"But it's worth remembering that no other president in decades publicly threatened "retribution" against a television network because it satirized him. "
Some commentators pointed out the violence that has been directed toward members of the news media in recent months, including a man who allegedly assaulted a BBC cameraman at a Trump rally, a man who allegedly mailed pipe bombs to CNN and several Trump critics, the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the fatal shooting of five reporters at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland.

Women on Money &amp; Mindset: Who’s in your personal brain trust?

Texto completo: The term “brain trust” is a term that was used by James Kieran, a New York Times reporter, to describe the group of leaders assembled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his presidential administration. President Roosevelt brought these “brains” together to advise him, decode problems and design new solutions for America.
When you think about it, having your own personal brain trust is a wise thing, no matter what our title or position. Life is complex, and those with whom we surround ourselves can make a difference in the way we look at life, contribute and enjoy the ride.
Who’s in your brain trust? And can the people in it support and challenge you in the following five ways?
Perspective
Living in the 21st century requires complex decision-making, being able to see and understand a problem or challenge from all angles.
Albert Einstein told us that we can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. However, it’s often difficult to step outside oneself to see other angles. Having a brain trust made up of people who come from various industries and backgrounds means you can tap into a vast pool of experience for greater perspective and creative solutions.
President Roosevelt’s brain trust helped him enact 19 laws to meet America’s challenges in just his first 100 days in office. He freely admitted this was due to having an intellectual powerhouse to bring ideas and perspective that he could not bring to the table alone.
Powerful support
It can get lonely as you carry out big responsibilities. Carrying this alone can cause isolation and stress. Unburdening and processing with family members or coworkers often creates greater stress on these relationships and can’t always provide the kind of support you need to meet life and work demands effectively.
It’s important for you to create a safe and powerful support system that is trustworthy, confidential and helpful in processing the complexity of your challenges.
Challenge
If you want to continue to grow so you lead both your life and work solidly into the future, you need input. What are you not seeing that you need to examine? How is not leading at a higher level affecting your life and work?
With great responsibilities, you can operate from “stress mode” as you address the immediate and urgent. This can develop tunnel vision and you will lean on familiar approaches that cannot meet more complex problems. This dynamic will prevent you from solving these problems, and meeting the important goals that will truly make a difference for you and the others around you.
A brain trust will challenge you where you might be playing small with limited thinking or approaches. It will provide that safe space for you to confront where you are holding yourself back and decide how you want to move forward.
Accountability
Change is hard. Growth is hard. Without an accountability mechanism, the biggest goals and commitments are seldom met successfully. As you process and make the necessary decisions to move forward, a brain trust will keep you accountable to yourself and your personal and professional commitments.
And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

Texto completo: The term “brain trust” is a term that was used by James Kieran, a New York Times reporter, to describe the group of leaders assembled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his presidential administration. President Roosevelt brought these “brains” together to advise him, decode problems and design new solutions for America.
When you think about it, having your own personal brain trust is a wise thing, no matter what our title or position. Life is complex, and those with whom we surround ourselves can make a difference in the way we look at life, contribute and enjoy the ride.
Who’s in your brain trust? And can the people in it support and challenge you in the following five ways?
Perspective
Living in the 21st century requires complex decision-making, being able to see and understand a problem or challenge from all angles.
Albert Einstein told us that we can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. However, it’s often difficult to step outside oneself to see other angles. Having a brain trust made up of people who come from various industries and backgrounds means you can tap into a vast pool of experience for greater perspective and creative solutions.
President Roosevelt’s brain trust helped him enact 19 laws to meet America’s challenges in just his first 100 days in office. He freely admitted this was due to having an intellectual powerhouse to bring ideas and perspective that he could not bring to the table alone.
Powerful support
It can get lonely as you carry out big responsibilities. Carrying this alone can cause isolation and stress. Unburdening and processing with family members or coworkers often creates greater stress on these relationships and can’t always provide the kind of support you need to meet life and work demands effectively.
It’s important for you to create a safe and powerful support system that is trustworthy, confidential and helpful in processing the complexity of your challenges.
Challenge
If you want to continue to grow so you lead both your life and work solidly into the future, you need input. What are you not seeing that you need to examine? How is not leading at a higher level affecting your life and work?
With great responsibilities, you can operate from “stress mode” as you address the immediate and urgent. This can develop tunnel vision and you will lean on familiar approaches that cannot meet more complex problems. This dynamic will prevent you from solving these problems, and meeting the important goals that will truly make a difference for you and the others around you.
A brain trust will challenge you where you might be playing small with limited thinking or approaches. It will provide that safe space for you to confront where you are holding yourself back and decide how you want to move forward.
Accountability
Change is hard. Growth is hard. Without an accountability mechanism, the biggest goals and commitments are seldom met successfully. As you process and make the necessary decisions to move forward, a brain trust will keep you accountable to yourself and your personal and professional commitments.
And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

Texto completo: In 1900, the Arts and Crafts movement swept across the country — and right into Asheville's growing neighborhoods of Montford, Kenilworth, West Asheville, Norwood Park, and Grove Park.
Back then young middle-class couples began turning their backs on their parents' ornate Victorian homes and plush velvet furniture, preferring instead to buy a modest bungalow and fill it with practical Mission oak furniture. The new Arts and Crafts style took root in Asheville and continues to flourish, evidenced today by strong interest in those original bungalows, as well as in new bungalows being built for both young couples and retirees looking to downsize.
"Historic examples of bungalows were built in emerging residential neighborhoods and have continued to be well-loved and sensitively adapted by families ever since," said As Asheville architect Jane Mathews. "And many who have come to the mountains in recent years ask us to recreate new homes for their families. They want homes that embrace the character, charm, and livability of the many historic homes that established the mountain aesthetic standard of quality and comfort through the Arts and Crafts style."
About a quarter of the homes sold in the Asheville area last year were such bungalows, said Asheville Realtor Brad Puffer at Keller Williams Professionals.
"This style has seen a resurgence over the last 20 years as Asheville has grown in popularity and population," he said. "Custom home builders and spec builders alike recognize this architectural style as the distinctive style most characteristic of the area. Today, most new construction homes in Asheville have some Arts and Crafts influence in their design."
The opening of the Grove Park Inn in 1913 helped label Asheville as the Arts and Crafts capital of the South, a title which it proudly bears today. Each February for 32 years, the iconic resort hotel has hosted the National Arts and Crafts Conference and Shows, drawing more than 2,000 people from across the country and WNC to the three-day event. This year's is Feb. 15-17.
"Once area people began to recognize our architectural ties to the Arts and Crafts movement," conference director Bruce Johnson explained, "they began flocking to the afternoon selling shows, looking for handmade reproductions and original antiques for their homes."
"The shows each afternoon are the highlight of the weekend," Johnson continued. "We bring in more than 100 of the country's finest artisans and antiques dealers, all of whom are exhibiting works made during or influenced by the Arts and Crafts style. Here people will find both new and vintage Arts and Crafts style furniture, art pottery, tiles, textiles, lighting, jewelry, rugs, and artwork. In nearly every case they will be speaking with the actual craftsperson who handcrafted the piece."
A growing number of area artisans exhibit in the Arts and Crafts shows, including furniture maker Brian Brace, cabinetmaker Gregory Paolini, jeweler Amy Brandenburg, potters Julie Calhoun Roepnack, Hog Hill Pottery, and Clark House Pottery, interior designer Karen Hovde, and Grovewood Village.
Details on the Arts and Crafts Conference The shows, which are open to the public, take place from 1-6 p.m. Friday, noon-6 p.m. Saturday, and 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $10 for adults and $5 for students, and tickets are good for all three days. Outdoor parking at the Omni Grove Park Inn is free. Indoor garage parking is free for the first three hours. For more information, please go to Arts-CraftsConference.com.
The National Arts and Crafts Conference also serves as a major fundraiser for two area nonprofit organizations. The Preservation Society of Asheville and Buncombe County will again be offering historic house tours on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Like the conference shows, these are also open to the public, as space permits. For information and availability, please go to www.psabc.org.
The Asheville Art Museum will host a Saturday evening reception and presentation entitled "Women and American Art Pottery." It, too, is available to the public. For additional information, please go to ashevilleart.org.
"Thirty years ago, "Johnson recalled, "the New York Times called this 'the most important weekend of the year for Arts and Crafts collectors.' But you don't have to be a collector to enjoy this once-a-year experience. If you appreciate hand-craftsmanship in the popular Arts and Crafts style, this is an afternoon show you will never forget."
Over 100 vendors will be at the National Arts and Crafts Conference at the Grove Park Inn in Asheville this weekend.

To reduce money in politics, slash the size of government

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Like a terrifying demon that returns during the final scene of a horror movie, campaign-finance reform is the “thing” that never goes away. The United States Supreme Court sometimes saves the day, as it did with the First Amendment-related Citizens United case in 2010. Yet reformers always have a new scheme to take “the money out of politics,” even though their last schemes always resulted in more cash influencing political campaigns.
The campaign-finance scaremongers are back with a symbolic bill that is a political poke-in-the-eye to the sleazy-seeming Trump administration. It could never pass the Senate or gain a presidential signature, but it makes a point. Now that they have a majority in the House, Democrats are pushing HR1, which Vox describes as a “sweeping anti-corruption measures aimed at stamping out the influence of money in politics and expanding voting rights.”
The voting-rights goal is doable because Congress has the power to loosen federal standards for voting. But only a delusional person would believe that lawmakers have the power to “stamp out” money in politics any more than they have the power to “stamp out” sexually transmitted diseases. Desire often outstrips good sense, which is why STDs and political spending are at record highs. People will work around any new hurdles placed in their way.
The problem — at least with political spending — is government, not rich people. Both political sides rail about the role of billionaires in our political system. The left fulminates about the Koch Brothers and right-wing “dark money” groups, whereas the right pounds the table about George Soros and left-leaning tech firms. However, a close look at lobbying spending in California offers some much-needed lessons on this hot-button topic.
The Sacramento Bee recently published an analysis of spending on government lobbying and found that it rose again last year. The total was $361 million, up 5 percent since 2017. It is far above the approximately $200 million spent on lobbying in 2002. One can easily conclude from these numbers — and from watching lobbyists swarm the Capitol — that something untoward is going on.
Nevertheless, those numbers need a little more perspective. The total 2017-2018 California state budget was $183.3 billion. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget proposal would spend $209.1 billion. In 2002-2003, the total state budget was $97.9 billion. Lobbying spending has gone up, but only in tandem with growth in state government spending. Lobbying dollars are small potatoes when you consider the total, well, potato pie.
Sure, stories are legion about legislators who won’t consider any proposal until they run it by the requisite lobbyist. Union leaders strut around the Capitol as if they own the place, because they pretty much do own the place. Lobbyists and trade groups of all type — unions, industry and activist groups — routinely write the language that becomes state law. Welcome to the real world. No finance reform can ever take the politics out of the political system.
Again, the problem is the size of government. Writing in National Review, Bradley Smith notes that Democratic lawmakers have proposed a Green New Deal “that would essentially abolish the aviation, auto, energy and mining industries, among others. Why is it illegitimate for shareholders and employees in those industries to voice their opinions on regulatory schemes that would leave them bankrupt and unemployed?” Good question.
Take a closer look at that California lobbying report. The top spender was Pacific Gas & Electric, which is a regulated monopoly utility whose continued existence could be dependent on how the Legislature decides to handle wildfire-related liabilities. The Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group that represents the highly regulated oil and gas businesses, is next on the list. Then there’s another regulated utility, Edison International, and the California State Council of Service Employees, which is a powerful labor union.
Reality check: Those groups whose existence is most dependent on the government are going to spend oodles on lobbying that government. Look at the lobbying categories, per the Bee. The biggest spender is government — mainly local governments influencing state government. Next is healthcare, which is a government-dependent industry. Then come utilities, which are government-granted monopolies. Also high on the list are insurance companies, where government has power to set rates, as well as manufacturers, education and labor unions.
Finance reformers are frustrated by the courts, but there’s that thing called the First Amendment. Spending is not speech per se. However, columnist George Will asked if The New York Times would be OK if it were free to write what it wanted, but if the government controlled “the amount it can spend on journalists, paper, ink, printing presses, delivery trucks, advertisements and so on.” You get the point.
Maybe we can all embrace a reform idea that would actually work: reducing the size and power of government. Sadly, that is the one idea that will frighten the kind of politicians and activists who support campaign-finance reform.

FBI official feared Russia probe would end after Comey fired

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) - Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in an interview that aired Thursday that he moved quickly after his boss was fired to protect an investigation into President Donald Trump's potential ties to Russia and prevent it from being shut down in case he, too, was dismissed.
Concerned when Trump fired FBI Director James Comey not long after taking office, McCabe also said Justice Department officials had discussed bringing the Cabinet together to consider using the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, according to CBS News, which conducted the interview and will air it in full Sunday on "60 Minutes."
CBS described McCabe's comments on the 25th Amendment in a news story about its interview but did not release excerpts from that part.
The Justice Department did not deny those discussions took place but said in a statement that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein does not believe there is a basis for invoking the 25th Amendment, which enables Cabinet members to seek a president's ouster if they believe he or she is unfit for office.
McCabe's interview comes ahead of the release next week of his memoir, "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump."
The book and the publicity around it are likely to refocus attention on the tumultuous eight-day period between Trump's firing of Comey and Rosenstein's appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The situation strained relations between FBI and Justice Department leaders, with McCabe - who was elevated to acting FBI director upon Comey's firing - becoming suspicious of Rosenstein, and Rosenstein removing McCabe from the Russia investigation.
McCabe, a frequent target of Trump's ire, was fired from the FBI last year after the Justice Department inspector general concluded he had lied during an internal investigation into a news media disclosure. The allegations, which McCabe has denied, have been referred for investigation to the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington.
Trump responded on Twitter to news reports of the new interview, saying: "Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a 'poor little Angel' when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal & the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakin' James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating."
The White House said in a statement that McCabe had been fired in "disgrace from the FBI because he lied to investigators on multiple occasions, including under oath" and that he had no credibility.
Asked in the CBS interview when he had opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's connections to Russia, and a criminal investigation into whether the president had sought to obstruct justice, McCabe said he acted almost immediately after Comey's firing and after discussing the firing with Trump himself.
Alarmed that Trump "might have won the White House with the aid of the government of Russia," he assembled his investigators the following day to discuss the investigations surrounding Trump and how to keep them moving forward in the event he was fired or reassigned.
"I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground, in an indelible fashion," McCabe said. "That were I removed quickly, or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace."
McCabe added, "I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground and if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision."
In a book excerpt obtained by The Atlantic, McCabe said the meeting with investigators was one in a series he held about protecting and preserving the probes.
He asked the team to say where they were on investigations that already were open into Trump associates - which, at the time, included former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort - and whether there was a need to open additional cases.
McCabe recounts in his book how his meeting with Russia-team investigators one day after Comey's firing was interrupted by a phone call from Trump, who gloated about his decision to dismiss the FBI director.
"I received hundreds of messages from FBI people-how happy they are that I fired him. There are people saying things on the media, have you seen that? What's it like there in the building?" McCabe quotes the president as saying.
McCabe writes that he didn't tell the president how sad FBI employees were, saying instead that people were surprised but trying to get back to work.
According to the CBS report, McCabe confirmed meetings at the Justice Department in the days after Comey was fired in which officials discussed potentially invoking the 25th Amendment to seek the president's removal.
CBS said McCabe also confirmed a report first published by The New York Times that Rosenstein had suggested wearing a wire to record conversations with the president.
McCabe told CBS that he took the comment seriously. The Justice Department has previously issued a statement from another official in the room who said he interpreted Rosenstein's remark as sarcastic.
The Justice Department issued a new statement Thursday asserting that Rosenstein "never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references."
"As the Deputy Attorney General previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was (Rosenstein) in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment," the statement says.
It also notes that Rosenstein removed McCabe from the chain of command and instead appointed Mueller as special counsel.

Newark beckons as Amazon cancels HQ2 plans

Texto completo: Amazon on Thursday said it was canceling its plans to build a corporate campus in New York City.
Although Amazon said it would not reopen its search for a second home, the company did say it plans to expand its tech hubs and corporate locations across the United States — meaning that some cities could still benefit from the tech giant's backing out of New York City. Those plans, however, may exclude Newark, which does not have an Amazon tech hub, even though Audible, an Amazon company, has its headquarters there.
"After much thought and deliberation, we've decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens," the company said in a statement. "For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term."
The company said it would not reopen the HQ2 search at this time but will proceed with its plans in Northern Virginia and Nashville. The company announced in November that it would split its proposed HQ2 between New York City and Northern Virginia. The company had previously announced it would open a new Operations Center of Excellence in downtown Nashville.
Amazon said it would also continue to hire and grow across its 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the United States and Canada
The company's tech hubs in North America outside Seattle employ more than 17,500 corporate employees, as opposed to warehouse and fulfillment staff. As of August, that number was anticipated to rise to 26,200 by 2023. With the change of plans for its HQ2, the growth of these tech hubs could mean more jobs in cities where Amazon already is.
In Newark, the company has a significant presence with its Audible headquarters. However, it is not one of the 17 cities with an Amazon tech hub.
Regardless of Amazon's decision not to reopen its HQ2 search, state and city officials said they are staying in contact with the tech giant, to be prepared should company officials change their minds. Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday that he contacted Amazon and Newark officials directly after he learned that the company had pulled out of New York City.
"After learning of the decision to pull out of their chosen HQ2 location, I contacted Amazon and city of Newark stakeholders directly, continuing a constant dialogue that predates my time as governor," Murphy said in a statement. "New Jersey is open for business, and now more than ever, Newark is the clear choice as the next presence for Amazon corporate offices. Amazon now has the opportunity to join in Newark's story of a city on the rise."
Mayor Ras Baraka on Thursday also said he welcomed the opportunity to resume conversations with Amazon should it want to relocate a portion of its proposed HQ2 campus to Newark.
"Given the city and state's assets — a strong talent pipeline, a diverse tech base, unmatched infrastructure and a highly accessible location — we are well poised to accommodate Amazon should they want to relocate New York City's portion of HQ2, in whole or part," Baraka said. "Legislation regarding the tax incentives has already been passed, our real estate options are still viable, and the community has been — and will continue to be — engaged."
After a flurry of contradicting reports published late last week, officials from near and far have come forward to remind the tech giant that if New York City doesn't want Amazon, there are plenty of places that do. It seems their outreach did not fall on deaf ears.
In New Jersey, where Newark was named a finalist in the year-long bidding process for Amazon's second headquarters, elected officials and city leaders reportedly have kept in touch with the company in hopes of keeping the campus near, if not in, New Jersey.
Earlier this week, Murphy made the most public case for New Jersey at a press conference for an unrelated event in Avenel in Middlesex County, where Amazon has fulfillment centers.
"Nothing's changed on the Newark story. I think it's one of the most inspiring, compelling urban stories in America, and it continues to be, and with each day the story gets stronger and better," Murphy said Monday. "So we remind everybody — Amazon, right through the entire alphabet — Newark and New Jersey are open for business. Period. Full stop."
State officials continue to work closely with Amazon because of the thousands of people the company already employs in New Jersey, Murphy added.
City leaders in Newark, too, have reportedly kept in close contact with Amazon. Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Alliance, which led negotiations with Amazon during the city's bidding process, told Fortune that she renewed talks with the tech giant six weeks ago.
"Our goal is to make sure we keep it in the region," Glover told the magazine. "We have reached out to express that our incentives on the state and city side have been passed, so there's more opportunity for them to be welcomed with ease."
Last year, former Gov. Chris Christie endorsed Newark's initial application and pledged as much as $7 billion in tax incentives, including $5 billion in state tax relief over a decade and $1 billion each in breaks on property taxes and income taxes from Newark. It would have been the largest tax incentive ever offered by New Jersey.
Glover did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
In November, Amazon announced that it would split its proposed HQ2, or its second headquarters in the United States, between New York City and Northern Virginia. The campus was expected to bring as many as 25,000 jobs to each campus.
Although Newark ultimately did not win the bid, it was chosen as one of 20 finalist cities out of hundreds. That was considered a win for New Jersey's most populous city.
Since Amazon announced that it would be heading to Long Island City in Queens, there has been push-back from politicians, residents and businesses.
On Friday, those tensions rose to an all-time high after The Washington Post published an article citing two people familiar with the company's thinking who said the company was having second thoughts about New York City.
Until Thursday, Amazon had not commented about those claims beyond a statement it gave to The Washington Post last week. In an email on Tuesday, a company spokesperson forwarded what appeared to be the same statement given to the Post, and declined to give further comment.
"We're focused on engaging with our new neighbors — small-business owners, educators, and community leaders," the spokesperson wrote. "Whether it's building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be."
Since the Post's story on Friday, conflicting reports have surfaced that implied Amazon would still move forward with its plans in New York City.
The same day of the bombshell report, The New York Times, also citing two people familiar with the company's thinking, reported that Amazon had no plans to back out. Sources told the Times that the story by the Post had gone too far.
The news that Amazon would be backing out of New York City came as a shock. As recently as Tuesday, officials were convinced that Amazon was still set on its HQ2 proposal in Queens.
On Tuesday, Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, told Bloomberg that Amazon's plans in New York City were still a go.
"Everybody that is involved on the ground here is all steam ahead," Lusskin told Bloomberg. "I have no direct indication that there's any change in that decision."
Although it remains unclear what exactly the tech giant will do in coming weeks, now that plans for New York City have fallen through, there are plenty of states ready to be Amazon's rebound.
Over the past several days, New Jersey and leaders in at least four other states have reportedly expressed their renewed interest in Amazon's HQ2, including Texas, Illinois, Connecticut and Florida. Even leaders in upstate New York have pitched themselves as an alternative to their own New York City.

Texto completo: "This Is Us" star Mandy Moore has no regrets about speaking out against her ex-husband Ryan Adams. On Wednesday, The New York Times released an article in which she and six other women accused the 44-year-old singer of emotional abuse and sexual misconduct.
"Speaking your truth can be painful and triggering but it's always worth it," Moore, 34, captioned an Instagram photo of herself on Thursday. "My heart is with all women who have suffered any sort of trauma or abuse. You are seen and heard. #sisterhoodforever"
Celebrities posted their support for Moore on social media. "I am so proud of the graceful, class act that you are, @TheMandyMoore. You are stronger and braver than most," actress Minka Kelly tweeted. "What a joy it has been to watch you soar these past three years. You've only just begun."
Actress Alyssa Milano also expressed her gratitude to Moore and the other women for speaking out about Adams. "Thank you to these women for being brave and holding him accountable for his abuses of power," Milano wrote.
"I know a few women who have dated this man and these claims are definitely true," tweeted actress Amber Tamblyn. "I believe Mandy Moore and the women who put their necks and careers on the line to tell their stories. We've got your backs. #TimesUp"
According to The Associated Press, in the story published Wednesday, a 20-year-old female musician said Adams had inappropriate conversations with her while she was 15 and 16. Identified by her middle name, Ava, she said that Adams exposed himself during a video call.
On Thursday, another woman came forward to accuse Adams. Model-musician Karen Elson, 40, wrote on her Instagram account "I also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams. While I'm not quite brave enough yet to speak about my specifics. I'm encouraged that many women have bonded and helped each other heal. This is the power of sisterhood and I'm very grateful for these women."Elson, a singer-songwriter in her own right, was married to rocker Jack White from 2005 to 2013 and shares two children with the former White Stripes frontman.
In the Times piece, Moore said that during their marriage from 2009 to 2016, Adams was psychologically abusive and stalled her music career, even telling her " 'You're not a real musician, because you don't play an instrument.' " Six other women also accused Adams of inappropriate behavior, including a 20-year-old female musician who alleged the singer had inappropriate conversations with her when she was a teenager.
Following the release of the article, Adams posted a series of tweets apologizing for his past "mistakes" while also disputing the Times story. "I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes," he tweeted. "To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly. ... But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright f

Texto completo: Dr. John Gunderson was training in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in the late-1960s when he encountered a “group of patients that didn't have a diagnosis, but which drove everybody crazy," he recalled in an interview that is posted on YouTube.
“For the most part, they were given psychotherapies from which they got worse," he added in the interview with Sigmund Karterud. It was a time when the term “atypical schizophrenia" was “on the margins, Dr. Gunderson said.
A few years later, while at the National Institute of Mental Health, “I had this opportunity, being a schizophrenia fellow, to try to identify who the people with atypical schizophrenia were," he said. “And that involved a literature review, called 'Defining Borderline Patients,' published in 1975."
Beginning with that work, Dr. Gunderson's studies of people with suicidal urges, fears of abandonment, and squalls of emotion helped establish borderline personality disorder as a stand-alone diagnosis, which provided a foundation for research and the first effective treatments. He was 76 when he died Jan. 11 in his Weston home of prostate cancer.
Trained in Freudian analysis, he was evaluating the effects of psychotherapy on people identified as schizophrenic in the early 1970s when he discovered that many participants in his study had received the wrong diagnosis. They did not have recurring psychoses, the signature symptom of schizophrenia, but rather a poorly understood syndrome described by the German-American psychoanalyst Adolph Stern in 1938: Their mental state was on the “border" between garden-variety neurosis and full-blown psychosis.
Studying the literature on borderline patients, Dr. Gunderson distilled defining features such as intense fears of being alone, floods of emotional turmoil, and impulsive self-harming, like cutting. While working at McLean Hospital in Belmont, He collaborated with Margaret T. Singer on the influential 1975 paper, “Defining Borderline Patients: An Overview," which turned a collection of descriptive accounts into a firm diagnosis. He also developed a diagnostic interview that set the standard for identifying the disorder, bringing focus to what had been a baffling condition.
“The way these patients were described before was as treatment failures, as if it was somehow their fault," Dr. Lois Choi-Kain, director of the Adult Borderline Center and Training Institute at McLean, told The New York Times. “John came along and said no, these are symptoms of the disorder, not failures."
The 1975 paper and others provided a foundation for research into borderline disorder that had not previously existed, clearing the way for its inclusion as a full stand-alone diagnosis in the landmark third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychiatry's encyclopedia of mental disorders, published in 1980.
Dr. Gunderson was recruited in 1973 to work at McLean and spent much of his career at the Belmont hospital. In 1996, he published another analysis, “The Borderline Patient's Intolerance of Aloneness: Insecure Attachments and Therapist Availability," which provided doctors and patients with an X-ray of the condition's internal emotional terrain.
“Being alone is often intolerable to them because it is associated with a profound sense of being bad or evil," he wrote, “a self-image distortion accompanied by such intense feelings of guilt or shame that the question of worthiness to live often follows."
Over the years, Dr. Gunderson was adamant that psychiatric drugs did not help resolve borderline symptoms. He favored talk therapies, including what is known as dialectical behavior therapy, an approach developed by the University of Washington psychologist Marsha Linehan.
He also published, with Dr. Paul Links, a handbook describing what he called good psychiatric management, intended for nonspecialists, patients, and families dealing with the storms of rage and self-loathing of borderline personality. This guide became widely used by doctors.
Dr. Gunderson's long commitment to people with borderline personality disorder had a hopeful payoff. He collaborated on a long-term study, led by Mary C. Zanarini, a Harvard Medical School psychology professor who is director of McLean's Laboratory for the Study of Adult Development. Their research found that most people given a diagnosis of borderline personality eventually recover: some 15 percent in the first year, a third by two years, fully 85 percent after a decade.
“He was the first person to look systematically at the data and figure out what the heck this diagnosis really meant," Dr. Glen Gabbard, a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, told the Times. “Before John, there were observations, case studies, confusion; after John, we had clarity."
In a long essay reflecting on his career, Dr. Gunderson returned repeatedly to the intensely personal, often uncertain craft that drew him to psychiatry in the first place.
“My life in psychiatry has provided me with access to people's deepest feelings, their most private secrets, and to the responsibilities of being entrusted by such access," he concluded. “At these times you are like a priest, parent, or best friend as much as a doctor."
John Gunder Gunderson was born in Two Rivers, Wis., the youngest of three children. His father, Sherman, was a professor of economics, and his mother, Alma Walter, was a high school English teacher. He grew up in Oshkosh and graduated from high school in 1960.
Determined to become a doctor, he entered Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where he found that everyone else seemed to be pre-med, too, and appeared better prepared. He stuck it out, earning his way into a two-year Dartmouth Medical School program that fed Harvard's medical school, where he finished his degree in 1967.
In 1963, while at Dartmouth, he met Susan Riley, a Skidmore College student, on a blind date. They married in 1965. In addition to his wife, Dr. Gunderson leaves two children, Craig and Kelly, and five grandchildren.
After completing an internship in Minneapolis, Dr. Gunderson did his residency at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston and received training as an analyst at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute. He joined Harvard Medical School in 1973 and retired last year as professor emeritus, seeing patients throughout his tenure there.
In the interview with Karterud, Dr. Gunderson said treating borderline patients “required that I listen to things which I would not have heard or would not have wanted to hear. And like the Grinch, my heart grew a bit larger because of this."
His interest in and understanding of such challenging patients “changed as a result of my work," he said, adding: “I can't say for sure, but I think that it's made me a more benevolent person."

'Queen of Art Scene' Gets Prison Term for Tax Fraud

Texto completo: Mary Boone, a veteran New York gallerist once lauded as the "Queen of the Art Scene," pleaded for leniency Thursday. But a federal judge sentenced her to two and a half years in prison for offenses connected to a tax fraud that prosecutors said had cost the government $3 million in revenue.
"I stand before you today saddened, humbled and heartbroken," Ms. Boone told Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in Federal District Court in Manhattan, adding, "I beg that you give me a second chance."
But after a brief recess, Judge Hellerstein delivered his sentence, asserting that the magnitude of her crimes and their "long and studied nature" required a prison term.
"This is a serious offense; all must pay their taxes," he said.
Ms. Boone, wearing a dark blue suit, leaned forward at the pronouncement, resting her face in her hands. She was ordered to surrender in May to begin serving her sentence.
For more than 40 years Ms. Boone, 67, has been a fixture in the ever-changing art world, rising from secretary to gallery owner, showing the work of artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, sometimes courting controversy and occasionally becoming embroiled in high-profile disputes. She is one of the most prominent art world figures to face prison since 2002, when the former chairman of Sotheby's, A. Alfred Taubman, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $7.5 million for leading a price-fixing scheme with Christie's that swindled customers out of more than $100 million.
Prosecutors with the United States attorney's office had asked that Ms. Boone be sentenced to as much as three years in prison for the crimes she had pleaded guilty to -- two counts of filing false tax returns. They said Ms. Boone had reported false business losses, used business funds to pay for more than $1.6 million in personal expenses, like renovations to her home, and then falsely claimed those personal expenses as business deductions.
But her lawyers had asked for a sentence of home confinement, probation and community service. They also submitted more than 100 letters attesting to her good works from friends, artists and collectors including the Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei, whom she once represented.
Ms. Boone was born in Erie, Penn. and had a childhood that her lawyers described as "marked by tragedy and poverty." Her father died at an early age, they said, and her mother struggled daily to survive. But after opening her own gallery in 1977 in SoHo, she quickly gained attention while selling works by Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, David Salle and Ross Bleckner. In 1982, when she was 30, New York magazine published a story about her titled, "The New Queen of the Art Scene."
Her gallery was considered by many to be at, or near, the white hot center of the '80s art boom. The works she displayed there, the critic Roberta Smith wrote in The New York Times, were "seen as slanting heavily toward an overtly macho form of Neo-Expressionist painting."
Ms. Boone moved her gallery from SoHo to Midtown in 1996 and later opened a space in Chelsea. She continued to exhibit the work of younger painters and organize shows that drew positive reviews.
She also continued to be cited in headlines. In 1999, Ms. Boone was arrested after displaying a handmade shotgun by the artist Tom Sachs and offering live 9-millimeter cartridges as souvenirs. She spent a night in jail, and told reporters her arrest was "an outrageous attack" on artists' rights. The charges against her were eventually dropped.
In 2016, the actor Alec Baldwin sued Ms. Boone, saying she had defrauded him by promising him one painting by Mr. Bleckner, but then providing another, similar Bleckner painting with the same name. Mr. Baldwin's case was eventually settled with Ms. Boone paying him what was described only as "a seven-figure sum."
In the tax case, Ms. Boone was charged with filing false returns for herself and her gallery for the year 2011. Federal authorities said that she had engaged in similar schemes the two previous years.
Ms. Boone's lawyers had argued against prison time, writing to the court that her troubled childhood led to mental health issues, a suicide attempt and drug and alcohol abuse. The poverty of her early life, they said, had left her fearful that, despite her success, she would end up destitute and dependent upon others.
In court Thursday, one of Ms. Boone's lawyers, Robert Fink, told the judge that she committed her crimes "not because she was greedy, but because she was frightened."
But Judge Hellerstein seemed skeptical, at one point asking how it would be fair for him to sentence someone to prison for narcotics while allowing Ms. Boone to remain free.
Prosecutors had argued in a memo to the court last month that Ms. Boone did not deserve leniency. They cited the many personal expenses Ms. Boone had falsely claimed as business deductions, including $793,003 used to remodel her Manhattan apartment, beauty salon purchases of $24,380, nearly $14,000 on products from Hermès and more than $5,000 on items from Louis Vuitton.
On Thursday one of the prosecutors, Olga Zverovich, told Judge Hellerstein that there was no excuse for Ms. Boone's conduct, adding, "It's brazen, it's deliberate, it's extensive and it's clear that it was motivated by greed."
It is now unclear what will happen to the gallery business. Her lawyers had told the judge that Ms. Boone's presence was "indispensable" to the business and to "the numerous employees, artists, vendors and others that it supports."

Texto completo: Ryan Morgan is a 17-year-old student from Wisconsin who likes grouse hunting, hanging out with his girlfriend and playing Madden NFL on his Xbox. He appears to be ordinary in a lot of ways - or presumably, editors at Esquire magazine perceived him that way, which is why they put him on their most recent cover with an all-caps headline: "An American Boy."
The story promised to unpack "what it's like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country."
Some people weren't having it. "Happy Black History Month, everybody," news anchor Soledad O'Brien tweeted sardonically Tuesday. "We do not need more features about how tough it is to grow up male and Caucasian," read another response. "We need more coverage of how tough it is to navigate the patriarchy." The author of the Esquire piece defended the story to CBS, saying that she hadn't approved the cover line and found it misleading. Hot takes abounded, and different commenters claimed the backlash proved the original story was necessary. In short, it was America in 2019.
Certainly, Morgan doesn't represent all white men. Part of the blowback occurred because he represented a specific male who, born of media desire to understand red-state voters, already gets a lot of coverage: a conservative-leaning Heartlander grappling with a changing order - one who's heard of #MeToo but worries about its impact. Morgan discussed how he sometimes felt persecuted because he likes President Trump, and he felt silenced as a male. Editors displayed one of his quotes on the cover: "I know what I can't do, I just don't know what I can do."
The other reason there was consternation, I expect, wasn't about Morgan at all, but about a broader question we're culturally grappling with. How should we talk about white men today?
We talk about them all the time, in the sense that Donald Trump, Robert Mueller, Elon Musk, a dozen televised Bachelors and movie-star Chrises (Pratt/Evans/Pine/Hemsworth) are all white men in regular conversational rotation. But, how do we talk about them like an anthropologist would? Recognize them without lionizing them, analyze them without demonizing them - how do we tell their stories while remembering that their stories, as a group, were often the sole narrative, told at the expense of others'?
Esquire's editor, Jay Fielden, explained that the piece would be part of a series, one that would feature teenagers of various backgrounds: "white, black, LGBTQ, female." The story about Ryan Morgan could turn out to be one piece of an illuminating whole.
But it's still noteworthy, I think, that editors chose to begin their series with him. Not only because February is Black History Month, but because the choice reinforces the idea that being white and male is the standard version of being human. That other versions, with other bells and whistles, would be released in the coming months - but if you were looking for the classic floor model of a person, a straight white man is who you'd get.
The evening I first started to read about the Esquire controversy I saw another headline, about presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). She'd just done a radio interview where she was invited, as she often is, to discuss her relationship with race and gender. The hosts asked her to respond to people questioning "the legitimacy of your blackness."
Harris isn't alone. It's rare to find an interview with a woman or a person of color where they're not asked specifically about being a woman or a person of color. "Kirsten Gillibrand's unabashedly feminist campaign," read a Tuesday New York Times headline about the New York senator and likely presidential candidate, which went on to discuss Gillibrand's "woman plus" platform.
Women are asked to talk about their identities because we recognize that those identies matter - that women's accomplishments, struggles and worldviews are all related, in some way, to the lives they'd lived and the bodies in which they'd lived them.
We haven't requested the same introspection from white men. They haven't been asked to talk specifically about how being male impacted their worldviews; they haven't been asked how being white has shaped their opinions on policy. You don't ask the floor model what it thinks of being a floor model, you just wait for, I dunno, the new self-parking feature to come out so you can use the original floor model as a standard for comparison.
I thought of Kamala Harris, and then I thought of Ryan Morgan.
It's time - it's beyond time - that we figure out ways to talk thoughtfully about what it means to be a white man. The problem isn't that Esquire wrote a story about Morgan; the problem is that it presented the story using a rapidly outdated way of thinking: that white men are the default model. That the #MeToo movement can be seen as a metaphorical assault on white male identity rather than women's attempt to avoid being literally assaulted.
I'm actually deeply interested in "what it's like," to use Esquire's language, to be a young white man. But to do that, we need to ask them questions like we ask Kamala Harris, or Kirsten Gillibrand, or Ben Carson, or other nonwhite or female Hollywood producers or CEOs. Not, How is your life difficult right now , but How do you think your life has been shaped by the identity into which you were born?

Texto completo: Apple and Google are facing criticism for offering an app that lets men in Saudi Arabia track and control the movement of women.
The app, called Absher, is listed in Apple's app store and the Google Play store as a Kingdom of Saudi Arabia eServices Mobile Application that lets you "safely browse your profile or your family members, or labors working for you, and perform a wide range of eServices online. "
Men can use the app to get texts telling them about the movements of their wives and daughters, aspects that have led critics to call for Apple and Google to shut down the apps.
"Saudi men can also reportedly use Absher to receive real-time text message alerts every time these women enter or leave the country or to prevent these women from leaving the country," wrote Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, in a letter sent to both companies this week. The Washington Post first wrote about Wyden's letter on Tuesday.
Online harassment: More than half of Americans say they’ve experienced hate online
Artificial intelligence: Can AI prevent the next Parkland shooting?
Earlier this month, the news site Insider wrote about a Saudi woman's escape from her father and family while on vacation in Turkey. She stole the family's smartphones because the Absher app, which was loaded on them, could allow them to track her.
Saudi guardianship rules require women to get permission from a male guardian to travel or do other daily activities.
The app, created by the National Information Center within the Saudi Ministry of Interior, lets men specify where women can go and how long women can travel and get alerts when movements go beyond that.
Apple CEO Tim Cook told NPR on Monday that he would investigate the situation. "I haven't heard about it," he said. "But obviously we'll take a look at it if that's the case. "
A Google spokesman told The New York Times Wednesday that the company is assessing Absher to determine if it is complies with its policies.
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment on the issue.
The Absher app handles some standard government functions such as paying fines, according to Insider. But it also tracks women in Saudi Arabia and has a messaging feature that texts men when a woman uses a passport or checks in at an airport.
"It's really designed with the men in mind," Human Rights Watch researcher Rothna Begum told NPR. "Of course, it's incredibly demeaning, insulting and humiliating for the women and downright abusive in many cases, because you're allowing men absolute control over women's movements. "
Amnesty International has also condemned the app. “We call on Apple and Google to assess the risk of human rights abuses on women, which is facilitated by the App, and mitigate the harm that the App has on women,” the group said in a statement to the Post. “The use of the Absher app to curtail the movement of women once again highlights the disturbing system of discrimination against women under the guardianship system and the need for genuine human rights reforms in the country, rather than just social and economic reforms. ”

Texto completo: It’s been described as a “high-tech version of hell" and it holds some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals – including, maybe soon, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
The federal government’s ADX "Supermax" prison in Florence, Colorado, is “the prison of all prisons,” said Louisiana State Penitentiary maximum-security warden Burl Cain.
It makes sense that a drug lord who's already escaped two high-security Mexican prisons would be sent there. In 2001, Guzman bribed his way out of prison in a laundry basket. In 2015, he escaped out of another penitentiary in a movie-style jailbreak: crawling into a hatch beneath his shower and hopping on a waiting motorcycle through a tunnel dug underground.
Federal authorities haven't confirmed exactly where Guzman will be held, but U. S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said Thursday that Guzman faces "a sentence from which there is no escape and no return. "
Here's what you should about his possible new home:
How secure is it?
The prison, also called the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," is surrounded by razor-wire fences, gun towers, heavily-armed patrols and attack dogs. Snipers guard the grounds in gun towers. No inmate has ever escaped the prison.
More: 'El Chapo' escaped from two prisons. This time, he’s probably headed to the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies'
What's a prisoner's day like?
Inmates spend about 23 hours of every day in solitary confinement inside a 12-by-7-foot cell made of concrete with a small window. The room is designed so that inmates cannot have contact with others or much of the outside world.
"You're designing it so the inmates can't see the sky. Intentionally," former Supermax prison warden Robert Hood told CNN. "You're putting up wires so helicopters can't land. "
Each cell contains a toilet, shower and bed (a concrete slab with a thin mattress). Meals are slid through openings in the doors.
“This place is not designed for humanity . . . It’s not designed for rehabilitation," Hood told The New York Times.
An hour of outdoor time for inmates placed in restraints is allowed some days inside a cage slightly larger than the cells. Travis Dusenbury, who spent 10 years locked up in the prison, told Vice that that was the only contact he had with people, if his neighbor's schedule lined up with his.
"The closest human contact you could get was what we called 'finger handshakes' through the fence," Dusenbury said.
Notorious criminals who are there
Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, who is serving a life sentence for a series of mostly mail bombs that killed three people and injured 23 others over 17 years.
Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces a death sentence after setting off bombs near Boston Marathon's finish line in 2013, where three people died and more than 250 people were injured. He has been convicted of 30 charges, including conspiracy and use of a weapon of mass destruction.
Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui is serving a life sentence for conspiring with hijackers to kill Americans.
Shoe bomber Richard Reid, who is serving a life sentence for charges including use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder of aircraft passengers and attempted homicide of U. S. nationals overseas.
Oklahoma City bombing accomplice Terry Nichols is serving a life sentence for planting a bomb that killed 168 people in an Oklahoma City federal building.
Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph, who is serving life sentences for a series of bombings including one at the 1996 Olympic Summer Games in Atlanta that killed two people and injured more than 100.

Ta-Nehisi Coates Picks Cover Art for Novel

Texto completo: Ta-Nehisi Coates's first novel, "The Water Dancer," will be published in September by One World, an imprint of Random House, and now, it has a cover. The image, painted by the artist Calida Garcia Rawles, depicts a black man submerged in water, a reflection of both a plot point in the book as well as Rawles' previous work, in which she said she's combined the "meditative" quality of water to reckon with black trauma.
In late 2017, during a visit to Rawles's studio in Los Angeles, Coates saw some of her recent work: photo-like paintings of black women, men and children floating or swimming in a pool. He had not yet finished his novel, but he knew it would deal with water as a central theme, so he asked Rawles -- somewhat shyly, in her telling -- whether she might be interested in trying her hand at the cover art.
Book covers are typically created by in-house designers, but Coates said he wanted Rawles to "read the work, feel a type of way and then create something," which is to say, be inspired rather than directed by him or his work. "It was kind of a gamble," he said. Rawles agreed to do it, but, nervous that rough sketches might not show the full range of what she could create, she bought a few small canvases and began painting instead.
When Coates got the first image last fall, "I wanted to cry," he said. He had written the earliest version of "The Water Dancer" in 2009, before "Between the World and Me" and "We Were Eight Years in Power" or, even, his seminal essay for The Atlantic, "The Case for Reparations." When he saw Rawles's interpretation of his words, the novel "started to feel really alive to me," he said.
"The Water Dancer," set in mid-1800s Virginia, is about an enslaved man named Hiram Walker whose life is deeply affected when he nearly drowns in a carriage accident. Coates said that, in his research for the book, he came across numerous references to water in relation to those forced into slavery, starting with the Middle Passage, when many jumped off ships to escape enslavement. These images stuck with him.
Rawles will create more paintings inspired by Coates's new novel. The two plan to collaborate on a series of events in which Coates will read from the book, and Rawles will display her art. In these, she said, "I will leave the pool and paint water from the ocean."
"There are other themes in this book that I know she's interested in," said Coates, who said he's eager to see what she comes up with once she reads the full book and without the constraints of the cover format.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- A New York Times report says seven women have claimed singer-songwriter Ryan Adams offered to help them with their music careers but then turned things sexual, and he sometimes became emotional and verbally abusive.
In the story published Wednesday, a 20-year-old female musician said Adams, 44, had inappropriate conversations with her while she was 15 and 16. Identified by her middle name Ava, she said that Adams exposed himself during a video call.
Adams' ex-wife, actress and singer Mandy Moore, said Adams was psychologically abusive toward her throughout their marriage. Their divorce was official in 2016.
The Times said the accounts have been corroborated by family members or friends who were present at the time.
Managers for Adams didn't immediately return an email seeking comment from The Associated Press but his lawyer died the claims to the Times.
Adams released his debut album in 2000 and has earned seven Grammy nominations. He famously covered Taylor Swift's Grammy-winning "1989" album in 2015, a year after its release. He has also worked as a producer behind the scenes for acts such as Willie Nelson and Jenny Lewis.
Last month Adams performed at a tribute concert for the late rock singer Chris Cornell.
Ava said Adams constantly questioned her about her age throughout the nine months they exchanged text messages. The report said she never showed him any identification, and he had pet names for her body parts.
"If people knew they would say I was like R Kelley lol," he wrote to her via text in November 2014, when he was 40 and she was 16. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual misconduct with women and girls but has denied the allegations.
"Mr. Adams unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage," Andrew B. Brettler, Adam's layer, told the Times.
The singers Phoebe Bridgers and Courtney Jaye said Adams behaved inappropriately during their relationships.
Moore, one of the stars of NBC's award-winning "This Is Us," burst on the scene as a teen singer had musical success in the late '90s and early 2000s. She claimed Adams stalled her music career and told her, "'You're not a real musician, because you don't play an instrument.'"
"His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time -- my entire mid-to-late 20s," 34-year-old Moore said to the Times.

Thanhha Lai’s debut novel tells of her childhood experience of fleeing Vietnam after the fall of Saigon and immigrating to Alabama. Based on her first year in the U.S., and told in verse as 10-year-old Hà, the narrative is a window into the challenges of leaving the only home she knew for one of hope, dreams, grief and healing.
“Inside Out and Back Again” is a New York Times bestseller, Newbery Honor Book and winner of the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature.
The project presentations are:

Texto completo: Jordan Peele and Charlie Sanders's "Weird City" begins on YouTube Premium. And Ewan McGregor narrates a "Nature" documentary on PBS.
What's Streaming
WEIRD CITY Stream on YouTube Premium. A sci-fi potpourri that wears its influences on its sleeves, this new anthology series created by Jordan Peele and the "Key & Peele" writer Charlie Sanders imagines a socially stratified dystopia whose upper- and lower-class citizens are separated by a physical barrier called "the line." But while it's dystopian, it's also funny; the show plays as if "Black Mirror" and Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" had a love child, and then that child chose a career in comedy. Many recognizable actors -- including Steven Yeun, Awkwafina, Dylan O'Brien, LeVar Burton and Rosario Dawson -- portray the citizenry of this middle-class-less society.
MELANCHOLIA (2011) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. On a pedestal at the M HKA museum in Antwerp, Belgium, sits a diamond, in an exhibition created by the filmmaker Lars von Trier. The diamond, he says, represents his 2011 film, "Melancholia." "What I'm trying to do is to capture the mood," von Trier recently told The New York Times. Those who can't make it to Antwerp can hop on the streaming service of their choice to experience the mood of this apocalyptic psychological drama, which stars Kirsten Dunst as a bride whose doomsday visions come true. It is melancholic and more.
PERSONAL SHOPPER (2017) Stream on Netflix; Rent on iTunes and Vudu. Class divides Maureen, a young American played by Kristen Stewart, from her wealthy celebrity employer in this quiet thriller, directed by Olivier Assayas. Set in Paris and throughout Europe, the movie follows Maureen as she travels around as a personal shopper, buying expensive clothes and accessories for her boss while mentally processing the recent death of her twin brother. Mystery, more death, and possible spirits come around soon enough. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film is both "an unnerving inquiry into the drift and mystery of modern life" and "a raw and smoldering study in grief." He called it "sleek and spooky, seductive and suspenseful."
What's on TV
NATURE: WILD WAY OF THE VIKINGS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Seafarers? Yes. Raiders? Check. Traders? Naturally. Environmental stewards? Somewhat, according to this documentary. The latest entry in PBS's "Nature" series focuses on the Vikings and their relationship to the natural world, which, it shows, they both exploited and nurtured. Ewan McGregor narrates.
SUICIDE SQUAD (2016) 7:30 p.m. on TNT. David Ayer's dark DC Comics adaptation assembles a heterogeneous squad of Hollywood heavyweights like Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Viola Davis to tell the tale of supervillains who come under government employ. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott called the film "a so-so, off-peak superhero movie." But he praised the costumes and Smith and Davis's "dead-serious, delightfully mischievous performances."

BuzzFeed News employees push to unionize after layoffs

Texto completo: BuzzFeed News employees are pushing to make the company a union shop, a decision that came shortly after BuzzFeed laid off about 15 percent of its workforce last month.

“It’s not all fun and memes,” the organizing committee said in a statement. “Our staff has been organizing for several months, and we have legitimate grievances about unfair pay disparities, mismanaged pivots and layoffs, weak benefits, skyrocketing health insurance costs, diversity and more.”

BuzzFeed employees first raised questions about unionizing in 2015 after several staff members met with the NewsGuild of New York about a pay gap between certain employees, especially women and minorities. The employees continued to meet with the NewsGuild as recently as the fall, and the New York Times reported that the recent layoffs have bolstered organizers.

Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed's founder, has previously said he didn’t believe a union was the right fit for the company. BuzzFeed did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner .

Efforts to unionize at BuzzFeed only include staff members of the news division so far. If the company doesn't recognize the union, organizers are prepared to hold a union election with a representative from the National Labor Relations Board.

Rest in Power, California's bullet train to nowhere

Texto completo: More than a decade ago, Californians voted yes on Proposition 1A to authorize the building of a big, beautiful bullet train connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles. On Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom finally bit the bullet on the high-speed train's $5 billion sunk cost and put the project out of its misery.

President Barack Obama's transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, once bragged that Californians were "obviously way, way ahead of everyone else," heralding the administration's billions in federal funding to the state for the bullet train. Republicans, not just in California but ones across the country who didn't want to foot the bill, warned that the train would be far more cost-, time-, and labor-intensive than rosy eyed environmentalists claimed, but the Democratic leadership in Sacramento and the White House ignored them, pressing on with the proposal as a green beacon of hope to prevail over the stupid concerns of idiot conservatives.

In a prophetic moment of hubris, the New York Times' Timothy Egan wrote in a column titled "California Beaming":

"By building the nation’s largest transportation project, California would alleviate the need to spend $100 billion on 3,000 miles of new roads. That’s the premise. Construction is set to begin later this year.
All of it together — the rerouted rivers, the train moving at the speed of Superman, taxing the rich and welcoming a Latino majority — is a road not taken by any other state. You can laugh at the sunbaked barbarians, even wish them ill. But you should not fail to see in their fledgling renaissance another chapter in the American experiment, no less daring than the Golden Gate Bridge or the castle that Hearst erected at continent’s edge.
Of course, we all now know how that story ends. The train's projected cost exploded from $33 billion to $100 billion since Prop 1A was first passed, and the predicted time required to complete it more than doubled. The state has already burned through more than $5 billion, half of which came from taxpayers across the country. When reporters asked Newsom what he'd do with the train during his gubernatorial campaign, he suggested lopping the train by more than half, connecting San Francisco to the thriving metropolis of Fresno, a drive that takes less than three hours on a decent day and almost no one ever actually needs to do. But Newsom knew the truth: The bullet train was an all-or-nothing promise, either a Japanese-style giant to connect the state's two massive business corridors or a nonstarter.

So Newsom did what politicians refused to do for more than a decade and euthanize the financial travesty. Sure, he's a Big Government Grinch who refuses to give the federal government back $3.5 billion that they allocated to the project, but at least he's less of a hack than the morons who thought that you could replace a $100 hourlong flight or $40 five hourlong drive with a $100 billion bullet train to nowhere.

If California were its own nation, its economy would close out the top five in the entire world. The state has the highest income tax rate in the nation, and the Obama administration did almost everything in its power to make the bullet train happen.

But it didn't. It couldn't. And if California failed to make it happen, how the hell could the rest of the country replace our entire airline system with high-speed trains? The answer, of course, is that even though the dozens of Democratic leaders demanding that we do so as a part of the "Green New Deal," we can't and we won't

Lawmakers honor Dingell at 30,000 feet as plane turns back for bad weather

Texto completo: DEARBORN, Mich. — Former colleagues including Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia; Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, paid tribute to John Dingell at 30,000 feet on Tuesday as their flight to Michigan for the lawmaker's funeral was turned back due to wintry weather.
The funeral for Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress in US history, went ahead with former vice president Joe Biden eulogizing the Michigan Democrat.
"Dignity was how John walked. Dignity was how John talked. Dignity was how John carried himself. And more than that, it was how he treated everyone — and I mean everyone," Biden said.
Dingell died Feb. 7 at the age of 92. He had complications from prostate cancer.
According to two Democratic aides, the two military transport planes taking lawmakers to the funeral were unable to land in Detroit due to bad weather and were forced to return to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, tweeted that lawmakers held an "impromptu service at 30,000 feet" for Dingell, led by Lewis, Upton, and Pelosi.
Several other lawmakers, including Michigan's Democratic Senator Gary Peters and Representatives Daniel Kildee and Haley Stevens, tweeted that they were disappointed their plane was turned around and that they were unable to make it to the funeral.
"We shared a prayer for him in the sky, and felt a bit closer to the Dean in heaven," Stevens said in a tweet, referring to Dingell's title as the longest-serving House member.
Dingell served in Congress from 1955 until retiring in 2015.
Washington Post
Trump critics to help House panel with inquiries
WASHINGTON — Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said Tuesday that they have retained two elite white collar litigators and prominent legal critics of President Trump to help begin inquiries into some of the most sensitive allegations involving the president, including ethics violations, corruption, and possible obstruction of justice.
The committee's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, has not committed to opening a formal impeachment inquiry, but the addition of the two lawyers, Norman L. Eisen and Barry H. Berke, indicates that the Democrats do not intend to wait for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to finish his work to begin weighing issues that could ultimately be wrapped up in such a proceeding.
“The president of the United States faces numerous allegations of corruption and obstruction," Nadler said in a statement announcing the decision. “His conduct and crude statements threaten the basic legal, ethical, and constitutional norms that maintain our democratic institutions. Congress has a constitutional duty to be a check and balance against abuses of power when necessary."
Eisen, 58, served as the top White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama and later as his ambassador to the Czech Republic. A former white collar litigator and investigator, he has emerged since Trump's election as one of the president's most recognizable legal critics, using his perch as chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington to write voluminously about what he has argued are ethical lapses and instances of outright corruption in his administration.
Eisen also serves as a cocounsel in a lawsuit accusing Trump of violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution by refusing to divorce himself from his businesses.
Berke, a partner at the New York firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, has written extensively with Eisen about obstruction of justice and the president's other legal vulnerabilities. He has long experience with complicated financial and tax crimes cases.
New York Times
Cameraman attacked at president's rally
A belligerent man at President Trump's campaign rally on the Texas border apparently attacked news crews, shoving and swearing at a photojournalist from the BBC, according to reports and a spokeswoman for the network.
The BBC said cameraman Ron Skeans was "violently pushed and shoved by a member of the crowd" while covering the rally Monday night in El Paso, about a mile from the US-Mexico border. BBC spokeswoman Charlotte Morgan said in a statement Tuesday to The Washington Post: "The man was removed by security, and Ron is fine. The president could see the incident and checked with us that all was OK."
"It is clearly unacceptable for any of our staff to be attacked for doing their job," she added.
It is unclear whether the man, who has not been publicly identified, will be charged.
When asked about the incident during Monday night's rally, Michael Glassner, who leads the Trump campaign, said in a statement to the Post that "An individual involved in a physical altercation with a news cameraman was removed from last night's rally."
"We appreciate the swift action from venue security and law enforcement officers," he added.
Skeans, the cameraman, told BBC News that he did not see the man in the crowd coming at him, but he felt a "very hard shove" that almost knocked him down.
"I didn't know what was going on," he said.
Video that appeared to be from Skeans's camera showed it falling toward the ground. Seconds later, when the picture was restored, a man in a red Make America Great Again hat could be seen being restrained as he shouted, "[Expletive] the media!"
Trump has repeatedly attacked the US news media, labeling journalists the "enemy of the American people" and calling much of their coverage of him "fake news."
Describing the Monday altercation, a reporter for the Washington Examiner wrote on Twitter that leading up to the encounter, Trump had "railed against all the media."
After the incident, however, Trump pointed toward the crowd and asked: "You all right? Everything OK?"
Then he flashed a thumbs up.

Texto completo: The votes are in, and the winner of the Worst Trump Cabinet Member competition is 
Wilbur Ross!
First time a secretary of commerce has ever won the title. Don't let me hear you complaining that this administration hasn't accomplished anything.
The Ross victory is a little suspect, since it came right after he gave an interview in which he expressed befuddlement about why furloughed government workers were going to food banks and homeless shelters when they could - you know, just go see their banker and take out a loan.
Do you think he was making a play for first place? Nah, that was just Wilbur being Wilbur, the guy who happily marveled that when Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere." When reminded that the Saudi government has a way of making protesters disappear, Ross admitted "in theory that could be true" but quickly added, "there was certainly no sign of it."
Until then Ross' biggest claim to cabinet fame was perhaps his habit of falling asleep at meetings. Hey, the man is 81. Give him a break.
Coming in a close second was Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, followed by that perennial favorite, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.
Nielsen, who one reader called "the queen of mendacity," got votes for her work separating thousands of families at the Mexican border. The Trump immigration policies were on so many people's minds, they put Stephen Miller in fourth place even though he's not actually in the cabinet.
Miller, a 33-year-old senior adviser to the president, is a longtime enemy of bipartisan immigration reform who's a chief architect of Trump's wall-mania. So it's sort of pleasant to mention, just for the heck of it, that lately Miller's seemed to be trying to fight premature balding by spraying some kind of black stuff on the top of his head.
Our voting results are not entirely scientific, given readers' demand to be able to vote for two, three or 12 different contenders. ("Why not give it to them all? My daughter played softball and everybody got a trophy.")
DeVos, a former Worst Cabinet Member winner, has faded a bit as her ineffectiveness appeared to mitigate some of her bad intentions. Nevertheless, it's clear our readers have been keeping an eagle eye on what she's been up to, however fumbling the effort. One voter cited "her disinterest in addressing the national student debt crisis; her support of private institutions' shady loan practices; her bungling of college campus sex policy; her complete lack of knowledge and interest in classroom achievement." And that was just the first part of the letter.
Other high-rankers in the Worst contest were Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Some readers mentioned Pompeo's cheerful visit to Saudi Arabia that was highlighted by "his boys-will-be-boys willingness to overlook the savage murder of Saudi Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi."
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson got quite a few votes despite a certain lack of, um, public presence. ("What happened to Ben Carson? No, seriously. What happened to him? Did he fall asleep in a chair somewhere? Did he ever get out of that elevator?")
Ditto Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, whose most notable recent achievement was being the cabinet member who stayed away from the State of the Union address so he could run the country if everybody else got assassinated.
We do not want to pursue this thought for any number of reasons.
There were virtually no votes for either the head of the Department of Interior or the Environmental Protection Agency. Ryan Zinke and Scott Pruitt were big Worst contenders in the past, but they're gone now, thrown into the darkness for various embarrassments along the line of super-expensive trips on the public dime and, in Pruitt's case, telling an aide to inquire about purchasing an old mattress from a Trump hotel.
Now Trump has announced that he's nominating David Bernhardt to be his new secretary of the Interior. Bernhardt is a former oil lobbyist whose biggest interest in public lands appears to involve drilling on them. I'll bet we hear a lot more of him next time around.
The list goes on and on. There's hardly a cabinet member who doesn't seem to be driving readers crazy. 
Think about it. How many members of the Obama cabinet can you recall? Even when George W. Bush was hanging out with Dick Cheney, did you know who was running the Department of Commerce?
At least we're all paying attention.

In a crowded field, are Democrats courting moderate voters?: Today's talker

Texto completo: Over the weekend, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota officially announced their bids for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It's time for Democrats to do what Republicans did in 2016
By Nancy Jacobson
For the second presidential cycle in a row, a crowded field of candidates has emerged in the race to claim a major party's nomination. The sheer number of hats in the ring could produce a nominee outside the small coterie most pundits expect to win out. Dubious? Just think about 2016.
In the last presidential election, most of the Republican candidates were seen as beacons of the "establishment. " With Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, John Kasich and Chris Christie all competing to win the hearts and minds of more moderate GOP primary voters, Donald Trump won by collecting support from Republicans with an appetite for a different brand of candidate — and he succeeded. In other words, the crowded field opened the door for an outsider who was (and could still be) largely out of step with many others inside his own party.

This time, the situation is flipped. Democrats are the party with the crowded field. But maybe more important, many Democratic candidates are not focusing on winning over moderate voters. Quite the opposite; they're keyed on winning over the Democratic Party's base voters and others on the far left. If history repeats itself, these candidates will end up slicing that electorate into such small portions that they could open the door for a competitor with a different message and outlook.
No one knows who will emerge as the Democratic nominee, and the widely held presumption that the 2016 race would be yet another contest between someone named Bush and someone named Clinton should give prognosticators pause. But the crowded field among Democratic candidates signals that the unexpected today might seem inevitable tomorrow. Voters eager to see a candidate emerge with a promise of getting Democrats and Republicans to work collaboratively should stay engaged.

What others are saying
Dean Obeidallah, CNN. com: "President Donald Trump is now confronted with a gang of women who are all gunning for him. And if he responds in usual Trump fashion, with his no-holds-barred attacks, he could drive away more female voters than he did in the 2018 midterms. That could potentially not only be devastating for Trump, but also for many Republicans on the 2020 ballot. "
Tara McGowan, The Hill: "Trump's campaign has excelled at leveraging digital ad dollars to keep the controversies surrounding the Trump administration from reaching his supporter base online. . . . Coupled with Trump's own tweets, thousands of Facebook ads placed by his re-election campaign and dozens of conservative 'media outlets' driving the same narrative, Trump’s chosen message blanketed the feeds and phones of voters nationwide. "
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "If I were Trump, I would fear Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Either would be well-positioned to take back blue-collar states Trump needs, like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa. They could also play well in the Sunbelt suburbs of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. And if I were the other 2020 Democrats, I'd be studying how Klobuchar and Brown have succeeded where so many other Democrats have been failing. "
What our readers are saying
The Democratic Party should save Americans some time and just tell us the Democrats who are not running for president in 2020.
— Daniel Rasmussen
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. , is a welcome voice to reclaim the middle. Underestimate her at your peril.
— Catherine Vale
It the list continues to grow. There is a dog catcher in Fresno, California, and a school bus driver in Tupelo, Mississippi, who think they have a chance at the Democratic nomination.
— Lou Creola
I guess anyone thinks they can beat President Donald Trump to the White House. Hillary Clinton had the baggage of emails, but now Trump has the baggage of . . . well, too much to list.
— Charity Smith
Here are the key items for a successful Democratic nomination: promise as much free stuff as possible; lots of feel-good phrases; don't mention any specific ideas or agenda because you don't want to be held accountable; and never answer a specific question about protecting our borders, just dance around it. Do that and you'll get dominated.

White House says leaker about to be caught. Then new leaked copies of Trump schedule land

Resumen: White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that hope to identify the staffer who leaked Trump's schedule by the end of the week.

Texto completo: Just hours after White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney declared that he expected to identify the staffer who leaked President Donald Trump's personal schedule to the news media within the week, new copies of the president's schedule were published online.
When asked about the staffer who leaked copies of Trump's schedule from a three month period, Mulvaney said on "Fox News Sunday" that he hopes "to have a resolution on that this week. "
But Axios then published more copies of Trump's schedule on Sunday, one week after their original story ran. The online publication revealed four days of the president's schedule from the previous week. Those days included about 50 percent of unstructured "Executive Time. "
The newly-published schedules were consistent with the initial report that showed about 60 percent of the president's schedule consisted of "Executive Time. " That report generated a wave of outrage and indignation from people who claimed the leak showed that the president was spending most of his time watching Fox News, firing off tweets or chatting on the phone.
Not so, says Trump.
On Sunday, the president posted a tweet in response to the first Axios report and explained that "Executive Time" should be "reported as a positive, not negative. "
"When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President," Trump tweeted.
He followed up with another tweet explaining that when he took office, the U. S. was such "a mess" that he "had no choice but to work very long hours!"

When the president's private schedule was leaked, political observers painted it as an unprecedented personal betrayal by a White House staffer.
"A White House aide is weaponizing his schedules, which says a lot about how people in the White House feel about the man they work for," tweeted New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman after Axios published the leaked documents.
"What a disgraceful breach of trust to leak schedules," tweeted Trump's secretary Madeleine Westerhout‏. "What these don’t show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday. This POTUS is working harder for the American people than anyone in recent history. "
Still, on Sunday, Trump said that getting his "work schedule" was actually "very easy to do. "

Mulvaney said Sunday that the leaked schedule "is not that confidential" and about 400 people get copies of it.
"It's not the content" that is upsetting, Mulvaney explained on "Fox News Sunday. "
"It's the fact that someone within the White House spent three months collecting this information, which is really, really hard to do," he said.

Schiff voices concerns about Mueller investigation

Texto completo: The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee expressed concern Sunday that special counsel Robert Mueller has not adequately scrutinized President Donald Trump's finances and said House investigators plan to probe Trump's relationship with a bank implicated in Russian money laundering.
"We are not interested in our committee in whether he's a tax cheat or not worth what he says he is," Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., said in an appearance on the NBC's "Meet the Press." "What we are interested in is, does the president have business dealings with Russia such that it compromises the United States?"
In particular, Schiff said the House panel plans to investigate Trump's two-decade relationship with Deutsche Bank, a German institution that has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties in recent years after admitting its role in a $10 billion money laundering scheme that allowed clients in Russia to move vast sums overseas.
Schiff voiced concern that Mueller has shied away from investigating Trump's ties to the German lender, saying that "if the special counsel hasn't subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, he can't be doing much of a money-laundering investigation."
Schiff was referring to reports last year that Mueller's office had told Trump's lawyers it was not seeking Deutsche Bank records related to Trump's accounts or loans. Deutsche Bank became a critical lender to Trump in the late 1990s when major U.S. banks refused to do business with the New York real estate developer after repeated bankruptcies.
Trump has described his finances as a "red line" Mueller should not cross, and he threatened to fire Mueller in late 2017 amid reports that the special counsel was seeking records from Deutsche Bank. Trump reportedly backed down after his lawyers obtained assurances from Mueller.
Schiff said he is concerned that Trump's "red line has been enforced whether by the deputy attorney general (Rod Rosenstein) or by some other party at the Justice Department. But that leaves the country exposed."
A spokesman for the special counsel did not respond to a request for comment.
The House intelligence committee has sought to bolster its investigative staff with financial and forensic accounting experts, part of an expansion of the Trump-Russia probe since Democrats gained control of the chamber.
Trump has lashed out at Schiff in recent days, calling him a "political hack" and questioning the committee's authority to investigate his finances. "It's called presidential harassment," Trump told reporters last week. "And it's unfortunate. And it really does hurt our country."
Deutsche Bank has been a key player in loans to Trump's companies totaling more than $2 billion, much of it apparently used to expand his global golf resort holdings. The New York Times reported this month that Trump sought a loan from Deutsche Bank in 2016 but was rejected in part because bank officials worried about the prospect of seizing assets from a sitting president if Trump won the election and defaulted on the loan.

59 New Emojis Speak the Language of Inclusivity

Texto completo: Interracial couples. A guide dog for blind people. A person using a wheelchair.
These were among the new emojis announced this week by the Unicode Consortium, the nonprofit that provides standards for text on the internet and oversees emojis.
The list -- which includes 59 new emojis, as well as variants for a total of 230 options -- emphasizes inclusivity. People will soon be able to create a "holding hands" emoji to reflect their own relationship, selecting for the skin color and gender identity of each individual. Other options include emojis showing a hearing aid, prosthetic limbs, sign language, a cane or a wheelchair.
A host of other new symbols include an otter, a sloth, a waffle, falafel, a yawning face, a white heart, a sari and a contentious one-piece bathing suit.
In a world where people use emojis to represent everything from weddings to poop, the announcement naturally led to much discussion, with an image of a drop of blood becoming a new way to talk about menstruation and a pinching symbol leading to jokes about a certain male body part being very, very small.
[ Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter for a look at what you need to know to begin your day.]
But don't expect to see the latest offering on your keyboard just yet. That will most likely happen later this year.
The Unicode Consortium sets the standards for emoji compatibility, allowing the symbols to translate across the internet. Then companies like Apple and Google have to design emojis and incorporate the code into their operating systems, Greg Welch, a board member for Unicode, said in an interview on Wednesday. New emojis typically come to cellphones in September or October, Unicode said in the announcement.
On Wednesday, a representative for Apple pointed to its proposal for Unicode to create accessibility emojis, which said that the new emojis would "foster a diverse culture that is inclusive of disability" and help people express themselves, as well as show support for loved ones.
A representative for Google said on Wednesday that it hoped to release the new emoji designs soon.
The latest update continues a trend toward greater emoji diversity, which began in earnest a few years ago when a range of skin tones was introduced. In 2017, a hijab emoji was introduced.
"You see people are asking for curly hair or skin tone and bald and hijab," said Jennifer 8. Lee, who serves on Unicode's emoji subcommittee and helped found Emojination, a grass-roots effort to make emojis more inclusive.
"In many ways it's because people are trying to say the word 'I,"' Ms. Lee, who previously worked as a reporter at The New York Times, said in an interview on Wednesday. "They are trying to represent themselves in emojiland."
Tinder, the online dating app, had campaigned for Unicode to better represent couples of different races and genders in the "universal language of the digital age."
"Love is universal," Tinder's website says. "And it's time for interracial couples to be represented in our universal language."
"It's huge and historic," said Ken Tanabe, the founder of Loving Day, an organization that encourages people to celebrate the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that legalized interracial marriage.
"You are talking about marriages and starting families," he said in an interview on Wednesday, adding that he had heard from people who could not find a wedding cake topper that reflected their relationship and chose to use black and white chess pieces instead.
"Having an emoji that's already there, it feels like hey, we are part of the conversation," he said. "We are part of the community. We are represented in the most personal part of our lives."
Apple had advocated adding emojis to represent people with disabilities. In a statement on Wednesday, Howard A. Rosenblum, the chief executive of the National Association of the Deaf, a civil rights organization for deaf and hard of hearing people, said it worked with Apple to help create the deaf emoji and hoped it would help "raise awareness throughout the world about Deaf Culture and the many sign languages that exist."
One of the new emojis -- a guide dog for people who are blind and visually impaired -- offers a fun way for people to represent their identity and honor their dogs in texts and emails, said Becky Davidson, who works at Guiding Eyes for the Blind, an organization that provides trained dogs for people who are blind or visually impaired.
"Some people might feel like they just don't want that to define them. And that's their choice and they don't have to use it," she said. "But I think a lot of us, we love our dogs and we love to show off our dogs."
Guide dogs are an integral part of life for many blind people, so much so that they often sign emails from "so-and-so and their dog," Ms. Davidson said.
But some people prefer to keep their dog's name private, so that other people don't use the dog's name and distract it from its work, Ms. Davidson said. Using a guide dog image, she said, would be a way to include the dog in conversations without sharing specifics.
For Ms. Davidson, using emojis does not come naturally, she said, because she was born blind and does not know what some facial expressions look like. But she said she might make an exception for the chance to include an emoji of her 9-year-old yellow lab, Lawson.
"I think it's kind of a cute idea," she said.

Texto completo: In the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird," a Hoosier actor named William Walker enjoyed a moment of lasting fame while seated in the segregated balcony of the courthouse following the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white girl.
One by one, the spectators silently rise as Robinson's attorney, Atticus Finch, gets ready to leave the courtroom. Walker, playing Reverend Sykes, then delivers one of the most memorable lines in movie history: "Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing."
In a 1981 interview with The New York Times, Walker said he "tried to make his clergy character reflect the kind of respect the world would have for a man like Atticus Finch." Despite being a character actor in more than 60 films, Walker said playing Reverend Sykes in "To Kill a Mockingbird" was his most-rewarding role.
William Franklin Walker was born in Anderson, Indiana, in 1896, the grandson of a slave who fought in the Civil War.
Walker was raised in Pendleton by his grandparents, William and "Aunty" Howell. In 1915, Walker was the first black to graduate from Pendleton High School. According to the publication, "Butler College in the World War," part of the collection at Butler University's Irwin Library, Walker enrolled in the 1915-16 catalog of classes as a freshman but did not graduate.
He enlisted in the Army in 1918 and served with the 351st Field Artillery, 92nd Division, in France during the First World War, before being discharged as a corporal on March 13, 1919. The 92nd division is well known as the "second fully organized all-colored division" in World War I. Following the war, Walker attended the University of Illinois from 1921-23, then took a job with the U.S. Post Office in Chicago and played with a band on the side, which got him noticed by the Morrison Talent Agency. In the early 1930s, he studied dramatics at Columbia University in New York and worked on Broadway as a stage manager and an actor.
His Broadway credits included Oscar Hammerstein's 1929 "Golden Dawn." From there, he headed to Hollywood, where he would amass an impressive career as a character actor. Walker's first role was in the 1946 film "The Killers," which made Burt Lancaster a star. Walker also had roles in "Larceny," "Young Man with a Horn," "Walk on the Wild Side," "The Great White Hope" and many more.
While acting was his profession, Walker's pride was with his work on the board of the Screen Actors Guild from 1951 to 1971. Walker and then-SAG president Ronald Reagan worked together to persuade Hollywood producers to hire more black actors with their "More and Better Roles for Negroes in Motion Pictures" campaign. The cause was bold and unprecedented, but there were no immediate results. In 1963, Walker joined the NAACP in negotiating a nondiscrimination clause in SAG's theatrical agreement.
In 1962, Walker and former silent-era child star Peggy Cartwright married in what is considered to be one of Hollywood's first interracial marriages. They remained married until his death in 1992 at the age of 95 and are buried next to each other at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.
According to the Pendleton Historical Society, Walker returned to Pendleton several times.
"To Kill a Mockingbird" will return to theaters this March. Tickets are on sale at fathomevents.com for the March24th and 27th showings at AMC Perry Crossing 18 in Plainfield, AMC Indianapolis 17 at 4325 S. Meridian St. and AMC Castleton Square 14.

Texto completo: I used to be able to watch "Morning Joe" on MSNBC until a couple years back. The show's anchors and guests had interesting, sometimes unpredictable points of view.
No longer, however. Now it is a one-track, one-note news-and-opinion show — not just anti-Trump all the time but invective at that.
This is just one example of our national media these days.
In the Trump era, American national media (CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, Fox News, The Washington Post, The New York Times) have self-divided into openly pro- or anti-Trump factions.
It isn't covert anymore, and many media outlets wear it as a badge of honor.
But when a media outlet is strongly for or against a leader or party, the first casualties are fairness, honesty and accuracy.
We saw this on vivid display in just two recent instances: the Buzzfeed story and the Covington Catholic kids story. In both stories, many national media outlets had not just egg but omelettes on their faces because of their rush to judgment before all the facts had been assembled and confirmed.
The losers in this, obviously, are the American public, who deserve but don't get a fair, balanced, comprehensive picture of their politics from any media outlet.
To be fair, at least one underlying reason for the pro- or anti-Trump slant is simple: It is good for business.
Giving their respective partisan audiences what they want generates ratings, subscriptions and advertising revenue for media outlets.
But aside from staunch partisans, there are millions of Americans, myself included, who care about this vital pillar of our democracy.
There is a great hunger, I think, for a different model of journalism: one that gives an objective, comprehensive picture of politics; that doesn't chase revenue-enhancing clickbait stories that end up hurting the societal fabric; that doesn't carry water for any party, politician or wealthy donor; that follows the truth wherever it may lead; that doesn't constantly tell us what to think.
The last is especially grating — in our news-and-opinion-blurred-times, one pet peeve many avid media consumers have is that many national media outlets actively try to shape public opinion on issues by constantly telling voters what to think, instead of just reporting the facts.
But I'm dreaming, right? All the above changes aren't happening in our current media climate.
But let me present what Glenn Greenwald, a journalist I admire, stated in 2016 about the role of media in a democracy:
"Adversarial journalism is critical for making democracy healthier and checking people who wield great power in ways that are constructive. In a democracy, people have different roles to play regardless of outcomes.
"If Congress passes a terrible law that hurts a lot of people, but it's not running afoul of any constitutional guarantees, nobody should want the judiciary to come in and invalidate the law on the grounds that it's a bad law. That's a violation of the role the judiciary is supposed to play to have a balanced, healthy society.
"In the short term, the mentality in making that law invalidated might help people or prevent harm. In the long term or even the midterm, it's going to make society much unhealthier, because now you have the judiciary running afoul of democratic principles by overriding laws even though they adhere to the Constitution.
"To me, it's more about the roles of politics. If you play a role in the campaign — you're a Hillary Clinton campaign spokesperson or work for Media Matters — fine, spend all day defending a candidate, because that's your role.
"When I was a lawyer, my job was to advocate for people who did the wrong things or who I didn't think were telling the ultimate truth — because that was the role I was supposed to play.
"But when you're a journalist, I think your role ought to be adversarial to people who wield the greatest power and to say the things you think are true — even if it hurts the candidate you like or helps the one you dislike. Because that's how society stays balanced."
A big Amen to that.

Daley's lame evasion freshens 'ancient' allegations of cheating

Texto completo: What is a fair-minded Chicago voter to make of the strong evidence reported Thursday in the Tribune that current Chicago mayoral candidate Bill Daley received illicit help to pass a state insurance broker's test in 1973?
That was 46 years ago! Talk about bygones.
"At a time when Chicago is facing serious issues around crime, taxes, education and the city's future, the Tribune's focus on ancient history is irrelevant," said a statement from Daley's campaign.
The fair-minded person, the one who wants to be an objective juror in the court of public opinion, uninfluenced either way by feelings about the candidate or the Daley family, squints skeptically at this deflection. Yes, the allegation is old, but it is serious. Where is the refutation, explanation or apology? Where is the counterpoint or clarification that will allow us to decide how relevant this story is to our vote?
The fair-minded person -- this fair-minded person, anyway -- views the response as a fresh and therefore relevant offense, a bigger mark against him than any shenanigans he was part of nearly half a century ago.
Another fair-minded person -- you, perhaps -- will have a different verdict. That's fine. As long as we're all trying to apply our principles consistently and honestly.
I've been thinking a lot about fair-mindedness lately, having received some two dozen angry messages from readers in the past several days accusing me of partisan bias and hypocrisy in my assessment of the controversy involving Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.
If Northam were a Republican, these indignant correspondents contend, I would be far less willing to categorize his wearing of blackface makeup 35 years ago as obliviousness rather than racism. I would be howling for his resignation.
Not true. The principle I applied in looking at the situation was that no one is perfect and that time informally erases many mistakes just as time formally erases many crimes.
Not all mistakes and all crimes, of course. But our understanding that people change as the decades pass and our tradition of forgiving those who repent dictates a response of mercy, not rage, to an offense such as Northam's.
Yes, his apology has been marred by shifts in what he was willing to admit to and by an excruciating performance at a news conference. If we learn that he's been lying today, that's a fresh offense and he has to go. But nothing we know about his life since 1984, when he admits to having darkened his skin to imitate Michael Jackson for a dance contest, suggests that his hurtful and offensive decision was evidence of malice, much less of a toxic character flaw that disqualifies him from public office to this day.
All racism is evidence of ignorance. But not all ignorance is evidence of racism.
Some correspondents asked, what about Brett Kavanaugh? After Christine Blasey Ford accused the conservative U.S. Supreme Court nominee of sexually attacking her when they were both teenagers, correspondents noted that I argued (in vain) that Kavanaugh shouldn't be confirmed by the Senate.
I did. But it wasn't because of what Kavanaugh did or didn't do in the early 1980s, when Ford said he groped her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party when he was drunk. Not to minimize the harm of that kind of attack, which I do believe occurred, but it strikes me as a redeemable sin of youth, so long as the offender seeks redemption.
Kavanaugh's disqualifying offense to my mind was lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee not just about the incident but also about aspects of his character back then as revealed in his high school yearbook.
I bring this up not to relitigate that particular controversy -- we've all made up our minds on it and moved on -- but to say I like to think my conclusion would have been the same for a similarly accused male Supreme Court nominee with the liberal bona fides of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
I like to think so. But I recognize that it's a constant challenge for all of us not to be overly harsh on members of the other team and overly forgiving of members of our team.
Consider:
What's a fair-minded voter to make of the image published recently by The Washington Post showing that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., identified herself as "American Indian" in 1986 on a registration form for the Texas state bar? It's still more evidence of Warren's peculiar and seemingly opportunistic effort to claim a Native American identity based on family lore that she had indigenous people as distant relatives.
She has abandoned that effort and apologized to tribal leaders angered that she took a DNA test (that found mere traces of American Indian ancestry), as though blood and identity are equivalent. I find it weird but not disqualifying.
But I find it far weirder that President Donald Trump -- who has not retracted his own origin story after a New York Times report last year showed his claim to being a self-made millionaire to be a myth if not an outright fraud -- gets away with mocking Warren with the slur "Pocahontas."
Trump tells more lies before breakfast than Warren has probably told in her entire life, so the fair-minded voter concludes that Trump and his unprincipled enthusiasts are rip-snorting hypocrites to taunt her.
What's a fair-minded person to make of political scientist Vanessa Tyson's accusation that Virginia's Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a Boston hotel room during the 2004 Democratic National Convention?
This is a significant accusation because Fairfax is next in line should Northam resign, as people all across the political spectrum are demanding he do. But the fair-minded person weighs the evidence supporting this accusation and the evidence supporting Fairfax's' insistence that the encounter was consensual without regard to party or consequences.
The passage of 15 years hasn't mitigated this alleged offense, and if it's true then Fairfax needs to resign and see if he can start his political career over.
The news seems to make daily demands on us to judge and pass sentence on the confessed and alleged misdeeds of others.
Fair-minded people won't necessarily all draw the same lines, apply the same standards and reach the same verdicts. But they'll strive for consistency, make sincere efforts to put shoes on other feet and follow their principles to sometimes uncomfortable conclusions.
And their fairness will illuminate their letters to newspaper columnists.

Quote of the month, so far
Mayoral candidate Daley to the Tribune's Bill Ruthhart on why he stays away from so many mayoral forums: "Some of these people in this group would go to a door opening, because they have nothing else to do. I'm not going to be dictated by the schedules of people who are looking for anything to get a few people in a room and think they're going to get points by kicking the hell out of me with a bunch of lies or rhetoric that heats up the crowd. Why would I want to do their work for them? Forget it. I don't need to do that."

Be all ears
Two new podcasts I've been recommending:
"Back Room Deal" is a short, near-daily, ward-level analysis of the coming Chicago election hosted by Ben Joravsky and Maya Dukmasova of the Chicago Reader. Their brisk conversations and insights have made me smarter.
"Public Official A" is a serialized retelling of the bizarre, compelling tale of now-imprisoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, hosted by WBEZ-FM 91.5 political reporter Dave McKinney. The archival audio and fresh interviews make this a must-listen for local history buffs.

Texto completo: The 61st annual Grammy Awards are on CBS at 8 p.m., and Hasan Minhaj's comedy show returns to Netflix.
What's on TV
THE GRAMMYS 8 p.m. on CBS. This awards show, billed as music's biggest night and hosted by Alicia Keys, celebrates its 61st ceremony. The Recording Academy made a series of changes in its membership and nominations process in an effort to address concerns about a lack of diversity. J Balvin, nominated for record of the year with Cardi B's "I Like It," will join the rapper Young Thug, the singer Camila Cabello, the trumpet legend Arturo Sandoval and Ricky Martin to open the show. From there, Diana Ross and Dolly Parton will perform, sharing the stage with Post Malone, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, Lady Gaga and Kacey Musgraves, among others. Fantasia, Andra Day and Yolanda Adams are to perform a tribute to Aretha Franklin, who died last summer at 76. In the lead-up to the event, the reporter Ben Sisario of The New York Times wrote, "as the show tries to stay culturally relevant, while also balancing the demands of race and gender representation, it may be impossible to please everybody at once." Catch all the red carpet action on E! starting at 6 and on CBS at 7.
THE BAFTA FILM AWARDS 9 p.m. on BBC America. The other big award show of the night is essentially the British equivalent of the Oscars, where Yorgos Lanthimos's "The Favourite," starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, is up for a whopping 12 awards, including best film. According to the reporter Alex Marshall of The Times, "the Baftas are often considered a rough bellwether for the Academy Awards," which air Feb. 24, because of the overlap between members of both voting committees.
THE WALKING DEAD 9 p.m. on AMC. For the midseason return of this zombie apocalypse saga, the survivors encounter a new foe, the Whisperers, who disguise themselves with the skin of the undead to move around unnoticed. The show was just renewed for a 10th season.
What's Streaming
PATRIOT ACT WITH HASAN MINHAJ on Netflix. The first season of this comedian's weekly Netflix show returns from its winter hiatus with new episodes about sneaker experts, affirmative action and the SAT. Last month, Netflix blocked an episode of Minhaj's show from streaming in Saudi Arabia after the government there complained it was critical of the crown prince. In a trailer introducing the new episodes, Minhaj poked fun at the controversy, telling viewers his show would be streamed globally, unless he angers "another crown prince."
2 DOPE QUEENS on HBO streaming platforms. Jessica Jones is another charismatic "Daily Show" alum with a television series, inspired by her podcast with Phoebe Robinson. In the premiere of its second set of hourlong specials, which aired on Friday, the hosts talk fashion with the actress Lupita Nyong'o and challenge her to a braiding competition.

Texto completo: Jeffrey P. Bezos has long guarded his personal privacy and that of his businesses with vehemence. Amazon kept major initiatives, such as the Kindle e-reader, secret for years. His space venture, Blue Origin, once had a rocket crash but didn't report the mishap for days. Visitors to the space company's headquarters have been routinely asked to sign nondisclosure agreements, even if just visiting for a holiday party.
This quest for privacy imploded in recent weeks as Bezos, the world's wealthiest man and the owner of The Washington Post, faced perhaps the most personal crisis of his career. The National Enquirer published a series of stories, including intimate texts and photos, about his extramarital relationship with a former TV anchor, prompting Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, to announce their planned divorce over Twitter.
Then, according to a blog post Bezos published Thursday, the tabloid threatened to blackmail him with additional photographs of Bezos and the woman he was dating. He responded in
the blog post by including copies of Enquirer emails detailing the alleged threat. The move revealed graphic descriptions of what the images showed.
The Enquirer on Friday said it had only been engaged in "good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him" and would investigate the claims by Bezos before taking "whatever appropriate action is necessary."
The blog post Thursday night startled many in the technology industry and beyond, quickly spreading to internal online forums at Amazon, the company he founded in 1994 and for which he remains chief executive, board chairman and the largest shareholder.
But some longtime associates and observers also considered his confrontation with the Enquirer to be a classic Bezos move. As Amazon's CEO, he has relished the chance to rewrite the script when it came to managing public relations. Perhaps even more so, he has thrived on seeking to vanquish rivals, whether they be corporate behemoths such as Walmart or upstarts such as Diapers.com. With the Enquirer, Bezos has twice seized the initiative by essentially scooping the tabloid, revealing news of his divorce and of the additional pictures before its reporters could.
Even as the controversy has grown, Bezos has been spotted in public settings looking jovial, as he did when he appeared briefly on national television during the Super Bowl, standing and chatting near NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He appeared last month at the annual dinner of the Alfalfa Club in Washington, a black-tie event that attracts some of the city's biggest names.
"He is playing his hand as well as he can, given what has been made public," said Shel Kaphan, the first Amazon employee after Bezos and his wife. The "damage is done and I think he probably calculates correctly that it isn't going to get measurably worse for him if the photos come out."
Kaphan added, "It would be very typical of Jeff to strategically weigh his options in a detached way and pick the one that would leave him in the best position or minimize further damage to him."
Bezos, who declined an interview request made through Amazon officials Friday, typically is described as cerebral, ruthless and relentless as a businessman, with a particular ability to focus on long-term goals in the face of short-term pain.
Bezos and his company have faced multiple controversies during his public life. In Amazon's early years, it faced skepticism over whether the company could ever turn a profit and survive. But he relentlessly focused on underpricing competitors and other customer innovations, earning the trust of investors that one day Amazon would make money.
In 2015, when the New York Times published a detailed investigation describing a "bruising" workplace culture at Amazon, the company responded with a 1,300-word blog post detailing what the company argued were flaws in the story's reporting. Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former press secretary to President Barack Obama, titled the response, "What The New York Times Didn't Tell You," and engaged in an tit-for-tat exchange with the Times's executive editor over the coverage.
In more recent years, as lawmakers have raised questions about whether Amazon was compensating its workers enough and other aspects of its business model, the company made announcements of plans to hire 100,000 new workers and, later, to introduce a $15 minimum wage. Amazon spent $14 million on lobbying last year, a record for the company.
Bezos in recent years has raised his public profile. He bought The Post and the biggest home in Washington, and has appeared at entertainment award shows and high-profile rocket launches. He even drew attention for a more muscular physique and more refined wardrobe than earlier in his life.
His ownership of The Post has led to clashes with candidate and now President Trump, who has argued that the Amazon founder bought The Post to advance his financial interests. When Trump was a candidate in December 2015 and criticized Bezos in several tweets, he replied on Twitter. "Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace."
He largely has avoided further clashes with Trump, though he has said it is wrong of elected officials "to demonize the media."
Trump has from time to time continued to criticize Bezos. After the Enquirer published its article on Bezos's expected divorce, Trump tweeted, "So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!"
In publicly challenging the Enquirer, Bezos gambled in a way that's rare in a corporate world where the more common approach could be to protect valuable businesses from controversies before they might spread in unpredictable ways. The stakes are particularly high for a man who has drawn the ire of an aggressive publisher that thrives on controversy and whose chief executive is David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump. Pecker has received immunity from prosecution as part of the Justice Department's investigation into campaign finance violations by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.
Bezos wrote in the post on Medium, a self-publishing site, "If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?"
The accusations about the Enquirer's reporting came at a critical time for Bezos's empire, which increasingly has sought to work with the federal government. Amazon Web Services, which holds a $600 million cloud computing contract from the CIA, is vying for a $10 billion contract to build a cloud computing system for the Pentagon. Late last year, Blue Origin won its first major government contract, a $500 million deal from the Air Force to help develop its New Glenn rocket.
"As a billionaire, he can afford to take the risk to respond this way," said Jim Lukaszewski, a crisis consultant based in Minneapolis. "He skipped all the steps that get people in trouble . . . This neutralizes the power of this predator."
Bezos, who bought The Post in 2013 for $250 million, said in his online post Thursday that owning the news organization is "a complexifier" in his decisions about how to respond to political and other pressure. At a technology conference in 2016, he said that he admired Katharine Graham, the Post's late publisher who supported the newsroom's Watergate coverage even when a Nixon associate threatened that she was "gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer" if a particular story was published.
"With Kay Graham as my role model, I'm very willing to let any of my body parts go through a big, fat ringer if need be," Bezos said at the conference.
However this clash with the Enquirer turns out, it has revealed elements of Bezos's personality not widely known before, including a degree of personal indiscretion that has surprised longtime associates and observers.
Bezos and his romantic partner, former TV anchorwoman Lauren Sanchez, appeared together in public, including at the Golden Globe Awards, before publicly announcing an end to his marriage to MacKenzie Bezos, a fiction writer who helped him found Amazon. The couple have four children together.
While extramarital affairs are hardly novel, some Bezos watchers expressed surprise that he would send provocative text messages given the ease of copying and sharing them with others.
Bezos amassed a fortune of more than $125 billion running a technology company at a time when such breaches of personal privacy were becoming routine. Bezos long has preached within Amazon that personal actions by employees - and there is no more visible one than Bezos - can reflect poorly on a company, said his biographer Brad Stone, author of "The Everything Store."
"It's kind of inexplicable considering his messages inside the company," Stone said. "This was somebody who has been careful and strategic about every move in his personal and professional life over 50-plus years."
Once the affair was exposed, Bezos's response comes right out of the playbook of his longtime security consultant, Gavin de Becker. In "The Gift of Fear," he wrote that "extortion is a crime of opportunity, usually committed by amateurs."
De Becker added that when someone threatens to reveal marital infidelity, the best response is to say, "Hold on a moment, let me get my wife on the line and you can tell her right now."
The immediate pain, he wrote, is better than a prolonged period of blackmail during which the damaging information may ultimately be revealed anyway.
For much of his career, Bezos personally avoided the limelight, and the penchant for secrecy extended to his company and to his philanthropic endeavors. Until 2018, when he announced a $2 billion commitment to support preschoolers and the homeless, he had said very little about what he planned to do with his fortune.
Bezos also is known for staying silent on quarterly earnings calls with analysts and investors, and the company has banned recording, typing and photography at its shareholder meetings. Reporters at such meetings were allowed only to take handwritten notes.
"I never think of us as secretive," Bezos once said at a meeting in response to questions about these practices. "We're just quiet . . . We talk when we have something to say."
Blue Origin, his space company, also has kept a low profile, even though space is one of his main passions and now comprises, as he has said, "the most important work I'm doing." That included not revealing a 2011 crash until urged to by NASA, which had begun to worry about conspiracy theories spreading among those who noticed that something had gone awry.
In the early 2000s, Bezos started quietly acquiring hundreds of thousands of acres in West Texas, where Blue Origin now launches its New Shepard rocket. He purchased the land under corporate entities named for explorers. There was Joliet Holdings and Cabot Enterprises, the James Cook and William Clark Limited Partnerships and Coronado Ventures.
All were linked to a firm with a Seattle post office called Zefram LLC, named for Zefram Cochrane, a character in the Star Trek franchise. As he was scouting the land, a helicopter carrying Bezos crash-landed in a creek, flooding the cabin with water before he and others could escape. Later, he would say that "it was harrowing. We were very lucky. I can't believe we all walked away from it."
At the time, Amazon downplayed the crash, saying only that Bezos "is fine. We're business as usual."

Texto completo: Edward F. Zigler, a psychologist and children's advocate who was a principal architect of the Head Start program in the 1960s, called for schools to be neighborhood social service centers, and advised every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama, died Feb. 7 at his home in North Haven, Conn. He was 88.
His death was announced by Yale University, where he was a longtime professor. The cause was not disclosed.
Dr. Zigler grew up in poverty as the child of immigrants and drew on those experiences in developing ideas for improving the lot of children, parents and schools.
He was a major scholar in the field of childhood psychology, publishing more than 800 papers and dozens of books, and advocated the concept of the "whole child." He believed that social development was as crucial to a child's well-being as academic achievement and sought to foster that notion with programs, the best known being Head Start.
He was among several social scientists and public policy experts, including Bettye Caldwell, Robert Cooke and Jule Sugarman, who designed the framework for Head Start, which was launched in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty.
It began as a summer program for preschool children, and after two years, it was expanded to serve families year-round. In 1970, under President Richard M. Nixon, Dr. Zigler became the first full-time director of the Office of Child Development, which then administered the Head Start program.
"I don't think we have had the kind of advocacy for children that they deserve to get," he said at the time. "I intend to be an outspoken advocate for children. We can do better by our children than we have been doing."
Working with Rep. John Brademas (D-Ind.) and Sen. Walter Mondale (D-Minn.), Dr. Zigler helped draft the Child Development Act of 1971, which was passed by both houses of Congress.
The bill, which would have provided child care for working mothers and poor families, was vetoed by Nixon after an outcry from conservative opponents.
"They didn't want women to work," Dr. Zigler said in 1989. "They said we were Sovietizing America's children, that children would be raised in centers rather than by their mothers."
Dr. Zigler soon resigned from the government and returned to Yale, where he taught psychology and directed a center for the study of childhood development.
Head Start also faced similar criticism, was condemned as a Communist plot to take children away from their families and was for years threatened with a loss of funding. Dr. Zigler often pointed out that the program was voluntary and was administered - with varying degrees of success - by local communities.
"In our nation today children and families all too often come last, and the social barriers to providing a better quality of life for our nation's children have become almost insurmountable," he wrote in a 1976 New York Times essay. "Too many Americans either will not or do not want to hear the well-documented facts concerning our nation's massive shortcomings in regard to children."
Dr. Zigler developed performance standards for measuring the effectiveness of Head Start, and independent studies have generally found that the program has had beneficial effects on children, making them more productive in school and less likely to become burdens on society. More than 35 million have gone through Head Start programs, which now serves more than 1 million children each year.
Edward Frank Zigler was born March 1, 1930, in Kansas City, Mo. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who earned a meager living selling produce and plucking and selling chickens.
By the time he was 8, Dr. Zigler was selling fruit and vegetables from a horse-drawn wagon. His family received support from a "settlement house," an institution once common in cities that helped immigrant families with social and medical needs, English-language skills and acculturation into American life.
Years later, Dr. Zigler used the settlement house as a model for Head Start and other programs for children and families.
"It was predicated on what he remembered of how he was treated as a child of immigrants," Walter Gilliam, a Yale colleague, said Saturday in an interview.
After military service during the Korean War, Dr. Zigler graduated in 1954 from what is now the University of Missouri at Kansas City. He received a doctorate in psychology from the University of Texas at Austin in 1958, then joined the Yale faculty a year later.
In the mid-1970s, Dr. Zigler helped coordinate the resettlement of 3,000 Vietnamese children - many of them the offspring of U.S. military personnel - in the United States.
Beginning in the 1980s, Dr. Zigler promoted what he called "the school of the 21st century." Especially with more women entering the workforce and the rise of single-parent households, he called for schools to act as neighborhood social service centers providing day care, medical services and recreation, as well as academic training.
"I want a solution that's going to last for the next 100 years and provide quality day care for everyone," he told The Washington Post in 1987. "We have to open schools earlier in the morning, keep them open later in the afternoon and during summer."
Today, more than 1,400 schools in at least 20 states are following Dr. Zigler's blueprint by offering an array of social services.
"He said if there was ever anything that should unite us, it should be how we care for our children," said Gilliam, who now directs the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale. "He felt that any society that is going to survive needs to invest in its children."
Dr. Zigler's wife of 61 years, the former Bernice Gorelick, died in 2017. Survivors include a son, Perrin Scott Zigler of East Bridgewater, Mass.; a sister; and two granddaughters.
Dr. Zigler, who served Republican and Democratic presidents, believed Americans should united by the cause of children.
"I remember when I was in Washington they kept trying to get me to say whether I was a Republican or a Democrat," he told the Progressive magazine in 2002. "I just said, my politics are children. That's all I know anything about."

Fundraiser for Closs and her family sets new goal of $150K

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint.
Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward," De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

New Evidence Emerges of Possible Wrongdoing by Trump Inaugural Committee

Autor: Elliott, Justin; Marritz, Ilya. 

Información de publicación: ProPublica ; New York [New York]. 08 Feb 2019.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/new-evidence-emerges-possible-wrongdoing-trump/docview/2177676668/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: Federal prosecutors in New York are circling Donald Trump’s inaugural committee as part of a wide-ranging investigation into possible money laundering, illegal contributions and cash-for-access schemes.

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors in New York are circling Donald Trump’s inaugural committee as part of a wide-ranging investigation into possible money laundering, illegal contributions and cash-for-access schemes. Now, WNYC and ProPublica have identified evidence of potential tax law violations by the committee.
A spokesman confirmed that the nonprofit 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee paid the Trump International Hotel a rate of $175,000 per day for event space — in spite of internal objections at the time that the rate was far too high. If the committee is deemed by auditors or prosecutors to have paid an above-market rate, that could violate tax laws prohibiting self-dealing, according to experts.
Tax law prohibits nonprofits from paying inflated prices to entities that are owned by people who also control or influence the nonprofit’s activities.
“Every legitimate nonprofit is very concerned with this,” said Doug White, a veteran adviser to tax exempt organizations, speaking generally. “You’re benefiting a private person, and you’re using the nonprofit to do it.”
The inaugural committee also spent at least $1.5 million at a hotel in which the investment firm of the committee’s chairman, Tom Barrack, held a small stake.
In addition, the inaugural nonprofit appears not to have disclosed multiple gifts to the committee on its tax return, as required by law.
Trump’s inaugural committee spent more than $100 million, almost twice the amount spent on the next-most expensive inaugural party, that of Barack Obama in 2009. In addition to probing how the nonprofit spent its money, investigators are examining whether the inaugural received improper donations from foreigners. Inaugural nonprofits are prohibited from receiving donations from people who are not U.S. citizens.
The committee paid a total of $700,000 to the Trump International Hotel for event spaces for four days in January 2017. At the time, a consultant working for the inaugural committee expressed her concern over email that the price quoted by the Trump hotel — $175,000 per day for several event spaces — was too high, as ProPublica and WNYC reported in December.
“Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,” wrote Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an experienced New York-based event planner, suggesting a fair rate for the event spaces would be at most $85,000 per day, less than half of what was ultimately paid. That fee did not cover catering.
Ari Krupkin, an event planner at the Markham Group in Washington, said event space rentals typically come as part of a package that includes catering and audio-visual. Without those services included in the price, he said, “$175,000 a day seems more than egregious.”
“It could be a tax law violation,” said Brett Kappel, an attorney at Akerman LLP who advises nonprofits. “Those emails would be of great interest to the Internal Revenue Service if they were to conduct an audit. They probably will be of great interest to the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York, which is investigating the inaugural committee.”
Tax law bars nonprofits such as the inaugural committee from insider deals that would unduly benefit people — in this case the Trump family — that have influence over the nonprofit, Kappel said. In legal parlance, these are known as excess benefit transactions. A key question would be whether the Trump hotel charged the inaugural committee above-market rates, which could violate tax rules, Kappel said. If an IRS audit found such a civil violation, the inaugural committee would have to pay taxes on the amount of money it overpaid.
It could become a criminal violation, Kappel said, if investigators uncover evidence that people knew that charging above-market rates to enrich the Trump Organization was illegal and did it anyway.
A question on the mandatory nonprofit tax return, Form 990, asks whether the organization engaged in any excess benefit transactions. The inaugural committee checked the “No” box.
The inaugural committee’s tax return states that it had a written conflict-of-interest policy, but the spokesman declined to provide the policy to reporters. Atchley & Associates, the Texas firm that prepared the tax form, did not respond to requests for comment.

Confidential Memo: Company of Trump Inaugural Chair Sought to Profit From Connections to Administration, Foreigners
The memo outlines how Colony, the company founded by Tom Barrack, an investor who chaired the inaugural, aimed to exploit its connections to Donald Trump. Federal prosecutors are conducting a wide-ranging probe into the nonprofit that ran the inaugural.
The inaugural committee has said that overall, for the event spaces and other expenses, it paid more than $1.5 million to the Trump hotel, as first reported by ABC and The New York Times.
Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and an executive at the Trump Organization at the time, was on the email chain about the Trump hotel event. She connected Rick Gates, the inaugural committee’s deputy chairman, with a hotel executive when Gates was seeking a price quote for the ballroom. Ivanka Trump’s spokesman in December said she only passed on the note and said that the inaugural should pay a “market rate.” Her spokesman did not respond to inquiries for this story.
In her email, Wolkoff, who was a friend of Melania Trump’s, pointed out that since other venues were donating their spaces, the Trump hotel’s rate was particularly troubling. The company that runs events at Union Station, the site for the inaugural’s candlelight dinner, donated the iconic space, according to a contract obtained by WNYC and ProPublica. Barrack’s own wine was also on the menu at the Chairman’s Global Dinner, an exclusive inauguration week event hosted by Barrack. “It was my honor to have donated wine from my personal vineyard, completely free of charge,” Barrack told Vinepair.
The Union Station donation and the wine do not appear to be included on the inaugural committee’s tax return, which is supposed to report non-cash contributions. The committee spokesman declined to answer detailed questions about the omission and other issues.
In addition, the inaugural spent money at a hotel then partly owned by the investment firm of Barrack, the businessman and friend of Donald Trump’s who chaired the inaugural committee. The committee has said it spent at least $1.5 million at the Fairmont, a Washington hotel owned by the conglomerate AccorHotels. Barrack’s investment firm Colony Capital owned a roughly 5 percent stake in AccorHotels at the time of the inaugural, which it sold soon after. AccorHotels is run by a longtime former Colony executive. The inaugural spent as much or more at the Fairmont as it did at at the Trump International, the Times reported.
The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said this week that the subpoena to the inaugural committee “has nothing to do with the White House.”
This week, ProPublica and WNYC reported that Barrack’s firm developed a plan after the inaugural to profit from its close ties with Trump and the incoming administration.

Texto completo: 'Great nations do not fight endless wars," President Trump declared in his State of the Union address. It was a line that could have been delivered by President Barack Obama, who in 2015 memorably said, "I do not support the idea of endless war."
Just a few days before Trump's address, his own party delivered the president a stinging rebuke when Senate Republicans passed a resolution opposing his Syrian and Afghan withdrawals by an overwhelming bipartisan 68-to-23 vote. Trump's defenders say: That's just the foreign policy establishment advocating "forever war." When, they ask, will these wars end? When will we be able to declare victory and go home?
These are fair questions, and they deserve serious answers.
In traditional wars, victory comes when the enemy surrenders and lays down its arms. But this is not traditional war. We are not fighting nation-states with defined borders and armies, navies and air forces. We are fighting radical Islamist terrorists who are engaged in what Osama bin Laden called "a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam." There will be no signing ceremony on the deck of the USS Missouri. They will never lay down their arms. In this war, victory for the United States is every day that passes without a terrorist attack on American soil. And that daily victory is made possible because the men and women of the U.S. military are hunting the enemy in faraway lands.
For our enemies, victory comes when we give up the fight before they do. They have told us so. The 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told his CIA interrogator that "Americans don't realize we do not need to defeat you militarily; we only need to fight long enough for you to defeat yourself by quitting." That is how the terrorists see Obama's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Trump's planned withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan: America defeating itself by quitting.
It is understandable that, after 18 years, Americans want the war to end. But what we want is irrelevant. Just because we've grown tired of fighting doesn't mean that the enemy has.
Here is the hard truth: We don't get to choose when the war ends, but we do get to choose where it is fought. It can either be fought in the deserts of Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, or it can be fought on American streets and in American cities, as it was on Sept. 11, 2001. It's up to us.
Trump deserves enormous credit for taking the gloves off in the fight against the terrorists. He was absolutely correct when he declared in the State of the Union address, "When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters." But the Islamic State is not defeated. It still has tens of thousands of fighters under arms and, according to one estimate by the Institute for the Study of War, up to $400 million it smuggled out of Iraq, money that can be used to sustain its movement and plan attacks across the world.
In Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence estimates that there are about 20 terrorist groups - including al-Qaida and the Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State Khorasan, or IS-K - who would immediately gain an uncontested sanctuary from which to plan new attacks if America withdraws. On Jan. 28, the New York Times reported that a 2017 intelligence assessment, renewed last year, "says a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the United States within two years."
Right now, the U.S. military has its boot on the terrorists' necks. Take that boot away, though, and the terrorists will get up, regroup, rebuild and go back to trying to kill Americans in the United States.
In his address, Trump praised the heroism of the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. "They did not know if they would survive the hour," he said. "They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail."
The same is true today. Great nations do not quit before they prevail.

Texto completo: Floodwater Comedy Festival is back in Iowa City. This time, the festival will play host to one of the most well-known Iowa-born comedians.
The comedy festival is set to flood the streets of Iowa City with comedians from across the country Feb. 28 through March 2 at six venues in town.
The three headlining performers include Paul Rust, the Le Mars native who became a comedy star after landing the co-lead role on the Netflix romantic comedy show "Love" alongside Gillian Jacobs in 2016.
Featuring more than 50 comedians spread across more than 15 events, proceeds from the festival will go to the Johnson County Crisis Center and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI.
Festival passes that get buyers into all events are $55 and can be purchased online through littlevillagetickets.com. Tickets to individual shows are also available.
"We tried to stuff as much as we can in three days. We'll give everyone as many options as we can," Mike Lucas, a local comedian and one of the festival's executive producers, said Wednesday. "There's sketch shows, improv shows, AV-type shows where we have stuff projected. There's musical stuff, there's the Paul Rust reading."
Rust graduated from the University of Iowa in 2004 and soon began performing comedy with iconic Los Angeles comedy troupe The Upright Citizens Brigade. As an actor, he's performed in Quentin Trantino's Academy Award-winning movie "Inglorious Basterds," the comedy movie "I Love You Beth Cooper" in 2009 and numerous other TV and movie roles. He's best known as the co-star of "Love," which was created by Rust; his wife, Lesley Arfin; and comedy filmmaking heavyweight Judd Apatow.
He has also served as a writer on the beloved Emmy-winning sitcom "Arrested Development."
Rust's event at the comedy festival is slated for 6:30 p.m. March 2 at The Mill. Far from a traditional stand-up performance, the event will feature UI Theatre Department students helping perform Rust's original Upright Citizen Brigade sketches. Then Rust will take questions from the audience. Tickets are $8 now, $10 at the door.
"For me, adding him was like manna from heaven," Lucas said.
Leela Bassuk, co-executive producer of the festival and a junior at the University of Iowa, said that the festival collaborated with the UI Theatre Department last year to bring UI alum and Hollywood producer Spencer Griffin back to Iowa City. This year, they aimed to bring Rust to town. By messaging him through the festival's Instagram account, Bassuk helped land Rust and bring him back to his alma mater.
"His career in comedy, or his career in general, is just inspiring to anyone in the arts," Bassuk said.
The other two headliners are musical comedian Catherine Cohen and the Seattle-based stand-up Solomon Georgio.
Georgio has performed on Conan O'Brien's late night show "Conan," acted in Comedy Central's "Drunk History" and the HBO show "Crashing." He's also worked as a writer on "SpongeBob SquarePants" and "Adam Ruins Everything." He will perform at 9 p.m. March 2 at The Mill. Tickets are $12 now, $15 at the door.
Cohen has performed on the HBO show "High Maintenance." The New York-based comedian was recently featured in a New York Times story about the resurgence of musical comedians, calling her performance character "a preposterously preening, rigorously self-regarding, sexually arrogant diva in Lululemon leggings" who makes "jokes you can hum." She will perform at 9 p.m. March 1 at the Blue Moose Tap House. Tickets are $12 now, $15 at the door.
Bassuk, a member of UI's Paberback Rhino comedy troupe, said she heard Cohen's name thrown around a lot while she was working in the NYC comedy scene as an intern last summer.
"She's just super unique, amazingly funny," Bassuk said. "I just have the sense that this is someone that will be the face of this next generation of comedy."
The festival is marked with a series of other non-traditional comedy events.
Festival favorite the Iowa City Police Log, featuring local Christopher Patton whose Twitter feed shares often-humorous passages from the Iowa City Police Department's daily activity log, will return this year. The event features comedians re-creating some of the weirdest logs of the year. The event is at 10 p.m Feb. 28 at The Mill. Tickets are $5.
Panic! is an event that will feature comedians standing on stage with a screen behind them. They will improvise sketches to match the random images and videos shown behind them. The event is at 7 p.m. March 1 at the Iowa City Yacht Club. Tickets are $5.
The festival will also put a spotlight on about 35 local or Iowa-based comedians, Lucas said. Nearly half of those are college students, from both UI and Iowa State University.
For Bassuk, the festival is an invaluable opportunity for both the city and comedians working in town. For local comedians and students, the chance to meet and talk with nationally touring comedians could be invaluable.
For the citizens of Iowa City, Floodwater can serve as an opportunity to see the comedy scene of Iowa City up close and under the bright lights.
"There's so much comedy going on in this city at all times," Bassuk said. "This is us showing the community that, yeah, we're here and we're doing really good comedy. We're not just hobbyists here in Iowa City."

Trump gave best, most Reaganesque speech

Texto completo: President Donald Trump delivered the best, most Reaganesquespeech of his tenure Tuesday night. The challenge will be whether this becomes his leitmotif going forward or whether it is merely a forgotten and missed moment.
From start to finish, Trump did something he rarely does: extol the virtue of the everyday American and give credit to the freedom that is our birthright. Yes, there were a couple of moments of typical Trumpian braggadocio, but in the main this was an exercise in unusual humility.
Trump's political problems stem from the perception that he represents the United States' past in his character, his manner and his ideas - and in each, the perception that he embodies America's flaws instead of its virtues. Step by step, the speech worked to subtly undermine those perceptions.
About half of the people in the gallery were women or people of color, and the white men were seemingly all cops, veterans or Holocaust survivors. That was no accident.
His section on immigration was the least aggressive of any I can recall, and his line about how legal immigrants enrich the country goes directly at the perception that he is anti-immigrant.
The bulk of the speech could have been given by a 1990s-era Democrat. No extolling of the entrepreneur, a staple of modern Republican dogma. Promises of spending, spending, spending - on family leave, on childhood cancer, on infrastructure. Troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria, negotiation with North Korea, confrontation with Iran - this is the sort of policy mix that President Bill Clinton in his prime could have endorsed.
The same, sadly, is true of the president's foray into abortion policy. Whatever one thinks about Roe v. Wade, the specter of abortion at a time when it could easily be possible to save the life of the soon-to-be-born child was rightly condemned by Trump. When Clinton said that abortion should be "safe, legal and rare," he surely did not envision a day when most members of his political party would sit in stony silence at this part of the talk.
Trump's reelection task is simple yet profoundly difficult: He must persuade about 6 percent of the voters who have disapproved of him throughout his presidency to change their minds. The State of the Union speech is a wonderful statement of intent to do just that. Whether he can maintain the rhetorical and policy discipline to do that remains to be seen.

Mark Morris Dance Group's 'Pepperland'
The New York Times once called Mark Morris “the most successful and influential choreographer alive, and indisputably the most musical." His dance group will be back in Boston with “Pepperland," a dance tribute to The Beatles' landmark album “Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." In keeping with the eclectic sounds of the 1967 album, the dance will be accompanied by a chamber music ensemble of voice, soprano saxophone, two keyboards, theremin, and percussion. (Friday, Feb. 8, through Sunday, Feb. 10, at various times; Boch Center Shubert Theatre, Boston; $25-$75; all ages)

The Ghost of Paul Revere
It's perhaps fitting that this Portland, Maine, folk trio named for a man most famous for his midnight ride got some big national exposure in 2018 with a late-night appearance on Conan O'Brien's show.

Texto completo: A mixed bag of corporate earnings nudged stocks in the United States slightly lower Wednesday, snapping the market's five-day winning streak.
Communications sector stocks, led by steep declines in video game companies, accounted for most of the market's slide. Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts plunged after reporting earnings that fell far short of what Wall Street analysts were expecting. The companies also issued weak forecasts, citing tougher competition.
Gains in technology stocks offset some of those losses, with Skyworks Solutions leading a rally in semiconductor companies.
"This is an earnings-driven market, and where you've seen both positive and negative price movement today it has largely been sector and industry specific," said Paul Springmeyer, head of investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "On balance, sales and earnings are really trending mostly above expectations."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.22 points, or 0.1 percent, to 25,390.30. The S&P 500 index dropped 6.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,731.61. The benchmark index finished higher the previous five days in a row.
The Nasdaq composite slid 26.80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,375.28. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 2.20 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,518.02. Major European indexes also finished lower.
More than half of the companies in the S&P 500 have already reported results for the last three months of 2018, and most have turned in earnings that beat analysts' forecasts.
"What we are seeing is earnings are in fact slowing, but they still remain positive," Mr. Springmeyer said.
That has helped to allay some investors' fears over a slowdown in growth. Still, broader economic concerns continue to shadow the market, including uncertainty over the trade dispute between the United States and China, the impact tariffs are having on profits and consumers' wallets, and signs of a general slowdown in global growth.
The latest quarterly snapshots from video game companies failed to impress traders Wednesday.
Take-Two, maker of the "Grand Theft Auto" and "Red Dead Redemption" games series, gave investors a weak outlook for the current quarter. Electronic Arts, whose titles include "The Sims" and various sports games, including "Madden NFL," flagged disappointing results in sales of its latest "Battlefield" game.
Both companies are grappling with competition from Epic Games's hit game "Fortnite."
Take-Two and Electronic Arts plunged 13.8 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively. Activision Blizzard, maker of the "Call of Duty" and "Candy Crush" games, fell 10.1 percent.
A broad slide in homebuilder shares also weighed on the market. Hovnanian Enterprises led the pack with a 6.6 percent decline.
Traders bid up shares in several companies that reported improved quarterly results.
The company behind the popular photo-messaging app Snapchat surged 22 percent as advertising gains drove revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The revenue increase helped cut the company's losses. It also maintained its user base.
The New York Times vaulted 10.3 percent in heavy trading after the newspaper publisher added 265,000 digital subscriptions in the fourth quarter. Its earnings and revenue topped forecasts.
Capri Holdings, owner of the Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace clothing and footwear brands, climbed 11.3 percent after reporting quarterly earnings that were far larger than analysts were expecting.
Skyworks Solutions jumped 11.5 percent after the semiconductor company announced a $2 billion stock buyback plan. The news sent shares in several chipmakers higher. Microchip Technology climbed 7.3 percent, while Micron Technology gained 5.5 percent.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - A federal subpoena seeking documents from Donald Trump's inaugural committee is part of "a hysteria" over the fact that he's president, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday.
Federal prosecutors in New York issued the wide-ranging subpoena Monday, furthering a federal inquiry into a fund that has faced mounting scrutiny into how it raised and spent $107 million on events celebrating Trump's 2017 inauguration.
Inaugural committee spokeswoman Kristin Celauro said the committee still is reviewing the subpoena.
The investigation is the latest in a series of criminal inquiries into Trump's campaign and presidency.
"Actually, I think the common thread is a hysteria over the fact that this president became president," Sanders said Tuesday in response to a CNN question. "The common thread is that there is so much hatred out there that they will look for anything to try to create and tie problems to this president."
Later, Sanders said the investigation "has nothing to do with the White House."
"I think the biggest focus and the thing that most Americans care about has nothing to do with the inaugural and it has everything to do with what the path forward looks like," she said.
The subpoena seeks "all documents" related to the committee's donors and vendors, as well as records relating to "benefits" donors received after making contributions, according to a person familiar with the document. The person was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
"They want everything," the person said, referring to federal prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan declined to comment.
According to the subpoena, prosecutors are investigating a host of possible federal crimes, including mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and disclosure violations.
Among other things, the subpoena sought documents related to any payments made by donors "directly to contractors and/or vendors" who worked for the committee, the person familiar with the document said. Any such payments sent directly from donors to vendors, without being passed through the committee, could potentially violate public disclosure laws.
The subpoena also requested documents relating to donations "made by or on behalf of foreign nationals, including but not limited to any communications regarding or relating to the possibility of donations by foreign nationals," the person familiar with the document said.
The New York Times reported late last year that federal prosecutors were examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee. Foreign contributions to inaugural funds and PACs are prohibited under federal law.
The head of the inaugural committee, Tom Barrack, confirmed that he was questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller in 2017. But he told The AP last year that he is not a target of the Mueller investigation, which is focused on Russian interference in the 2016 elections.
The subpoena issued Monday does not mention Barrack or any members of the inaugural committee by name.
But it did request documents related to Imaad Zuberi, a Los Angeles based financier, and his company, Avenue Ventures, which gave $900,000 to the inaugural committee. Zuberi's company also gave $100,000 to the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee to pay off debt from the 2016 Republican National Convention.
Zuberi has given more than $1.1 million to Trump-backed organizations and has accompanied the foreign minister of Qatar during meetings with Trump officials.
A spokesman for Zuberi, Steve Rabinowitz, said Zuberi has not had any contact with federal investigators about the inaugural committee.
"It's well known that after supporting President Obama and later Hillary Clinton, Imaad gave generously and directly to the Trump inaugural committee but others gave substantially more," Rabinowitz said. "If in fact he is named on this subpoena, never mind somehow named alone, he is bewildered why."
The subpoena also seeks records involving the committee's dealings with Stripe, a credit-card processing company based in San Francisco that handled online payments for the committee.
A Stripe spokesman declined to comment on the prosecutors' request but said in a statement the company receives "hundreds of subpoenas and other law enforcement requests in the normal course of business, as do other infrastructure companies of our scale."

Online’s ‘walled gardens’ must stop assuming real news is free

Texto completo: Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat.
As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as "regulators" of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies.
The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 planned layoffs at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to pledge to spend $300 million each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products.
But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information.
We can start with the fact that "free" isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have deals to pay music publishers when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on "free." Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value?
The tech giants are also run as "walled gardens" that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world.
Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading "news" that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly.
A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news.
David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an interview with The Guardian: "Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption."
Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms.
Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.

Ex-Starbucks CEO Schultz to talk at Purdue

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE – Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, will be at Purdue University Thursday to make what The Washington Post reported would be "a major policy address" leading up to the possibility that he might make an independent run for president.
Purdue President Mitch Daniels on Tuesday morning confirmed that Schultz would be on campus Thursday. Daniels told the J&C that Schultz reached out to Purdue about the event.
The talk will be at 1 p.m. Thursday in Fowler Hall, a 388-seat venue in Purdue's Stewart Center. Seating will be limited "to invited and ticketed members of the university's governance councils," according to Tim Doty, a Purdue spokesman.
A livestream of the talk will be shown in Loeb Playhouse, which is down the hall in Purdue's Stewart Center and has 1,038 seats.
The format for the event — lecture, Q&A with Daniels or straight-up rally — wasn't immediately specified by Purdue or Schultz's team.
Schultz has been a center of attention after saying he was considering an independent bid in 2020. Some Democrats have blasted his strategy of going for moderate voters, saying that a third-party candidacy would siphon votes from a Democratic nominee and help President Donald Trump win re-election.
In the past week, Schultz has criticized both Trump and candidates lining up on the left, insisting that he could win the White House by going for American voters disaffected by the partisan fighting from both sides.
"I am certainly prepared for the cynics and the naysayers to come out and say this cannot be done," Schultz told The New York Times. "I don't agree with them. I think it's un-American to say it can't be done. I'm not doing this to be a spoiler."
Trump went after Schultz after "60 Minutes" aired a profile of billionaire on Jan. 27.
"Howard Schultz doesn't have the 'guts' to run for President!" Trump tweeted. "Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the 'smartest person.' Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!"
Over the weekend, on CNN, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat said to be considering a run in 2020, called an independent run by Schultz "an enormous mistake."
"He has had a successful legacy as a businessperson," Inslee said on CNN, "and it would be tarnished beyond imagination if he does the only thing that his candidacy would do would be to help the re-election of Donald Trump."
Bill Burton, a spokesman for Schultz, told The Washington Post leading up to the Purdue visit: "Howard burst onto the scene in a way that no one anticipated, and now that a majority of Americans know who is he is, he is laying out some of his ideas and prescriptions for the greatest problems facing our country."
Aaron Banks, Purdue's student body president, said Schultz's team reached out this week to Purdue Student Government, which will sponsor the visit Thursday.
"I believe it is important for us as an organization to provide opportunities for students to hear dialogue from and interact directly with people like Howard Schultz, so we jumped on the opportunity," Banks said. "As someone who is passionate about entrepreneurship and business, Howard Schultz is someone who I've admired in regards to those two categories. I'm interested to hear his thoughts on politics and his potential role in them in the future."
There's another connection to Purdue, or at least to Daniels.
When asked at week ago by a reporter from Axios to name a Republican he admired, Schultz mentioned Daniels, who was a two-time Republican governor in Indiana before he came to Purdue in January 2013.
In September 2016, Daniels hosted a Q&A at Purdue with Gary Johnson, former New Mexico governor who was making a presidential run as a Libertarian. During the 2016 campaign, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders also held a campaign event at Purdue ahead of Indiana's May primary.

Texto completo: You can learn a tremendous amount about our country's history and its present state by reading whose death didn't merit an obituary in The New York Times.
The newspaper launched "Overlooked" last March, in time for International Women's Day, with a series of obits for 15 remarkable women whose deaths went unremarked upon at the time of their death. (Author Sylvia Plath, journalist Ida B. Wells, Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells led to a medical revolution, Margaret Abbott, the first American woman to win an Olympics championship.)
Now, the first week of Black History Month, the paper is adding a series of prominent black men and women who didn't receive obituaries.
Scott Joplin, for instance, the pianist and composer behind "The Entertainer" and "Maple Leaf Rag," who died in 1917. From the "Overlooked" obit: "In the post-Civil War era, the cruel breath of slavery and the aborted plan of Reconstruction still hung over the American South. But in the Joplin home, banjo and fiddle music filled the family's evenings, giving the children -- Scott in particular -- a sense of music's power to move." Joplin died penniless and was buried in an unmarked grave.
His music wove its way throughout the 1973 movie "The Sting," which renewed the public's interest in him. "It was as if the nation had suddenly discovered a new and dazzling composer," the obit reads. "Joplin's grave was given a suitable marker. And in 1976, he was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his contributions to American music."
Also: Major Taylor, the first African-American world champion in cycling and the second black athlete to win a world championship in any sport. He was living in Chicago when he died, broke, in 1932. The Chicago Defender published a short obituary at the time.
Also: Civil rights pioneer Elizabeth Jennings, who refused to leave a whites-only trolley on her way to her organist gig at the First Colored American Congregational Church in Lower Manhattan. She was kicked off, sued the trolley company for damages and won -- 100 years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat for a white passenger.
Also: Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first black baseball player to play in the major leagues -- as catcher for the American Association's Toledo Blue Stockings in 1884 -- long before Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.
Also: Margaret Garner, whose "Overlooked" obit reads, "Motherhood, across race, language, country and culture, is understood to be complicated and powerful: a tsunami of gut and joy and fear and heartache. Garner found herself in that fleeting, lightless instant of a mother's incongruous love on a frigid night, when slave catchers surrounded her cousins' home and when she made the decision, in one soul-chilling moment, to slit the throat of her 2-year-old daughter rather than return her to slavery."
Garner's story inspired Toni Morrison's 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "Beloved." Her death went unremarked upon in newspapers. Until now.
The new obituaries, published online and in a special print section Sunday, adds a dozen lives to the "Overlooked" project.
"Many of them were a generation removed from slavery," obituary editor Amisha Padnani writes in a note to readers. "To carve a name for themselves, they sometimes had to make myth out of a painful history, misrepresenting their past to gain a better footing in their future. They were ambitious and creative, becoming painters and composers, filmmakers and actors. Others used their imaginations to invent and innovate. Often they felt an unspoken greater mission to break the constraints society placed on their race.
"Some managed to achieve success in their lifetimes, only to die penniless, buried in paupers' graves," Padnani continues. "Almost all of them reached deep within themselves to push back against harsh circumstances, the likes of which are unimaginable for many of us today."
Unimaginable, but essential to read and digest and remember if you want to understand our nation's painful, often shameful, past.

'Fairview' Will Return To the New York Stage

Texto completo: After a successful run at the 73-seat Soho Rep theater last summer, Jackie Sibblies Drury's acclaimed play "Fairview" will return to challenge audiences in a bigger space this June.
The play, which both chief theater critics for The New York Times named among the year's top 10 productions, will be remounted at Theater for a New Audience's Polonsky Shakespeare Center, in Brooklyn, from June 2 to June 30.
The return engagement marks the second time that the Polonsky's 299-seat main stage has hosted a play that originated at Soho Rep, following "An Octoroon," Branden Jacobs-Jenkins's formally inventive comedy about race and American history, which ran at the Polonsky in 2015.
On its face, "Fairview" is about an extended black family preparing for an important dinner. The tone starts off light and the plot stays within the confines of a family comedy. But as the play progresses, the mood shifts and the assumptions it invites are turned on their heads.
"You begin watching by feeling mildly amused, then uneasy, then annoyed, then unsettled," Ben Brantley wrote in his review for the Times. "And then abruptly you're free-falling down a rabbit hole, and there's no safe landing in sight."
"Fairview," which was directed by Sarah Benson, Soho Rep's artistic director, was extended three times there. The play moved to Berkeley Repertory Theater, which co-commissioned it, in October.
Casting for the new production has not been announced. But the play's much-discussed staging will be retained and adapted for the Polonsky, according to a publicist for the show.
Ms. Drury's new play, "Marys Seacole," begins previews at Lincoln Center Theater on Feb. 9.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Ben Anderson: Jazz blockbuster trade is nearly a decade in the making

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Jazz have waited a long time to make a splash on the NBA trade market, and it appears they may finally be close to pulling the trigger on a major deal.
Several of the NBA’s news breakers, including The New York Times' Marc Stein and ESPN’s Zach Lowe have revealed the Jazz are in serious talks with the Memphis Grizzlies for guard Mike Conley Jr.
Conley, a 31-year-old point guard, has had a near All-Star career derailed by injuries, and has been overlooked in an era of elite point guards in the league. Just as Conley helped developed the "Grit and Grind" culture in Memphis, he appears to be an ideal fit in Utah as an elite perimeter defender and floor general with the ball in his hands.
A move like this is one the Jazz seem to have been building up to for nearly the past decade.
Since Deron Williams departed from the Jazz, the team has had a fluctuation rate between a mid-level playoff team and a team drafting in the late lottery. The Williams trade brought in Derrick Favors, Devin Harris and a series of draft picks. The Jazz gave up on their existing core player in Williams and decided to undergo the long game, a sometimes painful process of building a roster through the draft.
Somewhat ironically, a blockbuster trade this season could be centered around Favors, the former third-overall pick who signaled the beginning of the new-look Jazz.
While Ricky Rubio appears to be the main player named in a Conley trade, Favors' name has consistently been thrown around in trade rumors over the past two years and could be included alongside Rubio to take back extra salaries from Memphis.
While the patience the Jazz have asked of the fan base has been trying at times, now may finally be the right time to turn this roster into a true contender. Donovan Mitchell continues to evolve as an elite scoring guard in the NBA, with plenty of room to grow.
Meanwhile, Rudy Gobert narrowly missed out on an All-Star selection, but is nearly a lock to make another All-NBA team and potentially repeat as the league’s Defensive Player of the Year.
With two years remaining on Mitchell’s rookie contract, as well as having Gobert and Joe Ingles under contract through 2021, Conley’s two-year, $67 million contract fits well with the Jazz's plan. The team would have two years to compete for a title in the Western Conference before having to negotiate the next round of contracts.
The Jazz have built the current roster specifically for one of two scenarios: Surround Mitchell and Gobert with a max-level free agent this summer, where the Jazz could have as much as $30 million in cap room; or for this exact situation, where the Jazz could take on the max contract of a star from a team that is needing to begin a rebuild.
With a team that’s showed an ability to win a first-round playoff series in each of the last two seasons, the Jazz can realistically hope to take the next step by adding one final piece to the puzzle. Patience has been a common request from the team’s front office, but Jazz fans may finally be on the verge of reaping the reward of a long rebuilding process.

Texto completo:  Alec Baldwin says that despite reports otherwise, no punches were thrown in the November parking-space incident for which he pleaded guilty to harassment last month. 
Joking on Monday's "Ellen DeGeneres Show" that the true story was that "I punched a nun ... I pulled her out of her car," the 60-year-old Amityville and Massapequa native conceded that he had gotten into an argument with a man over the spot. "But what's interesting is that in New York ... there's cameras everywhere. ... So they said I punched this guy, which was not true - the cameras show from every angle that no one punched anybody. But once that story's out there, the D.A. never gets out there after the fact and says, 'Mr. Baldwin is just such a great guy. He would never do a thing like [that].' "
Baldwin added he "felt bad" that people accused him of punching the man. "I mean, did I have an argument with the guy? Yeah, I thought he was going to run my wife over with his car when he was stealing my parking spot. ... But now he and I are best friends," Baldwin joked, quickly assuring, "I'm kidding."
The actor was arrested Nov. 2 after a car had pulled into a space someone was holding for Baldwin outside his apartment building on East 10th Street in Greenwich Village, according to a police report. In court records, Baldwin later admitted shoving Wojciech Cieszkowski, 49, who was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital with a jaw injury, The New York Times reported. Police issued Baldwin a summons for misdemeanor assault and harassment.
On Nov. 2, Baldwin accepted a plea deal that dropped the former charge, and was ordered pay a $120 fine and to verify in court in March that he had completed an anger-management course. He tweeted afterward on the Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Foundation account that "the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much."
Baldwin over the years has been involved in several high-profile incidents of losing his temper publicly, often outside his building where paparazzi congregate but also during air travel and once while bicycling in Manhattan.

Stacey Abrams' SOTU response role comes with guaranteed privilege, hero status

Texto completo: Stacey Abrams hit the jackpot when she was picked to deliver the Democrats’ response to President Trump’s State of the Union Address: She’s a female minority who can’t be held politically accountable for anything because she doesn't hold any office.

ABC News on Monday ran the headline, “For Democrats, Stacey Abrams sends key message on gender and race in [State of the Union] response.”

A news article in the New York Times that same day featured a bunch of Democrats who want Abrams to run for U.S. Senate (because in today’s Democratic Party, nothing positions you for national office like a failed campaign in the style of Beto O’Rourke).

There is no other person on the national scene who enjoys more privilege among the national press than Abrams, who lost her bid for Georgia governor last year and refused to accept the result long after the writing was already on the wall. Her delivery of the response will fit the Trump-hates-women-and-minorities narrative that Democrats and the news media run day in and out.

Even if she botches the response on Tuesday, Abrams will still be a hero for having taken on white male Trump. That's because she can expect the national media to frame the conflict as an epic battle between white and black, privilege and victim.

In November last year, Trump engaged several black reporters who confronted him with critical questions by doing what he does with literally any reporter of any race — he lashed out. He called American Urban Radio Networks and CNN contributor April Ryan a “loser” who “doesn’t know what the hell she’s doing.” He told CNN correspondent Abby Phillip that she asks “a lot of stupid questions.” And he accused PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor of asking a “racist” question.

All of those women are black, and the rest of the media would never let you forget it. Never mind that Trump behaves this way with anyone in the media he deems disrespectful.

CNN’s Jim Acosta, who is Cuban, had his White House credential stripped, and Trump called him “rude” and “terrible.”

NBC’s Peter Alexander is white and Trump told him, “I’m not a big fan of yours, either.”

The Washington Post’s George Will is white and Trump has said he “looks like a dumb guy.”

The entire 2016 Republican primary field of candidates, almost all white men, were picked off one by one as Trump ruthlessly mocked their appearances and personalities. They were not all white, but most of them were.

Right after taking office, Trump belittled white male Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-Calif., for crying on TV, giving him the nickname "Cryin' Chuck Schumer."

There was little sympathy for any of these victims of Trump's ire from liberals and the press. But after Abrams gets her time on national TV, she’ll become an exceptional victim for the media to hold up as an example of Trump’s “bigotry.”

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
Shintaro Okamoto spent several long hours outdoors in Manhattan on Friday, a day so cold that anyone who could stay indoors did. But for Mr. Okamoto, the 21-degree weather was fine.
He is an ice sculptor.
He has shaped blocks of ice into everything from old-fashioned locomotives to giant beer bottles. He has done ice sculptures in Alaska when it was 30 degrees below zero. That is too cold. "The ice won't join together," he said. The joining is done by squirting water between the blocks, like mortar. At 30 below, "the water freezes before we can squirt it."
On Friday, bundled-up subway riders were still shivering on chilly train platforms and coffee-cart vendors were stomping their feet, but Mr. Okamoto did not have to worry about water problems. Several gallons were sloshing around in a huge plastic jug that looked as if it had been snatched from a water cooler. What fused the blocks was not squirted but poured.
Like a surgeon preparing to operate, Mr. Okamoto laid out his tools -- chain saws, chisels and grinders. And then he and some of his ice-sculpting colleagues went to work, happily, on a replica of one of the most famous statues in the world, the Statue of Liberty.
But not the whole statue, just the torch, the hand and the arm.
A day like Friday was also different from a day with temperatures in the 30s. The torch was not going to drip or droop, at least not while he was still carving and chipping and molding and modeling. Ice is not the marble of Michelangelo's David. It will lose the form Mr. Okamoto gives it.
"It continues to transform" after he finishes, he said. "That's inevitable. That's part of the drama. It's changing, but constantly reminding us of what the source was."
The source in question -- the object to be sculpted in ice on Friday -- was the Statue of Liberty's original torch, with the hand holding it and the disembodied arm, cut off at the elbow. These odd-looking body parts had sat in the same place, Madison Square Park, for several years in the 1870s and 1880s to raise money for the project's completion.
Mr. Okamoto and colleagues from his studio worked in the base of the fountain in the park, which had been drained. There is melting in the forecast, even if the National Weather Service was not exactly explicit when it predicted a high of 37 degrees on Sunday, 54 on Monday and 58 on Tuesday.
Bringing Mr. Okamoto to Madison Square Park was the idea of Arlene Shechet, an artist best known for colorful ceramics. She created "Full Steam Ahead," an exhibition of her sculptures that will be on display in the park until April 28. The title refers to the monument to Admiral David Glasgow Farragut in the park. It was Farragut who said "full speed ahead," or perhaps "full steam ahead," during a Civil War battle -- along with "damn the torpedoes," according to some accounts.
"What better material to work with than ice in the middle of the winter?" Ms. Shechet asked, adding that she wanted to draw people into the park, even in 20-degree weather.
"In New York, our lives are so much more interior," she said. "We experience winter as the time to go indoors and not appreciate some of the more beautiful things that winter can present. Ice is one of them."
Ms. Shechet had more in mind than the torch-and-arm sculpture. She also asked Mr. Okamoto to create a statue of Audrey Munson, the all-but-forgotten model for artists in the early years of the 20th century. She was the heroine at the Maine monument in Columbus Circle and the Roman goddess in the Pulitzer Fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel. She is above the Municipal Building, in front of the Low Memorial Library and Columbia University and at the Brooklyn end of the Brooklyn Bridge (as Miss Manhattan).
Unlike those statues, Mr. Okamoto's bears Miss Munson's name.
Unlike those statues, too, Mr. Okamoto's will melt. He said he had designed it to do so gracefully.
As for the Statue of Liberty, it was constructed over nine years; Mr. Okamoto's replica over a few hours. The designer of the statue, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, had been mesmerized by the view of New York when he arrived by ship -- "here where people get their first view of the New World," he said.
One of Mr. Okamoto's colleagues, Benjamin Grasso, had a view of the torch and arm from a color photograph that he held in one hand. In his other hand was a chisel that he used to sketch the shape to be cut into the ice, first with a chain saw, then with smaller hand tools.
But where Mr. Okamoto's replica was solid and translucent, Bartholdi's was hollow, with a thin copper skin. Bartholdi had enlisted the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, who designed the torch-bearing arm, but he died in 1879 without devising a plan for the rest of the statue. For that, Bartholdi recruited the engineer Gustave Eiffel, not yet famous for a certain tower in Paris.
New Yorkers had to be persuaded to accept the statue, and when the original installation went up in Madison Square Park, there were skeptics. "The sculptor sent us an isolated and useless arm and hand," The New York Times complained about the display.
Mr. Okamoto's torch-bearing wrist was a fraction of the size of the actual one. Brooke Kamin Rapaport -- a curator who oversees art installations as part of the Madison Square Park Conservancy's public art program, known as Mad. Sq. Art -- said the original, when it lay in the park in the 19th century, reached the treetops. When the rest of the statue arrived from France and was assembled on what became known as Liberty Island, it was hailed as the largest statue ever built -- until then, anyway. It was briefly the tallest structure in New York.
"You can imagine the scale of the buildings then," Ms. Rapaport said. "We're not talking about the excessive height of skyscrapers that we have now. It was quite a spectacle." The New York Times art critic John Russell, writing in the 1980s, said that the torch and hand had "overpowered their surroundings."
By contrast, Mr. Okamoto's replica was only about eight feet tall.
Mr. Okamoto and his colleagues did some preliminary work on the Statue of Liberty replica at his studio in Astoria, Queens, shaping the blocks they joined together in the park. For the ride to Manhattan, they wrapped the blocks in insulation blankets and stretch wrapping, and loaded them onto a truck.
"Sometimes we have to be a mechanical engineer," he said. "Sometimes we have to be animal wildlife artists. For something like this, we had to dig up historical references. We spent time studying actual references."
But his research did not include a trip to the statue itself. He has never climbed the 377 steps from the lobby to the crown platform, although work has taken him to Liberty Island. He was hired once to build ice bars and carve logos for a party on the lawn.
In warm weather, of course.

Texto completo: Louis C.K. is trying to re-start his career, and his next stop will be in the Tampa Bay area.

The controversial comic, who recently returned to live performances after a sexual misconduct scandal brought his career to a halt, has been booked for six shows this week at Side Splitters Comedy Club. Hell perform at 8 p.m. Wednesday, 8:30 p.m. Thursday, 8 and 10:30 p.m. Friday and 7 and 9:30 p.m. Feb. 9. Tickets are $30 and up.

In 2017, the New York Times reported the stories of five women who alleged C.K. had for years engaged in sexual misconduct, including masturbating in their presence. C.K. has admitted the stories were true.

In August, C.K. began making surprise appearances in comedy clubs, and shortly thereafter began selling tickets to billed performances around the country. Those, too, have not been controversy-free; leaked audio of a recent show featured instances of C.K. mocking the student survivors of last years Parkland shooting.

In January, Side Splitters owner Brian Thompson told the culture website Vulture that he would have no problem bringing C.K. into his club because he is going to sell tickets.

Booking somebody doesnt necessarily mean youre condoning things they may have done or been accused of, Thompson told Vulture. I believe in second chances and like to be open-minded about things. Certainly if I was one of the alleged victims I would hate to see his name on things. Id hate to see him on TV and all. But the reality is he is a business, and if he still sells tickets, people will still book him.

The shows in Tampa will be entirely cell phone-free; fans will be required to deposit them in locked bags for the duration of the performance.

Texto completo: By Alix Strauss Photographs by Vincent Tullo
Ian Ginsberg stood in his West Village office above C.O. Bigelow, considered by some to be the oldest pharmacy in the United States. He was unwrapping vintage items from the early 1900s: An amber bottle filled with German Salts; a glass container of Violet Witch Hazel with a crown top; a round, pink box that once held pills. Each had been meticulously packed in tissue paper and Bubble Wrap. Mr. Ginsberg handled the objects as if he had come from an excavation site.
In many ways, he had.
"These items still give me chills," he said. "They are an incredible treasure trove of history; a snapshot of health care through the ages."
Mr. Ginsberg, the Indiana Jones of apothecary relics, is also the president, owner, and historical expert of C.O. Bigelow.
Established in 1838 by Dr. Galen Hunter, the store was originally called the Village Apothecary Shoppe. In 1880, Clarence Otis Bigelow purchased it and renamed it after himself, moving it 22 years later, two doors down, to Sixth Avenue and Ninth Street, where it stands today.
Mr. Ginsberg's grandfather and his brother-in-law bought the drugstore in 1939. Over the last 180 years, the Ginsberg family has amassed more than 10,000 pharmaceutical and beauty items, including original prescription and recipe books from the 1800s; tablet rollers; old photographs; and mid-20th-century cosmetics packaging.
Earlier this month, Mr. Ginsberg invited The New York Times to photograph some of them.
Mr. Ginsberg, 56, a soft-spoken man who slightly resembles the actor Ben Stiller, graduated from pharmacy school in 1985 and purchased Bigelow from his father in 1997. "Until I got there, everything you see here had been buried in the basement. They were in boxes, thrown around like garbage. The more I dug, the more stuff I found."
Eventually Mr. Ginsberg moved the artifacts to a warehouse in Long Island. Some of the prize possessions were distributed between his home, the store, and the company's two offices.
The register "weighs more than 100 pounds so we don't move it around," Mr. Ginsberg said. "I have fond memories of this being around my entire life."
Letter From Eleanor Roosevelt, 1942 "Before they moved to the White House, the Roosevelts lived on Washington Square," Mr. Ginsberg said. "As a gift, my father sent Eleanor Roosevelt a bunch of Bigelow products. The letter is addressed to Mr. Bigelow, which is what people called my grandfather."
The Original Store A painting of this photograph hangs inside, Mr. Ginsberg said. "If you look closely, in the right window you can see the image of a pharmacist, which could be Clarence Otis Bigelow."
Mark Twain was a customer "This is a charge account ledger from 1906 with an incredible collection of notable New Yorkers," Mr. Ginsberg said. "While we don't specifically know what S.L. Clemens, a.k.a. Mark Twain, purchased, we do know that he paid his bills on time."
"The store is an interior landmark," Mr. Ginsberg explained. "The ceiling is an original canvas ceiling, the fixtures are original oak, the tile floor is original, the chandeliers used to burn gas and were lit during the blackout in 1977."
Each generation of Ginsberg has evolved the store during his tenure. Mr. Ginsberg's grandfather was an ethical pharmacist who introduced medication dispensing methods and cultivated relationships with the most important doctors, and thus, their patients. Mr. Ginsberg's father curated the makeup, fragrance and beauty products of the '50s and '60s.

"We've gone from making powder papers and rolling pills to robots dispensing medication," said Mr. Ginsberg, who, in addition to creating Bigelow's skin care and beauty brand, has watched the pharmaceutical world change drastically. "We've moved away from cocaine eye drops to making chocolate or banana flavored antibiotics for kids. We no longer have charge account ledgers. Instead we have phone apps that let you refill your medications."
Forced to modernize in some ways, the store does keep some old-fashioned sensibilities, offering unique services that are not so easy for Duane Reade and CVS to match.
"We still compound liquids, creams, powders, and suppositories. If something isn't available in liquid form we can make it liquid," Mr. Ginsberg said. "We also cater to pets and filling their prescriptions. That accounts for five to 10 percent of our weekly prescription business. If you want tuna or salmon flavored medication, we can do that."
The store has always had a celebrity following. Sarah Jessica Parker, Elvis Costello, Jessica Lange, Graydon Carter, Amy Sedaris, Justin Theroux and Dianne Von Furstenberg have all been spotted in the aisles. Many are hooked on the Bigelow products.
"Some of the products we offer are original formulas recreated from the archives, like our Lemon Body Cream, which is a recipe that goes back to 1870, and Dr. Galen's Skin Tonic, named after our founder."
After the photo session, while Mr. Ginsberg fastidiously re-wrapped and returned his artifacts into thick, plastic containers, his expression was slightly sad, as if saying goodbye to old friends.
"I've always wanted to do a gallery showing. It's on my bucket list. It would be so impactful for people to see these," he said. "We're still an independent family business trying to survive in a modern world. But people gravitate toward things that are real. It doesn't get any more real than these items."

Texto completo: I've spent most of the last five years traveling across dozens of countries. The question I hear most, by far, is "how can you afford that?" No one believes it's possible to travel cheaply and comfortably, but it is. Since I live on the road for months at a time, I want both. I'm guessing you do too. Here's how you can have it.
Stay at a hostel. No, really.
Forget everything you think you know about hostels. Today's hostels are clean, cheap, for all ages, and in many cases, gorgeous. I've stayed in hostels that were better than most hotels I've been in. Though the average age skews younger, I'm 40 and I'm never the oldest in any hostel I've stayed at, and often I'm not even the oldest in my room.
If you're curious about these low-cost, often-luxe living spaces, check out hostel booking sites like Hostelworld and Hostelz. You'll get user reviews for each hostel, plus tons of pictures. I've stayed at over 100 hostels in the last few years and most were great, some were awesome, and only a handful were bad. Generally, though not always, you'll have to share a bathroom, and the cheapest rooms are shared rooms. However, most hostels have private rooms, too. Staying in hostels, even for just part of your trip, will save you hundreds. Who knows, you might even make some new friends.
Skip the restaurants
If it's an important meal, or a spot you really want to try, don't feel guilty about spending money in a restaurant. If the food is great, never feel guilty. But if it's just a quick bite while you're exploring, don't waste the time or money.
Grocery stores and markets around the world offer far cheaper food than any restaurant. If you stay at a hostel or Airbnb, most have kitchens and refrigerators, so you can store easily prepared meals or ingredients you buy while you're out and about. Depending on where you're headed, the street food might be exceptionally cheap and incredibly good. If street food isn't your style, in many parts of the world, convenience stores like 7-Eleven have delicious fresh food, and corner stores offer cafeteria-style dinners for local-friendly prices.
Pack light
If your luggage is too heavy to easily carry, you've packed too much. Being able to carry your luggage with ease opens all sorts of money-saving options, like walking and public transport, instead of needing an expensive cab or car service to get you and your bags from place to place.
Regardless of how long your trip is, aim for no more than a carry-on and a day pack. That is, unless you're going someplace cold and you need to bring winter wear, or you're traveling for a specific reason that requires extra gear. Otherwise, we have some tips on what you can leave behind on your next trip, like hair dryers and a lot of clothes.
Use local SIM cards
Roaming fees are like an ominous and pending threat looming over any trip. How much will checking email cost? Will I be charged $5 to look at Google Maps? Get a local SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card instead, if you can. SIM cards are available virtually everywhere you might travel. You may even find them in vending machines or kiosks in the airport, although those will likely be more expensive than one you'll find once you get into town or closer to your hotel.
A local SIM will make your phone work pretty much just as it does at home, without the roaming fees. For around $20, your local SIM will get you unlimited or near-unlimited data for your entire trip. You may want to stop by a local phone store just to make sure you get one that'll pair your phone up with a carrier that will support it, and your phone will need to be unlocked if it isn't already. For more, Wirecutter, the New York Times company that reviews products, has a complete guide to using your phone abroad here, that full-disclosure, I wrote.
Buy a local metro card
The local train or subway systems in nearly every major city have cards that offer discounted rates for people who ride frequently. If you're in a city for more than a few days, these will likely save you a lot. Load the card with a bit of money, and each ride is cheaper than if you bought them individually. Plus, it feels pretty cool to slap down your card at a turnstile like a local.
Many local transit systems offer temporary visitor cards. Be wary, though, I've found these aren't always cheaper than buying individual rides. Cities with reusable cards, like London's Oyster, Tokyo's Pasmo, and others, require a small deposit, which you can get refunded when you leave. Often they'll give you the remaining balance too, though not always. I just keep mine. Maybe you'll go back next year!
Avoid the tourist traps
I always thought this was obvious, yet restaurants near tourist hot spots are always packed. They're almost universally overpriced, with mediocre food. The worst pasta I've had in my life was adjacent to St Mark's Square in Venice. Instead, walk a few blocks in any direction. You're bound to find something cheaper and better.

Texto completo: WEST HARTFORD, Conn. - The afternoon high was 12 degrees here Thursday, and as soon as the sun set, the temperatures dropped quickly into single digits. The middle of winter in New England: a perfect time for a 76-year-old man who loves to play golf to be somewhere in the south, enjoying warmth and the fruits of a Hall of Fame career as a basketball coach.
Instead, Jim Calhoun sat in a tiny locker room inside O'Connell Center at the University of Saint Joseph, a school of a little more than 1,000 undergraduates that began admitting men in the fall.
"It's all the same," he said, twisting his hands nervously in front of him. "And it's not the same."
"Five minutes, Coach," called Ben Wallek, his team manager.
There would be about 500 people in the building, almost a sellout, for the game between Saint Joseph and Johnson & Wales. This is Calhoun's team now - his life, one he eagerly chose - more than six years after retiring from Connecticut, nearly eight years after coaching it to the national title in front of 75,421 in Houston's Reliant Stadium and almost 14 years after his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
In 26 seasons at U-Conn., Calhoun built from next to nothing a program that won three national championships and produced NBA players by the bushel. "Nineteen lottery picks," Calhoun likes to point out. Which is why it made sense for him to quietly move full time to his home on Hilton Head in South Carolina after he stepped down in 2012. He had had myriad health problems, including three bouts with cancer and two serious bicycle accidents.
"I was beat up when I stopped," he admitted, sitting in the tiny office he occupies at O'Connell Center. "I was hobbling badly because of the bike accident I'd had, and I was tired. I was 70. It was the right time."
Calhoun's last couple of years at U-Conn. were the best of times and the worst of times. There was the out-of-nowhere national title in 2011, when Connecticut went into the Big East tournament as the No. 9 seed and then won 11 consecutive postseason games to claim Calhoun's third national championship, leaving him behind only John Wooden, Mike Krzyzewski and Adolph Rupp on the all-time list and tied with Bob Knight. (Roy Williams has since won a third title.)
But there also were an embarrassing NCAA investigation involving a former manager offering illegal inducements to a recruit and academic issues during Calhoun's final years that landed the school on probation during Kevin Ollie's first season as Calhoun's successor.
Even with his iconic status in Connecticut sealed, Calhoun was restless. He worked about 30 games a year for ESPN, keeping his hand in the game, but it wasn't the same.
"I missed the highs, and I missed the lows," he said. "More than anything I missed having something at stake. I never felt any pressure going to do a game on TV. I had an itch that needed scratching."
He flirted with Boston College in 2014 but ultimately decided it was too soon to come back, especially to an ACC program that would need a deep-dive effort to rebuild.
Then came a call from Bill Cardarelli, an old friend, who had been the longtime athletic director at Saint Joseph. The school, founded in 1932, was planning to admit men for the first time in the fall of 2018. Cardarelli want to know whether Calhoun would help him put together a men's basketball team.
"I have no idea how many games we'll win or how long I'll stay," he said. "But I feel like I can make a mark here - on the school, on the kids. That means something to me."
It wasn't until this past September that the school formally announced that Calhoun would coach. By then, he had spent months scouting players and recruiting a team. ESPN had a camera crew begin following him in April. The New York Times did a long story on Calhoun's return. WTIC, the 50,000-watt Hartford radio station, signed on to broadcast home games. Joe D'Ambrosio, the play-by-play man throughout Calhoun's U-Conn. tenure, does the play-by-play.
"If nothing else, Saint Joseph has to be the only D-III team in history with its games on a 50,000-watt radio station," D'Ambrosio said laughing, after taping, by his estimate, his 853rd pregame show with Calhoun.
When word got out that Calhoun would coach the basketball team, applications jumped at Saint Joseph. "They told me it was 115 percent higher," Calhoun said. "They call it the Calhoun Effect."
There was just one roadblock in the way of his return: another bout with cancer. This time it was stomach cancer, unrelated to the previous bouts with prostate cancer and skin cancer. Calhoun had been undergoing chemotherapy until this past fall when his doctors told him surgery was the best option. And so on Oct. 8 - a week before the start of practice - Calhoun had about 60 percent of his stomach removed.
Nine days later, he was on the sideline for practice, watching Glenn Miller, the former Brown and Penn head coach and Calhoun's longtime assistant at U-Conn., run the workouts with a roster of 18 freshmen and one sophomore - a Division I transfer. Since there are no scholarships in Division III, Calhoun could bring in as many players as he wanted.
When the season opened Nov. 6, Calhoun was 100 percent Calhoun, pushing everyone in his orbit to the limit.
"I always believed in creating a certain amount of chaos when I coached," he said. "Some years, I pushed the chaos too far. But the players have to know that I need them to care as much as I care."
In the season opener, a victory over William Paterson, it took Calhoun less than 16 minutes to draw his first technical foul. Six weeks later, he got tossed out of a loss to LaGrange. The next night, he calmed down and only drew one technical during a win over Rockford.
Since then, he hasn't been teed up, but that doesn't mean he isn't all over the officials. On Thursday, during a 98-97 double overtime loss to Johnson & Wales, he spent more time on the court than in the coach's box. At one point, he screamed, "You guys are going to have to throw me out of here if you don't start calling them for fouling my guys on those rebounds!"
After the loss, Calhoun sat with his four assistant coaches and reviewed the long night.
Finally, looking up from the stat sheet he had been staring at, he shrugged. "We came, we saw, we lost," he said. "Didn't get the job done. That's about all I've got to say."
Then he went to talk to his players. He had plenty to say to them. "Practice 3:30 tomorrow," he said, finally. "This one's gone. We have to be emotionally read to play again Saturday."
The players nodded. There was only one certainty about Saturday: Their coach would be emotionally ready.

Texto completo: President Trump intends to offer an "aspirational" and "visionary" path for the nation at the State of the Union on Tuesday, White House aides said, even as his relations with lawmakers have soured over his threats to use executive power to bypass them.
In his third prime-time address to the nation from the House chambers, Trump will call on Congress to work with him on initiatives around infrastructure and health care, while also reaffirming his strategy to toughen immigration enforcement, confront China on trade and actively intervene in the political upheaval in Venezuela, aides said in previewing the speech Friday.
Trump will make an appeal for bipartisan support, the aides said, despite the heightened acrimony in the nation's capital as the White House has engaged in a fierce standoff with Democrats over the president's efforts to build a border wall. The speech comes after Trump began his third year in office last month during a partial government shutdown that ended only after the president set a Feb. 15 ultimatum to get his wall - with a threat to declare a national emergency if he is rebuffed.
"Together we can break decades of political stalemate," Trump plans to say, according to an excerpt of his prepared remarks offered by a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make."
Earlier Friday, Trump was coy about his plans for a potential national emergency, which advisers have said could allow him to redirect some Pentagon funding to build the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
"I don't want to say," Trump said at a midday photo op, when asked about that possibility. "You'll hear the State of the Union, and let's see what happens."
The president intends to highlight his immigration agenda, the senior administration official said, but the speech is not intended as a sweeping, lengthy complaint on that topic. The aide described the address, in length and tone, as in line with traditional State of the Union speeches from Trump.
Among the key points, the president intends to call on lawmakers to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement that his administration signed last year. That pact is intended to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump called unfair to American workers.
The president also will discuss his national security and foreign policy initiatives, including his "determination to bring an end to U.S. foreign wars," the official said. Trump has initiated a withdrawal of troops from Syria, though aides have emphasized that it will be done in a deliberate fashion as the United States continues to battle threats from the Islamic State. The president has suggested that the Islamic State has largely been defeated, but national security analysts say the group remains a potent threat in the region.
The administration also has negotiated the outlines of a tentative peace deal with the Taliban, which could lead to a drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Trump's speech had been scheduled for Jan. 29, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it off because the shutdown was underway, leading to an angry response from the president, who denied her and several other Democrats access to a military plane to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives who narrowly lost the gubernatorial race last fall, is slated to deliver the Democratic rebuttal to Trump.
A joint negotiating committee on Capitol Hill is trying to work out a spending deal to keep the government open past Feb. 15, which is when the three-week continuing resolution that ended the shutdown is set to expire. Pelosi has said there will be no money for a wall in any deal, and in an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Trump called the talks a "waste of time."
Asked if Trump would acknowledge the shutdown in his speech, the administration official said the president will "definitely talk about immigration and about where we are in that debate and present a path forward. The totality of the speech will address it because in some ways, he will offer a vision forward."

When a poet shows he is jealous

Texto completo: Everyone loves poetry. In theory. Not that anyone actually wants their child to end up a poet.
In that sense, we — ever since I was an undergrad, I confess to occasionally publishing poems in little magazines with, as Calvin Trillin used to say, circulations in the high two figures — are like guitar players. Fine with parents if Junior wants to pluck a little. Just God forbid he should try to take it on the road.
But we continue to exalt poetry. To treat it as the best manmade thing in the world. As I wrote in “Poetry in Orbit,” a poem published in Gulf Stream Literary Magazine — a prose poem, as we dub it in the trade: “The coolest job is astronaut, right? Well, astronaut-poet. Every child’s dream. ‘Cause no one calls it astronautics in motion when someone has a fluid tennis swing. They call it poetry. In motion. As opposed to on the page no one reads. But poetry, still. Someone has to do the job.”
In recent decades, poetry has been called upon not just to be the best stuff ever but to take on its ancient task of bucking up a nation in times of despair. Good luck with that one, fellow poets. I’m not up to the task.
But one prominent poet, much-published in non-little magazines and a writing professor at the University of Florida, is up to the task of doing hatchet jobs on poets who are not very good ones, and that’s fine, a necessary tonic for the vast majority of poetry criticism, which often amounts to what’s known in the literary dodge as “logrolling”: writing only good reviews of peers who one runs into often at the hotel bars at our annual drinking conferences.
So The New York Times’ editors knew what they were about when they assigned William Logan to review last month “THE FLAME: Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings,” a posthumous collection by the late songwriter, and, yes, poet Leonard Cohen.
Leonard Cohen was not a very good poet. But he was a great songwriter, and lyricist, and singer, who lived an extraordinary life.
Few — none, that I know of — great songwriters are also great poets. Bob Dylan is not even a good poet, nor is Joni Mitchell, nor … Ira Gershwin. But I don’t begrudge at all Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That was for his words as sung, not as read. Just don’t bother to read his scribblings as such. Open any little mag if you want to read a good, even great, poem.
What Logan and many other Cohen-despising poet/critics are is jealous. Cohen, who started out as a poet, actually did very well at it, commercially. When his “Collected Poems, 1956-1968” came out, it sold 20,000 copies in just the summer of 1968, when it was published. Most poets don’t sell that many books in a lifetime. It was on my mother’s bookshelf. I remember one good line: something that was “as empty as the drawer where I used to keep my opium.” The poems were written when he was between 15 and 20. He got smart; saw that there was no real career in poetry as such — all poets have to teach, or, like Wallace Stevens, sell insurance, to keep body and soul together. He picked up a guitar instead, and that worked out fabulously.
But in his hatchet job, Logan pretends Cohen wasn’t any good at all: “He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. … At any moment of the day, ‘Suzanne’ is probably playing in an elevator somewhere.” Unlike Logan’s poems. But not a good singer? That’s like saying Neil Young is not a “good” singer, or Dylan, for that matter. A generation left Broadway show tunes behind, for good reason. They covered “Hallelujah” to the point where it was overplayed. Because it is a really great song.

THE VENEZUELA RED HERRING VENEZUELA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PROGRESSIVE POLICIES

Texto completo: Alas, Michael Bloomberg. You aren't the man I thought you were.
On Tuesday, asked about Elizabeth Warren's (very smart) proposal for a wealth tax, he responded with the favorite right-wing calumny of the moment - suggesting that her plan would turn us into Venezuela.
That's a shameful line of argument. In fact, whenever you see someone invoking Venezuela as a reason not to consider progressive policy ideas, you know the person in question is uninformed, dishonest or both. It basically shows that the speaker or writer isn't willing to engage in serious discussion, preferring to scare people with a bogeyman of which he or she knows nothing.
What, after all, do we learn from the Venezuelan experience? Yes, the country is a mess. Venezuela has always been a one-industry economy, with huge inequality. Hugo Chavez got into power because of rage against the nation's elite, but used the power badly. He seized the oil sector and turned it over to corrupt cronies, who mismanaged it. Then, when oil prices fell, his successor tried to cover the income gap by printing money. Hence the crisis.
It's a bad story, and not without precedent: "Macroeconomic populism" has a long history in Latin America and usually comes to grief. But what, exactly, does any of this have to do with the policy ideas of Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris, or even a genuine radical like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? Is anyone in U.S. politics, even those who call themselves socialists, proposing that we nationalize large parts of the private sector? Is there anything in the record of U.S. progressives suggesting that they are less fiscally responsible than the people who keep using voodoo economics to push massive tax cuts for the rich?
Look at the actual content of Ms. Warren's proposal, and it's Teddy Roosevelt, not Hugo Chavez. Ms. Harris' call for single-payer health care would put us in the same category as socialist hellholes like . Canada. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has suggested tax rates for very high incomes that nobody would endorse except, um, Nobel laureate experts in public finance, and that have never been implemented in any country except, well, the United States throughout its great postwar boom.
Maybe you disagree with these policy ideas. But if your first response is to scream "Venezuela," you're demonstrating both your unscrupulousness and your lack of serious arguments for your position.
In Mr. Bloomberg's case, one can hope this was a one-time lapse brought on by too much time spent talking to other billionaires and those who try to please them. But from now on, here's my rule: Anyone who uses Venezuela as a cudgel in U.S. political debate doesn't deserve to be part of that debate.

Texto completo: Two U.S. immigrant rights attorneys and two journalists who have worked closely with members of a migrant caravan in Tijuana say they were denied entry into Mexico in recent days after their passports were flagged with alerts by an unknown government.
Their stories are nearly identical: All four report being detained by Mexican immigration authorities while trying to enter the country and eventually being turned back because the authorities said their passports had been flagged.
It is unclear which government or governments, if any, might have issued the alerts.

The U.S. State Department declined to comment Friday, and the Homeland Security Department and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department directed The Times to Mexican officials. Representatives for the Mexican government did not respond to requests for comment.
The two attorneys who were denied entry into Mexico, Nora Phillips and Erika Pinheiro, are leaders of Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles and Tijuana that has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies.
In 2017, the group filed a lawsuit accusing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency of unlawfully depriving asylum seekers access to the U.S. asylum process.
In recent months, Al Otro Lado has sent lawyers to Tijuana to advise members of a Central American migrant caravan that arrived late last year at the Mexican border city. Some of the caravan's members are seeking asylum in the U.S.
Al Otro Lado recently partnered with two members of Congress to escort a group of asylum seekers to the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, where the group waited overnight until Customs and Border Protection officials agreed to accept the migrants for processing.
Phillips, the legal and litigation director for Al Otro Lado, said she was detained Thursday evening after flying to Guadalajara for a planned vacation with her husband and 7-year-old daughter.
Mexican immigration agents scanned her passport and told her it triggered "an alert," she said.
Phillips said she was separated from her daughter and husband and escorted into a separate room in which Mexican officials peppered her with questions, including how much money she was carrying, whether she had weapons training, and whether she ever had been arrested or convicted of a crime.
Her daughter was standing just outside the room and started crying. She was allowed to join her mother while the pair were detained for nine hours and had to sleep on a cold floor without food or water, Phillips said. Ultimately, they were turned away and placed on a flight back to Los Angeles.
At a news conference upon her return to Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, Phillips said Mexican officials insinuated that it wasn't Mexico that had placed the alert. She believes the U.S. government is to blame, although she provided no evidence.
Trump administration officials have repeatedly accused immigration attorneys of coaching migrants to make false asylum claims. In 2017, then-Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions criticized what he called "dirty immigration lawyers who are encouraging their otherwise unlawfully present clients to make false claims of asylum."
"I think this is retaliation," Phillips said. "I think this is because we sued the U.S. government. I think it's that we're pointing out gross, flagrant human rights violations being committed by the U.S. government, and they don't like that."
Pinheiro, the group's policy and litigation director, said Mexican immigration officials turned her away under similar circumstances Monday as she sought to cross into Tijuana on foot.
Pinheiro, a U.S. citizen who lives in Tijuana, said she was denied the chance to fetch her 10-month-old son, who has dual citizenship and was in Tijuana at the time.
Two journalists who covered the migrant caravan and are not associated with Al Otro Lado described having similar experiences.
Kitra Cahana, a freelance photographer who holds U.S. and Canadian passports, said she was denied entry to Mexico twice in recent weeks.
After flying from Detroit to Mexico City on Jan. 13, she said, Mexican immigration agents detained her at the airport for 13 hours, explaining that her passport had been flagged. She said one official said that when her passport had been scanned, it triggered an Interpol alert. She said the official told her the alert had been triggered by "the Americans."
Cahana flew back to the U.S. and later flew to Guatemala, where she tried to enter Mexico at a port of entry by foot Jan. 26. She said she was detained for about five hours and was again denied entry.
Cahana, whose work has been published in the New York Times and National Geographic, spent six weeks in Tijuana this winter photographing the caravan.
She spent some of that time at the border taking pictures of migrants as they sought to cross a fence into the United States.
Cahana said she and other photographers present were occasionally harassed by U.S. Border Patrol agents, who on several occasions took photographs of her and other journalists who were working on the Mexican side of the border.
Cahana said she also once was stopped by a Mexican police officer, who took a photograph of her passport.
She is now waiting on the Guatemalan side of the border, still hoping to access Mexico to continue her work.
"I'm in limbo," she said. "What kind of list am I on?"
Associated Press photographer Daniel Ochoa, a citizen of Spain, said he was denied entry into Mexico as he tried to cross into Tijuana from San Diego on Jan. 20. He was detained for four hours before being turned back.
Like Cahana, Ochoa had photographed members of the migrant caravan, including those who sought to cross the border illegally. He said he too had been photographed by Border Patrol agents and that Mexican police also had taken a photograph of his passport.
Charles LaBella, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego who was a federal prosecutor for some 25 years, said the reports were surprising.
"I've never seen it," LaBella said Friday.
Typically, he said, putting out an alert on someone's passport through Interpol or a law enforcement agency "usually requires some sort of legal process," with a judge required to approve the request or charges filed.
Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration law expert and professor at UCLA, said the reports, if true, were troubling.
"I ask the question whether this is a retaliatory move on the part of the government," he said. "It represents an attempt to interfere with the right to counsel."
Linthicum reported from Mexico City, Carcamo from Los Angeles and O'Toole from Washington. Reporter Kate Morrissey of the San Diego Union-Tribune also contributed to this report.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump delights in using the term “fake news,” and even takes credit for coining the term. But he insists he bears no responsibility for what press advocates say is a steep rise in threats and attacks against reporters, including by foreign autocrats who jail, censor and assault journalists. Trump says he doesn’t condone such attacks, but he says the term “fake news” is well deserved by many in the mainstream news media. "I do think it’s very bad for a country when the news is not accurately portrayed,” he said in an interview with The New York Times. “I really do. And I do believe I’m a victim of that, honestly.” [NYTimes]

Hampshire College won't admit full freshman class

Texto completo: AMHERST — Despite sharp criticism from students, professors and alumni, the trustees of Hampshire College on Friday evening announced the school will not admit a full freshman class this fall, plunging its future into further uncertainty.
The school will accept only those students who had already been granted a spot at Hampshire through deferred admissions or the early-decision process — about 60 in all. College officials have pledged to keep the school open and are looking for a partner to merge with.
“This is a time of extreme anxiety," board chair Gaye Hill told a crowd gathered at the campus athletic center. Her speech was cut short by the chants of students angered by the decision.
Gaye spoke at a 7:30 p.m. meeting that capped a tense 24 hours on campus. Students held demonstrations and sit-ins, urging trustees to take more time before they made a decision. When students and alumni finally gathered to hear the news, they formed a ring around the gymnasium, joining hands. When the news came, some, including several trustees, shed tears.
Hampshire, known for its alternative education model with no grades or majors, is the lastest liberal arts college to cast itself as a victim of the nationwide decline in high schoolers and the increasing inability of families to afford expensive tuition.
Miriam Nelson, who took over as Hampshire president last summer, announced two weeks ago that the school, while solvent, would like to merge with another educational institution. She also said then the college might not admit a new class this fall.
But ever since Nelson's announcement, administrators have faced outrage from students, professors, staff and alumni, who all say they were blindsided by the decision.
Prominent author and alumnus Jon Krakauer published a column in the New York Times this week worrying about the college's future.
“The transparency situation has been so horrifying for so many students," said Alison Smith, a first-year student from outside Baltimore.
On Thursday, several hundred students made signs and marched across campus and swarmed a lecture hall where trustees were deliberating.
“Students are scared," said Emery Powell, a third-year student from Brooklyn, at a protest on Thursday ahead of the board's vote. “This community needs time to hear more."
Hampshire College enrolled its first class of students in 1970. It was created by the presidents of the other four colleges in the Pioneer Valley — Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst — and was conceptualized as an experiment in a new type of educational model.
So far none of the four four founding schools has said it would like to merge with Hampshire.
Alumni, meanwhile, had begun a fundraising campaign to help make possible a full freshman class this fall. A crowdfunding site raised $219,000 in 48 hours toward the cause, including a $100,000 pledge from Adele Simmons, the third president of Hampshire.
Several Hampshire graduates said they do not believe the school made a good-faith fundraising effort in the years leading up to this announcement. They said they approached many wealthy graduates themselves who told them they were never contacted by the college.
Joan Wattman, who enrolled in Hampshire's fourth class of students in 1974, said she contacted Hampshire voluntarily last fall and pledged $25,000 for a scholarship. The school accepted her offer but never mentioned any hint of financial stress, she said.
“I don't feel like there has been a concerted effort to try to fundraise," she said.
Steve Aronstein, who helped set up the crowdsourcing effort and started at Hampshire in 1989, said the school has always survived on a shoestring budget and idealism.
“We've always been in trouble; that's how Hampshire operates, hand to mouth, for 50 years," he said.
A group of faculty, staff, and alumni also recently penned a letter in response to the announcement urging the president to accept a new class. It expressed worry about layoffs that could follow such a decision.
Hampshire administrators, meanwhile, say the school explored many options and chose to make itself available for a merger before it is in a true financial crisis.
Two weeks ago Nelson assured students and faculty that the college will not close, but she said it is searching for other educational institutions that it could merge with as soon as this summer.
“We've always run lean and always been underfunded. But it's unsustainable for us to continue living the equivalent of paycheck to paycheck," the president wrote on the school's website.
Small colleges across the country are struggling as the pool of college-going high schoolers shrinks. The schools are also in trouble because families are increasingly unable to pay the high tuition prices at these schools.
Hampshire, for example, costs $50,000 per year for tuition plus another $14,000 for room and board. Schools offer scholarships, of course, but that comes off their bottom line.
Hampshire has a modest $52 million endowment and depends heavily on student tuition to operate.
The fate of Hampshire is being closely watched by other colleges in New England and across the country. Green Mountain College in Vermont announced its closure just last week, and several other schools are on probation with college accreditors over concerns about their finances. Newbury College in Brookline will also close this spring.
Amid the more challenging environment, several regulatory agencies including the regional accrediting agency and the state Board of Higher Education have become more strict in their oversight of schools.
As students filed out of the gymnasium on Friday and into the sub-freezing air, many struggled to process what this will mean for their future.
“It'll continue to be a stressful and difficult time for students and faculty and staff," said Eric Palmer, a fourth-year student from outside Philadelphia.
Another student, Daniel Schmidt, said he is not entirely pessimistic. The first-year student from St. Louis said he will wait to see whom the college might merge with. He doesn't want to transfer if he doesn't have to.
“Hampshire is a really special place," he said.

On an Internet of nefarious bots, these just want to help

Texto completo: As someone who came of age in the midst of the Web's newborn modem squeals and all-nighter JPEG downloads, I'm also someone who grew up around bots.
From the early AOL chatbot distractions of SmarterChild (as for many others, my first AI buddy) to Siri and Alexa, I've had automaton friends for decades now, insofar as they appear on my friends list. 
I've written in the past about the approaching army of service-oriented bots that have since penetrated social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, as well as most major chat apps and customer service portals. And I did so with an anticipatory cheeriness that predated the revelations concerning the other army of bots that had already stormed various provinces of social media with far less helpful intentions.
Now, the term “bot" rings pejorative, and conjures up associations of large-scale operations of deception and fraud.  And our strained interactions with the “good" ones who can't even correctly take down my pizza toppings (“ANN! CHO! VEE!") do not help the frayed state of bot-human relations. 
Well, not to be that guy, but I'm here to say #notallbots deserve these attacks.
Right alongside the bots who manipulated us all into fights with each other like some shady Real Housewife and undid democracy in the process, there were some that stuck to their simple program of bringing delight to users. 
Some of my favorite bots on Twitter, for instance, manage to post better content than the living, breathing, quipping tweeters I follow just by executing simple processes. New New York Times (@NYT_first_said), for example, posts every time The New York Times prints a word it has never used before (this week we had “quizmaker," “unspherical," and “pillorizing") and offers a fascinating view of language as it graduates (or sneaks) past copy desks and into the discourse.
Equally helpful, the context-bot account @NYT_said_where replies to each post with a link to the article in which the new word appears; or, if you'd prefer new words that aren't actually real, there's the daily feed of computer-generated balderdash known as @fantasticvocab.
I also turn to bots for my literary fix on Twitter. An Allen Ginsberg bot I follow virtually recites “Howl" line by line as an endless procession of tweets that intersperse themselves between the grim headlines they still critique from decades of distance. I consume guppy-size bites of Melville and Joyce through @MobyDickatSea and @finnegansreader, respectively, and otherwise break up the inartful noise of my feed with bot-driven bits of Dickinson and Sappho.
But I also like the accidental and experimental sources of literature on Twitter, like the Pentametron — which hunts down any instances of iambic pentameter in the wild and posts them as couplets (hence finding a kind of underlying beauty beneath the muddy currents of Twitter discourse). Or @JustToSay, which uses generated text to remix William Carlos Williams's famous treatise on plum theft into new forms.
Or the MIT-spawned collaborative AI horror-bot Shelley, which slashes out a new horror story every hour (and will even write one with you). Or (if you can't find your copy of Italo Calvino's “Invisible Cities") the @BrandNewPlanet bot, which voyages deep into its artificial imagination with visions of new worlds every day.
Other of Twitter's best bots are just born entertainers. Like @I_Luv_Recipes, a bot programmed to emulate “like every recipe commenter ever" by posting various recipes and making random and often horrible substitutions (e.g. “Amaretto Olive Oil Cake: I replaced the almonds with herring eggs. Hubby loved it!").
(While it was put down permanently in 2017, I'd be remiss not to mention the old gray mare of automated absurdist generative text-spam poetry, @horse_ebooks, which still makes for better reading than 95 percent of Twitter.)
And still other bots prove the most useful for simply changing the fundamental functions of Twitter by tweaking the tone. It's hard to get in an argument with @grow_slow, which daily charts the growth of a fiddle-leaf fig in the corner of a room.
And with its gentle daily reminders to make yourself a happier, healthier person (“please remember to breathe," “listen to a song you enjoy please," “please take a sip of water") @tinycarebot is an automated confidant that's grown essential to me amid the roiling toxic wasteland of Twitter. Now someone just needs to teach it to order pizza.

Texto completo: A San Francisco Bay Area chef doesn't want to serve anyone at his restaurant wearing the President Donald Trump-inspired "Make America Great Again" hats.
In a since-deleted tweet, J. Kenji López-Alt said, "It hasn’t happened yet, but if you come to my restaurant wearing a MAGA cap, you aren’t getting served, same as if you come in wearing a swastika, white hood, or any other symbol of intolerance and hate. "
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the tweet from Sunday had more than 2,000 likes by Wednesday afternoon.
In another apparently deleted tweet from Sunday, López-Alt said, "MAGA hats are like white hoods except stupider because you can see exactly who is wearing them," per the Chronicle.
Other tweets replying to users remained on López-Alt's profile on Thursday. "If you’re comfortable sitting next to a MAGA wearer I’m probably not interested in serving you either," the chef said.
López-Alt is a chef and partner at Wursthall in San Mateo, less than 20 miles from downtown San Francisco. He's also written a New York Times bestseller, "The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science. "
USA TODAY's calls to the restaurant Thursday evening were not answered. The chef told the Chronicle the Wursthall had received threats via email since the tweet, but declined to comment further.
Restaurant goers told the Chronicle that they understood López-Alt's sentiment but disagreed with a ban.
"I see where he's coming from, but I don't think you should just keep people out because of a hat," San Mateo resident Jamie Hwang, 42, told the newspaper inside the restaurant. "I get that idea, that maybe that hat could mean the person wearing it is just looking for a fight, but just cutting off dialogue, not giving a chance to get to know someone – I just don't know if that’s something I would do. "
"I don't think it matters to me about the rule, but the hat doesn't just tell you all about the person," Bryan Agbayani, 30, also told the newspaper while dining. "All people are different. It's just weird, to me, at least, that he would make it part of this business. "
Since Trump's presidential campaign, red "MAGA" caps have become a divisive symbol in the United States. Those who wear them often say they do so to show patriotism and outward support for the president. Others say the hats promote the hate and racism that they believe Trump fosters.
The hats, sold for $25 on Trump's campaign website, sparked widespread conversation earlier this month after an incident involving an indigenous marcher and a group of high school boys donning the caps in Washington, D. C.
In the wake of the incident, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, "The red MAGA hat is the new white hood," and later said she wouldn't apologize for the remark.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The mysterious phone calls that Donald Trump Jr. made before and after his meeting with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower were not to his father, President Donald Trump, but rather to several business associates, according to media reports.
The reports, from CNN and ABC News, which cited unnamed sources, say records given to the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed the identities of who Trump Jr. spoke with both in the hours after and in the days before the notorious 2016 meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who the president's eldest son thought had compromising information on rival Hillary Clinton.
The reports cast doubt on a theory long held by Democrats that the blocked phone calls were to his father, informing him of the controversial meeting. The Democrats theory seemed to hold weight for months due to contradicting explanations given by Trump Jr. about the meeting.

Trump Jr. first said the meeting was about U. S. - Russia adoption policies but that changed after the New York Times inquired about emails that showed the meeting was set up with the promise of obtaining "dirt" on Clinton.
Trump Jr. 's phone calls became a focus due to the mysteriously blocked numbers. When he appeared before Congress, Trump Jr. said he did not remember who he spoke with in three calls with blocked numbers but said that he didn't speak to his father.
The president called the revelations about the calls "really sad. "
"Just out: The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me," Trump wrote on Twitter late Thursday. "They were made to friends & business associates of Don. Really sad!"
Trump Jr. also relished in the news.
"More of the Democrat’s #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes," he wrote on Twitter. "I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Two of the disputed phone calls happened two days before the June 9, 2016 meeting and a third, a three-minute conversation, happened just after the meeting, CNN reported.
"I simply don't remember," Trump Jr. told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017 when asked about who he spoke with on the phone.
ABC News reported the phone calls were to NASCAR CEO Brian France and real estate developer Howard Lorber, citing three anonymous sources.
Trump Jr. and his attorney did not respond to inquiries from USA TODAY.
The first two phone calls happened on June 6, 2016, lasting about 11 minutes in total. The calls came one day before Trump, who was then a candidate for president, teased a "very interesting" announcement on Clinton. The calls also happened the same day Trump Jr. spoke with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, whose publicist Rob Goldstone, set up the meeting, according to CNN.
Agalarov’s father, Aras, is a self-made oligarch and a billionaire developer. He and Trump partnered together to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013.
Democrats argued while this might clear up one unknown aspect of the Trump Tower meeting, it's still unclear why Trump Jr. , Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, would take a meeting with a foreign national who was offering information on behalf of the Russian government.
"I don't think this clears up much at all," Rep. Eric Swalwell argued on CNN.
Swalwell, D-Calf. , said if President Trump and his administration wants to put this whole inquiry about Russian influence in the election to rest, "just sit down in Bob Mueller's interview chair and come clean. "

Fake university set up by feds to nab foreign students

Texto completo: The Department of Homeland Security said it set up a fake university in Farmington Hills to target foreign students who were staying in the U.S. without proper authorization, according to federal indictments unsealed in Detroit on Wednesday.
Eight people were arrested and indicted in an immigration fraud case for conspiracy to commit visa fraud and harboring aliens for profit, said the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Matthew Schneider.
Six of them were arrested in metro Detroit, one in Florida and another in Virginia. The students enrolled at the fake university with the intent to obtain jobs under a student visa program called CPT (Curricular Practical Training) that allows students to work in the U.S., said prosecutors.
An indictment says the defendants helped at least 600 "foreign citizens to illegally remain, re-enter and work in the United States and actively recruited them to enroll in a fraudulent school as part of a 'pay to stay' scheme."
The indictments were filed Jan. 15 and unsealed Wednesday. They allege that from February 2017 through January 2019, the defendants "conspired with each other and others to fraudulently facilitate hundreds of foreign nationals in illegally remaining and working in the United States by actively recruiting them to enroll into a metro Detroit private university that, unbeknownst to the conspirators, was operated by HSI (Homeland Security Investigation) special agents as part of an undercover operation."
HSI is an investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security.
"We are all aware that international students can be a valuable asset to our country, but as this case shows, the well-intended international student visa program can also be exploited and abused," said Schneider in a statement.
The fake university is located on Northwestern Highway, just south of 13 Mile Road.
Its website touts itself as a credible university, saying: "Located in the heart of the automotive and advanced manufacturing center of Southeast Michigan, the University of Farmington provides students from throughout the world a unique educational experience. Our dynamic business administration and STEM curriculum allows students to rapidly apply their knowledge; preparing them to succeed in an ever-globalizing economy."
But the university was staffed with undercover agents working with the Department of Homeland Security.
In order to study in the U.S., students must get certain types of visas and approval from universities authorized by the Department of Homeland Security. After obtaining an F-1 visa, the student has to stay enrolled and maintain progress toward a degree; if not, they have to leave the U.S. within 60 days.
The indictments say the operation allowed students to stay in the U.S. without proper visas. The U.S. alleges the students who enrolled "knew that they would not attend any actual classes, earn credits or make academic progress toward an actual degree," read an indictment.
The eight defendants charged are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks, and tuition credits as part of the "pay to stay" scheme.
An official with ICE said the students involved in this case had come to the U.S. legally to study at universities, but then transferred to the University of Farmington after they arrived in order to work.
Rahul Reddy, an immigration attorney in Houston, said in a live-stream on YouTube that students who may have been enrolled at the university were detained in Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte, and St. Louis. Reddy said that concerned students contacted him Wednesday.
"Homeland Security Investigations special agents uncovered a nationwide network that grossly exploited U.S. immigration laws," said Special Agent in Charge Steve Francis, who heads the Detroit office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). "These suspects aided hundreds of foreign nationals to remain in the United States illegally by helping to portray them as students, which they most certainly were not. HSI remains vigilant to ensure the integrity of U.S. immigration laws and will continue to investigate this and other transnational crimes."
HSI agents have been conducting this investigation since 2015, said the U.S. Attorney's Office.
"Beginning in 2015, the university was part of a federal law enforcement undercover operation designed to identify recruiters and entities engaged in immigration fraud," said a federal indictment. "The University was not staffed with instructors/educators, it had no curriculum, no actual classes."
Charged in the indictments were:
Barath Kakireddy, 29, of Lake Mary, Florida
Suresh Kandala, 31, of Culpeper, Virginia
Phanideep Karnati, 35, of Louisville, Kentucky
Prem Rampeesa, 26, of Charlotte, North Carolina
Santosh Sama, 28, of Fremont, California
Avinash Thakkallapally, 28, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
Aswanth Nune, 26, of Atlanta
Naveen Prathipati, 26, of Dallas
The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman.
The website provided phone numbers and an email address for interested students.
This is not the first time that federal authorities have created a fake university to nab foreign students in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security once created the University of Northern New Jersey as part of a sting operation targeting students who enrolled in order to work and study in the U.S., according to a New York Times report in 2016.

Trump’s 2016 campaign pitch proven false

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The news that Donald Trump’s approval rating is near historical lows brings some relief that the laws of political gravity still apply. When the president is doing a spectacularly bad job, a majority of our fellow citizens — or at least a clear majority of people contacted for the Washington Post-ABC News poll — think Trump is doing badly.


Compared with polling from when Trump took office, perceptions of the president’s performance have plummeted on the federal budget deficit, on improving the health care system and on the economy.


Perhaps the greatest danger to Trump’s political future is the cost of these negative perceptions to his brand. The president was elected, in part, by giving his supporters an impression of business acumen. This was, in fact, the image carefully cultivated by book publishers and TV producers. And by Trump himself as a pres-idential candidate, who claimed to be a peerless negotiator, an unrivaled businessman and an excellent manager.


These claims can now only be believed by the ideologically addled.


The problem for Trump is not only that he lost the most visible and important confrontation of his presidency — in negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the government shutdown. It is that his methods are so blunt and transparent. His typical tactic is to raise the stakes of a negotiation impossibly high — a government shutdown or nuclear war — then to make a maximal demand and trust in the triumph of his stronger will. It is a form of negotiation ended by someone saying “uncle.” That Trump ended up in abject humiliation was perhaps fated by biology: You can only angrily hold your breath for so long.


If, in the next stage, the loser acts unilaterally under the pretense of a border security crisis, it will merely prove that Trump is a dangerously sore loser. For the MBAs taking notes, this complex negotiating strategy is known as: Throwing the game off the table if you can’t win.


Meanwhile, in a variety of global negotiations, American opponents need only master one method: flattery. In Trump’s words, “I know people, because deals are people. … If [Russian President Vladimir] Putin respects me, and if Putin wants to call me brilliant, and other things that he said which were, frankly, very nice, I’ll accept that.” Taken at face value, Trump is arguing: Deals are people. People who praise me have good judgment. Thus, people who praise me make good deals. Hearing these sentiments from an American president is enough to gag a historian. It is pathetic gullibility elevated into the realm of theory. It should concern us that the American president is a source of global derision and national shame.


The other branding claims made by Trump have become equally incredible. His reputation as a self-made billionaire lies in ruins. An extensive New York Times story on Trump’s wealth found a bassinet millionaire, consistently bailed out of bad bets, who dodged gift taxes, milked his empire for cash and cultivated a deceptive image of business brilliance. And special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation may reveal serious corruption and perjury in cataloguing Trump’s 30-year panting desire to sell his brand in Russia.


And who can take Trump seriously as a manager? He has a talent for weeding out the talented and responsible. He is a world-class nepotist. He is incapable of delegation or of taking conflicting advice. He is unreliable in dealing with his allies. He is capable of taking several conflicting policy views on the same topic — be it health care, or the Dreamers, or gun control — in a matter of days or hours. He often has no clear goals. He has no attention span and is consistently ignorant of details. He is prone to vicious and public abuse of rivals and of employees. Try to put that profile up on LinkedIn.


Those 37 percent who approve of Trump’s performance may point to the state of the economy or the composition of the Supreme Court. They may be impressed by his destruction of norms or enthused by his promotion of exclusion. They may want a president who speaks his mind, even when it is hateful gibberish. They may want a president who is an institutional arsonist, even if the result is mere destruction.


But no one can reasonably claim to believe in Trump’s brand as it was sold in 2016. We have plumbed the shallows of his boasts. They are refuted lies. And whatever else the president may be, he is a fraud.

Texto completo: John Mendelsohn, a physician-scientist and hospital administrator who pioneered a new form of cancer therapy before growing the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center into one of the world's preeminent cancer hospitals, died Jan. 7 at his home in Houston. He was 82.
The cause was glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, said his son Eric Mendelsohn.
As just the third president in MD Anderson's 55-year history
, Dr. Mendelsohn helped steer the Houston institution toward international renown, building it into a formidable center for research, education and patient care.
It was a remarkable turnaround for a hospital that was facing severe budget cuts and low morale when he took the job in 1996. The institution had hacked $90 million from its annual budget, and financial consultants had recommended additional cuts, including the shuttering of entire departments.
Dr. Mendelsohn ignored their advice and embarked instead on an ambitious expansion effort. By the time he stepped down in 2011, MD Anderson had doubled its staff, quintupled the size of its facilities, increased its fundraising almost tenfold and grown hospital revenue from $726 million to $3.1 billion.
The hospital also began granting degrees in biomedical and health fields; developed teaching affiliations with schools in Europe, Asia and South America; and renewed its commitment to patient care, instituting a policy in which patients saw doctors within four days of calling for an appointment.
Its growth was fueled in large part by Dr. Mendelsohn himself, who as the face of the hospital spent about 23 nights a month fundraising and socializing at parties after putting in 12-hour days at MD Anderson, according to one Wall Street Journal account.
In the last five years of his tenure, U.S. News & World Report named MD Anderson the country's finest cancer hospital, ahead of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, where Dr. Mendelsohn had served as chairman of the medicine department before moving to Houston.
"His firsthand experience with the pain, suffering and sometimes futility of cancer treatment really informed his whole approach to leadership," Peter WT Pisters, MD Anderson's current president, said in an interview. Dr. Mendelsohn, he added, "was the architect behind the advancement of what we now know as personalized cancer medicine. His work allows us to match treatments to the biology of an individual patient's tumor."
Dr. Mendelsohn's work on personalized treatments began in the 1980s, when he was founding director of the University of California at San Diego's cancer center. When research suggested that a group of proteins known as growth factors played a key role in the spread of cancer, Dr. Mendelsohn and a colleague, biologist Gordon H. Sato, proposed using an antibody to try to block one of the most intriguing of those proteins, epidermal growth factor.
"We just thought, 'Let's stick a piece of chewing gum in our lock so the key can't get in,' " Dr. Mendelsohn told the New York Times in 2004.
His team studied thousands of antibodies, according to a Memorial Sloan Kettering tribute, before isolating one in 1984 that prevented the protein from binding with a receptor on the outside of cancer cells, effectively halting the proliferation of those cancers.
Dubbed C-225, after the number of the laboratory well in which it was found, it inspired other researchers and pharmaceutical companies to pursue other cancer treatments with similar precision and formed the basis of cetuximab, also known by the trade name Erbitux.
After years of testing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer in 2004 and for head and neck cancer in 2006. The drug was also "extremely important" in developing treatments for lung cancer, said Larry Norton, an oncologist at Sloan Kettering. He added that Dr. Mendelsohn also played a key role in the development of Herceptin, a drug that "totally transformed the treatment of breast and many other cancers."
For Dr. Mendelsohn, the drugs were just a few more steps in the battle to transform cancer into a treatable disease, akin to pneumonia or tuberculosis.
"We'll never get rid of cancer completely; there are too many genetic issues for that to happen," he once told the Dallas Morning News. "But our target is to eliminate cancer as a major health problem."
John Mendelsohn was born in Cincinnati on Aug. 31, 1936. His mother was a homemaker, and his father sold suspenders and men's belts.
Dr. Mendelsohn was studying physics and chemistry at Harvard University when he "found out I liked people as much as math, maybe more," he said in an interview with the American Association for Cancer Research. Switching to a medicine track, he knocked on the door of James D. Watson, a new faculty member who went on to share a Nobel Prize for identifying the double-helix structure of DNA, and became his first undergraduate researcher.
Dr. Mendelsohn received his bachelor's degree in 1958 and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1963. After completing research fellowships, he joining UCSD in 1970, moving to Memorial Sloan Kettering in 1985.
In 2002 he weathered a pair of corporate meltdowns while serving as a board member with Enron, the energy giant that collapsed amid allegations of widespread accounting fraud, and ImClone Systems, a biotech company embroiled in an insider-trading scandal centered on the Erbitux cancer drug.
Both controversies left him relatively unscathed. Dr. Mendelsohn said he had done nothing wrong and was never accused of impropriety, although he faced criticism from members of Congress who said he and other board members had not done enough to supervise their companies.
That same year, The Washington Post reported that MD Anderson had tested Erbitux on patients without telling them its president had a financial stake in the drug. Dr. Mendelsohn told The Post that the hospital had recently changed its policies to avoid similar ethical concerns in the future, saying, "I don't want to take any chances that a patient will feel they've been deceived at MD Anderson."
After retiring as president, Dr. Mendelsohn returned to MD Anderson in 2012 to become a director of the Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy. He also served as a senior fellow in health and technology policy at the Baker Institute, a public policy center at Rice University. Previously, he had served as a health policy adviser to President George H.W. Bush, who last year called him "one of the leading gladiators in the war against cancer - innovative, relentless, fearless," according to the Houston Chronicle
.
Survivors include his wife of nearly 60 years, the former Anne Charles, a research chemist turned educator and TV producer, of Houston; three sons, Andrew Mendelsohn of London, Eric Mendelsohn of Summit, N.J., and Jeffrey Mendelsohn of San Francisco; and eight grandchildren.
As part of his overhaul of MD Anderson, Dr. Mendelsohn supervised a remodeling that turned the hospital into something resembling a fine hotel, with waterfall features, a vaulted atrium, three dozen aquariums and jigsaw puzzles scattered throughout its rooms.
The changes were not simply cosmetic, Dr. Mendelsohn told the Dallas Morning News, but provided comfort to patients and their families. At the same time, he added, the core of cancer treatment remained the same: "One doctor dealing with one patient, one at a time, making them feel like they're the most important person in the world."

Texto completo: This White House is sensitive to criticism, especially criticism from its right flank. Press secretary Sarah Sanders just threw shade at those accusing President Trump of caving after he reopened the government without first securing funding for his border wall.

Trump didn’t concede anything, Sanders insisted, “because the negotiations are still ongoing.” Any voices who say otherwise, she seemed to suggest, are out of the mainstream: “I would argue that conservatives who actually have influence supported the president throughout this process.”

A subtle dismissal to some, that sentiment will be an unmistakable slap-in-the-face to some of Trump’s earliest and most enduring allies.

It is a long list.

Ann Coulter expressed her displeasure with the deal on Friday:

The conservative commentator and New York Times best-selling author endorsed Trump in August 2015 and predicted his eventual presidency to the laughter of liberal pundits.

Mike Cernovich was similarly displeased. The right-wing commentator has been a loyal digital bulldog for Trump, regularly ripping his critics.

Tweet
Sanders also implicitly wrote off a slew of Trump-friendly outlets critical of the so-called deal. The Daily Caller, the masthead built by Tucker Carlson, ran with the headline “TRUMP CAVES.” Breitbart, the empire built in part by former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon, wrote: “Government Open … And Border. NO WALL.”

The Drudge Report, the right-leaning news aggregator run by Matt Drudge, linked to news of the deal, summarizing it as: “NO WALL FUNDS.”

Sanders appeared to address all of them in one fell, roughly 30-second, swoop Monday. The message seemed clear: Anyone foolish enough to cross the administration must not have much influence.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is not getting a lot of positive feedback since indicating on Sunday that he was seriously considering a 2020 presidential run.
"Don’t help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire a-----e!" a man screamed Monday night as Schultz discussed the possibility of running. The interruption came as Schultz was being interviewed during the first stop on his tour promoting his new book, "From the Ground Up. "
"Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter. Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world!" added the heckler, who has not been identified. (Getting "ratioed" means getting more replies than retweets in a Twitter post, indicating a negative reaction. )
Although most have not used profanity, many political figures and media pundits have echoed the heckler's sentiments.
Schultz's fellow billionaire, Michael Bloomberg, warned him against running, saying in a statement that "the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President. "
'Not a wise thing': Democrats pan Howard Schultz's potential 2020 bid
More: Trump blasts former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who critics fear could help president win re-election
Bloomberg has explored running for president as an independent in the past and said that "the data was very clear and very consistent. Given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there is no way an independent can win. "
He said electing Trump was "a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now. "
New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote that if Schultz enters the race, he will running a "narcissistic spoiler campaign. "
Trump appeared to try to goad Schultz, tweeting, "He doesn’t have the 'guts' to run for President!"
"This is no time for Howard Schultz’s foolishness," read the headline of a column by the Washington Post's Eugene Robinson.
CNBC host Andrew Sorkin, who interviewed Schultz at the book event, asked the former coffee executive if he would drop out of the race if polls indicated his third-party candidacy could lead to Trump's re-election.
"Nobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me," Schultz said. But he added that he would only run as an independent if he believed he could win, so he couldn't "answer that question today. "
"But I'm certainly not going to do anything to put Donald Trump back in the Oval Office," he said.
If he runs, Schultz says it will be as an independent centrist because both Republicans and Democrats have been taken over by their extreme wings. When asked about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , and her belief that billionaires represent a moral failing of the American system, Schultz said she was "misinformed. "
"It’s so un-American to think that way," he said.
"I am self-made," Schultz added. "I came from the projects and took advantage of the promise of the country. I am living proof of the American Dream. "
Schultz's book, "From the Ground Up: A Journey to Reimagine the Promise of America," hit stores on Monday. As of Tuesday morning, the book had one and a half stars on Amazon, based on 15 reviews.

Texto completo: Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every Monday, we email readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
When we're in the dead of winter and it's too cold to venture outdoors, I, like many people, sometimes spend entire days inside my home.
At first, I delight in snuggling under fluffy blankets and sipping mugs of fragrant herbal tea. But after a while -- definitely by the third day -- boredom creeps in. I feel trapped, isolated and sluggish.
Cabin fever, the edginess that comes from being confined indoors for an extended period of time, can strike anyone, at any time: new parents, snowbound students, listless urbanites who are trapped inside their apartments. A dull, lethargic feeling takes hold when it doesn't make sense to leave the house (or when you physically can't).
In collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) items to bust your next bout of cabin fever.
Board games
Binge-watching TV shows isn't always the best way to stave off long-term boredom. In fact, according to a 2017 study in The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, binge watching can contribute to poor sleep quality, increased fatigue and symptoms of insomnia.
When I've blown through my Netflix queue and can't find anything on screen (or off) to hold my attention, I pull out a board game. Wirecutter has a range of stimulating board games they recommend depending on your interests. If you're a newbie, check out Wirecutter's "Best Beginner Board Games for Adults" guide.
For those who are stuck home alone (or can't rope in a willing companion), old school puzzles can also be a fun diversion. The EuroGraphics Fruits Seed Catalogue 1,000-Piece Puzzle is an appealing option.
Colored pencils
When your eyes have glazed over out of sheer boredom, clear off space on a table and reach for a coloring book, for which you'll need a handy set of colored pencils to do the job right. Wirecutter recommends the vibrant Prismacolor's Premier Colored Pencils. They're easy to sharpen and draw smooth lines.
Try out your new colored pencils on The Swear Word Coloring Book (be warned: there are swear words) to add a little attitude to an otherwise humdrum day.
Smart speakers
Impromptu dance parties are a great way to shake up the energy. Instead of digging around your personal collection for something everyone in your household would want to bop to, instruct the digital assistant on your smart speaker to stream your favorite artist's station or a curated playlist. If you're a Marie Kondo-type, the speaker can play podcast episodes as you declutter the house, room by room.
If you're new to smart speakers and are wondering which is right for you, read Wirecutter's breakdown here to see if a Google Home or Amazon Echo device is a better fit.
Baking
Yes, the holidays have passed, but there's never a bad time to make holiday cookies!
Baking is a perfect cabin-fever-busting activity: It'll keep you just busy enough so you feel occupied and productive, and when you're done you have delicious treats.
Wirecutter pulled together everything you need to own -- and know -- to bake cookies in this comprehensive guide. Pick up the items you'll need so you're ready to go next time you're snowed in.
Electric kettle
I used to own a traditional stovetop kettle, but I disliked how intrusive the screeching whistle was. I'd drop whatever I was doing and run to the stove anytime the water boiled. I've since switched to an electric kettle and now making warm drinks is a thousand times more chill.
Wirecutter recommends the Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp Cordless Electric Kettle because it is fast, accurate and easy to use (and its 1.7 liter capacity makes preparing drinks for a crowd a breeze). Banish the blahs with a round of hot chocolates, hot toddies or a spontaneous tea party.
Best of Smarter Living
Want to Close the Pay Gap? Pay Transparency Will Help. It may not be the cure-all to inequity, but we need a starting point.

What Professional Organizers Really Do, and How They Can Help You. When you hear "professional organizer" you may think "reality TV," but you shouldn't. Professional organizers can help with projects large and small, and with the psychology of clutter, to boot.
How Exercise May Help Keep Our Memory Sharp. Irisin, a hormone that is released during exercise, may improve brain health and lessen the damage that occurs during Alzheimer's disease.
Beyond the Built-in Bookcase. The best built-ins aren't just for books. How about a built-in for the dog, or the in-laws?
Tip of the Week
This week I've invited the writer Eliza McGraw to teach us all how to clean up our bookshelves.
I have too many books. But by sorting them into categories I've devised, I can find, read and enjoy each one more. Does one book remind you of another? Shelve them together and you can find -- and read -- that play you loved at 19, or the Roosevelt biography from your cousin. Your real-life library should match how you imagine your books. No matter how odd your taxonomy may seem to an outsider, you'll be a happier reader.
For example, my sections include Civil War history, turf writing, mythology, poetry and oversize. Lean in to subjective calls: If you'd like "The Odyssey" in poetry rather than in classics, that's where it should go. Within divisions, I sort books alphabetically by author's last name. I like the camaraderie this creates. In short story collections, Saki stands with Damon Runyon, and over in novels Donna Tartt sits by Peter Taylor while Charlotte Brontë is next to James Lee Burke.
But likely the most important section is what I think of as "course reserves." No book stays there very long. There's no alphabetizing this area; the books there play by their own rules. They're books I am reading right now, books I've borrowed, books I keep meaning to read, books I am considering giving away. Don't skip this: Allowing space for chaos is what makes the order work.
And yes, it's all right to give books away. A home library should be dynamic and evolving, no matter how you sort it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Our founding fathers wisely provided for our way of life to be protected and represented. Our Constitution explains three ways our voices are to be heard.
Number 1 is in the Senate where states have an equal number of representatives (two senators for each state).
Number 2 is in the House of Representatives where an equal number of citizens are to be represented by a popularly elected representative. (Currently there are about 170,000 people in each of 439 Congressional Districts. Many times district lines have been gerrymandered in favor of a party or other group of people.)
Number 3 The president who represents all of us. (The Electoral College chooses our president.) The Constitution leaves the choice of electors and their instruction to the states. Since the 1800s electors in every state have voted for their state's winner. NPV would ensure a state's Electoral College votes are cast for the national winner.
Currently states with small populations like NM with 11 electors are outvoted by states with large populations like California with 53 electors. In five elections, candidates who won the popular vote did not win the presidency. With the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPV), presidents will be chosen by national popular vote. That's one man-one vote!
The Constitution will not be changed. The compact will go into effect when state legislatures representing a majority of citizens agree that electors will vote for the national winner. NPV has been passed in 23 states, totaling 172 Electoral votes of the required 270.
The effort to pass legislation in NM has been hampered by time limits of our legislative sessions. NPV passed in NM House of Representatives in 2009, and it passed NM Senate in 2017. Time ran out in each session. This session we need to pass NPV.

Resistance never stopped working New York Times columnist David Leonhardt, in his Jan. 21, 2019 column critiques the resistance by first praising them, then going on to fault the movement for a lack of stamina—for low energy you might say. While I appreciate his praise, I also believe his critique is misdirected.
What he sees as a weakness is just a predictable letdown after an intense two years in which the resistance beat back assault after assault on health care and expended furious energy to help take back the House of Representatives. In New Mexico, resistance groups statewide helped turn the state "blue" top to bottom, border to border. We threw our support behind candidates who now fill seats from the Statehouse to the county sheriff's office. We needed to catch our breaths, certainly. But we've never stopped working.
Leonhardt dings the resistance for not leading the charge to reopen the federal government. The fact is the shutdown has hit New Mexico harder than most anywhere. But our leaders are the ones charged with resolving the crisis. We elected a this new generation to represent us, to work for us, and to use their fine brains for the common good. Our seasoned leaders, including those in the once-powerful unions, must guide us out of this national mess. Activists need to make their voices heard, but it is these leaders who bear responsibility for making our government function again. Leonhardt should look into it.

Texto completo: Twice a week, Memphis Elementary School second graders Madison Evans, Lilian Brandi, Peyton Provost and Eden Wonsey walk down to their school library.
They read and check out books, but there's also a 3-D printer, art materials and a lot of other stuff not always found in a traditional library.
On Friday, they worked together to build a platform strong enough to support a book. Using craft sticks, gumdrops, marshmallows and other materials, they developed a design.
"I like to do the crafts," said Brandi, 7. "You can do interesting ones, scary ones, anything you like."
Over the past two years, the school has transformed its traditional library into a media center. It still houses and lends out books, but now incorporates more options for STEM activities.
"When you come and read a book, you can immediately apply your knowledge by making things," said Meran Khon, Memphis Elementary School media specialist. "You learn by trying and failing.
Nearby, Ryan Budnick, Tucker Gascoyne and Hunter Smith worked on the same project as Brandi and her friends. Ryan said he likes the hands-on activities that come with going to the library.
"We get to go on computers, check out books," Ryan said. "Usually I make inventions out of stuff Mrs. Khon has in here.
"I made a little robot."
Tucker also likes to build.
"I like to make LEGO houses with the LEGO table," he said.
Khon won a St. Clair County RESA Classroom 4 the Future grant during the 2016-17 school year, which was used to purchase flexible furniture. That provided the base for the revamped library, which has been added onto through donations and other grants since.
The library also contained a computer lab, which has seen its desktop computers replaced with laptops — which freed up more floor space.
Now the school is showing off the work its done in hopes of winning prizes to keep building. The library has been entered into the Follett Challenge, with the school creating a short video outlining the new library's amenities and educational outlook.
If enough people vote, the school could receive prizes worth $8,000 through the People's Choice category. Video voting begins Monday, Jan. 21. There is also one $60,000 prize for the overall winner, which would also receive a celebration featuring New York Times bestselling author Kwame Alexander. Two semi-finalists may win $30,000 worth of prizes.
"We would love to add more up-to-date, relevant literature based on topics and subjects the kids are interested in, along with any relevant technology to help ignite their reading interests and STEM skills," Khon said.
The semifinalists and the People's Choice awards will be announced on Feb. 27. The 2019 Grand-Prize will be announced on April 24.

Texto completo: Howard Schultz, former chief executive of the ubiquitous coffee chain Starbucks, teased a potential third-party White House bid on Sunday, drawing condemnation from Democrats who see a threat to their efforts to unseat President Trump.
"I love our country, and I am seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent," Schultz wrote on Twitter.
The businessman, whose personal wealth Forbes estimates at $3.4 billion, had publicly identified as a Democrat and had reportedly toyed with seeking the party's nomination.

Instead, Schultz told the New York Times on Sunday that he had begun efforts to get on the ballot in all 50 states.
When initial reports published in January indicated that Schultz was pondering an independent bid, Democrats in his home state of Washington expressed their blunt displeasure.
"Just. Don't. If you're a Democrat, run as a Democrat. Invest in Party infrastructure so we can win the White House, Senate, expand House majorities," Tina Podlodowski, chair of the Washington State Democrats, said in a tweet directed at Schultz.
Schultz, 65, has been vocal on social and political issues, a rarity for often cautious corporate leaders. During his tenure, the company undertook initiatives to hire veterans and at-risk youths, backed same-sex marriage and waded into gun politics by asking people not to openly carry firearms in its locations.
Schultz's emphasis on public service and supporting veterans -- as well as his significant personal wealth -- stoked speculation about his presidential ambitions.
He has been an outspoken critic of Trump, blasting the executive order blocking refugees from predominantly Muslim countries. In response, Starbucks announced it planned to hire 10,000 refugees by 2022.
Appearing on CBS' "60 Minutes" on Sunday, he criticized Trump as "not qualified" to lead the nation but also went after Republicans and Democrats. He said they were "consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged every single day in revenge politics."
He declared both major parties have been a "reckless failure" in driving the national debt to more than $21 trillion.
Asked on "60 Minutes" whether he worried an independent campaign could siphon votes from the Democratic nominee and help Trump, Schultz didn't indicate that was a concern.
"I want to see the American people win. I want to see America win," Schultz said. "I don't care if you're Democrat, independent, libertarian, Republican, bring me your ideas and I will be an independent person who will embrace those ideas because I am not in any way in bed with a party."
Raised in public housing in Brooklyn, Schultz joined the Seattle-based coffee empire when it was a fledgling enterprise in 1982. After leaving briefly to start his own coffee company, he returned in 1987 to serve as chief executive until 2000.
The company struggled after his departure, which Schultz attributed to growing too fast. He came back to lead Starbucks in 2008 and made high-profile moves to turn around the company, including closing more than 7,000 stores one day for barista retraining.
He similarly closed all locations in 2018 for an afternoon of racial bias training after a widely reported incident of discrimination against two black customers in a Philadelphia shop. He officially stepped down that summer.
Schultz is equally notorious in his hometown for his stewardship of another local franchise, the Seattle Supersonics.
It's been more than 10 years since Schultz, then the owner of the NBA team, sold the Sonics to an ownership group that soon moved the team to Oklahoma City and renamed it the Thunder. Devoted Sonics fans still hold it against him.

Their aim is true Maine Oyster Company needs a bit of fine-tuning on its way to the noble goal of spreading oyster love.

Texto completo: If John Herrigel gets his way, it won't be long before the oyster replaces the lobster as the iconic symbol of Maine.
A small-scale oyster farmer as well as owner and general manager of Maine Oyster Company, Herrigel spends most of his time thinking about oysters. These days, what's on his mind is a near-term future where he foresees both a looming crisis and glimmering opportunity.
"We're going to hit a point in three to five years where our supply is going to triple," he said. "Right now, most of the 10-20 million oysters we grow in Maine get eaten in the state; very little gets out. So we have to figure out what to do when that supply goes way up...if we can't get those oysters out of Maine, get people to want them, the price is going to drop."
Opening a casual bar-restaurant in the middle of Portland may seem like a strange way to stave off such a price collapse. But Herrigel's strategy involves more than just selling raw seafood, craft beer and Prosecco on tap ($9) to locals from his "general store chic" digs in Bayside.
Indeed, his 25-seat venue is equal parts restaurant and ministry, a spot where he hopes anyone with a connection to farming oysters - or a passion for eating them - will be able to meet other devotees. Together, they'll form a blended community to celebrate the oyster and go on to champion it here and abroad.
Have you heard the good news?
If not, sign up for one of Maine Oyster Company's frequent themed events. There are shucking classes, wine pairing dinners and even a costume night called the "80s Sweat and Slurp."
Still not enough for you? Then join the Boom Shuck-A-Lucka club ($59); you'll score a T-shirt, a 10-cent discount on every shucked oyster and a shucking knife, not to mention a dozen oysters every year.
"I'm a connector, and this place is a hub where consumers and growers meet and can disseminate information," Herrigel said. "I want this place to be the bullhorn, and I want everyone who comes here to be fired up to share the story of the oyster."
Eventually, he also plans to sell oysters on a retail basis, but for the moment, they are only available shucked ($2.50 each/$15 for six/$29 for a dozen), pried open underneath a papier mchÃ© shell strung with blinking lights.
On my recent visit, Herrigel's own Cape Smalls oysters, grown on his property in Phippsburg, were not on the menu, but six other local varieties were. Two from Casco Bay: sweet, tiny Basket Islands and sultry, slipper-shaped Mere Points; as well as enormous, mineral Nonesuch oysters from Scarborough, assertive Wild Damariscottas, muscularly briny MDIs from Bar Harbor, and well-balanced Eros Oysters from Georgetown (my favorites of the night). I would very happily eat any of these oysters again.
However, chef Todd Bullis's mignonettes were hit-or-miss. His classic version, made of not much more than Champagne vinegar and minced shallot, was lovely. Yet his orange juice, Sriracha and Allagash beer-hops-vinegar mignonette was another story. "Careful with this stuff," my server warned, motioning toward a tiny vial of Day-Glo fluid as if it were radioactive. "A little goes a long way."
Unfortunately, I soon learned that anything beyond a single drop of the concentrated brew was too much. Add more, and it will taste like someone has sprinkled Tang on your oyster.
Bullis doesn't shy away from citrus in other dishes, either. By blending lemon juice, dill and mayonnaise, he creates what Herrigel calls a "lemonade sauce" for dressing lobster meat. On the lobster crostini ($11), it is spooned onto lifeless baguette toasts that make the dish feel like leftover hors d'oeuvres someone might have scavenged from a gallery opening. The best part is, surprisingly, the nest of simple, vinaigrette-spritzed lettuce at the center of the plate.
On the other hand, in the West Bayside lobster roll ($17) - where freshly picked Phippsburg lobster meat spills out over the sides of a buttery, panini-grilled hot dog bun - it works. Dill and lemon aren't for purists, but they give the sandwich a pleasing Nordic twinkle that feels right for a chilly January evening.
So too, the fantastic coriander-and-white-vinegar-pickled cruditÃ© ($5): bright, acerbic slices of red pepper, crunchy baby carrots, dilly beans and tender, blanched asparagus spears.
And while January isn't traditionally ice cream sandwich season up here in the Northern Hemisphere, the C. Love Cookie Project version ($6) is good enough to make you reconsider your frozen-treat prejudices. Each one comes wrapped in parchment paper cinched with blue-and-white cotton twine. Inside are two homemade chocolate chip cookies - underbaked so they remain blond and doughy - that bookend a fat disc of vanilla ice cream.
It's an unfussy finish that fits right in with the informal vibe of Maine Oyster Company. "If you feel like it, you can take that (dessert) up to the front and check out our map," my server suggested as he cleared the table. "It shows where tonight's oysters come from."
So I stood, looking at the outline of jagged, finger-like peninsulas and islands, taking bites of my dribbling ice cream sandwich as a shucker told me how this was the best job he had held so far. "I mean, I like oysters," he said. "But since I started working here, I just can't stop talking about them." I don't know if Herrigel was within earshot, but if he was, he probably would have smiled. Mission accomplished.

Texto completo: Her network may have given him the boot, but Julie Chen Moonves is standing her husband.

The "Celebrity Big Brother" host signed off of the CBS reality series' premiere this week using husband Les Moonves' last name -- less than a month after he was denied a multi-million dollar severance package following an investigation into sexual misconduct claims.

Chen, 49, has steadfastly stuck by her husband's side since he was first accused of sexual assault and harassment in July.

The host shocked "Big Brother" viewers in September when she signed off as "Julie Chen Moonves" instead of "Julie Chen" for the very first time, and has stuck with using her married name since.

Her official biography on the CBS website refers to her as Julie Chen Moonves, and also makes reference to her marriage, saying she lives in New York and Los Angeles "with her husband," who is not identified.

Les Moonves, 69, stepped down as chairman and CEO of CBS in September after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women.

He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, though an internal CBS report obtained by the New York Times found that he destroyed evidence and "deliberately lied" to lawyers amid an internal investigation.

The investigation wrapped in December, and the disgraced head honcho was pushed out the door without his $120 million severance.

"With regard to Mr. Moonves, we have determined that there are grounds to terminate for cause, including his willful and material misfeasance, violation of Company policies and breach of his employment contract, as well as his willful failure to cooperate fully with the Company's investigation," CBS said in a statement. "Mr. Moonves will not receive any severance payment from the Company."

Chen took a brief hiatus from her CBS duties after the first wave of accusations, and eventually stepped down as co-host of "The Talk."

She married Moonves in 2004, and they share a 9-year-old son.

"I have known my husband, Leslie Moonves, since the late '90s, and I have been married to him for almost 14 years," she wrote on Twitter in July. "Leslie is a good man and a loving father, devoted husband and inspiring corporate leader. He has always been a kind, decent and moral human being. I fully support my husband."

Texto completo: The divided government of 2019 is a mirror image of the divided government of 2011. Back then, Democrats controlled the White House and Senate, while Republicans had recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2010 midterms. Today, Republicans control the White House and Senate, while Democrats have recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2018 midterms.
It’s the same situation, essentially. But today there is a vastly different public conversation about the balance of power in government. These days, we are often reminded that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and therefore Speaker Nancy Pelosi stands on an even level with President Trump. Back in 2011, when the two players were Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama, there wasn’t as much of that kind of talk.
Now, Democrats have been saying it every day. There was even talk to the effect that Pelosi is now equal to the president. The chief advocate: Pelosi herself. "Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump’s equal, she replied, ‘The Constitution does,’" The New York Times reported in an article about the speaker.
A Jan. 17 discussion on CNN focused on the speaker’s battle with the president over the government shutdown and State of the Union address. Republican Rep. Michael Turner said of Pelosi, "She needs to come to some recognition that she’s not equal to the president of the United States."
Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution scholar, CNN analyst, and editor of the blog Lawfare, blanched. "Pretty wild to hear a member of Congress forcefully argue that congressional leaders are constitutionally inferior to the president," Hennessey tweeted. "James Madison weeps."
But the speaker of the House is not, in fact, equal to the president of the United States. Congress, not the House, is a co-equal branch of government. Actually, more than equal — it is, as Pelosi noted, the first branch of government. But to exert its will, Congress must be united. To overrule the president — and, of course, Congress can even remove the president — Congress must be united.
Pelosi controls just half of Congress. And she only controls the House when she gets 218 members to agree with her. To overrule a presidential veto, she needs 287 members to agree with her. And then the Senate, controlled by Republicans under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has to go along.
On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive branch is the only branch of government headed by a single person. That gives that one person, in this case President Trump, the power of the executive branch. No single person in the other two branches has that power.
The bottom line is the House is one-half of a co-equal branch of government. The system simply was not designed for a head-to-head equal competition — the president versus the speaker. It doesn’t work that way. It’s entirely understandable that Democrats and their allies in the press would want to see Pelosi as equal to the president.
But that doesn’t make it true.

Texto completo: Americans might soon learn what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found out about potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
But there's one Trump-Moscow link where the emerging evidence is already as damning as it is disturbing.
During much, if not all, of Trump's campaign he sought to enrich himself by pursuing a luxury hotel-condominium-office deal in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.
And as a candidate, Trump repeatedly misled or lied to voters about his business with Russia. "I have nothing to do with Russia," he told reporters in July 2016. "I don't deal there," he said during the Oct. 9 presidential debate.
OTHER VIEWS: ' ‘We still have no evidence of collusion’
The truth is, Trump had coveted a lucrative hotel project in Russia — whether to build one or license his name to be emblazoned on a skyscraper — for decades. "We will be in Moscow at some point," he said in a 2007 deposition.
Later, as a presidential candidate, he secretly signed an 18-page letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow on Oct. 28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.
Court filings by Mueller in November make clear that negotiations led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen continued through at least June 2016. Cohen lied about this to Congress to "give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and . . . the very first primary,' " according to the filings.
You have to wonder what the fallout would have been if those negotiations had been exposed before Trump debated his Republican primary opponents or Hillary Clinton. The electorate certainly was robbed of knowing about this crucial information at a time when:
►There were news reports that Russia was interfering in the election.
►Trump was expressing praise and admiration for President Vladimir Putin, even as he was insulting hundreds of other people, places and things on Twitter.
►The candidate said that, as president, he would consider easing sanctions placed against Russia for its violent seizure of Crimea.
►Trump was questioning America's continued role in NATO, a bulwark against Russian aggression that Putin has historically despised.
►A plank in the GOP platform regarding U. S. support for Ukraine was watered down.
►Trump challenged Moscow to release Democratic emails that Russians were reported to have hacked.
How does the president explain the appearance of a quid pro quo? By claiming that he was just keeping his options open. "There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won," Trump said in November, "in which case I would have gotten back into the (real estate development) business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"
Exactly when the Trump Tower Moscow "opportunity" collapsed remains murky. On Sunday, the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quoted Trump as telling him that project talks were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won. " By Monday, Giuliani was scrambling to walk back his comments to The New York Times and other news outlets.
But whether Trump was pursuing the arrangement until he clinched the Republican nomination, or right up until he was elected president, isn't the main point. What matters is that a presidential candidate was secretly negotiating a major business deal with a major U. S. adversary — an extraordinary conflict of interest that was concealed from voters.

Rapper Cardi B is scared about the government shutdown, and you should be too

Texto completo: A few days ago, I would have asked, "Who is Cardi B?" Now, she's established herself in the firmament of Trump-busters. In an expletive laced commentary about Trump's wall induced government shutdown, Cardi B instagrammed a video reprimand saying, essentially, "Now I don't wanna hear y'all talking 'bout, 'oh, but Obama shutdown the government for 17 days'... yeah, for healthcare so your grandma could check her blood pressure and you can go check that p***y at the gynecologist with no problem."
With little concern for polite speak, Cardi B laid out the problem in a few pithy words. What is this nation so caught up about? A wall? Shouldn't we be arguing healthcare, or environment or guns or criminal justice? What's so worthwhile about the wall?
Even the conservative Wall Street Journal's editorial board dismissed the rationale for wall spending: "Mr. Trump is wrong that [the wall] will magically reduce drug traffic or illegal crossings ... The best solution for illegal crossings is a legal system that gives migrants the chance to move back and forth depending on the needs of the U.S. economy."
In the meantime, as the government shutdown crosses into its second month, the current Congress sets the record of being the most uncompromising in America's history.
The consequences of the government shutdown are growing beyond the 800,000 federal workers who are being deprived of their paychecks.
The Food and Drug Administration posted a statement on its website accounting for any slip ups that might happen due to fur-loughed staff. "Our work protects the food that families feed their children and pets and ensures the effectiveness of the medicine they need, all of which contribute to improving the health and welfare of Americans. All our work is important, but only some of our work is permitted to continue during a lapse in funding."
San Francisco's Human Services Agency issued an advisory informing CalFresh recipients that their benefits were being issued early. CalFresh is California's food stamp program and 50,000 low-income residents in The City currently receive CalFresh benefits. Households were cautioned to "plan their food budgets wisely and to be judicious in spending February benefits to ensure that the funds will last and serve their needs through the end of the month."
In addition to long security lines at several airports, a number of parks and recreation areas are closed, the home-buying process is more protracted, school lunches are being rationed and seniors and low-income families are dealing with rental assistance programs that are in jeopardy.
Cardi B urged people to care about the shutdown, even if "y'all don't work for the government or y'all probably don't even have a job." In her fresh, impudent manner, the pop idol summarized, "Our country is in a hell hole right now all for a wall and we really need to take this seriously."
She is right. In the hope of preventing other people from coming into America, we're turning on our own people in America.
While Cardi B makes some valid points, it is exactly the Cardi B-type unchecked, unfiltered, unedited public viewpoints on social media that supply a regular diet of misinformation about immigrants and the wall.
With exceptions now making the general case, immigrants have been called all manner of names, including drug-runners, job-stealers, criminals, rapists, human-traffickers and more in an effort to craft a convenient public relations narrative to justify the wall.
At a Los Angeles county media briefing that I attended on Jan. 18, Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said that when it comes to health care, she feels "haunted" by the false narratives that are proliferating. "Fifty-two percent really believe that immigrants burden our country with health care costs." In fact, she explained, immigrants have a much higher rate of out-of-pocket expenses.
The New York Times editorial board took down another myth around immigration this week, "Last year, many business owners, in both high-tech and low-tech areas, complained that they didn't have enough workers. We need more immigrants, not fewer."
Mr. Trump's wall is not an irrefutable truth. The wall cannot solve all our immigration woes. It might turn away a few people, but not all. It might control the flow of illegal goods, but not all.
The wall is a campaign promise that's fast becoming an inconvenience. Sure, we need a wall, but must it be at the expense of our institutions, livelihoods and fellow-feeling?
To quote our rapper celebrity once again, "I feel like we need to take some action. I don't know what type of action, 'cause this is not what I do, but I'm scared."

Texto completo: Wl Needs History Puzzle
I was writing The Informer to see if you would take a suggestion from me, a loyal reader, about a feature you need to add to your paper. I would love a crossword puzzle in The Informer like the one in the New York Times, but this one would be about Black history! I think that's a fantastic idea. I read the paper during my long commute on the Metro and I would love to pass the time with something like that. You don't have to pay me, just say inspired by a loyal reader.

Harris Bid a Mistake
I DO NOT think that Kamala Harris should run for president. I mean, what a waste of time and resources when she could really be getting stuff done for her California constituents and the country. I think she is a fabulous, accomplished woman, but that doesn't make her qualified for presidency. And, yes, I know the orange man currently occupying the role isn't qualified. But the answer to Trump is not more unqualified people! I would also implore people to read on Kamala's policies - and specifically, criminal policies - and then get back to me with Kamala 2020.

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN — Two of Connecticut’s better singer-songwriters will share the stage Feb. 1 at CT Folk’s CT Artist Showcase featuring Kristen Graves and Glenn Roth.

Why King, but not Trump?

Texto completo: This week Republicans completed, with relative ease, what may be their least painful act of righting a wrong in 2019. They repudiated U.S. Rep. Steve King's repeated blathering about white supremacy.
The Iowan, in a New York Times interview, set things in motion by lamely wondering why terms such as "white nationalist," "white supremacist" and "Western civilization" have negative connotations.
From a prominent member of Congress, that's a dog whistle to organized haters such as the Proud Boys, neo-Nazis and their ilk. But it also appeals to a broader range of people who want cover for their own good, old-fashioned racial, ethnic and sectarian biases.
The GOP stripped King of his committee assignments, which is the political equivalent of ordering him to stand silent in a corner.
All good. But the righteousness of the 424-1 vote on the House resolution against the words of King on Tuesday (Jan. 15) is less convincing than it might seem. King has been serving up similar hateful talk for years. Only now have his party's leaders done something about it.
Have Republicans simply enumerated a "words you can't say" list for party members, like comedian George Carlin's famous seven banned words? Or do they accept that the prejudiced views behind King's statements are actually prevalent in their party? White supremacy, after all, dangerously plays into the president's America First doctrine.
Trump's foreign and domestic policy perspectives focus on the supposed victimhood of white Americans and the supposed dangers presented by others deemed to be of lesser status: African-Americans; Latinos, including asylum seekers at the southern border; Syrian refugees and Muslims generally.
Trump's willingness to cause devastating financial harm to federal workers with the shutdown is directly tied to his insistence on a pseudo-solution to the pseudo-problem of Central Americans acting out their supposed criminal blood-lust on Americans.
It's a story he tells and retells his supporters in almost pornographic detail, to keep them in a lather. But immigrants among us, documented or not, commit violent crime at much lower rates than native-born Americans. Trump ought to know that, having hired them at his enterprises throughout his career.
However, the Trump brand is xenophobia. He simply does not want the U.S. engaged in the world, except to dominate and despoil. His attitude is: make them pay or make them suffer. Or both.
What he and his supporters don't understand is that this attitude carries devastating risks.
Horrifyingly, the deaths of four Americans became an example on Wednesday. Two members of the U.S. military, a contract worker and a civilian, were murdered in a heinous act of terrorism in Syria that took as many as 19 lives total. ISIS immediately claimed credit.
The bombing deaths stood in direct conflict with Trump's December insistence that ISIS had been defeated, which he argued justifies withdrawing U.S. troops from a peace-seeking coalition with Kurdish-led forces in Syria.
Sen. Lindsey Graham was among the few Republicans who quickly spoke up, questioning whether Trump's bravado had goaded the terrorists to act. Graham also noted that in Iraq, the U.S. had also undermined the confidence of the people we claimed to be helping, with dire consequences.
Many military leaders today believe that withdrawing U.S. forces in Syria would create a vacuum for others with less benign intentions to fill. Would Turkey attack Kurdish forces as a new front in its decades-long war against ethnic Kurdish separatists? Would ISIS revive and flourish again? It's a fair bet that Trump neither knows nor cares.
Republicans were right to repudiate King. But it's Trump, not King, whose prejudices are causing the greatest harm at home and abroad. It's a shame the GOP lacks the backbone to stand up to him.

Congressional Black Caucus Foundation chairwoman stepping down amid lawsuit by former staffer

Texto completo: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee will step down from two influential posts after a former staffer sued the Texas Democrat for allegedly firing her over a rape complaint.

Jackson Lee will resign as the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's chairwoman, according to the New York Times Wednesday. She'll also temporarily stand down from leading a House Judiciary subcommittee, the newspaper reported. Jackson Lee's chief of staff, the foundation, and a spokesman for the House Judiciary panel did not immediately return the Washington Examiner 's request for comment.

The lawsuit, filed this month, claims Jackson Lee retaliated against the woman referred to in court documents only as "Jane Doe" after she requested a meeting with the congresswoman in March 2018 about an alleged sexual assault three years prior. Doe is seeking at least $75,000 in damages from Jackson Lee and the foundation, who are both named defendants in the suit, for harm caused to her career and emotional stress.

Doe alleges she was raped in 2015 when she was a 19-year-old intern for the foundation by her supervisor, Damien Jones. Doe reported her assault to police and told other people about it around the time of the incident. She elected not to explore legal recourse despite DNA evidence obtained through a medical examination. Jones was eventually placed on leave from the foundation after a complaint from Doe.

The alleged rape was revisited after Doe was hired by Lee's office in 2017 as special assistant and director of public engagement because Jones was being considered for another position on the congresswoman's staff.

In early March 2018, Doe told Rushing she was planning to pursue legal action against the foundation and asked to meet Jackson Lee. Doe was fired by the end of the month due to “budgetary issues," which she alleges was only a pretense for her dismissal.

In a statement to the Times Wednesday, Jackson Lee's office touted her record pushing for better workplace safety and nondiscrimination laws, including in Congress.

“The congresswoman is confident that, once all of the facts come to light, her office will be exonerated of any retaliatory or otherwise improper conduct and this matter will be put to rest,” the statement said.

Trump is trapped and tanking in polls

Texto completo: Even this White House, infamous for self-delusion, must realize it's in deep trouble. Two more polls released Wednesday show the depth of President Trump's problem.
The Morning Consult-Politico poll finds that "57 percent of registered voters disapprove of Trump's job performance -- more than any other survey in Trump's two years in office -- while 40 percent approve. The 17-percentage-point deficit matches two previous lows of the Trump presidency." Sixty percent of independents now disapprove of his performance. As time goes on, more Americans blame Trump for the shutdown ("49 percent of voters [say] he is responsible in the latest survey -- up 6 points since the shutdown began").
The CBS News poll has even worse numbers for Trump. In that survey, "Seven in 10 Americans don't think the issue of a border wall is worth a government shutdown, which they say is now having a negative impact on the country. ... Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has dipped three points from November to 36 percent today. Fifty-nine percent of Americans now disapprove of the job he is doing -- a high for his presidency, although just one point above his previous high." To add insult to injury, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gets higher marks (47 percent) than Trump (35 percent) in handling the shutdown. Only 39 percent think Trump cares a lot or some about people like them; 53 percent say the same of Democrats. On the wall, 61 percent think the border can be secured without it, while 71 percent say it is not worth a shutdown.
The irony here -- or is it karma? -- is that Trump's biggest cheerleaders in the right-wing media (e.g. Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity) and his hardcore anti-immigrant adviser Stephen Miller who egged him on are now responsible for the worst political debacle of his presidency, one that has erased any residue of presidential power. He's now trapped, waiting for a permission slip from the right-wing media chorus to capitulate -- or watch his support and any hope for legislative accomplishments evaporate.
As to the remainder of his term, Trump was never going to advance any proposal on a wide range of issues without Democratic-buy in. Now, having empowered them and weakened his own hand, he'll either have to give more ground in future negotiations or meekly accept two years without a significant accomplishment.
For now, his agenda is on hold. ("The standoff has already forced Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Europe to meet with global business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown," The New York Times reports. "The president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. He has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.")
Trump cannot bear to face the possibility of defeat on the issue that was most central to his campaign and most closely tied to his theme of white grievance. As with trade, however, his fixation with avoiding defeat leads to further erosion of his power. He faces a lose-lose choice: Give in now, as humiliating as that might be, or alternatively, continue a fruitless fight that will sap his chances of political survival and still not avoid eventual defeat.

Texto completo: A new book by a former White House staffer claims that employees within President Donald Trump’s administration are “absolutely out of control” at times. The tell-all titled “Team of Vipers,” which is set to hit shelves next week, describes the browbeating, dysfunction and dissatisfaction experienced within the White House during the first part of Trump’s time in office. The author, Cliff Sims, writes that former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said in frustration that “this is the worst [expletive] job I’ve ever had.” He recounts an instance in which Trump wandered out of a room and began watching television as former House Speaker Paul Ryan was trying to discuss a Republican health-care bill with him. And he depicts the turbulent 11-days when Anthony Scaramucci was White House communications director. “Can you believe this guy?” Trump is quoted saying of Scaramucci. “He’s completely out of his mind — like, on drugs of something — totally out of his mind. We’ll figure it out, but the guy is crazy.” [WaPost]
Happy Tuesday.
Topping the news: TheUtah Transit Authority is looking at extending TRAX lines to Lehi. This announcement comes despite four years of promises from UTA officials to direct future expenditures towards an improvement in the bus system rather than spending on big rail projects. [Trib]
-> According to research by The Salt Lake Tribune, nine out of every 10 Utah legislators are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Latter-day Saint supermajority particularly comes into play for issues such as alcohol, gambling, marijuana, assisted suicide, immigration and gay rights. Non-LDS Utahns make up about 38 percent of the state’s population. [Trib]
-> The Weber County Commission discussed the detrimental effects of the government shutdown on the county with Sen. Mitt Romney, who said action to break the federal impasse must come from the president and House speaker. The meeting was originally closed to the press but a Tribune reporter was able to enter by citing Utah’s Open and Public Meetings Act. [Trib]
Tweets of the day: From @joshtpm: “I’m setting up a new crisis PR firm specializing in work for affluent suburban catholic all boys schools because i don’t feel like I’ve saved enough yet for retirement.”
-> From @KimFoxxforSA: “I’m so excited that @KamalaHarris has decided to run for president. I would not be where I am today without her guidance during my first run for political office, and she has continued to mentor me as I work to reform the criminal justice system in Cook County.”
-> From @tribelaw: “Trump has gotten some quids for his pro-Putin quos but don’t assume the deal is done. Putin may want still more vis-a-vis NATO and Ukraine; and Trump is still beholden to Putin and may STILL want that Moscow Tower after he’s Citizen Trump again.”
In other news: Utah Rep. Cheryl Acton introduced a controversial bill that would ban abortion after 15 weeks with some exceptions. A similar piece of legislation was passed by the Mississippi legislature last year but later struck down by a federal judge. [Trib] [DNews]
-> Tribune columnist Robert Gehrke discusses the cost to taxpayers of passing abortion bans that get overturned by the courts. [Trib]
-> Utah women took to the streets in this year’s Women’s March, boasting a large number of younger participants, thanks in part to the contribution of college-aged activist group People for Unity. [Trib] [DNews] [ABC4]
-> In her State of the City address, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski — who is up for re-election this year — touted past accomplishments while focusing less on future goals. The mayor stated that 2019 would be dedicated to the implementation of the foundations that were put into place by herself and the city staff. [Trib] [DNews]
-> Salt Lake County Council’s newly appointed chairman, Richard Snelgrove, credits past success to the collaborative efforts between Republicans and Democrats on the council. The most pressing issue on the council’s plate, according to Snelgrove, is the the negative effects that the government shutdown is having on Salt Lake County. [Trib]
-> In an interview with the Tribune, prominent feminist and proponent of the Equal Rights Amendment, Sonia Johnson, says she is happy with her life’s work and credits The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with making her who she is. [Trib]
-> Reports indicate that Utah was fourth in the nation in job creation in 2018, with a growth rate of 3.1 percent. It was surpassed only by Nevada, Arizona and Texas. [Trib] [DNews]
-> Only 4.1 percent of Utah workers were members of a union in 2018, while the national average stands at 10.5 percent. This means Utah has the third-lowest rate of labor union membership in the nation. [Trib]
-> Utah’s newest congressman, Ben McAdams, held his first town hall meeting Saturday, discussing the government shutdown, border security, health care and public lands. The audience remained peaceful despite the heated nature of the topics, and McAdams encouraged audience members who had not voted for him to not hold back in voicing their concerns. [Trib] [DNews]
-> Rep. Brad Daw is among the Utah lawmakers who are sponsoring a bill aimed at tweaking the way that ballot initiatives work. The bill would delay implementation of the ballot initiatives once they have passed. [Fox13]
-> Pat Bagley imagines Martin Luther King Jr.’s perspective on the debate over a border wall. [Trib]
-> Pat Bagley illustrates the state of sex education in Utah. [Trib]
Nationally: Democrats declined to accept Trump’s proposal to end the shutdown. The president wants Democrats to approve $5.7 billion for a border wall in exchange for the restoration of temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants. [NYTimes] [Politico]
-> There was no official event at the White House to celebrate Martin Luther King Day. But President Trump made a brief visit to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, telling the press that it was a “beautiful day.” [NYTimes]
-> The New York Times compiled a list of potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, from those who have already entered the race to those who are likely or unlikely to run. [NYTimes]
-> Controversy ensued after video footage went viral showing students from an all-male Catholic high school in Kentucky, cheering loudly while surrounding a Native American Vietnam War veteran outside of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. [NYTimes] [WaPost]
-> Republicans plan to create a rival platform to the Democratic fundraising apparatus, ActBlue, which raised more than $700 million in small-dollar donations during the 2018 campaign. [Politico]

Greg Rosener: Greg grew up spending summers in Estes Park — giving his family relief from the hottest days of on their ranch in eastern Colorado. The Rosener family moved to Estes Park when Greg was a junior in high school and this has been home ever since. He sold both residential and commercial real estate in Estes Park since the early 1970s. Greg’s extensive knowledge of the area is unequaled. Greg’s many accomplishments include economic development (since the early ’80s), leading the local team that rebuilt downtown Estes Park through urban renewal after the 1992 Lawn Lake flood, selling Lily Lake to the Nature Conservancy to become part of Rocky Mountain National Park and creating an Estes Park Economic Development Corporation in 2013. He is currently on several boards and committees.
Jon Nicholas: Nicholas is the President/CEO of the Estes Park Economic Development Corporation, formed in August of 2013. Prior to that time, he served as the Business Resources Coordinator for the Estes Valley Library District, forming regional connections to resources for local business.

Texto completo: A hitchhiking robot was beheaded in Philadelphia. A security robot was punched to the ground in Silicon Valley. Another security bot, in San Francisco, was covered in a tarp and smeared with barbecue sauce.
Why do people lash out at robots, particularly those that are built to resemble humans? It is a global phenomenon. In a mall in Osaka, Japan, three boys beat a humanoid robot with all their strength. In Moscow, a man attacked a teaching robot named Alantim with a baseball bat, kicking it to the ground, while the robot pleaded for help.
Why do we act this way? Are we secretly terrified that robots will take our jobs? Upend our societies? Control our every move with their ever-expanding capabilities and air of quiet malice?
Dark roots
Quite possibly. The specter of insurrection is embedded in the word “robot” itself. It was first used to refer to automatons by Czech playwright Karel Capek, who repurposed a word that had referred to a system of indentured servitude or serfdom. The feudal fear of peasant revolt was transplanted to mechanical servants, and worries of a robot uprising have lingered ever since.
Comedian Aristotle Georgeson has found that videos of people physically aggressing robots are among the most popular he posts on Instagram under the pseudonym Blake Webber. And much of the feedback he gets tends to reflect the fear of robot uprisings.
Georgeson said some commenters approve of the robot beatings, “saying we should be doing this so they can never rise up. But there’s this whole other group that says we shouldn’t be doing this because when they” - the robots - “see these videos they’re going to be” angry.
But Agnieszka Wykowska, a cognitive neuroscientist and editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Social Robotics, said that while human antagonism toward robots has different forms and motivations, it often resembles the ways that humans hurt each other. Robot abuse, she said, might stem from the tribal psychology of insiders and outsiders.
“You have an agent, the robot, that is in a different category than humans,” she said. “So you probably very easily engage in this psychological mechanism of social ostracism because it’s an out-group member. That’s something to discuss: the dehumanization of robots even though they’re not humans.”
Paradoxically, our tendency to dehumanize robots comes from the instinct to anthropomorphize them. William Santana Li, chief executive of Knightscope, the largest provider of security robots in the United States (two of which were battered in San Francisco), said that while he avoids treating his products as if they were sentient beings, his clients seem unable to help themselves.
“Our clients, a significant majority, end up naming the machines themselves,” he said.
‘Frankenstein syndrome’
Wykowska said the cruelty that results from this anthropomorphizing might reflect “Frankenstein syndrome,” because “we are afraid of this thing that we don’t really fully understand, because it’s a little bit similar to us, but not quite enough.”
In his paper “Who Is Afraid of the Humanoid?” Frederic Kaplan, digital humanities chairman at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland, suggested that Westerners have been taught to see themselves as biologically informed machines - and perhaps, are unable to separate the idea of humanity from a vision of machines. The nervous system could only be understood after the discovery of electricity, he wrote. DNA is necessarily explained as an analog to computer code. And the human heart is often understood as a mechanical pump. At every turn, Kaplan wrote, “we see ourselves in the mirror of the machines that we can build.”
This does not explain human destruction of less humanoid machines. Dozens of vigilantes have thrown rocks at driverless cars in Arizona, for example, and incident reports from San Francisco suggest that human drivers are intentionally crashing into driverless cars. These robot altercations may have more to do with fear of unemployment, or with vengeance: A paper published last year by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University suggested that each robot that is added to a discreet zone of economic activity “reduces employment by about six workers.” Blue-collar occupations were particularly hit hard. And a self-driving car killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in March, which at least one man, brandishing a rifle, cited as the reason for his dislike of the machines.

Trump isn't making America great

Texto completo: According to the New York Times, the FBI opened an inquiry into whether President Donald Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia. That was in 2017, shortly after the president fired James Comey.
In a direct response to a question from MSNBC’s Kristen Welker, Trump denied having worked for Russian interests. That comes from a man who, according to The Washington Post, has either lied or made misleading claims 7,645 times since taking office.
If Robert Mueller’s investigation clears Trump of any misdeeds, his report should be made public to all Americans. Would Trump still call the probe a witch hunt?
If, however, the special prosecutor finds that Trump was an unwitting Putin pawn, it would reinforce the perception that the president is unfit for office.
In a worst-case scenario — if Trump is proven to be a Kremlin mole — he ought to be tried for treason. Again, Mueller’s report should be made public.
The president has proudly shut down the government because Democrats won’t pay for a border wall. There is a word for forcing people to work without pay; it is called slavery.
If that is making America “great again,” this entire nation is in dire straits.

A conspiracy of dunces

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Texto completo: "We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."
Douglas Cox, chairman of the Menominee Indian Tribe
GREEN BAY - The children had just awakened from a nap and were still rubbing sleep from their eyes when they pulled up tiny chairs at two small U-shaped tables.
Bowing their heads to say grace in their Oneida native language, the Head Start students were about to snack on Kiwi slices and rice cakes washed down with cups of water.
The Oneida Nation spends $233,000 annually on its Head Start program, which oversees 152 children at two locations on the reservation. Almost three-fourths of Head Start funding for the Green Bay-area tribe is paid through federal funds — roughly $172,000.
But all federal funds flowing to the Oneida and other Wisconsin tribes, as well as Indian tribes across the country, have dried up since the federal government shutdown.
Wisconsin tribes are using their own funds to continue to provide education, health, law enforcement, food pantries and other services, but if the shutdown lasts much longer — and there's no sign of the impasse ending any time soon — some services could be curtailed or cut, hiring might be frozen, workers could be laid off and other drastic measures taken.
"We're fortunate we have the infrastructure and manpower here. A lot of tribes don't have that," Oneida Vice Chairman Brandon Yellowbird Stevens said. "We can supplant the loss of funds with emergency contingency funding."
But the tribe's emergency funding is not limitless and it's designed for emergencies, and no one knows how long the federal shutdown, already the longest, will last.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, the New York Times reported.
When Oneida self-government coordinator Candice Skenandore tries to contact someone at the bureau, which she does daily for her job, she gets automatic email replies that the person she's trying to reach is on furlough for an indefinite time. It's the same for voicemail.
Skenandore is in the middle of negotiations for a new funding agreement for the tribe's health services and she's waiting for grant approvals and funding OKs for several programs. But everything is on hold and Skenandore knows it will take several weeks, if not months, for federal employees to get up to speed once the shutdown ends.
Skenandore is supposed to attend a tribal self-governance advisory board meeting in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, but she's not sure if the meeting will be held.
The shutdown "is stopping us from doing what we need to do to improve our health services," said Skenandore, whose position is federally funded. The tribe is paying her salary during the shutdown.
About 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive basic services from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some tribes, like the Oneida, administer services funded by BIA money, while other tribes have their programs run by federal workers, many of whom are tribal members.
Services tied to decades-old treaties Because of treaties negotiated decades ago, the money funneled to tribes for health care, education, law enforcement and other services is in exchange for tribal nations giving up millions of acres of land in the 1800s. In effect, the tribes prepaid with land for funds now held up by the shutdown.
There's no guarantee tribes will ever see that money. Stevens said the Oneida tribe never got the money it was owed and was not paid during the government shutdown of 2013.
"We ceded millions of acres of land and, in return, the United States said they would pay for health and education," Stevens said.
The Oneida tribe was based in New York at the time and gave up 3 million acres. It later moved to Wisconsin.
Stevens points out that the Oneida were among America's first allies, fighting alongside American troops and helping feed George Washington's army when it was hunkered down at Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777. The tribe continues to receive a symbolic annuity payment of $1,800 each year from the Treasury Department as part of a treaty signed at the end of the Revolutionary War.
The tribe operates a 48-bed nursing home and a health center that handles 350,000 patient visits annually, offering family practice, internal medicine, behavioral health, dental, optical and public health services among other things. Its pharmacy dispenses between 1,000 and 1,200 prescriptions daily, said Debbie Danforth, comprehensive health director for operations.
Last week Danforth was on a conference call with other tribal health directors and learned that while some tribes are able to continue to provide services during the shutdown like the Oneida, some might have to close their clinics in a few weeks.
'It's truly scary' "It's truly scary for some tribes," Danforth said.
Of the Oneida Nation's roughly $490 million 2019 fiscal year budget, about $50 million comes from federal grants and self-governance funds. There are 17,165 enrolled members in the Oneida tribe with more than 4,400 living on the reservation, including 1,000 who are 55 or older.
"Our message to Congress: these should not be discretionary, we shouldn't be the first to be cut," Stevens said.
Wisconsin's other tribes are facing the same difficulties as the Oneida.
The Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is the largest employer in Shawano County with about 900 employees. The tribe does not have its own school system but provides tutors and a public safety officer for school districts where tribal members attend, in Gresham and Bowler. It handles snowplowing and repairing roads for many smaller communities in Shawano County.
About 1,475 people are enrolled in the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe with 500 living on the reservation.
"But many of those are aging so their health care needs are great," Stockbridge-Munsee President Shannon Holsey said.
"A majority of our citizens are no longer in the workforce. They're living on fixed incomes and they look to the tribal nations for needs such as transportation to medical appointments and healthy food distribution through Meals on Wheels," Holsey said.
The biggest priority for the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is its rural health clinic in Bowler, which offers general medicine, dental, behavioral health, chiropractic and community health services as well as a pharmacy. Since there are no buses or public transportation, the tribe shuttles members who cannot get to a doctor on their own and sends a registered nurse to help people who forget to take their medicine.
The tribe is paying for services normally provided by federal funds out of its reserves but Holsey said there's a limit to that, especially for a small tribe like the Stockbridge-Munsee.
Lac du Flambeau tightens spending Two weeks into the shutdown, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa decided to freeze all capital expenditures until further notice and told employees to be frugal in spending. Not all federal grants have been affected by the shutdown but some have and tribal administrators are meeting regularly with the tribe's accounting staff.
"We want to avoid disruption in services wherever possible and we are working carefully to determine the impact to our general fund and to avoid layoffs," Lac du Flambeau President Joseph Wildcat Sr. said in a statement.
The Menominee Indian Tribe is also using reserve funds to keep essential programs open, Chairman Douglas Cox said.
Like all tribes, the Menominee use a mix of funding to pay for services ranging from a police force and tribal court system to a large health clinic and K-8 school. Menominee Indian High School is a state school district and is not affected by the shutdown.
There are 9,300 enrolled Menominee members with about 4,000 living on or near the reservation.
Cox estimates about 60 percent of the tribe's $19 million annual operating budget is funded through federal grants. Cox and other leaders are reviewing the tribe's finances daily during the shutdown to ensure services continue to be provided.
Cox is worried money due to the tribes from this federal government shutdown will never be paid because Congress would have to approve paying those funds separately.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous," Cox said in a phone interview.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."

TRUMP AND HIS MORONS NOBODY LEFT BESIDES THOSE WITH NO REPUTATION TO LOSE

Texto completo: There have been many policy disasters over the course of U.S. history. It's hard, however, to think of a calamity as gratuitous, an error as unforced, as the current federal shutdown.
Nor can I think of another disaster as thoroughly personal, as completely owned by one man. When Donald Trump told Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, "I will be the one to shut it down," he was being completely accurate - although he went on to promise that "I'm not going to blame you for it," which was a lie.
Still, no man is an island, although Mr. Trump comes closer than most. You can't fully make sense of his policy pratfalls without acknowledging the extraordinary quality of the people with whom he has surrounded himself. And by "extraordinary," of course, I mean extraordinarily low quality. Lincoln had a team of rivals; Mr. Trump has a team of morons.
If this sounds too harsh, consider recent economic pronouncements by two members of his administration. Predictably, these pronouncements involve bad economics; that's pretty much a given. What's striking, instead, is the inability of either man to stay on script; they can't even get their right-wing mendacity right.
First up is Kevin Hassett, chairman of Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, who was asked about the plight of federal workers who aren't being paid. You don't have to be a public relations expert to know that you're supposed to express some sympathy, whether you feel it or not. After all, there are multiple news reports about transportation security workers turning to food banks, the Coast Guard suggesting its employees hold garage sales, and so on.
So the right response involves expressing concern about those workers but placing the blame on Democrats who don't want to stop brown-skinned rapists, or something like that. But no: Mr. Hassett declared that it's all good, that the workers are actually "better off," because they're getting time off without having to use any of their vacation days.
Then consider what Sean Hannity had to say about taxing the rich. What's that? You say that Mr. Hannity isn't a member of the Trump administration? But surely he is in every sense that matters. In fact, Fox News isn't just state TV, its hosts clearly have better access to the president, more input into his decisions, than any of the so-called experts at places like the State Department or the Department of Defense.
Anyway, Mr. Hannity declared that raising taxes on the wealthy would damage the economy, because "rich people won't be buying boats that they like recreationally," and "they're not going to be taking expensive vacations anymore."
Um, that's not the answer a conservative is supposed to give. You're supposed to insist that low taxes on the rich give them an incentive to work really, really hard, not make it easier for them to take lavish vacations. You're supposed to declare that low taxes will induce them to save and spend money building businesses, not help them afford to buy new yachts.
Even if your real reason for favoring low taxes is that they let your wealthy friends engage in even more high living, you're not supposed to say that out loud.
Again, the point isn't that people in Mr. Trump's circle don't care about ordinary American families, and also talk nonsense - that's only to be expected. What's amazing is that they're so out of it that they don't know either how to pretend to care about the middle class, or what nonsense to spout in order to sustain that pretense.
So what's wrong with Mr. Trump's people? Why can't they serve up even some fake populism?
There are, I think, two answers, one generic to modern conservatism, one specific to Trump.
On the generic point: To be a modern conservative is to spend your life inside what amounts to a cult, barely exposed to outside ideas or even ways of speaking. Inside that cult, contempt for ordinary working Americans is widespread - remember Eric Cantor, the then-House majority leader, celebrating Labor Day by praising business owners. So is worship of wealth. And it can be hard for cult members to remember that you don't talk that way to outsiders.
Then there's the Trump effect. Normally working for the president of the United States is a career booster, something that looks good on your résumé. Mr. Trump's presidency, however, is so chaotic, corrupt and potentially compromised by his foreign entanglements that anyone associated with him gets tainted - which is why after only two years he has already left a trail of broken men and wrecked reputations in his wake.
So who is willing to serve him at this point? Only those with no reputation to lose, generally because they're pretty bad at what they do. There are, no doubt, conservatives smart and self-controlled enough to lie plausibly, or at least preserve some deniability, and defend Mr. Trump's policies without making fools of themselves. But those people have gone into hiding.
A year ago I pointed out that the Trump administration was turning into government by the worst and the dumbest. Since then, however, things have gotten even worse and even dumber. And we haven't hit bottom yet.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has certainly surrounded himself with plenty of incompetent and ethically challenged people. But in William Barr, he has nominated someone with a track record of integrity and experience to be the next attorney general.
Such a person is badly needed at the Justice Department. Not only has Trump repeatedly debased law enforcement, his actions also have left many Americans thinking the unthinkable — that the president not only benefited from Russia's interference in the 2016 election but also is somehow beholden to its government.
No less than the FBI has entertained this thought. The New York Times reported that the FBI started a counterintelligence inquiry in 2017 into whether Trump was — gulp! — acting as an agent of the Russian government.
The outcome of that inquiry is unknown, and Trump denied that he ever worked on Russia's behalf. But he has given Americans plenty of reason for suspicion, including his odd obsequiousness toward Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, his confiscation of notes and records from his meetings with Putin, his real estate dealings with Russians, and his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, leaving a vacuum for Russia and others to fill.
It is into this troubling context that Barr now drops as Trump's pick to become the nation's top law enforcement official and overseer of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry. This would be Barr's second stint as attorney general, a position he ably held during the administration of President George H.W. Bush.
At the very least, Barr would represent a huge upgrade over acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is wholly ill-suited for the job.
Barr states in prepared testimony for his Senate confirmation hearing that Mueller should be given a chance to finish his report, and that the report should be made public. This is a good start but is not sufficient. Mueller might plan further legal actions such as subpoenas, indictments and plea agreements. Barr needs to pledge that he would not interfere with those. He also needs to make abundantly clear that he would not fire Mueller.
Beyond these things, Barr needs to explain recent statements and writings defending the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and criticizing Mueller on the grounds that members of the special counsel's team made political contributions to Hillary Clinton.
While some Democrats have urged that his nomination be withdrawn, this is too extreme. Barr has done nothing to disqualify himself and deserves a chance to make his case.
An attorney general can be hired and fired by the president, but ultimately he or she serves the Constitution and the rule of law. At this fraught time in the nation's history, senators shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough.

Lawmakers here today, gone to Maui

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

Texto completo: Ahead of Saturday's Women's March in San Jose, activists will stage a protest today outside the San Jose Improv, where disgraced comedian Louis C.K. is scheduled to perform tonight and Thursday.
Organizers of the San Jose Women's March and the Enough is Enough Voter Project, a national political action committee aimed at targeting politicians who condone violence against women, will demonstrate outside venue starting at 7:30 p.m.
They have denounced the San Jose Improv for booking the 51-year-old comedian, given his admission in November 2017 that he sexually harassed multiple women by masturbating in front of them. C.K. was responding to allegations in the New York Times made by five women who worked with him.
More recently, C.K. made jokes at a stand-up performance that mocked teen survivors of the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting, as well as young people who identify as transgender.
"Santa Clara County recently voted in a landslide to recall Judge (Aaron) Persky because we believe that sexual violence and harassment is very serious," said Stanford Law professor Michele Dauber, the founder and chair of Enough is Enough. "The Improv should not give a serial sexual harasser a platform in our community to make light of the harm he caused to his victims."
The statement from Enough is Enough noted that other venues have canceled C.K.'s shows due to outrage over "his shocking and disgusting actions. ... But now the Improv has booked C.K. in San Jose, despite the fact that he is an admitted sexual harasser."
San Jose Improv on Tuesday indicated that it has no plans to cancel C.K.'s shows, with a spokesperson for the Improv Comedy Clubs saying the franchise stands by the comedian's right to perform, while respecting critics' right to protest.
"We see comedy as the final frontier and we don't censor artists," according to a statement. "We want them to perform without scrutiny. We trust that our audiences can decide for themselves what their limits are. We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision and we respect their right to protest. We also respect Louis C.K.'s right to perform."
Details about the protest were posted on Facebook. A Change.org petition also was launched Tuesday to denounce San Jose Improv for booking C.K.
"Tell the owners of San Jose Improv that you oppose the booking of Louis CK and are immediately calling for the cancellation of his shows," the petition said. "As customers and/or residents of San Jose we need to express to the owners that the decision to book Louis CK is not something we stand behind."
Monday, San Jose Improv announced that the C.K. would be trying out some "new material" that's "XXX adults only" at his two scheduled performances.
But the announcement also raised questions about whether C.K.'s "new" material would include the jokes that enraged many last month. Leaked audio of a set he performed at a Long Island club showed him mocking students who survived the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The violence left 17 people dead and some of the survivors have become nationally known advocates for gun control.
"They testify in front of Congress, these kids," the Emmy winner joked at the Governor's Comedy Club in Levittown, N.Y., on Dec. 16, according to reports. "You're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids were shot."
He then asked, "Why does that mean I have to listen to you?"
C.K. also delivered a few lines ripping political correctness among young people and adopted a stereotypical lisp to excoriate new attitudes and language regarding gender identity.
"They tell you what to call them," C.K. said. "You should address me as they them because I identify as gender neutral...'"
Some comedians and former fans have said the 51-year-old comedian has come off as excessively defensive and angry in his comeback performances, or point out he's not doing what he successfully did in the past: leavening his more abrasive and edgy jokes with moments of empathy, self-deprecation or self-reflection.
The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon and other writers have been more harsh in their criticism, with Fallon writing that the Parkland and transgender jokes were "just plain disgusting" and accused C.K. of "pandering to the alt-right."
But C.K. has his defenders. Ricky Gervais tweeted that it's wrong to say there are certain subjects that are out of bounds for comedy. Others have said it was unethical for audience members to secretly record C.K.'s set when he was likely in the process of trying out new material and would discard jokes that didn't go over well.
"Leave Louis C.K. alone," said another famous defender, longtime friend Janeane Garofalo, in a recent podcast.
While appearing on Bust Magazine's "Poptarts" pop culture podcast, Garofalo said C.K.'s critics should at least consider his family's feelings.
"He's been my friend and I stand by that he's been my friend since 1985, and I think he has suffered," she said. "And when he performs at the Comedy Cellar and people get all irate, if nothing else, care about his daughters. If nothing else if you can find no compassion for him, which I think you should think about how his daughters, who hear all of this stuff, feel. Why don't you leave him alone for them if you're so women-empowering?"
Garofalo said C.K. has "paid heavily, heavily, and his family has paid heavily."
On its website, promoting the "special event" shows tonight and Thursday night, the San Jose Improv did not mention C.K.'s sexual misconduct scandal or his recent controversial performances. The venue touted his Peabody Award-winning shows "Louie" and "Horace and Pete" and hailed him as a "six-time Emmy Award winner" and "the first comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden three times for the same tour."
The shows were sold out as of Monday night, but fans can sign up for a waiting list.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Sen. James Risch, the new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, says he has disagreed with President Donald Trump on “many, many occasions. ”
But in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Risch defended the president’s controversial approach to North Korea and Syria. He downplayed reports that Trump wants to withdraw from NATO.
And he flatly refused to answer questions about the FBI’s reported probe into whether Trump was secretly working for Russia, or whether Congress should subpoena the notes of Trump’s interpreter in his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Next issue,” the Idaho Republican responded brusquely when asked if he would support seeking the interpreter’s notes. That question has gained steam in the wake of a Washington Post report that Trump tried to hide the details of his conversations with Putin, even from other officials in his administration.
The 75-year-old lawmaker said he was “stunned” to learn of the FBI probe into whether Trump was working on Russia’s behalf, and he quickly cut off a question about it.
“I’m not going to do this. That’s nonsense, all nonsense,” said the former trial lawyer and current cattle rancher, who has also served as Idaho’s governor and state legislative leader.
Risch takes the helm of the committee at a turbulent moment in U. S. foreign policy, with lawmakers in both parties questioning the Trump administration’s approach to Saudi Arabia, Russia, Syria and North Korea, among other global hot spots.
Here’s the new chairman’s take on four key foreign policy questions – and whether he will act as a check on Trump:
China
Risch said his biggest foreign policy concern was China’s expanding geopolitical influence. That will be a major focus of the first hearings he plans to convene, the Idaho senator said, along with a broader look at the re-emergence of a competition between global powers.
“Particularly in the latter part of the 20th century, we were the 800-pound gorilla on the planet,” Risch said. “We’re still the 800-pound gorilla, but there’s some (other) gorillas that are growing up pretty quickly. ”
The Chinese government has made billions of dollars in loans to countries in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere – using what some have called "debt-trap diplomacy" to increase its leverage across the globe and challenge American influence.
“They’re everywhere,” Risch said. “They want to establish their influence, and particularly economic influence, in every possible place that they can. ”
Syria
Risch said he had no immediate plans for a hearing on Trump’s decision to withdraw U. S. forces from Syria, which has created confusion and concern among American allies across the Middle East. Lawmakers in both parties have criticized the decision, saying it will allow ISIS to regain strength and will leave the U. S. -allied Syrian Kurds vulnerable to attack from Turkey.
Risch expressed confidence that U. S. would be able to continue its campaign against ISIS from other locations in the region. And he said he’s satisfied with Trump’s efforts to protect the Syrian Kurds from harm.
NATO
Risch expressed staunch support for NATO, calling it “the most successful military alliance in the history of the world. ”
Trump has criticized the 70-year-old military alliance as “obsolete” and threatened to withdraw the U. S. from NATO. The New York Times reported on Monday that he has repeatedly revisited that possibility even as his top advisers have warned against such a move.
Risch said he agrees with Trump's complaint that other NATO countries do not spend enough on defense. But, he said, “that doesn’t justify getting out of NATO or making major changes to NATO. ”
Still, Risch would not commit to supporting bipartisan legislation to prevent the president from withdrawing from NATO without congressional approval.
“We’re not at that point where we need to talk about that yet,” Risch said.
North Korea
Risch, who also sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered a full-throated endorsement of Trump’s efforts to arrange a second summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The two men held an historic first meeting last year in Singapore, when they signed a vaguely worded pledge to work toward full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Critics say Kim has done little to make good on that agreement and that Trump should hold out for more concrete action before he agrees to another high-level meeting. Kim has not, for example, given American negotiators an inventory of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal – what many experts see as a vital first step.
Trump and his allies note that North Korea hasn’t launched any missiles in the last year and has moved to dismantle some nuclear and missile engine test sites.
“Every single American, including the national media, should be delighted that we’re in a lot better place than where we were previously,” Risch said.
Trump wants to have a second meeting “so that he can better secure the defense of the United States,” Risch said. “That’s –– really, really good idea. ”
Trump
Risch seemed taken aback when asked if he would stand up to Trump when he believes the president is wrong.
“Why would you perceive that I would stand up to Trump? What kind of question is that?” he asked.
Risch’s processor as chairman, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, had many public feuds with the president over foreign policy issues – blasting Trump for his warm words for Russian President Vladimir Putin and rebuking the administration for its handling of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, among other steps.
Risch said he’ll be looking for ways to support the president, not fight with him.
“It’s in every American’s interest to see that the president is very successful when it comes to foreign policy. I want to help him do that,” he said.
He said he’s disagreed with Trump on a number of issues but never publicly. “When I did it was face-to-face, person-to-person,” he said. Asked what those disagreements were about, he said: “I’m not going there. ”

TM Landry: Education breakthrough or scam?

Texto completo: After eight years of quiet existence, TM Landry in Breaux Bridge made national news for its non-traditional success in student achievement, high level ACT scores and college placement. Then, for reasons unknown, the New York Times burst its bubble, challenging its integrity, its leadership and its methods.
The truth about TM Landry is a concern. Is it an unorthodox solution to the intractable challenge of educating disadvantaged kids? A scam? Even a cult?
I do not know but have confidence that the answers will be revealed. The reason? Greg Davis.
It starts with Greg's belief in all children and his commitment to helping underprivileged kids succeed in life as he has. Literally, leading them to the heights of Mt. McKinley and the depths of the Grand Canyon.
It is his belief in the ability of everyone that caused him to receive the Lafayette Civic Cup for his leadership in welcoming 14,500 people to the Cajundome so they could recover their dignity and rebuild their lives after the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Greg has a very personal interest in knowing the truth about TM Landry. Two of his grandchildren enrolled there this year. They were successful in the Lafayette Parish School System. Unfortunately, personal circumstances dictated their move to another school district which system failed them.
Greg not only drives them to the school but spends time there as a family volunteer.
Following the New York Times bombshell, Greg helped organize the school's previously non-existent board. Long time BESE Board member, Linda Johnson, has joined him in that effort.
Under Greg's guidance, the board has commissioned two investigations. A CPA firm is conducting a financial audit. Former Louisiana Superintendent of Investigation Paul Pastorek, and the Couhig law firm are conducting a broader investigation of the allegations raised by the New York Times and the experience of students who continue being educated there.
The results of both will be made public so that everyone has the facts.

Why is King feeling GOP's wrath now?

Texto completo: Steve King, known as much for the controversial things he says as he is for anything he's done in Congress, may have finally lost the support of key Iowa Republicans who have long stood by him.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" he's quoted as saying in a Jan. 10 New York Times article that highlighted King's long history of racially fueled rhetoric, particularly around immigration.
That quote has resulted in a steady drumbeat of denunciations from King's fellow Republicans, the stripping of his committee assignments in Congress and, on Tuesday, a formal, nearly unanimous condemnation on the floor of the House.
King adamantly denies supporting white nationalism and white supremacy. But this month's developments come less than three months after his last major controversy, in which he met with members of an Austrian far-right political party associated with neo-Nazi movements.
But King has made comments throughout his 16-year Congressional career that those on the left as well as the right have castigated as inflammatory, controversial, racially insensitive, racist and harmful to American discourse.
So why does this moment feel like a turning point for King's career?
Iowa Republicans interviewed by the Register say it's a confluence of factors in a unique political moment:
For Republicans seeking election in Iowa and across the country, King has become a political liability. For those who share many of his views on immigration and the border wall, he's become a distraction. And in Iowa's 4th District, where voters have elected him nine times, he appears to be — for the first time in his career — beatable.
Becoming a political liability David Kochel, a Republican strategist who advised Gov. Kim Reynolds' 2018 election campaign, calls King "the largest in-kind contribution Nancy Pelosi's received" because of the drag King represents to other Republican candidates.
"District by district, Republican candidates get asked about his comments," he said. "It is never in a context that is helpful to our candidates. ... The laundry list of comments that he's made, positions that he's taken over the course of several years — it's untenable for our candidates to have to answer for someone like that."
King made headlines right before the 2018 midterm elections in which he and Reynolds both were competing in closely contested campaigns.
With such a close race, could Reynolds afford to alienate King's voters by publicly denouncing him? But become too cozy, and she risked losing many of the more moderate Republicans across Iowa's other three districts.
She threaded the needle by condemning King's comments without removing him as one of her campaign co-chairs — an almost entirely symbolic position that enraged Democrats who thought Reynolds should have distanced herself more.
After the election, she came out with a more forceful denunciation of King, saying King "needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else, and I think he needs to take a look at that."
Kochel disputes the idea that Reynolds should have made that statement before Election Day.
"Gov. Reynolds is responsible for what she says and what she believes," he said. "And that's part of why I think there is a major effort now in the party to find the right candidate and defeat (King) in a primary."
Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst will be on the ballot in 2020 and no doubt will be questioned, as Reynolds was, about her thoughts on King. This month, Ernst joined other Republicans in condemning King's comments.
Nationally, Republicans lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives and may already be looking toward their ability to manage a 2020 cycle in which Democrats will undoubtedly seek to highlight Republican President Donald Trump's similarly controversial comments. Publicly admonishing King now helps them make the case that they don't tolerate racism within their party.
A growing distraction Other Republicans who live and work in King's district say they've known and respected King for years but are finding it increasingly difficult to support him.
Rep. Matt Windschitl, the speaker pro tempore of the Iowa House and a Missouri Valley Republican, said that for some, the constant controversy may be starting to pile up and outweigh the conservative work King has done in Congress.
"I think that many of his comments have distracted from the message that needs to be put forward," said Windschitl, who has championed an expansion of gun rights and restrictions on abortions.
Rep. Steve Holt, a Republican from Denison and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he agrees with King on things like immigration, border security and the need for a wall along the nation's southern border. Holt last year led an effort to outlaw so-called sanctuary cities in Iowa and has been a fierce advocate for "the rule of law."
"This isn't helpful because this is not what conservative values are about," Holt said. "This is not what the Republican Party is about. The Republican Party is about advancing conservative values that I believe are in the best interest of everybody, regardless of their sex and regardless of their color. So, of course it's not helpful, because it's a distraction that isn't needed."
Belief that he's beatable Republicans also say that J.D. Scholten, King's Democratic challenger in the 2018 race, deserves some credit for this political moment.
Scholten showed for the first time since King first took office that not only is King potentially beatable but, with the right set of circumstances, he could even be beaten by a Democrat.
Republicans outnumber Democrats 190,000 to 120,000 in the 4th District, and many of those Republicans remain fiercely loyal to King. But Scholten came within 11,000 votes of King in the midterm elections — the closest call of King's political career.
Put up the right Republican — someone who matches King's deep-red, conservative bona fides with a base of support in the district and the ability to raise money — and it's possible King could be defeated in a primary.
State. Sen. Randy Feenstra, R-Hull, announced a primary challenge to King the day before the Times story was published. Feenstra, who is chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, shepherded one of the most substantial tax cuts in state history through the Iowa Legislature last year.
His primary challenge is seen as credible in ways that many of King's other previous challengers have not, in part because his candidacy wasn't dreamed up by a group of Republicans from outside the district who recruited him to the race.
"Both Rep. King and President Trump benefit from the same odd phenomenon," said Brad Best, a political science professor at Buena Vista University. "They both have lengthy records of controversial, offensive remarks that, paradoxically, serve to trivialize the effects of any subsequent bad behavior."
In King's first eight Congressional races, there was no electoral cost, Best said. King won handily.
"The context in which King maneuvers is, however, changing," Best said. "And a growing number of Republicans with sound political credentials are betting that 'King fatigue' is peaking in the 4th District."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A group of House Democrats declined an invitation to meet with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, stymieing a plan by the White House to break the shutdown stalemate by winning over centrist Democrats.
On the 25th day of the government shutdown, both sides remained entrenched in their positions - the White House issued a statement opposing legislation introduced by House Democrats to reopen shuttered agencies until Feb. 1 or Feb. 28, while House Democratic leaders continued to assert that they will not support a spending deal that funds Trump's $5.7 billion request for a southern border wall.
With no signs of the gap between Trump and Democratic leaders narrowing, several groups of lawmakers have started to meet informally, looking to devise a solution to end the longest-running government shutdown.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders chastised House Democrats for not accepting the president's offer to meet for lunch on Tuesday, saying, "It's time for the Democrats to come to the table and make a deal."
But several Democrats, pointing to Trump's decision to walk out of a bipartisan meeting at the White House last week after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to support his $5.7 billion demand, expressed concerns about showing up at Tuesday's gathering.
"The question everybody can reasonably ask: Is he inviting people to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to really try to resolve this problem, or to create a photo-op to project a false sense of bipartisanship?" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) during a Tuesday morning news conference.
Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.), a member of the new class of freshman House Democrats, told reporters on Capitol Hill that after a Tuesday morning meeting "the general feeling" among the group was "that whoever goes to the White House is kind of setting themselves up to be used as a stunt."
Five House Republicans who emerged from the White House gathering with Trump criticized Democrats for not showing up, and reiterated the president's calls for an updated wall along the U.S. and Mexico border.
"If you don't show up at the table, how in the world are you ever going to come up with a solution?" said Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.).
On Capitol Hill, Democrats ramped up efforts to pressure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell into scheduling a vote to reopen the government temporarily while negotiations over border security funding continue. McConnell (R-Ky.) has repeatedly said he will not schedule a vote on any measures not first supported by Trump, who has threatened to veto any legislation that does not fully fund his border wall request.
Nearly a dozen freshman House Democrats staged a demonstration, descending on McConnell's office Tuesday afternoon to call on him to schedule a vote, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a Senate floor speech described McConnell as the "only one person who can help America break through this gridlock."
"For the past month, Leader McConnell has been content to hide behind the president, essentially giving him a veto over what comes to the floor of the Senate. It has put him in the ridiculous position of refusing to consider legislation to reopen the government that nearly every Senate Republican has voted for," Schumer said, referring to legislation passed last month that would have temporarily kept the government open before the shutdown went into effect.
McConnell, in a Senate floor speech, accused Democrats of engaging "in increasingly acrobatic contortions in order to dodge a serious conversation about the urgent humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border."
"Their refusal to come to the negotiating table has serious implications for the hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay, and for all Americans who deserve a nation that can secure its own border," McConnell said.
Amid the gridlock, a dozen Senate moderates, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D- W.Va.) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have been holding informal discussions aimed at brokering a solution, according to multiple news reports, and a group of freshman Democrats who won in districts carried by Trump in 2016 planned to meet this week to discuss whether they should push Democratic leaders to negotiate further with Trump, according to The New York Times.
The informal talks come as 800,000 federal employees continue to be furloughed or to work without pay since the shutdown went into effect on Dec. 22.
Plans for lawmakers to take a recess at the end of the week until Jan. 28 were put on hold Tuesday, with McConnell and Pelosi both announcing the Senate and House would remain in session until a resolution is reached on the

Texto completo: The 2019 PEN America Literary Service Award will be given to Bob Woodward, The Washington Post editor known most recently for "Fear: Trump in the White House," one of the biggest political books of 2018 with nearly two million copies sold.
"Woodward has set the standard for dogged and objective reporting and gripping storytelling," said Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive officer of PEN America, in a statement. "His work has helped fortify American democracy for decades."
Woodward played a central role in bringing to light Richard Nixon's role during the Watergate scandal through his reporting for The Washington Post and wrote a number of books on the subject, including "All the President's Men: The Greatest Reporting Story of All Time," written with Carl Bernstein. He pioneered in the use of anonymous sources, which allowed him to report on details that might not otherwise have become public. He has also tackled a number of other presidents including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
The PEN America Literary Gala, which will be held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York on May 21, will also recognize Scholastic chief executive officer Richard Robinson, who has led the company for more than 40 years. "Scholastic has informed the next generation and inspired them to be empathetic, engaged citizens," read PEN America's statement.
Last year, Stephen King received the Service Award, and past winners have included Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison and J.K. Rowling.
Two other award recipients will be announced in the coming months, including for the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, which will honor a writer or artist persecuted for their work, and the PEN/Toni and James C. Goodale Freedom of Expression Courage Award, which "celebrates dauntless exercises of free expression." John Oliver of "Last Week Tonight" on HBO will host the event.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House nearly unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday condemning Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, for questioning why phrases such as "white supremacist" are offensive.
King voted for the resolution himself. It passed 424 to 1.
Before the vote, King said he agreed with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy. " The resolution invoked King’s comments and condemned such words as “hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States. ”
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country.
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.
He said his "white supremacist" comments had not come across as he intended.
King sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber as Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, urged his colleagues to support the resolution. A handful of Republicans sat nearby. Many stood up to condemn racism.
On the other side of the aisle, about two dozen Democrats sat in rapt silence as Clyburn, a civil rights veteran, invoked the work of Martin Luther King Jr. , whose birthday was Tuesday.
“Now is the time to do right," Clyburn said before the vote. “This body must speak out against this evil. "
The sole "no" vote came from Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. , an African-American, who said the measure did not go far enough.
Minimally, King should be censured, Rush said Tuesday, and if he continues making such remarks, he should be expelled from Congress.
“Steve King has made a career out of being a racist, and he needs to be called out as such,” he said.
The vote followed a series of condemnations from lawmakers in both parties. A handful of prominent Republicans said King should leave Congress, and top House Republicans voted Monday not to assign King any committees in the new Congress. King was on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business Committees. He had been the chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled the House.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?” King said in an interview with The New York Times last week. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
"The House Republicans denounce his language. We do not believe in his language, and we’ve decided that he will not serve on any" committees, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , said Tuesday. He said it was up to King whether he should resign.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. , the No. 3 House Republican, went further, echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. : "I think that he should find another line of work," she said. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also called on King to resign.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, 235-199, with the help of a coalition of women, African-Americans and Hispanics. They ushered in the most diverse class yet, breaking records for the number of women and minorities. The House GOP became less diverse, seeing a decline in the number of women and the loss of the sole African-American Republican woman in the House, Mia Love of Utah.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. , applauded Republican leaders for their “strong” actions against King on Tuesday. “I think they did the right thing,’’ he said. “I think they’re very concerned about their party being perceived as a Steve King party. ”
Hoyer said the party was discussing two measures that would censure King – one by Rush and a more narrow one from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio – acknowledging that such actions could open a Pandora’s box. “It is a big deal to be censured,” he said.
Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce, the first Republican to join Ryan’s censure resolution and a member of the steering committee that stripped King of his committees, told USA TODAY he tried to have a “man-to-man” conversation with King when he “made stupid comments” about immigrants in 2013.
“My point was that when you say stupid things, it splashes on all of us,” Joyce said. “He said, well, he gets good publicity out of it. I said, ‘Well you need to think about other people here because it’s not right. ' "

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: Confirmation hearing for attorney general nominee Barr
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear Tuesday from William Barr, President Donald Trump’s attorney general nominee. Barr, who served as the attorney general under President George H. W. Bush, has been a major critic of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. If confirmed to succeed the ousted Jeff Sessions, Barr would have full authority over Mueller's inquiry. On Monday, Barr released written testimony to the committee stating his pledge to allow Mueller to complete his work. Along with the Russia investigation, other points expected to be brought up during the hearing include criminal justice overhaul and immigration policy.
Rep. King faces disapproval vote over racial comments
Democrats in control of the House of Representatives have scheduled a Tuesday vote on a resolution of disapproval of Rep. Steve King over the Iowa Republican's comments on white supremacy. The decision to hold a vote came on Monday night, just as GOP leadership also decided not to give committee assignments to King, who has been in Congress since 2003. “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King said in an interview with the New York Times last week.
10 years ago, 155 survived the 'Miracle on the Hudson'
The sky was cold but clear a decade ago Tuesday when Flight 1549 took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport with 155 passengers and crew. “What a view of the Hudson today," pilot Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger remarked to co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles. Less than a minute later, the plane collided with a flock of geese, knocking out both engines. Sullenberger took the controls and somehow brought the plane down in one piece onto the surface of the Hudson River. For Sullenberger, the "Miracle on the Hudson" brought instant fame and eventually a Hollywood film starring Tom Hanks. For the passengers, it led many to re-examine their lives. "Everything that I could think about was the things I was going to miss," said Tripp Harris, 47. "That fundamentally shifted my priorities. "
Ford and Volkswagen expected to make major announcement
Ford and Volkswagen plan an announcement Tuesday during the Detroit auto show regarding a possible alliance. The carmakers have been talking since June about several joint projects and joint development of a range of commercial vehicles. Ford and VW sources have said in recent months that talks are proceeding as hoped. The companies also have said any partnership won't be a merger or include equity stakes. News of a potential announcement won praise from industry analysts, and some have said the alliance could result in more jobs.
That was fast: Serena wins 49-minute Melbourne match
Serena Williams appears to be a woman on a mission at the Australian Open, which could be a good thing in her quest to earn a 24th Grand Slam title. Making her first appearance at the Down Under Grand Slam since she won the title while in her first trimester of pregnancy in 2017, Williams flew past fellow mom, Tatjana Maria of Germany, 6-0, 6-2 in 49 minutes. “That was one of the best matches of my career,” the 16th-seeded Williams said.

Texto completo: The Russian media was having way too much fun last week.
They were downright gleeful over new reports that a group of Democrats had used online disinformation in the campaign against Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama in 2017.
"Well, well, well," went the general line in the Russian media, "look what we have here."
Their reaction was understandable, given the news that American political operatives had tried the same kind of troll operations that United States intelligence officials believe the Russian government used in an attempt to swing the 2016 presidential election to Donald J. Trump.
The Russian news outlet Sputnik jumped on the news, saying last week that the Alabama operation "seems to cast Democrats' Russiagate accusations into further doubt."
Also getting in on the action was RT, the Kremlin-financed news organization once known as Russia Today. "The only 'Russian bots' to meddle in U.S. elections," the network reported, "belonged to Democrat-linked experts."
The disinformation campaign in Alabama included a scheme to produce false evidence that Russian Twitter bots were working to elect Mr. Moore. After the revelations first came to light, John Griffing, a former executive director of the Harris County Republican Party in Texas, appeared on RT to go after the Democrats.
"I've always been suspicious that the Russia-bot narrative was flimsy and probably made up," Mr. Griffing told RT viewers. "Simply because that's the kind of thing the Democratic Party does -- they make things up in order to create the basis for an attack on the right wing."
In addition to giving Russia new ammunition in its defense against election-meddling allegations, the progressives' political caper in Alabama sent a chilling message to the rest of us: Reality-warping attacks are now coming from inside the house.
If the trend intensifies, the 2020 presidential campaign will make the media shenanigans of 2016 seem genteel.
Sputnik and RT were keying off two articles in The New York Times, which broke the news of the Alabama efforts. The first, by Scott Shane and Alan Blinder in late December, detailed an operation that included the creation of fake Russian Twitter accounts, as well as a phony Facebook page purportedly set up by conservative Alabamians opposed to Mr. Moore, who ended up losing to his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.
One of the people behind that effort, Jonathon Morgan, of the cyber security firm New Knowledge, minimized the effort by saying it was only an experiment to observe how such Russian-style tactics work in real time (though an internal report said the project was seeking to depress turnout for Mr. Moore).
The main financial backer of that project, the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, disavowed it, saying he did not know the money he had donated to groups affiliated with Democrats would finance such a thing. "I want to be unequivocal," he wrote on Medium. "There is absolutely no place in our democracy for manipulating facts or using falsehoods to gain political power."
Mr. Jones, the politician who benefited from the operation, angrily denounced it and called for a federal investigation. So maybe there was reason to think it was all just a blip.
Then came the second Times article, last week, on another shady tactic used against Mr. Moore. This one involved a Facebook page for a fake group of Baptists supporting Mr. Moore as a potential ally in their bid to ban alcohol in Alabama -- a surefire way to alienate voters if ever there was one.
The phony teetotaling campaign was the work of another group of liberal activists with different financiers, whose identities remain unknown. And it came with an implicit warning: Get used to it.
As one of the organizers, the progressive activist Matt Osborne, told The Times, "If you don't do it, you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back." Given the way some of Mr. Trump's backers -- here and in Russia -- have engaged in such tactics, he said, there was "a moral imperative to do this."
Researchers who have been studying the Russian disinformation tactics have been girding for just such a development.
"One of the things we've been talking about in the last year is how the real threat's going to be when it's not just Russia or Iran -- nation-states with budgets -- but when every single person with an issue starts engaging in this type of manipulative behavior," said Bret Schafer, an analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a research project at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. "It's absolutely awful for democracy."
Mr. Schafer had particular reason to be chagrined. New Knowledge helped build the website for the Alliance's disinformation-tracking database, Hamilton68, which had monitored suspected Russian-linked accounts, tracking the falsehoods they spread and the discord they tried to sow. (New Knowledge also helped write a report on Russian troll activity released last month by the Senate Intelligence Committee.) The Alabama project, Mr. Schafer told me, "undercuts our collective ability to take other countries to task for their deceptive, online behavior."
Fight-fire-with-fire reasoning is bubbling up on the left as the social media giants continue to struggle to stop distortion campaigns in real time. It was only after The Times and The Washington Post reported on the Alabama operations that Facebook shut down the suspect accounts.
None of this bodes well for the 2020 campaign, which has entered its first stage at a time when analysts in and out of government are still trying to determine the full effect disinformation had in the last presidential election.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has concluded that the Russian activity probably affected the outcome. In "Cyber War," her just-published book about the 2016 campaign, she reports that Russia "tried to mobilize, demobilize, and shift the sorts of voters that Trump needed to win."
If the results of the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III confirm her conclusion, some people may be deterred from employing such tactics. On the other hand, nothing spawns copycats like victory.
Big questions remain about how to keep American political campaigns from descending into disinformation, barring still-elusive legal or technical remedies, as Ms. Jamieson told me in an interview. "How do you make sure it's marked off as inappropriate?" she said. "The real question for 2020 is, what is out of bounds? Is there anything?"
As a start, I reached out to various expected 2020 players to see if they would eschew such tactics.
I was heartened to receive this statement from Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey: "There is no place in our politics for deceptive tactics that undermine trust in -- and the credibility of -- our democratic process and stand in contrast to our values."
Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential exploratory committee said, "Our campaign doesn't support these kinds of tactics." The campaign manager for Representative Tulsi Gabbard's 2020 committee, Rania Batrice, said Ms. Gabbard "strongly condemns" the use of disinformation.
The Republican Party chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel -- sounding as if she might be relishing the Democrats' turn under the microscope -- said, "These tactics are shameful."
Then there were those whose offices I never heard back from -- Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Julián Castro, the Democratic Party itself and Mr. Trump's re-election team.
The real surprise was former Vice President Joe Biden.
"Not going to have any comment on that for you," a spokesman said.
Maybe Mr. Biden wants to keep his options open.

Schumer to force vote on Treasury decision to lift Russian sanctions

Texto completo: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday he plans to force a vote this week to block the Treasury Department from lifting sanctions on three Russian companies.

Calling the Treasury's plan "flawed" and "misguided," the New York Democrat called on Congress to pass the motion by Jan. 17. Senate leaders were briefed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week after Democrats demanded answers after his agency announced last month it would ease sanctions on EN+ Group Plc, JSC EuroSibEnergo, and United Co. Rusal.

The three Russian companies are connected to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with reported ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is a possible subject of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Deripaska may have been associated with Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign manager who pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges brought by Mueller in 2018. Although that connection could still exist, The New York Times last week corrected a report that Manafort wanted 2016 campaign polling data shared with Deripaska.

The Treasury Department's agreement to lift the sanctions requires the companies limit Deripaska's involvement in their affairs, but Schumer's move to force a vote signals Democrats have no confidence such an agreement can be enforced. The Treasury recently sanctioned several individuals connected to Russian intelligence, including a former Russian spy that works for Deripaska.

In a statement Sunday, Schumer said he has the privilege to force a vote due to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, under which Congress has 30 days to independently assess and possibly reverse sanctions or the act of lifting them.

A simple majority is needed bring the matter to vote and then 60 votes to pass cloture. The fate of such an effort is unclear as the Senate is currently in Republican control. Schumer said he decided to act after consulting with members from the Banking, Foreign Relations, Intelligence, and other committees.

“After consultation with the relevant committee ranking members and my colleagues, I have concluded that the Treasury Department’s proposal is flawed and fails to sufficiently limit Oleg Deripaska’s control and influence of these companies, and the Senate should move to block this misguided effort by the Trump Administration and keep these sanctions in place,” Schumer said in a press release. “Furthermore, given Mr. Deripaska’s potential involvement with Paul Manafort and the fact that the Special Counsel’s Russia investigation has not yet concluded its work, it’s all the more reason these sanctions must remain in place. I urge all of my Senate colleagues to vote to reverse the Administration’s wrongheaded decision to relax these much-needed sanctions.”

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Trump on Comey: 'Total sleaze'

Texto completo: President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.

"And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"

Lavish legislator junkets 'burn' state's residents

Texto completo: Picture this: As the deadly Camp Fire was ravaging Butte County and leveling the town of Paradise, some California legislators were meeting in Hawaii with officials from various industries, including utility company executives who hope Sacramento shields them from billions in potential liability from increasingly costly wildfires.
Doesn't that just about set your hair on fire?
Now ponder this: Though not all events that bring together lawmakers and corporate and other special interests have the spectacularly bad timing and optics as last fall's $8,000-per-person California Independent Voter Project retreat in Maui, all of them are perfectly legal.
We'll go ahead and say it: This stinks.
Of course, corporate interests and others who hope to make their case to state government have the right to their say. We all do.
That's the nature of our system. Junkets like these, however, distort the process.
A New York Times article earlier this month on the retreat suggests that anyone canattend the annual CIVP event — for a price.
"What would be wrong with elected officials and business discussing issues?" Voter Project chief Dan Howle told the Times, also pointing out that the conference rules prohibit lobbying or discussion of specific legislation. "If the public wants to go, the public can pay a fee."
Got that, John Q. Public? Just send along your own fat check for a ticket — oh, and make sure you get the OK from the boss for the time off — and you'll surely score a good seat. Bring your "fat pants" to make sure you enjoy the poolside buffet and open bar.
One other thing: To put more punch into your personal pitch "on the issues," John, bring along that checkbook that'll prove you can compete with the millions some of your dinner partners are going to spend on lobbying and campaign donations down the road to further bend the ear of "your representative."
Folks, this sick joke is on you.
Assembling "captive" audiences of influential lawmakers in a far-off Polynesian paradise or some "Where Eagles Dare" mountain ski lodge and regaling them with one-sided explorations of issues they'll be acting on is neither democratic nor necessary. These tilt the playing field far beyond anything resembling fair.
The people's business should be done where the people can take part. These types of junkets have too much potential to simply be the jet-set version of the sinister "smoke-filled room" where decisions are made. They should be relegated to the past.
The supremely cynical pragmatist might suggest lawmakers "need" this type of quality time with such power players so they can be "educated" on how to fix hot messes like Pacific Gas & Electric. PG&E, which seemed to be in the clear from potential billions in liability from then-record 2017 wildfires, is now teetering on bankruptcy thanks to the now-record Camp Fire, which left 86 dead and additional billions in damage.
Our society can't surrender to that level of cynicism.
For now, we'll reserve judgment on potential legislative solutions – which currently range from extending the recently enacted 2017 "lifeline" to also cover 2018 fires to a potential breakup of PG&E. Lawmakers definitely have their work cut out for them, but they need to get it done without undue influence from Mai Tais and kalua pork.
(For the record, PG&E decided to not send its executives to CIVP this year, but did not request refund of its sponsorship funds. The other two investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, did have executives in Maui.)
The nonprofit progressive advocacy group Consumer Watchdog on Wednesday, in response to the New York Times piece, called on the Legislature to require lawmakers to disclose – in real time on public websites – specific information about the educational "seminars" and trips they attend when they accept an invitation and information about the lobbyists attending as well.
"Had this been a requirement for the Wailea trip in November many legislators would likely have reconsidered their attendance," Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court wrote in a letter to Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon and Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins.
Democrats who hold supermajorities in both bodies of the Legislature could make this happen faster than you could say "red eye to Kahului" if they saw it as a priority. Barring an actual ban on such junkets, this tougher disclosure policy could be a good start at reform.
As similar legislation that sought to rein in junket travel has gone down in flames in the past, however, we won't hold our breath.
We'll be watching to see how our own lawmakers handle such travel "opportunities." Voters across the Golden State should keep a sharp eye on their own representatives and remember to take it into account at election time.
California lawmakers, you've got this great big building at your disposal in Sacramento. Please stop distorting our democracy by flying off to distant locales to work with moneyed special interests on the people's business, the Editorial Board opines.

CRONKITE REPORTS ON AIR BATTLE OVER GERMANY CRONKITE REPORTS ON AIR BATTLE OVER GERMANY

Texto completo: What would become one of the most famous names in journalism appeared on the front page of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 75 years ago.
Walter Cronkite, then a United Press staff writer, assembled a "You Are There"-style report on a 1944 American bombing raid over Germany by at least 1,400 planes.
"It was weird waiting for death up there," Cronkite wrote in a story that appeared Jan. 13 and was based on the accounts provided by airmen who took part in the mission. While the outside temperature was 33 degrees below zero, "you sweated so [much] that you took off your gloves and turned off the heat in your flying suit."
"It was eerily quiet, with even your engines sounding strangely muffled, while you waited for death to make his entrance," he wrote. "Then he came, roaring at you in the form of a row of Messerschmitts with madmen at the controls ." The German pilots first fired rockets, then followed up with machine guns. "That was the experience related today by American fliers who spent three appalling hours over Germany."
Cronkite, based in London, was the re-write man that day for material gathered by UPI reporters at American air bases after the raid. He was 27 and had worked for the wire service since 1937.
Cronkite described the recent air battle in near-novelistic terms. "It was a story of heroism . of Fortress gunners who held their fire until their turrets were almost brushed by enemy wings, of bomber crews who battled valiantly long after their ships had been mortally stricken."
Cronkite had some personal experience involving aviation and air combat. Eleven months earlier he had been among six reporters, including future CBS correspondent Andy Rooney, who flew on a bombing mission over Germany. One of the journalists, New York Times reporter Robert Post, died when his B-24 was shot down and exploded.
Later in the war, Cronkite was aboard a glider landing with members of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne as part of "Operation Market Garden" in the Netherlands. Months later he covered the Battle of the Bulge.
Cronkite joined the television division of CBS News in 1960. In 1962, the 25-year journalism veteran became anchor of the network's evening news. In that position, he headed CBS coverage of stories that included the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the U.S. race to the moon, the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon.
His closed his last broadcast as CBS anchor with his familiar signoff, followed by the date: "And that's the way it is: Friday, March 6, 1981."

Texto completo: "True Detective" returns to HBO, this time with Mahershala Ali. And revolution brews in PBS's "Victoria."
What's on TV
TRUE DETECTIVE 9 p.m. on HBO. Fresh off his Golden Globe win for "Green Book," Mahershala Ali leads the third season of HBO's time-jumping crime drama, which returns after a less-than-beloved second season. The locale this time is the Ozarks; the time periods are the 1980s, 1990s and 2010s; and the crime is a gruesome one involving children. As a level-headed detective, Ali (along with his partner, played by Stephen Dorff) investigates, while viewers are ping-ponged between decades -- and see Ali's character afflicted with dementia, struggling to explain the details of the case in a movie-within-a-show documentary. In his review of the season for The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that the season treads a lot of familiar ground, writing that "if you score 'True Detective' Season 3 on originality, it fails." But he also noted: "If you treat it as a do-over -- if the series, like one of its haunted antiheroes, is retracing its steps to try to get things right -- then it's fine. Often quite good. Far more consistent."
AMERICAN STYLE 9 p.m. on CNN. One of the pleasures of a decade-hopping show like "True Detective" is watching the costumes change to reflect the time periods, the way suits and hair are cut providing an indication of which one is being explored. For those wanting to give more thought to these nuances, this documentary series looks at American fashion during several windows of time in the nation's history: The first episode, "War Boots to Work Suits," covers the 1940s and '50s, and the ways in which things like bikinis and Katharine Hepburn's pants reflected the sensibilities of the time. The second episode, airing directly after, covers the 1960s and '70s.
VICTORIA 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). After Season 2 spent time in the first half of the 1840s, the third season of Daisy Goodwin's Victorian drama begins in 1848, with the pressures of a revolution mounting on the titular queen. Offering a looser and more playful version of Victorian royal life than Netflix's "The Crown," the show stars Jenna Coleman as a Victoria whom Mike Hale referred to in his review for The Times as "a combination of coquettish flibbertigibbet, tough proto-feminist and compassionate, perhaps too-good-to-be-true liberal humanist."
What's Streaming
FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE on Netflix. A matter relating to an illustrated centaur's nether regions is discussed within the first five minutes of this comedy's second season, which gives a pretty good gauge of the kind of over-the-top humor one can expect from it. Keegan-Michael Key, Cobie Smulders, Annie Parisse, Nat Faxon, Fred Savage and Jae Suh Park star as friends from Harvard many years into post-college life.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Saturday unleashed an extended assault on the F.B.I. and the special counsel's investigation, knitting together a comprehensive alternative story in which he had been framed by disgraced "losers" at the bureau's highest levels.
In a two-hour span starting at 7 a.m., the president made a series of false claims on Twitter about his adversaries and the events surrounding the inquiry. He was responding to a report in The New York Times that, after he fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017, the bureau began investigating whether the president had acted on behalf of Russia.
In his tweets, the president accused Hillary Clinton, without evidence, of breaking the law by lying to the F.B.I. He claimed that Mr. Comey was corrupt and best friends with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He said Mr. Mueller was employing a team of Democrats -- another misleading assertion -- bent on taking him down.
Individually, the president's claims were familiar. But as the special counsel's inquiry edges ever closer to him, Democrats vow a blizzard of investigations of their own and the government shutdown reaches record lengths, Mr. Trump compiled all the threads of the conspiracy theory he has pushed for many months in an effort to discredit the investigation.
Hours later, Mr. Trump continued his broadside on a friendly television venue, Jeanine Pirro's show on Fox News. Asked "are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?" Mr. Trump did not directly answer the question.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," he said by telephone. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written."
He also denied a report in The Washington Post that he had taken extensive steps to conceal from other high-ranking officials his conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over the past two years.
Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that his panel would hold hearings on "the mysteries swirling around Trump's bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies, and how those dark dealings affect our national security."
In his Twitter outburst earlier in the day, Mr. Trump accused the F.B.I. of opening "for no reason" and "with no proof" an investigation in 2017 into whether he had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia, painting his own actions toward Russia as actually "FAR tougher" than those of his predecessors.
The Times article, published Friday evening, reported that law enforcement officials became so alarmed by Mr. Trump's behavior surrounding his firing of Mr. Comey that they took the explosive step of opening a counterintelligence investigation against him.
Naming several of the bureau's now-departed top officials, including Mr. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I. had "tried to do a number on your President," accusing the "losers" of essentially fabricating a case. "Part of the Witch Hunt," he wrote -- referring dismissively to the investigation now being overseen by Mr. Mueller.
At the time he was fired in May 2017, Mr. Comey had been leading the F.B.I.'s investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, and the officials believed that his removal, in hindering the inquiry, posed a possible threat to national security. Their decision to open the case was informed, in part, by two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the firing to the Russia investigation.
The inquiry they opened had two aspects, including both the newly disclosed counterintelligence element and a criminal element that has long been publicly known: whether the firing constituted obstruction of justice.
When Mr. Mueller was appointed days later, he took over the joint inquiry as part of his larger investigation of Russia's action in 2016 and whether anyone on the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow. It is not clear whether he is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and no public evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump himself secretly conspired with the Russian government or took directions from it.
Mr. Trump indicated on Saturday that he had not known of the existence of the counterintelligence investigation before the Times article, and he did not dispute the newspaper's reporting.
But he made clear that he viewed any such inquiry as illegitimate from the start. He presented it, without evidence, as part of a vast, yearslong conspiracy to undo his presidency.
In the tweets, Mr. Trump defended his decision to fire Mr. Comey -- "a total sleaze!" -- at length, accusing the former director of overseeing a "rigged & botched" investigation of Mrs. Clinton, and leading the agency into "complete turmoil." Democrats and Republicans alike wanted Mr. Comey removed, he said.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Mr. Trump wrote. "He was a Crooked Cop."
But an investigation conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general and internal surveys of F.B.I. agents have undercut Mr. Trump's portrayal of Mr. Comey as corrupt and unpopular within the bureau.
Mr. Trump's comments echoed those that his White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, released on Friday night.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the F.B.I.," Ms. Sanders said. "Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
Parts of the statements by Mr. Trump and Ms. Sanders are at odds with the public record and with the findings of the inspector general's report. While Democrats were furious with Mr. Comey over his public statements about the Clinton email server case -- at a news conference and in a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign -- they were deeply alarmed by his removal, given his role in the Russia investigation.
In his report, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, pointedly criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy to publicly discuss the Clinton case, and he castigated "insubordinate" senior officials who worked with Mr. Comey for privately criticizing Mr. Trump even as they investigated him. But he ultimately said he had found no evidence to believe that the decisions not to charge Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server in handling classified information "were affected by bias or other improper considerations."
"Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor's assessment of facts, the law and past department practice," he wrote.
Mr. McCabe, who briefly served as acting director after Mr. Comey was removed, was fired last March for failing to be forthcoming with investigators about an unrelated conversation he had authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist. Mr. McCabe argued that the firing was politically motivated and designed to hinder the Russia investigation. Other members of Mr. Comey's team have also been fired or left the bureau.
Mr. Comey responded on Twitter on Saturday with a quotation attributed to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The Times report cited former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation, as well as private testimony that the F.B.I.'s former general counsel, James A. Baker, delivered to Congress related to the inquiry.
"Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security," Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times.
Some former law enforcement officials outside the case have since debated whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a chaotic period after Mr. Comey's firing. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.

Texto completo: A Nicaraguan Supreme Court justice who was President Daniel Ortega's closest legal adviser before he resigned this week accused the president and his wife of running a brutal government that tramples on civil rights and is driving the nation to the brink of civil war.
The justice, Rafael Solis, was speaking in an interview with The New York Times after his resignation on Thursday, which marked the highest-profile defection yet in the country's nine-month-old political crisis. Government critics said it signaled a possible weakening of the political apparatus that has helped keep Mr. Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, in power long after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets demanding their ouster.
Mr. Solis was unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Ortega, who he had been allied with since the 1970s.
"The separation of powers in Nicaragua is over," he said. "The concentration of power is in them, those two people."
Mr. Solis said he now regretted one of his own most consequential rulings, a 2009 Supreme Court decision that ended term limits and allowed Mr. Ortega to remain in power.
But while critics of the government saw Mr. Solis's defection as an important show of opposition that could lead to others, he said he had few illusions that his resignation alone would have a big impact on the judiciary or the government where Mr. Ortega and Ms. Murillo now make all the decisions that matter.
"I wasn't being very useful: We practically didn't have any job functions," Mr. Solis said in a telephone interview from an undisclosed location outside Nicaragua. "It was a very limited judiciary."

Nicaragua, with a population of 6.2 million people, is one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere. It has been rocked by political turmoil since April, when students and older people who picketed against proposed reductions in social security benefits were attacked by pro-government mobs.
The protests quickly spiraled out of control, and several dozen people were killed. The unrest spread to cities around the nation. At least 325 people have been killed and hundreds more imprisoned as public dissent was outlawed.
Mr. Solis had been a loyal member of the president's Sandinista Front party since he helped Mr. Ortega fight a guerrilla war against the Somoza dictatorship in the 1970s. He was the only witness at Mr. Ortega's wedding.
A former member of the legislature and leader in the armed forces, he had been on the Supreme Court for 19 years. During that time, he was an unstinting Ortega loyalist as exemplified by the term-limits ruling that, in effect, let Mr. Ortega run for re-election indefinitely. In the past, presidents were limited to two, nonconsecutive terms.

Mr. Solis was one of the most powerful people in the nation, known as a kind of godfather who people turned to to resolve myriad problems.
Mr. Solis was a key member of the court in 2009 when the magistrates ruled that term limits violated Mr. Ortega's civil rights. Mr. Solis now calls that ruling "a mistake."
He said the idea of a second term did not bother him so much, and is allowed in many places. Mr. Ortega is now in his third consecutive five-year term.
"It was the third time that was worrisome," Mr. Solis said. "I did not think it would bring the nation to this. I never imagined it."
He said that in the future, Nicaragua should bring back term limits -- and should even prohibit two terms.
In the wake of the unrest, the government has maintained that the protesters were agents of "right wing" political parties, the Catholic church, and groups from outside the country that plotted a coup to unseat democratically elected leaders.
Mr. Solis wrote a scathing three-page resignation letter, with a copy of his I.D. attached, that said there was never any attempted coup or outside intervention, "but rather an irrational use of force."
There are "a great number of detainees with a series of absurd accusations of crimes they never committed," he wrote.
He said when the crisis broke out, he was in Mexico getting spinal surgery and could easily have written a letter saying he was resigning over health problems. Instead, he said, he chose to tell the truth about a government he no longer believed in.
"I think that the situation Nicaragua is in merited this kind of letter," he said in the interview.
Mr. Solis said he tried to bring about electoral reform and other measures like plebiscites that would have opened up the democratic process, but "it was not to be."
His conversations with the president, he said, were perfectly civil.
He said he kept hoping that the president's addresses at Christmas and New Year would call for peace. But instead, he said the president seemed set against any kind of dialogue or international intervention, which left Mr. Solis no choice but to step down.
Juan Sebastian Chamorro, an opposition leader who was among the members of a failed committee on national reconciliation that tried to end the protests, said Mr. Solis's resignation signaled that the government's coalition could be weakening.
"He is the highest ranking official to defect from the regime, and one of the oldest public officials in the judiciary system who dates back to the 80s," Mr. Chamorro said. "I think that resignation is going to have a whole lot of people who are currently in the government evaluating whether to take a similar action."
The Ortega family has maintained control of the country, mostly because of loyal allies in key positions, including the police, military, the National Assembly and the courts. But if someone as close to Mr. Ortega as Mr. Solis is willing to step down, others could do the same, Mr. Chamorro said.
"The fracture has begun, at least in Solis' case," he said. "Very probably, others will follow suit."
The president did not release any statements about the resignation, and the government does not speak to any media it does not control.
Mr. Solis said the time for a peaceful end to the crisis is running short. The Organization of American States voted Friday to invoke a section of its charter that could lead it to take measures to restore democracy to Nicaragua. Congress passed economic sanctions last month.
"A big economic crisis is coming that is going to give rise to even bigger upheaval and more violence," Mr. Solis said. "Right now there is an appearance of calm, but it's a forced calm," because the police instilled terror.
He added: "The country is not doing well. What is coming is worse."

Texto completo: Almost 40 years have passed since Daniel Patrick Moynihan - a serious intellectual turned influential politician - made waves by declaring, "Of a sudden, Republicans have become a party of ideas." He didn't say that they were good ideas, but the GOP seemed to him to be open to new thinking in a way Democrats weren't.
But that was a long time ago. Today's GOP is a party of closed minds, hostile to expertise, aggressively uninterested in evidence, whose idea of a policy argument involves loudly repeating the same old debunked doctrines. Paul Ryan's "innovative" proposals of 2011 (cut taxes and privatize Medicare) were almost indistinguishable from those of Newt Gingrich in 1995.
Meanwhile, Democrats have experienced an intellectual renaissance. They have emerged from their 1990s cringe; they're no longer afraid to challenge conservative pieties; and there's a lot of serious, well-informed intraparty debate about issues from health care to climate change.
You don't have to agree with any of the various Medicare for All plans, or proposals for a Green New Deal, to recognize that these are important ideas receiving serious discussion.
The question is whether our media environment can handle a real party of ideas. Can news organizations tell the difference between genuine policy wonks and poseurs like Ryan? Are they even willing to discuss policy rather than snark about candidates' supposed personality flaws?
Which brings me to the case of Elizabeth Warren, who is probably today's closest equivalent to Moynihan in his prime.
Like Moynihan, she's a serious intellectual turned influential politician. Her scholarly work on bankruptcy and its relationship to rising inequality made her a major player in policy debate long before she entered politics herself. Like many others, I found one of her key insights - that rising bankruptcy rates weren't caused by profligate consumerism, that they largely reflected the desperate attempts of middle-class families to buy homes in good school districts - revelatory.
She has also proved herself able to translate scholarly insights into practical policy. Full disclosure: I was skeptical about her brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I didn't think it was a bad idea, but I had doubts about how much difference a federal agency tasked with policing financial fraud would make. But I was wrong: Deceptive financial practices aimed at poorly informed consumers do a lot of harm, and until President Donald Trump sabotaged it, the bureau was by all accounts having a hugely salutary effect on families' finances.
And Warren is continuing to throw out unorthodox policy ideas, like her proposal that the federal government be allowed to get into the business of producing some generic drugs. This is the sort of thing that brings howls of derision from the right, but that actual policy experts consider a valuable contribution to the discussion.
Is there anyone like Warren on the other side of the aisle? No. Not only aren't there any GOP politicians with comparable intellectual heft, there aren't even halfway competent intellectuals with any influence in the party. The GOP doesn't want people who think hard and look at evidence; it wants people like, say, "economist" Stephen Moore, who slavishly reaffirm the party's dogma, even if they can't get basic facts straight.
Does all of this mean that Warren should be president? Certainly not - a lot of things determine whether someone will succeed in that job, and intellectual gravitas is neither necessary nor sufficient. But Warren's achievements as a scholar/policymaker are central to her political identity, and clearly should be front and center in any reporting about her presidential bid.
But, of course, they aren't. What I'm seeing are stories about whether she handled questions about her Native American heritage well, or whether she's "likable."
This kind of journalism is destructively lazy, and also has a terrible track record. I'm old enough to remember the near-universal portrayal of George W. Bush as a bluff, honest guy, despite the obvious lies underlying his policy proposals; then he took us to war on false pretenses.
Moreover, trivia-based reporting is, in practice, deeply biased - not in a conventional partisan sense, but in its implicit assumption that a politician can't be serious unless he (and I mean he) is a conservative, or at most centrist, white male. That kind of bias, if it persists, will be a big problem for a Democratic Party that has never been more serious about policy, but has also never been more progressive and more diverse.
This bias needs to be called out - and I'm not just talking about Warren. Consider the contrast between the unearned adulation Ryan received and how long it took conventional wisdom to recognize that Nancy Pelosi was the most effective House speaker of modern times.
Again, I'm not arguing that Warren should necessarily become president. But she is what a serious policy intellectual looks and sounds like in 2019. And if our media can't recognize that, we're in big trouble.

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet? In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2.5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ? Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat? Plants. Basically most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe? Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits? Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she enjoyed the journey and the results, including losing six pounds with little effort.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," wrote Josefsberg in a blog post. "I also noticed I had a real clarity of mind and much more energy than usual."
Organic produce is recommended as part of a pegan diet.

Dietitians recommend sheep or goat dairy products on the diet because they're easier to digest than milk from cows.

A man usually tells you to walk, not a woman, because of frequency not sexism

Texto completo: Q. Where I live they have been changing the crosswalk buttons to these fancy new ones that beep, flash and talk to you. Why are all of the voices men’s voices? Isn’t this the age of equality?
– Patrick Shane, North Tustin
A. Patrick lives in unincorporated county territory, near the city of Tustin. After getting some specifics on the traffic signals, he and Honk agreed the city would be best to ask, as at least some of these new-school devices are in Tustin.
Krys Saldivar , the manager of the Tustin’s Public Works Department, said the city is upgrading all of its pedestrian push buttons tied to traffic signals, with about 40 percent having these newer devices.
“Those who are blind will be able to hear where they are crossing and when to cross, and those who are deaf will feel the vibration when it is safe to cross,” she told Honk in an email. “The first ones that have been installed in the city were actually programmed by the manufacturer.”
That would be Polara, a Texas-based company.
Its president, John McGaffey , said if a city asks, Polara can provide a female voice; it has done so before. But it generally uses a male voice.
“In controlled studies using … accessible pedestrian signals, the majority of the visually impaired participants said they were able to hear a male voice better because it has greater low-range frequencies (under 800 Hz), which people can tend to hear, even with some hearing loss. We also try to keep the voice consistent so the messages sound similar, no matter where you are in the United States.”
Q. My license expires on my birthday in June. Should I go ahead and make an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles now because of the crowded DMV offices, with the popularity of the REAL ID? Or should I wait until they send me a notice? It’s very confusing! Thank you!
– Linda Wells, Mission Viejo
A. DMV officials and Honk readers have told the wise one, that would be Honk, that wait times have gone way down since the mess in the summer.
Still, appointments are the way to go if you must go into an office to renew your license (Typically every 15 years until you hit age 70, then every five years).
“She can make an appointment before she receives her renewal notice,” Marty Greenstein , a DMV spokesman up in Sacramento, said via email. “In fact, that’s something we encourage. If you know your license is going to expire in a few months, go ahead and make your appointment. We started sending out renewal notices 90 days in advance this summer (up from 60) to give people more time.”
The DMV takes appointments for several months out. Linda noticed that the two DMV offices near her home were completely booked. What about that?
“Appointment availability can change on a daily basis as offices perform daily assessments, or spots open when an appointment is canceled,” Greenstein said.
So keep trying, Linda.
But don’t go too early to a DMV office to renew, or you will be required to take what used to be called a “written” test and is now a “knowledge” test (it is usually done on a touchscreen these days) even if you weren’t scheduled for one. The DMV reasons that if you renew real early, then you are shortening up the time it has to monitor your track record out there on the roads, so the test is meant to ensure you are a safe motorist.
“In instances when a knowledge test is not required, coming in at any time during that 90-day window before your license expires should not trigger that requirement,” Greenstein added.
Honkin’ cool: A dad didn’t want his daughter to be alone on Christmas, so Hal Vaughan took six flights over three days to be with her. Pierce Vaughan is a rookie flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, and Dad shadowed her, able to jump on standby for free, a perk of his daughter’s job. A passenger heard about the journey, put it on Facebook and the cute story went viral. The trip: New Orleans; Detroit; Fort Myers, Fla.; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Atlanta; and back to New Orleans (Source: The New York Times).

Resumen: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, one of the world’s leading research institutions, announced on Friday that it would bar its top executives from serving on corporate boards of drug and health care companies that, in some cases, had paid them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Memorial Sloan Kettering has been shaken by the unfolding series of conflicts of interest since September, when The Times and ProPublica reported that its chief medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, had failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug and health care companies in dozens of articles in medical journals. Additional reports detailed how other top officials had cultivated lucrative relationships with for-profit companies, including an artificial intelligence startup, Paige.AI, that was founded by a member of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s executive board, the chair of the pathology department and the head of a research lab.

Texto completo: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, one of the world’s leading research institutions, announced on Friday that it would bar its top executives from serving on corporate boards of drug and health care companies that, in some cases, had paid them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
Hospital officials also told the center’s staff that the executive board had made permanent a series of reforms designed to limit the ways in which its top executives and leading researchers could profit from work developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a nonprofit with a broad social mission that admits about 23,500 cancer patients each year.
The conflicts at Memorial Sloan Kettering, unearthed by The New York Times and ProPublica, have had a rippling effect on other leading cancer institutions across the country. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, both of whose executives sit on corporate boards, are among the institutions reconsidering their policies on financial ties.
In the wake of reports about board memberships held by Memorial Sloan Kettering officials last fall, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, the hospital’s chief executive, resigned in October from the board of Merck. The company, which makes the blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, had paid him about $300,000 in 2017 for his service.
The announcement on Friday was one of several steps the cancer center said it was considering as part of an institutionwide overhaul of its corporate relationships and conflict-of-interest policies. The cancer center has hired Deloitte as well as two law firms, Ropes & Gray and Debevoise & Plimpton, to help conduct its reviews.
Debra Berns, the center’s chief risk officer, also said in an email to employees that the hospital’s Board of Overseers and Managers formalized a policy enacted last fall that prohibits board members from investing in start-up companies that Memorial Sloan Kettering helped to found. In addition, it also prevents hospital employees who represent Memorial Sloan Kettering on corporate boards from accepting personal compensation, like equity stakes or stock options, from the companies.
Dr. Walid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, called the policy changes a “watershed moment.”
“This is highly significant, especially at such a high-profile academic center,” Gellad said in an email. “Leadership matters, and the institution has decided that their leaders should not also be concurrently leading for-profit health companies.”
When doctors enter into financial relationships with companies, the concern is that these ties can shape the way studies are designed and medications are prescribed to patients, potentially allowing bias to influence medical practice. A 2014 study in JAMA found that about 40 percent of the largest publicly traded drug companies had a leader of an academic medical center on their boards.
Berns said the Memorial Sloan Kettering board’s policy decision was intended to emphasize the hospital’s focus on education, research and treatment of patients. Dr. Nadeem R. Abu-Rustum, who is president of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s medical staff, said the policy changes were “well-received” by employees.
Memorial Sloan Kettering has been shaken by the unfolding series of conflicts of interest since September, when The Times and ProPublica reported that its chief medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, had failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug and health care companies in dozens of articles in medical journals.
Baselga resigned days later, and he also stepped down from the boards of the drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer. Earlier this month, AstraZeneca announced that it had hired Baselga to run its new oncology unit.
Additional reports detailed how other top officials had cultivated lucrative relationships with for-profit companies, including an artificial intelligence startup, Paige.AI, that was founded by a member of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s executive board, the chair of the pathology department and the head of a research lab. The hospital struck an exclusive deal with the company to license images of 25 million patient tissue slides that had been collected over decades.
Another article detailed how a hospital vice president was given a stake of nearly $1.4 million in a newly public company as compensation for representing Memorial Sloan Kettering on its board.
When news of Baselga’s disclosure lapses first became public, 12 doctors and researchers at the hospital served on the boards of publicly traded companies. The number has now dropped to nine.
On Oct. 1, some doctors at the hospital called for a no-confidence vote in Thompson’s leadership and questioned whether the industry relationships were jeopardizing the hospital’s mission.

Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Season of Turmoil
One of the nation’s top cancer hospitals has grappled with how to bring breakthrough treatments to market while remaining true to its mission.
No such vote was taken, but a day later, Thompson stepped down from the boards of Merck and Charles River Laboratories, which assists in early drug development.
The hospital task force is expected to release draft recommendations in February and will solicit feedback from employees, Berns said in the memo released Friday. The review is also expected to examine faculty membership on corporate boards, participation on companies’ scientific advisory boards, and doctors’ and researchers’ consulting relationships with drug and health care companies.
Memorial Sloan Kettering will also host a symposium in February on disclosing conflicts of interest in medical journals, in what Berns described as “a first step toward developing a common framework that harmonizes financial disclosures in research publications.”
Berns delivered details of the review at a medical staff meeting Friday morning that was also attended by Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, the hospital’s acting physician-in-chief. During the meeting, DeAngelis sought to reassure employees that hospital leaders were taking their concerns seriously while also defending the hospital’s reputation as a world-renowned cancer center, according to accounts of the meeting.
At one point, according to the accounts, DeAngelis celebrated recent good news for the institution, including the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a new cancer drug, Vitravki, developed at the hospital.
She also cited internal research that she said showed Memorial Sloan Kettering’s treatment of the Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had received positive press that overshadowed the recent conflict-of-interest coverage.
Ginsburg is recovering from cancer surgery on her left lung that was performed at the center. The Supreme Court announced on Friday that she was still recovering and would not be on the bench next week, but that there was no evidence of any more cancer.

Texto completo: At a time in which many American patriots have wondered who within the Republican Party will now be present in Congress to challenge the president for the destruction that he has inflicted on our nation, its character and our values, we have the good fortune to be at the dawn of the congressional leadership of Mitt Romney, who is now the junior senator from Utah.
Romney’s recent Washington Post opinion piece is a tour de force, a throwing down of the gauntlet to an abnormal and amoral president. It is no wonder that many members of what has become the Trumpublican Party are expressing concerns.
While expressing support for many of Donald Trump’s policies and actions, Romney challenges Trump for his actions, hateful words and deficient character, noting how he has used his victory to engage in name-calling and resentment and promising to continue to speak out against conduct which is “divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” all of which are Trump hallmarks.
We now have reason to believe that the president’s expectation that he will have another “yes man” in Romney will not be reality.
May Romney continue to display the courage, decency and adherence to American values that are evident in his essay. We need more like him.

New year, same soup?
On New Year’s Day, members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly were sworn in and seated. There were a few more women, some younger members, some more progressive Democrats and more moderate Republicans — but will there really be any change?
Will any one of them, or any bloc of them, pull this state into the 21st century? Or two years from now, will we still be relying on property taxes to fund an inequitable public school system? Still be paying to drive on a highway that should have been paid for decades ago? Will our roads be under endless construction, yet somehow come out the perennial worst in the nation?
Will we still be buying alcoholic beverages from a system set up after Prohibition? Will we continue to forgo billions in revenue with criminalized cannabis and no shale extraction fees? Will we still have a justice system skewed against certain communities?
Will our legislative and congressional districts remain drawn by partisan hacks? And, will we still have the nation’s largest, most bloated Legislature?
If any or all that nonsense is still in place two years from now, then no matter how you hype the new membership, it’s the same soup in a different bowl ... .
George Hawdon, Arnold
The Catholic Church will prevail
What to think of Bob Rocker’s letter “Priests are the ones who should have been confessing”? Like Rocker, all Catholics are angry, frustrated and feel betrayed by the scandal that has befallen our church. However, unlike Rocker, the vast majority of Catholics don’t think cutting and running is the proper response. Catholics have every right to expect their priests to be morally superior. However, we should not be Catholic because of such expectations. The vast majority of Catholics believe in and love their church and know it is worth fighting for.
How do we fight? Letters to the parish or bishop expressing our concerns, prayer, attending Mass on a regular basis, or just plain getting involved. We should not be Catholic because we hold church leaders to a position of moral superiority, but because of Catholic dogma. The Catholic Church has been a force for good in the world for over 2,000 years, and will continue to be so.
For myself, I’m Catholic because Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead. I’m Catholic because of the sacraments, especially the most Holy Eucharist. I’m Catholic because of Mary, the Blessed Mother, and I’m Catholic because of the angels and saints. I’m proud to be a Catholic and cannot imagine a day in my life not being Catholic.
Jesus’ church will prevail; he promised it.

Address the gun issue now
As the new year opens afresh, ask yourself: What must change in 2019?
A new legislative session is about to commence in Pennsylvania. Our representatives will start the new session by acting for us -- “We the people” — and voting accordingly. If not, democracy is extinct in our land and is merely a theoretical concept.
We must address legislatively the gun culture plaguing our society. Mayor Bill Peduto and Councilman Corey O’Connor desire to enact a municipal ordinance to restrict guns in the City of Pittsburgh. I support their efforts and you should, too.
Now’s the time to call your state representative and senator and demand political action at the state level to appropriate funds for and enforce any municipal ordinances that get passed.
To members of Congress and the General Assembly: We want a bill at the federal and state levels to eliminate bump stocks, require universal background checks and ban assault weapons — now. Don’t sit on this until June when budget time rolls around.
The state and federal taxes we pay become your paychecks tomorrow. We will march, protest, badger you and shut you down if you refuse to help our city’s elected leaders enact common-sense gun reform. Our representatives (Doyle, Kelly, Reschenthaler, Scarnati, Turzai, Corman, et al.) were duly elected by us to represent us, not the NRA. Will you refuse to act by hiding behind archaic documents, by referencing the state and federal Constitutions?
Is the gun culture we have allowed to be created representative of the civil society that the framers envisioned?

Socialists and the presidency
I agree with The New York Times’ warning to Nancy Pelosi not to give too much power to the newly elected House Democrats who call themselves “Democratic socialists.” They will be a minority of the Democrats in the House.
I don’t enjoy being unkind or insulting toward anyone, even the Republicans in Congress, a sizeable minority of whom are really scary “survival of the fittest” social Darwinists, but you have to be a complete idiot to call yourself a “Democratic socialist.” That includes Bernie Sanders, who I like and agree with 90 percent of the time.
First, they are not true socialists because they do not advocate abolishing our capitalist economic system.
Second, if you believe that anyone who calls herself/himself a “socialist” can be elected president of the United States, then you must live in Dreamland.
I do agree with their belief that our federal government should do more and spend more to help the poor, the near-poor, the lower middle class and the middle class who are struggling to survive and to pay their bills. They need to inform and educate the public to the fact that almost every one of our traditional allies (if not all of them) have federal governments that do more and spend more (in proportion to their population sizes) than we do in the USA.
And, to paraphrase Al Pacino in the movie “And Justice For All,” for us to be right about this, all of these other countries have to be wrong.
I don’t think so.

War on the poor
Three blocks from the theater where I saw “A Christmas Carol,” a gray-haired woman sat on the sidewalk with her two grandsons. Both under 3, they couldn’t open their granola bars and gnawed at the wrappers instead.
Her sign read “Please help.” My son and I bought groceries, then accompanied her and the toddlers to her room at a Downtown shelter. There, staff warned that these little guys were not welcome after 11 p.m. Grandma said “OK,” but it wasn’t clear what would happen later.
Upstairs, her cell-size room was ajumble with all she owned. We parked the bags and then Grandma hugged my son and me and bade the boys to wave “thank you.”
Flush with cash, corporations and CEOs give generously to top politicians in exchange for massive tax cuts. Meanwhile, conservative politicians “fix” the revenue loss by cutting the Supplemental Nutrition Program and other “unaffordable” services for the poor.
When Congress cuts taxes for the rich and food stamps for the needy, they turn America’s back on grandmas and toddlers with their cardboard pleas and little mouths.
Has the war on the poor brought us to Dickens’ era of indifference, hate and humbug?
Tom O’Brien, Mt. Lebanon
Civil justice for Donald Wuerl?
The pope has accepted Donald Wuerl’s resignation of his bishopric office. That’s an internal action by the Catholic Church. The Pennsylvania attorney general, based on a formal grand jury report, has accused Wuerl of covering up many instances of sexual abuse of minors by priests under his jurisdiction when he was bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.
Will Wuerl now be charged with a crime or misdemeanor under criminal law for this coverup? Isn’t that the appropriate next step given the evidence reported by the grand jury?

Texto completo: Hartford - Richard E. Mooney, a former New York Times columnist who served as executive editor of The Hartford Courant for five years, died Wednesday night at the age of 91.
Mooney shepherded The Courant during the landmark years of 1976 to 1981, coinciding with the shuttering of The Hartford Times and The Courant's $105.6 million sale to the Times Mirror company, ending its independence as a locally-owned paper.
He spent more than 40 years as a journalist, his time at The Courant book-ended by long careers at The New York Times as a reporter, foreign correspondent, assistant editor and editorial board member.
"His passion was the New York Times, and The Hartford Courant when he was editor there," his son, Steve Mooney, said. "His passion was the news and his passion was getting it right. He took language seriously, he took facts seriously, he took journalistic standards seriously."
Until he suffered complications from a long battle with cancer, he was living independently in New York City. Even recently, Mooney was taking regular trains to visit his alma mater, Yale University, where he compiled several exhibits on the Yale Daily News, Revolutionary War figure Nathan Hale and the naming of Yale's 12 original colleges.
Mooney was born in Plainfield, N.J., to Wandell M. Mooney, a banker, and Alice Joy Mooney. He briefly served in the U.S. Navy at age 18, but as World War II came to a close, he went on to Yale, where he became managing editor of the Yale Daily News.
He graduated in 1947, and spent a year as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, going on to work for the United Press and, in 1956, The New York Times.
Over 19 years, he worked as an economics reporter in Washington, D.C., and New York and a foreign correspondent in Paris, with his wife, Elizabeth Coleman Mooney, and sons Jim, Steve and John in tow. He returned to the city as deputy foreign editor and deputy financial editor, until a serendipitous phone call from a cousin - and head hunter - led him to Hartford.
The cousin had been commissioned to find the next editor for The Courant and wanted to know if Mooney had any suggestions, according to former Courant editor and historian Joseph Nunes. Mooney gave him a few names, and then threw in his one.
He got the top job.
"It was a personal accomplishment for him to be leading a paper, and especially one with that kind of history to it," said his son, John Mooney, founder of an online policy publication NJ Spotlight. "I think he wore that really proudly and seriously. There was no chance it would falter under his watch."
His oldest son, Jim Mooney, remembers his parents searching for a home in the West End, near the town line, and his father insisting they have a Hartford address.
"He said, 'I have to live in Hartford, we can't live on that side of the street because it's West Hartford," Jim said.

Bob Woodward Resolute: 'Trump Has Unleashed War on Truth'

Texto completo: Bob Woodward, the celebrated journalist, author and associate editor of The Washington Post, shared keen insight gleaned from decades in the field on the Trump presidency, commenting on potential dangers he believes the U.S. now faces due to the president's unprecedented and often unorthodox approach in determining domestic and foreign policies, during a riveting conversation recently with fellow reporter and moderator Michael Schmidt at Lisner Auditorium in northwest D.C.
The venue, located on the campus of George Washington University, continues to serve as a frequent choice for program Sponsor Politics and Prose, an independent bookstore that stands among the District's favorite for the area's literary community.
And despite objections issued by both the White House and upper-level administrative officials, past and present, all of whom refute several of the book's assertions as fabrications or exaggerations, Woodward remains adamant as to the accuracy of his reporting.
In a statement obtained by CNN prior to the book's release on Sept. 11, Woodward described Trump as an "emotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader. He writes in his book, "Fear: Trump in the White House," that the staff s efforts to circumvent the president could be best summarized as "a nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world."
Woodward, best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning news reporting co-written with Carl Bernstein on Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal of the 1970s and winner of a second Pulitzer for his lead reporter coverage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, pulls few punches in this timely analysis of Donald Trump and his presidency.
Further and by his own admission, the author treads onto foreign soil, going well beyond the detailed, objective methodology he's routinely employed in his previously published works that focus on American politics.
"No one has wanted to stand up to Trump - no one," Woodward said. "But my wife and my longtime assistant, both of whom contributed significantly to the book to make it a real family affair, convinced me that I had to include my personal conclusions and concerns. It was a wise decision."
Woodward, whose welldocumented book illuminates a White House significantly more dysfunctional than the American public could have imagined.
"He's involved in so many things in the U.S. and abroad, some clearly connected to personal interests or family-owned businesses, that it's not uncommon for several within his inner circle to both steal or hide highlysensitive letters, reports or memos which they fear might prompt him to respond irrationally," Woodward said of the president.
"Consider, for example, his unexplainable fascination with trade tariffs and how they actually affect our economy and our position in the world," he said.
"Ninety-nine percent of America's economists unequivocally say it's dangerous to tamper with alreadyestablished and agreed-upon trade tariffs, particularly without indisputable cause. Even Trump's chief economist agrees.
"In addition, it can lead to our national security facing increased jeopardy," Woodward said. "It has nothing to do with partisanship. Nonetheless, Trump insists on issuing threats that he may impose even higher tariffs if other countries refuse to yield to his demands.
"This is why I had no other choice but to include my own conclusions in the book. What we're witnessing as a result of our president's endless rhetoric is an intentional war on truth," said Woodward.
Woodward then added a succinctly-stated postscript, murmured by more than a few White House personnel and out of the range of the president's hearing: "If you [Mr. President] would shut the f- up, you'd learn something."
Woodward snickered when asked if we would see Trump testify as the Russian investigation continues.
"I'm sure his lawyers will do whatever's necessary to maintain their efforts to keep that from ever happening," he said. "For Trump, that would result in the worst scenario possible since we know he's not one known to worry about telling the truth."
Facts Matter, Not Memory
Woodward's insistence on gathering copious notes, facts, figures, interviews and other forms of supporting data remains one of the hallmarks maintained throughout his career - a practice that has proved invaluable given the impressive number of presidents he's covered.
"I look for and ask about specific dates, times, places - I'm suspicious when someone replies with some vague statement like 'I believe it occurred one day in May,'" he said. "More often, stories which I knew to be true were those most often denied.
"It doesn't matter what's said. In the end, what matters is what's actually done," Woodward said. "So, in writing this book, I worked hard to keep the focus on what Donald Trump has done - not what he's said.
"My fear, as it relates to the president, is that because he has such a closed mind, that we have no idea how he might respond or the actions he might take in the event of a sudden, unexpected crisis.
"I believe people talk to me because they know and trust me," he said. "This isn't the kind of profession suited for those who prefer today's emphasis on computer-based reporting, repetitiveness or speed mode journalism.
"And while social media has given us tremendous benefits, if you want to get the whole story, if you want the truth, you must be willing to walk the streets, knock on office doors, go back to see people over and over again - even be willing to get hold of their home address and knock on their front door."
With time running out, Woodward and Schmidt answered a few questions from the audience, including one from a local 10th-grader who wanted to know how to become a journalist with the skills and reputation commensurate to the two seated on stage.
Schmidt recalled how he eagerly accepted an entrylevel position at The New York Times - one that he said had to be among the lowest of all jobs possible. However, he says he had achieved his goal: "I got in the door."
Woodward, continuing in the upbeat tenor maintained throughout the evening, advised the inquisitive student to seek any summer internship that would expose him to the industry being careful to avoid at all costs any connection with The New York Times.
His reply instantly elicited a roar of laughter from the packed auditorium's audience.
Schmidt then read the final paragraph from Woodward's book, most notably the last phrase - a sentence of just four words, that the author describes as Trump's "tragic flaw."
Woodward writes the following:
Trump had one overriding problem that [John] Dowd [Trump's formal personal attorney who resigned as the president began facing increased scrutiny due to the escalation of the Mueller investigation] knew but could not bring himself to say to the president: "You're a f- ing liar."

DEMOCRATS FAIL TO GATHER MORE REPUBLICANS IN PASSING INTERIOR SPENDING BILL: The Democratic leadership on Friday failed to pick up any new Republican votes on a spending bill to open the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.


Only 10 Republicans voted for the measure, leaving the final vote tally at 240-179, as the GOP dug in its heels to oppose any new spending bills without adequate funds for President Trump 's border wall.


On Thursday, 12 Republicans voted for a bill to reopen the Department of Transportation, and 10 voted to reopen the Department of Agriculture. Democrats are calling up the bills in the hopes of putting pressure on GOP lawmakers to start voting for the bills as the shutdown continues.


Democrats spent the morning trying to persuade their Republican colleagues to join them in opening the government, calling Trump's insistence on $5.7 billion for the wall a source of self-inflicted punishment.


Natural Resources Committee chairman Rep. Raul Grijalva , D-Arizona, called the shutdown a source of “Republican inflicted damage.”


He noted that the administration's priority of continuing the leasing process for natural gas, oil drilling and mining on federal lands has gone on unabated during the shutdown, while members of Indian tribes go without adequate healthcare.


House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to sway the GOP by insisting there were other ways to guard the border without funding Trump's wall.


“We can hire more personnel,” she said.


“We must have more people to do the job here,” which "is what the administration has asked for," she added.

DEMOCRATS FEAR INTERIOR IS PREPPING FOR A LONG SHUTDOWN: Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt held surprise discussions with Capitol Hill staff earlier this week to help make the legal case for using maintenance funds to keep national parks afloat during the shutdown, a move Democrats are saying demonstrates the administration’s resolve not to open the government.


Bernhardt visited with Natural Resources Committee staff from both sides of the aisle on Tuesday at a special briefing at Interior headquarters ostensibly meant for laying out the legal opinion that justifies Interior’s move to use maintenance money to pay park staff, according to Democratic and GOP committee aides privy to the meeting.


However, Democrats saw Bernhardt's presence as odd because the gathering was not supposed to be a meeting between staff and a senior Cabinet official. It was simply billed as a time for the agency counsel to share a legal opinion, said an aide. Democrats saw the maneuver as a sign that the agency is digging in for a potential drawn-out shutdown.


GOVERNORS CRITICIZE TRUMP’S POTENTIAL MOVE TO USE STORM AID FUNDS TO PAY FOR BORDER WALL: U.S. governors on Friday criticized the Trump administration’s consideration of diverting disaster aid funding to build a border wall.


White House officials told various news outlets Thursday that Trump is weighing using billions of dollars of Army Corps of Engineers funding allocated for states and territories suffering from storm or wildfire damage, including Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas, and California, in order to get around Congress and build his border wall.


Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello was among the officials quick to criticize the potential move, as the U.S. territory continues to recover from Hurricane Maria’s devastation in 2017.


“No wall should be funded on the pain and suffering of US citizens who have endured tragedy and loss through a natural disaster,” Rossello, a Democrat, wrote in a Twitter post. “This include[s] those citizens that live in CA, TX, PR, VI [U.S. Virgin Islands] and other jurisdictions. Today it’s us, tomorrow it could be you.”


The pushback is bipartisan: New Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis , a conservative and Trump supporter, also said Friday he opposes the president using hurricane funding for a border wall. Florida is still recovering from Hurricane Michael, which hit the state in October and is blamed for at least 60 deaths.


"We have people counting on that," he told reporters in a Friday morning media availability, according to the Tampa Bay Times. "If they backfill it immediately after the government opens, that's fine but I don't want that to be where that money is not available for us."


Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the state’s former Republican governor, spoke to Trump Thursday night, the New York Times reported. Scott’s office downplayed any potential action from the president.


"At this time, we have no reason to believe that Florida disaster funds will be repurposed for any reason,” Scott’s Senate office said.


Democrats say climate is the real crisis: Leading Democrats also criticized Trump’s potential use of an emergency declaration for illegal immigration, saying he is overlooking the real emergency: climate change.


“Instead of declaring a national emergency to address a fictional emergency – @realDonaldTrump needs to stop denying a real one: climate change,” former Secretary of State John Kerry tweeted Friday.


GOP CENTRIST AND SKEPTIC JOCKEY FOR SPOT ON PELOSI’S CLIMATE COMMITTEE: A centrist and a skeptic of man-made global warming are jockeying for the top Republican spot on a new climate change committee that Pelosi created.


Reps. Francis Rooney of Florida, a climate change hawk, and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a longtime skeptic, are openly campaigning to be ranking member of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which Democrats created to elevate the issue ahead of the 2020 election.


“It might be interpreted as a less than positive thing if someone who is made ranking member doesn't really care about climate change," Rooney told Josh in an interview.


Why the choice matters: The appointment will be made by House GOP leadership, which now faces a choice between trying to shape Democratic-led climate policy and trying to stop it.


Serving on the committee to hamper it: Sensenbrenner, a veteran lawmaker in his 21st term who has the advantage of seniority, would undoubtedly take a more adversarial approach to the Democrat-controlled committee.


“I am interested in selling the American people that market-based solutions work rather than all kinds of bureaucratic taxes or regulations that haven't worked in Europe, wouldn't work here, and would be extremely unpopular with voters,” Sensenbrenner told Josh in an interview. “We won’t win the House back if the Republican position is Green Revolution-light.”

CHAMBER PUSHES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE, EYES GAS TAX HIKE TO PAY FOR IT: U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Tom Donohue called Thursday for Congress and Trump to enact a major infrastructure bill this year, a goal that would face resistance from some Republicans.


Donohue said that the Chamber will push for an increase in the gas tax in order to pay for new building and transit projects and that the group believes Congress would have the votes to pass legislation to that effect.


“Not only would it have 218 votes, it would have 218 bipartisan votes,” said Neil Bradley , the Chamber’s chief policy officer, during a press conference following the speech. Bradley also expressed optimism that the funding mechanism could pass the Senate. The Chamber favors raising the gas tax and also indexing it to inflation.


Longtime conservative opposition: Conservative activists, particularly low tax advocates, would oppose the push, setting up the potential for an unusual intraparty legislative battle between Republicans. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, holding steady at 18.4 cents per gallon and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel.


“The president agreed with increasing the gas tax,” said Donohue, adding, “We can do roads, bridges, and light transit with an increase in the gas tax.”


NEW DEMOCRATIC LEADER OF ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE EMPHASIZES CLIMATE: Rep. Frank Pallone , D-N.J., the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, announced Thursday the names of the panel’s six subcommittees.


The announcement included a notable name change: the Subcommittee on Environment — which has oversight of the EPA’s use of the Clean Air Act — will now be called the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.


“I’m confident these six subcommittees will allow us to focus on our priorities of strengthening the economy, reducing costs for consumers, combating climate change and conducting vigorous oversight,” Pallone said in statement.


Mixed reviews for Pallone’s leadership: The move is a further sign the committee will prioritize climate change under Pallone’s watch. He recently announced the committee’s first hearing later this month will be focused on the economic impacts of climate change.


But a new crop of freshmen progressives have criticized Pallone for not being aggressive enough, citing his resistance to embrace the “Green New Deal” and his refusal to reject donations from fossil fuel companies and executives.


WASHINGTON IS STILL USING A LOT OF ENERGY DESPITE THE SHUTDOWN: The partial government shutdown has not had much effect on energy demand in the Washington D.C. region, says the large regional utility Pepco.


“During the past few weeks, we have not seen significant changes in electrical load other than those that we would expect due to changing weather conditions,” Ben Armstrong , spokesperson for Pepco Holdings, told John.   


The utility closely monitors customer electric usage across the company’s service areas, including the greater Washington D.C. area, Armstrong said. He will continue to provide updates if the shutdown affects electricity use.


Armstrong said the shutdown primarily has to do with furloughing federal employees, but federal facilities that house them aren’t closed and are still consuming electricity.


The federal government in Washington consumes enormous amounts of electricity over a 24-hour period.


News reports in recent years have shown many agencies remain bright throughout the evening, with very few attempting to reduce energy consumption even when employees aren’t there.


Nevertheless, the Energy Information Administration reports that the federal government’s energy use has improved.


ENTERGY COMPLETES FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SALE AS IT EXITS MARKET: Power plant owner Entergy on Friday completed a first-of-a-kind sale of one of its shuttered nuclear power plants in Vermont, leaving it to the new owners to complete the painstaking decommissioning of the site.


The Vermont Yankee plant is being sold to NorthStar Group Services, which will decommission the site, including securing any left over nuclear fuel at the site.


“The sale is a first-of-its-kind in the nuclear power industry – a permanent ownership and license transfer to a company that is slated to perform timely and efficient decommissioning and site restoration,” Entergy explained.


Typically, the power plant owner either does the decommissioning itself, or contracts with a partner to do so. In this case, the owner decided to sell off the plant, which will be followed by Entergy exiting from the merchant power utility business altogether.


Entergy owns some of the first nuclear power plants to be built and operated in the U.S., but has struggled in recent years from waning revenues and increased competition from renewable energy and natural gas.


The company has annual revenues of $11 billion and owns energy assets from New York to Texas.  


NASA SPOKESWOMAN MARKS FINAL DAY IN DC AFTER SERVING TWO YEARS WITH TRUMP: Friday marks the final day for Megan Powers’ service as NASA’s spokeswoman under the Trump administration.


“While I will miss working with the incredible team here, last month I accepted an exciting new offer, which will be announced in the near future,” she said in an email to reporters on Thursday.


Powers had been with NASA for nine months, from April 2018-January 2019.


Prior to that, she was the senior lead press representative in the White House Office of Presidential Advance from March-April 2018 after serving in the same office for well over a year.


Before coming to the Washington she had worked on the Inauguration and the Trump Campaign.


FRETTING ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN’S IMPACT ON ROCK CREEK PARK: The Rock Creek Conservancy, an advocacy group, expressed concern Friday to the Interior Department that the government shutdown is causing damage to Washington D.C.’s Rock Creek Park.


“Without staff, the shutdown is disrupting the balance between visitor engagement and resource conservation, with a negative impact on both,” the group said in a letter to Dan Smith , the acting director of the National Park Service. “The damage that occurs in a very short time will take a very long and expensive effort to reverse.”

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon’s Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely — but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that’s a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times’ popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring’s video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: “A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers’ video streams or recordings.”
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring’s mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, “the company’s treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but.”
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team “virtually unfettered access” to “every video created by every Ring camera around the world,” according to The Intercept.
“The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers,” the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company’s image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
“A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring’s video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors,” The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
“The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing.”
The site’s reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team’s location.
“The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime,” according to The Information. “If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone’s home.”
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees’ viewing of video, according to The Intercept. “Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example,” the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers’ personal information very seriously.
“These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes,” the spokesperson said.
“Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products.”
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, “anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them.”
According to The Intercept, Ring describes “Neighbors” — a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras — without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that “those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab.”
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, “you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors,” the site reported.

Let Me Tell You the Story of My Life. Again.

Texto completo: Kathryn Harrison's recently published book, "On Sunset," in which she describes being reared by her wonderfully eccentric grandparents in Los Angeles in the 1960s, is her fifth memoir. "Typically, when people hear the phrase 'serial memoirist,"' I said to Harrison recently, "they think of Maya Angelou, who wrote eight memoirs, or Shirley MacLaine, who has written 11. How do you feel about being in that company?"
Harrison, who has also written seven well-regarded novels, two biographies and a book of true crime, but who is best known for "The Kiss," her controversial memoir about her four-year consensual romance with her father, replied, not uncheerily, "I'm O.K. with it." But Harrison then recounted walking the Camino de Santiago, the pilgrimage in northern Spain which is the subject of memoirs by both Harrison and MacLaine. At one point during her walk, Harrison had fallen into conversation with a British man who was offering refreshments on the side of the path. "When he found out I was a writer, he said, 'You must be here because of Shirley MacLaine.' It was so insulting! I was not looking for my past lives!"
A different combination of motives and inclinations prompts every serial memoirist to return repeatedly to the keyboard's well-worn "I" button. If the searing emotionalism found in the work of most repeat memoirists (Angelou, Augusten Burroughs, Mary Karr, Jamaica Kincaid, Joyce Maynard, Frank McCourt, Lauren Slater) would seem to have been generated by forces other than those fueling writers who, at the end of, or well into, their careers, tack on a few autobiographical works to their oeuvres (Diana Athill, Gore Vidal), one quality unites all these writers. Their lingua franca is candor.
That said, outside of "stunt journalists" (Henry David Thoreau, George Plimpton, A.J. Jacobs) and famous or notable personages compelled to leave behind a historical record of their existence on the planet (any celebrity or politician with a pen), serial memoirists would seem to fall into two main camps -- those who simply want to capture life as they themselves experienced it, and who happen to have more than a book's worth of material; and those for whom an additional memoir or memoirs is a form of repudiation or correction.
At first blush, the phrase "serial memoirist" seems distinctly postmodern: Before the self-empowerment boom of the 1960s and 70s, writing a memoir was thought to be the province of a reflective senior citizen. "Whether I serve one or two terms in the presidency," John F. Kennedy said in 1961 at the age of 43, "I will find myself at the end of that period at what might be called the awkward age -- too old to begin a new career and too young to write my memoirs." But if we take a broader view, we see not only that St. Augustine started writing his "Confessions" in 397 at the age of 43, but that this early example of memoir can also qualify as serial: each of the 13 books was composed as a discrete unit (meant to be read aloud, each taking about an hour to perform.)
Of the two main camps of serial memoirists described above, Harrison falls into the former. Though Harrison's agent, Amanda "Binky" Urban, will sometimes try to coax her client into writing something for commercial reasons (on the heels of Josephine Hart's novel "Damage," Urban tried, "How about a little book about adultery?"), Harrison said she needs to be thinking about, if not obsessing about, a topic in order to take it on. "'The Mother Knot' is typical," she said, referring to her fourth memoir, in which she achieves equanimity over her long-troubled relationships with her parents by sprinkling her dead mother's remains in the sea. Harrison said she had not been planning to write "The Mother Knot."
"It was only when I was on the phone with the funeral director out in Los Angeles, asking him to dig my mother up, burn her up and send her to me, that I thought to myself, 'You're behaving weirdly now. Perhaps you should start taking notes."'
Writer Dani Shapiro's upcoming work, "Inheritance" -- her fifth memoir -- can be classified in the repudiation or correction category. After blithely submitting her DNA to a genealogy website in 2016, Shapiro discovered that her father -- son of the founder of the Lincoln Square Synagogue, brother of the former president of the Orthodox Union -- was neither her biological father nor Jewish. (Coincidentally, in New York magazine last month, Elizabeth Wurtzel recounted her own recent discovery that her birth father was famed photographer Bob Adelman.)
That Judaism is matrilineal seems, in Shapiro's case, to take a back seat to the fact that Shapiro, over the course of her memoirs, has not been shy about positing herself as a Jewish person who doesn't look Jewish (she is blonde and Californian-looking.) In her first memoir, "Slow Motion," Shapiro recounted how her Holocaust survivor neighbors in New Jersey would tell her, "We could have used you in the camps, little blondie. The soldiers would have given you extra bread." In her second memoir, "Devotion," she refers to herself as "the blond sheep" of her family. Thus, "Inheritance" can be viewed as a kind of crisis management of the Dani Shapiro brand.
In this second category of serial memoir, the theme of repudiation or correction is often more overt than it is Shapiro's case. As Joan Wickersham pointed out in Harvard Review last year, Emily Fox Gordon and Karen Armstrong are notable examples. In her 2010 personal essay collection, "Book of Days," Gordon writes of her 2000 therapy memoir, "Mockingbird Years," "The narrative of my memoir was a lie," referring not to factual accuracy but to context and scale: "I presented what was only one of a multitude of possible autobiographical stories as if it were the story of my life."
Similarly, Armstrong has explained the existence of her third memoir, "The Spiral Staircase" -- partly a rewrite of her second memoir, "Beginning the World," describing the ex-nun's trials with depression and temporal lobe epilepsy -- by saying that the second memoir "did not tell the whole story!" The publisher of "Beginning the World" didn't want Armstrong to be perceived as an intellectual, so the book has no discussion of theology or the purpose of prayer; but in between the publication of this book and "The Spiral Staircase," Armstrong wrote her international best-seller "A History of God" and became a celebrated religious historian.
The impulse to repudiate or correct also fuels what might be termed the call-and-response memoir. After literary critic Anatole Broyard wrote two memoirs that neglected to mention that he was African-American, his daughter Bliss Broyard corrected the score in 2007 with her own memoir; two years after Sean Wilsey cast his gimlet eye on his socialite mother in "Oh the Glory of It All," she fired back with "Oh the Hell of It All."
In the end, serial memoirists, regardless of what categories we file them under or what motives we ascribe to them, serve as a litmus test of a reader's humanity. If memoir is, according to serial memoirist Mark Twain's friend and adviser, William Dean Howells, "the most democratic province of the republic of letters," then it makes a certain kind of sense that critics and cognoscenti often sniff at writers who repeatedly offer up literature's answer to fried dough. Consider the editor faced with whittling down the notes that H.L. Mencken appended to the three memoirs he published during his lifetime, from 1200 pages to 200.
But aren't serial memoirists expressing something deeply human? In 1971, psychologists Edward Jones and Richard Nisbett conducted an experiment in which they asked subjects to rate a series of individuals -- their fathers, their friends, Walter Cronkite and themselves -- in terms of traits like aggression and generosity. If the subjects wished, they could choose "depends on situation" as a rating. To a large degree, the subjects chose "depends on situation" only for themselves, while positing more definite character traits for the other three categories of people. While we tend to think of other people as having fixed personalities and traits, we view ourselves as inherently flexible. A cottage industry is born.

Texto completo: During nearly 20 years writing about health, I've had the opportunity to speak with hundreds of top medical experts about how to live well. What I've learned from all of them can be summed up in four simple words.
Move. Nourish. Refresh. Connect.
The science is clear. If you move your body a little each day, you will be far better off than if you are sedentary. If you nourish your body with real food (the kind that doesn't come in packages loaded with sugar or via a drive-through window) you will be healthier than if you eat junk food. If you allow your mind to take a break and refresh from time to time, you will feel better. And if you regularly connect with loved ones and friends, old and new, you will be both happier and healthier.
These four words -- move, nourish, refresh, connect -- are the guiding principles behind the 30-Day Well Challenge, a first-of-its-kind program from The New York Times to help you build healthy habits for your body, mind and spirit, one daily challenge at a time. Each task is based on science, and over time, each new habit can add up to meaningful changes in your life.
Each challenge takes just minutes to complete. We've created new six-minute move workout videos to show you that you really do have time to exercise. We've included refresh challenges to give your mind the rest it needs. You'll find delicious nourish challenges to nourish your body with more food, not less. And because the health of your relationships affects the health of your body, we've included connect challenges to help you get closer to those you love. Here are a few examples of what to expect:
[Ready to get started now? Sign up for the 30-Day Well Challenge.]
A Mindful Chocolate Challenge: Nourish both your body and your mind with this task. Pick a piece of quality, delicious chocolate (yes, I said chocolate!). If you don't like chocolate pick a piece of fruit or a bite-size savory treat. Then do this mindful meditation from Dr. Michelle May, founder of AmIHungry, which teaches mindful eating. Sit down where you won't be distracted.
"As you unwrap the chocolate, listen to the sounds and notice the aroma. Take a small bite, then pause. Become aware of the textures and flavors on your tongue. As you begin to chew, notice how the flavors, textures and aromas change. Notice pleasure. When you have fully experienced your bite, swallow, then pause to notice how long the flavor lingers. Slowly repeat until your treat is finished."
Why are you doing this? Because studies show that mindfulness encourages more healthful eating.
The One-Minute Task Challenge: Declutter your mind and your home with this simple refresh challenge, which can be completed any time of day. Your goal will be to complete as many one-minute or less tasks as you can find over the next five minutes. Use your phone or watch as a timer, and no cheating. You are going for one-minute tasks only. Here are some suggestions:
■ Make the bed.
■ Pick up laundry and put it in a hamper.
■ Throw away junk mail left on a table.
■ Wipe off a counter.
■ Put the remotes next to the TV.
■ Hang up your coat.
■ Make a quick to-do list for later.
■ Tidy the bathroom vanity.
Gretchen Rubin, author of "The Happiness Project," calls this her one-minute rule. "Keeping all those small nagging tasks under control makes me more serene, less overwhelmed."
The How Are We Doing Challenge? It's easy to let our closest relationships hum along when there are no obvious problems. Use this Connect challenge from Philip and Carolyn Cowan, two University of California, Berkeley professors who have spent their careers studying children and families. To complete this challenge, take a quiet moment in the morning or evening with your partner, a close friend or anyone who is important to you. Ask each other the simple question, "How are we doing?" Take a moment to think about what in the relationship has made you feel happy recently. Are there special memories you want to talk about together? Were there moments, happy or sad, where you wish you had spoken up, asked for help or shared your feelings? It will provoke a thoughtful exploration of your relationship, what's working and where you can do better. Try it!
The goal of each challenge is to distill the science of healthful living into one simple task. To discover 30 all-new daily challenges like these, sign up for the Well Challenge now and skip those impossible New Year's resolutions ("I'm going to lose weight!" "I'm going to exercise an hour a day!") that you impose on yourself each year. (Research shows that most resolutions don't work.) Instead, join us on the Well Challenge for 30 days and take a small step every day to live well. (If you missed starting with us this week, you can start any Monday of the year, so don't fear missing out on a chance to take small strides to a healthier life.)
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Both Democrats and most news media are yelling as often as they can that there is no border "crisis," even though they spent the last year telling everyone there was and even though they had no problem explicitly calling it a "crisis" in 2014, when the situation was the exact same as it is now.

In 2019, we now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the borer that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all," then-President Barack Obama said in the Rose Garden. "In recent weeks we've seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers."

This is no different than what President Trump said from the Oval Office on Tuesday.

"Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States -- a dramatic increase," he said. "These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs."

The only difference is how the media are covering it.

The Washington Post on July 12, 2014, referred to "the current crisis on the Southwest border, where authorities have apprehended tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American children since October ..." The story's lead author was Karen Tumulty, now a columnist for the Post, who completely dismissed the idea of any crisis at the border this week.

"We are headed to this extraordinary situation where the president declares a state of emergency, which does not exist, and the law does not really explain what we do if the president manufactures an emergency," she said Tuesday on MSNBC.

On June 5, 2014, a New York Times article began, "This is what it looks like when an immigration system is overwhelmed by tens of thousands of women and children from Central America." It further noted that, "The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been ordered to coordinate efforts to contain the crisis."

The Times editorial board this week, however, said that the crisis is actually "in the Oval Office."

The border crisis didn't change between 2014 and now. The only thing that changed was who's in the White House and how the media are reporting on it.

Texto completo: In an effort to prevent immigrant students from being detained and deported on questionable evidence of gang involvement, a Long Island school district is taking the lead in negotiating an agreement to limit the role of school-based police officers.
At a packed, often emotional meeting Monday, the Huntington, New York, school board said it has authorized its superintendent to hammer out a deal between the approximately 50 Suffolk County school districts that allow police in schools and the county Police Department. Board president Jennifer Hebert said that without a formal agreement, she would oppose the continued use of police known as resource officers in Huntington’s schools.
“We need clarity and guidelines, and if we can’t get those, I’m not comfortable having officers in our building going forward. And many of these trustees feel similarly,” she said.
Another board member, Xavier Palacios, called for expunging school suspensions from the disciplinary records of students whom school resource officers reported to ICE. “We must make a wrong right. If our district needs to create a new policy to prevent this from happening again, then we must do so,” he said.
The board members were responding to a story published last month by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine about a student named Alex who attended Huntington High School while seeking asylum in the U.S. After he drew the telephone country code of his native Honduras as well as a devil with horns, which is a symbol of the violent street gang MS-13 but also Huntington High’s mascot, the school suspended him for gang activity.
Alex was then detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which under President Donald Trump is increasingly using school records to arrest immigrant students who haven’t been charged with any crime but are suspected of gang membership. Alex was one of about a dozen immigrant Huntington High students detained for allegedly associating with MS-13, which has been particularly active on Long Island. In several of these cases, ICE cited classroom doodles and other school incidents that were reported by Huntington High school resource officer Andrew Fiorillo. Alex was deported to Honduras in July 2018.
The day after the story ran, the Huntington school district posted a letter promising to ask for a contract with Suffolk County police to clarify the duties of school resource officers. The Police Department said it is reviewing the district’s request, and the police commissioner is expected to meet with county superintendents soon. At a community meeting Tuesday, Inspector Bill Scrima said that Fiorillo, who has worked at Huntington High for 14 years, has been pulled out of the high school. “We’re not sure whether the school wants him back,” Scrima told Newsday.
Neither the school nor the Police Department responded to ProPublica’s questions about when Fiorillo is expected to return. Fiorillo did not respond to messages.
A spokesman for the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association said it supports Huntington’s proposal for a formal agreement with police. “This episode is upsetting on so many levels,” Huntington Superintendent James Polansky said. “What I ask for is that we come together as we take a lead role in changing the story, not just for us, but for districts around the area.”
Protecting Our Classmates, a group of Huntington High alumni that formed in response to the article and includes the school’s three most recent valedictorians, said that an agreement should mandate cultural competency training for police. The group has set up a GoFundMe site for Alex.

He Drew His School Mascot — and ICE Labeled Him a Gang Member
How high schools have embraced the Trump administration’s crackdown on MS-13, and destroyed immigrant students’ American dreams.
School privacy experts said districts that allow student information to be handed over to ICE may be violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the landmark 1974 law that protects the confidentiality of school records. “This is a massive violation of the spirit of our federal student privacy law. These practices are unconstitutional and must stop immediately,” said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law Center.
Some 500 people packed into an assembly hall for the school board meeting. So many people wanted to speak that the board held two comment sessions. Recent graduate Landary Rivas stood at the speaker’s podium next to Alex’s younger brother, who transferred from Huntington High to a neighboring school district after Alex was deported.
“It’s very hard to be Latino here,” Landary said, speaking through tears. “Something has to change. ‘I’m sorry’ is not going to cut it. This stuff has to stop.”
Alex, who is following the developments from Honduras, said he is grateful for the support and hopes that telling his story will help other immigrants. “I want this to never happen to another student,” he said.

Kim Jong Un reportedly up for 2nd U.S. summit

Texto completo: World
BEIJING - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly told the leader of his only major ally, China, that he is committed to setting up a second summit with President Donald Trump to "achieve results" on the nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula.
The comments, contained in reports Thursday from Chinese and North Korean state media, came after Kim left Beijing on his special armored train for Pyongyang after a two-day visit to the Chinese capital.
Kim's trip to China - his fourth in the past 10 months - is believed to be an effort to coordinate with Beijing ahead of a possible second summit with Trump.
It comes after U.S. and North Korean officials are thought to have met in Vietnam to discuss the site of the summit.
Kim met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip, Chinese and North Korea state media reported Thursday.
Xi was quoted as saying that China supports the U.S.-North Korea summits and hopes the two sides "will meet each other halfway."
Iran says it's holding U.S. veteran
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran confirmed Wednesday it is holding U.S. Navy veteran Michael R. White at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained under President Donald Trump's administration.
White's detention adds new pressure to the rising tension between Iran and the U.S., which under Trump has pursued a maximalist campaign against Tehran that includes pulling out of its nuclear deal with world powers.
Although the circumstances of White's detention remain unclear, Iran in the past has used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported the confirmation, citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi.
"An American citizen was arrested in the city of Mashhad some time ago and his case was conveyed to the U.S administration on the first days" of his incarceration, Ghasemi was quoted as saying.
The New York Times has quoted White's mother saying she learned three weeks ago that her son is alive and being held at an Iranian prison.
The State Department said it was aware of reports of an American citizen's arrest, but was otherwise unable to comment.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
Rosenstein has been a shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers mulled removing them both.
Rosenstein’s appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions’ recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal led to Sessions’ firing after the midterm elections in November.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, which may be in its final stages. Rosenstein has helped oversee the inquiry since the appointment in November of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers before next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 during the administration of President George H. W. Bush.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly, I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him. "
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
A career attorney at Justice before taking the No. 2 post in April 2017, Rosenstein's tenure has been inextricably joined with the Russia investigation.
Less than a month after his confirmation, he wrote a controversial memo supporting the removal of FBI Director James Comey.
Trump's dismissal of Comey is being examined by Mueller as part of his inquiry into whether the president sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.
Rosenstein announced the appointment of Mueller shortly after.
Democrats, who have unsuccessfully sought to pass legislation to protect Mueller from any attempt by the White House to remove him, expressed deep concern Wednesday after learning of Rosenstein's pending departure.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N. Y. , said the development at Justice "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.
Schumer cited a memo Barr sent to Justice last year that was critical of the Russia inquiry.
"From all accounts, Mr. Rosenstein has been an impartial actor at the head of the special counsel's investigation," Schumer said.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday he is concerned about Barr protecting the Mueller investigation.
“I’m concerned when this man, who has a good reputation as a lawyer and professional, volunteers to the Trump administration that they should constrain Mueller’s investigation,” Durbin said. “This is not a good starting point for someone who as attorney general would have supervisory authority over the investigation. ”
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , a member of the Judiciary Committee who met with Barr Wednesday, said the nominee was "committed to allowing Mr. Mueller to finish" his work.
Rosenstein strongly supported Barr's nomination and said the Russia inquiry was proceeding as it should.
The deputy attorney general joined the department in 1990 through the attorney general’s honors program.
During independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton, Rosenstein helped convict three associates of the Clintons – Susan McDougal, James McDougal and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker – on fraud and conspiracy charges in May 1996.
Rosenstein became an assistant U. S. attorney in Maryland, prosecuting federal court cases and arguing appeals at the 4th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He served four years in the Justice Department’s tax division.
He served 12 years as U. S. attorney for Maryland before beginning his stint as deputy attorney general.

Texto completo: ISTANBUL - White House national security adviser John Bolton traveled to Turkey this week to talk with Turkish officials about working together on President Trump's plan to quickly withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.
Instead, he got an earful.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who declined to meet with Bolton, scolded him on live television Tuesday, describing as "a serious mistake" remarks Bolton made conditioning the American exit plan on protection of U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters. Turkey considers the Kurdish forces terrorists and has vowed to attack them in northeast Syria as soon as the Americans leave.
The furious response in Ankara was the latest setback for the White House's troubled effort to extricate 2,000 American troops from Syria - a withdrawal that President Trump announced suddenly last month without a detailed plan to implement it.
Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are touring the Middle East, seeking to explain the policy and elicit support. But administration efforts at reassurance have instead raised doubts about the plan, laid bare internal disagreements and perplexed U.S. partners.
In Jerusalem on Monday, Bolton listed pre-withdrawal "objectives" - including the final defeat of the Islamic State and protection of Kurdish allies - that went well beyond Trump's simple assertion that U.S. forces were heading home from Syria.
"The message that Bolton gave in Israel is unacceptable. It is not possible for us to swallow," Erdogan said during a televised address to lawmakers in his political party. He suggested he also might ignore the Trump administration's request to delay a Turkish military operation against the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters. "Very soon, we will take action to neutralize terrorist organizations in Syria," Erdogan said.
The administration encountered similar pushback elsewhere Tuesday, as U.S. allies pressed their own priorities.
In Jordan, Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi greeted Pompeo with kind words and a smile, but was unyielding in demands that the United States coordinate any troop withdrawal from Syria with regional allies. The minister also rejected Israel's request that the United States recognize Israeli sovereignty over Syrian territory that Israel occupies in the Golan Heights.
Safadi also emphasized the position of Jordan and other U.S. allies in the Arab world that a pending American proposal for Israeli-Palestinian peace must recognize Palestinian statehood with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.
Meanwhile, in Washington, the administration's special envoy tasked with establishing a U.S. military alliance with countries in the Persian Gulf resigned his position on Tuesday. Anthony Zinni, who was named to the job last year, said no progress had been made in resolving a bitter dispute dividing gulf countries, which was undermining the prospects for the security pact.
A retired Marine Corps general and former head of U.S. Central Command, Zinni is the latest senior military veteran to leave the administration, following last month's resignation of retired Marine general Jim Mattis as defense secretary and the departure of retired Army general John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff.
Most attention, however, was focused on Turkey and the increasingly muddled administration explanation of its intentions in Syria.
Aaron Stein, the Middle East director at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, said the tensions over the administration's Syria policy were largely the result of Trump's staff ignoring "the intent of the president."
"Whatever you think of Donald Trump, he has been very, very clear that he wants to withdraw from Syria. Instead of listening to that, what the national security bureaucracy is doing is putting together a plan that depends on a forever U.S. presence. Everyone is scrambling to reinterpret the president's message." As a result, the U.S. deliberations over Syria, which would normally occur behind closed doors, are "literally happening in front of the entire world," Stein said.
Responding to media reports that Erdogan had snubbed Bolton by refusing to meet with him, National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said that the U.S. Embassy in Ankara had requested an Erdogan meeting but that because of a "scheduling conflict," it was "never confirmed."
Marquis said that Bolton had held a "productive discussion" with Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin during a meeting that lasted more than two hours.
In the meeting, Bolton told Kalin that an op-ed written by Erdogan and published Monday night by the New York Times was inaccurate and offensive, according to a person briefed by a senior administration official who attended the session. Erdogan said in the op-ed that Trump had "made the right call" in announcing a withdrawal from Syria but was seeking to put unwise restrictions on Turkey's agreement to take the United States' place.
Bolton presented Kalin with a document restating Trump's intention to withdraw U.S. forces but also insisting on protection for Kurdish fighters, said the person who had been briefed, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the private diplomatic session.
According to U.S. talking points, American troops and their allies in Syria would continue attacks against remaining Islamic State forces during an "orderly" U.S. departure period. Though orders have been given to the U.S. military to begin preparing for withdrawal, troops will carry out operations against the militant group as they leave. To prevent an Islamic State resurgence, the United States will retain unspecified capabilities on the ground for ongoing operations.
The withdrawal order does not involve an immediate departure from Syria of a separate U.S. garrison at Tanf in southeast Syria, near the junction of the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq. The administration has said the force of several hundred U.S. and coalition troops provides a buffer against any expansion by Iranian forces and their proxies, which have been aiding the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Bolton's delegation - which included Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and diplomat James Jeffrey, the administration's special envoy for Syria and for the anti-Islamic State coalition - stressed that Washington was seeking a negotiated solution to Turkey's concerns and would cooperate with Ankara on deconflicting airspace over northeast Syria.
During the discussions, Bolton stressed U.S. opposition to any Turkish mistreatment of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which have fought alongside the United States against the Islamic State. But Kalin did not budge from Turkey's insistence that the bulk of those fighters, who are members of the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, are allied with Kurdish separatists in Turkey. He said that no offensive action would be taken in Syria while U.S. forces remained but that Turkey was fully within its rights to attack the Kurdish "terrorists."
Bolton and Pompeo have both insisted on protection for all of the SDF, whose estimated 60,000 fighters include Syrian Arabs as well as Kurds. But this concern has not been made a formal condition of the pullout, according to one person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment on sensitive policymaking. This person said that "there will definitely be a fight" between Turkey and the Kurdish forces once the Americans leave Syria.
One possibility is that the Kurdish forces will fragment while resisting a Turkish onslaught. Another possibility is that the Kurds will transfer their loyalty to Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers.
In Jordan on Tuesday, Pompeo said the departure of U.S. troops would not affect U.S. priorities in the region, particularly the goal of stopping Iranian expansion in Syria. Repeating remarks he has previously made in media interviews, Pompeo said that stepped-up, but unspecified, "diplomatic and commercial" pressure would achieve that aim. Before Trump's withdrawal announcement, Pompeo and Bolton had said U.S. troops would remain indefinitely in Syria, until Iranian-commanded troops and their proxy militias were gone.
Pompeo said that the U.S.-led coalition in the region "is as effective today as it was yesterday, and I'm very hopeful it will continue to be effective and even more effective tomorrow. This is not just about a particular tactic. . . . The president's decision to withdraw folks from Syria in no way impacts our capacity to deliver" on the continuing fight against Iran and the Islamic State, he said.
Trump has also said he wants countries in the region to make a bigger financial and military contribution toward promoting their shared aims, a subject that Pompeo plans to address during visits this week and next to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Egypt.

New York City to invest $100 million a year to provide healthcare to undocumented, low-wage workers

Texto completo: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new healthcare plan for "all New Yorkers" to include illegal immigrants and low-wage workers that would cost the city $100 million a year.

De Blasio made his announcement on Tuesday hours before President Trump was scheduled to air a national address regarding the government shutdown and what he calls a "crisis" at the southern border. The healthcare initiative, called NYC Care, would work in tandem with the current MetroPlus healthcare system, but it was not immediately clear how and where the funds would come from, although de Blasio said that they would not have to raise taxes in order to fund the initiative. According to the New York Times, aides said that the city could independently implement the system without the approval of the state Legislature.

The goal, according to the Democratic mayor, is to "ensure the first stop for people isn’t the emergency room," including a hotline that could connect patients to doctors who would become their primary care doctor. De Blasio said that going to the emergency room was the default means of healthcare for people, but it is the worst and most expensive way to get healthcare. NYC Care would allow individuals to seek treatment and even preventive care to help avoid costly trips to the ER.

The plan is to have NYC Care at full scale in two years, but it could face opposition from local Republicans, including Nicole Malliotakis, who is in the New York State Assembly and lost to de Blasio in the 2017 mayoral election.

"Our citizens have hard enough time covering their own healthcare costs. Now, @nycmayor also wants them to pay for healthcare of 300,000 citizens of other countries," wrote Malliotakis on Twitter. "He must stop abusing the middle class and treating us like his personal ATM."

De Blasio called it a "guarantee of healthcare," saying that it's meant for New Yorkers who need it. He also said that undocumented immigrants are part of the community and it is important to include them and their families under the healthcare plan. When asked about pushback on paying for healthcare of young people and undocumented immigrants, de Blasio said that by not paying for coverage and care before people get really sick, the city, and therefore taxpayers, pay more for emergency room visits.

Texto completo: Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump will speak to the American people about his demands for a southern border wall, which have led him to shut down the government. He will, undoubtedly, gin up fear about a “crisis” mounting at the US-Mexico border. Here are nine things you should know in advance of his speech — incidentally, nine things that I wish Trump would correctly acknowledge in his speech, too.
After all, Trump has been hyping fears about violence stemming from the United States/Mexico border since the early moments of his presidential campaign. In June 2015, for instance, he painted an ugly picture of Mexican migrants crossing the border. “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists,” Trump said. He has kept up his fearmongering about the border, but ramped it up in recent weeks as justification for his sudden decision to shutdown the federal government because neither Democrats nor Republicans in his own party will approve funding for Trump’s border wall. He has tweeted about “our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER” and even threatened to declare a state of emergency to build the wall that he insists is not only needed but is also needed now more than ever.
Trump is simply, on these and related points, incorrect. Here are the key facts:
Read more commentary: Trump's 'border security' shutdown: Cut off cash to people and agencies that protect us
Trump turned the border wall into his Alamo. That didn't end well and this won't either.
Stories from the border: The women asylum seekers I met need protection, not barriers
►Illegal border crossings are down. Significantly.
In 2000, 1. 6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border into the United States. In 2001, 1. 3 million were apprehended. In 2018? Less than 400,000. That’s not just a decline. It’s a significant decline.
A lot of the decline was because of the recession, which dried up jobs migrants were seeking to fill. But if we’re being fair, apprehension numbers reached a low of about 310,000 in 2017 in part because of increased border enforcement and fear of Trump and his anti-immigrant policies.
►The counties along the southern border are among the safest in the United States.
According to data from the Wilson Center, as summarized by The Washington Post, “The crime rates in U. S. border counties are lower than the average for similarly sized inland counties, with two exceptions out of 23 total. ”
Anti-immigrant conservatives like to talk about how undocumented immigrants are supposedly menacing border communities and making border states less safe. Recently, in a segment with me on CNN, conservative radio host and Trump supporter Ben Ferguson shouted, “Talk to people in Texas! I’m in Texas right now! People here … have been killed by illegal immigrants that come across the border illegally. And you say it’s fearmongering!?”
Yes, I do. And I’m not the only one. Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center, told The Post, “There is no doubt the U. S. side (of the border) is a very safe place. ”
►Most undocumented immigrants don’t “sneak” across the border.
The majority of immigrants in the USA without authorization first entered the country legally, and then overstayed their visas. The Center for Migration Studies said in a 2017 report that crossing the border is not the way “the large majority of persons now becoming undocumented. ” It reported that two-thirds of undocumented immigrants entered the U. S. legally and then simply overstayed their visas. If you legitimately are concerned about the issue of undocumented immigrants, as opposed to just exacerbating and exploiting fearmongering for political gain, then this is where you would focus — not the border.
►The White House is lying about terrorists crossing the southern border.
In an interview on Fox News this weekend, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted that “nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border. ” Sanders' careful wording suggests she knew she was more than bending the truth. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace fact-checked Sanders: “Do you know where those 4,000 people come, where they are captured? Airports. ”
“The state department says there hasn’t been any terrorists found coming across the southern border,” Wallace stated. But Sanders kept pressing the lie, because Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda relies on fact-less fearmongering.
►Migrant caravans aren’t “sneaking” across the border, either.
If you care about facts, it’s important to distinguish between illegal border crossings and migrants lawfully presenting themselves at southern ports of entry in order to apply for asylum. The simple fact is that large groups of very visible migrants, such as the main so-called migrant caravan of people fleeing violence in Central America, are obviously not trying to “sneak” across the U. S. border. They’re coming to the border to apply for asylum, which was a completely transparent and lawful process until Trump started changing the rules.
►Drugs entering the USA across the southern border are most often hidden in legal shipments.
Trump has suggested that the flow of heroin into the United States would be stanched by his border wall. He’s right that 90 percent of heroin enters through the southern border. However, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency, “illicit drugs are smuggled into the United States in concealed compartments within passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers. ”
In other words, a wall wouldn’t stop most heroin from entering the country. And arguably, resources spent on the wall would divert from other enforcement mechanisms, such as more officers and technology at ports of entry to scan vehicles for drugs.
It’s also noteworthy that in ramping up prosecution of migrants trying to enter the United States, the Trump administration actually reduced prosecution of drug traffickers. Last June saw the fewest such prosecutions in two decades.
►Conservative political figures and think tanks think Trump’s wall is pointless.
What apparently began as a memory device to help the undisciplined Trump remember what to thunder about during campaign appearances has turned into a central bone the president won’t let go of. But there’s a reason Trump couldn’t get funding for his wall during the past two years of his presidency when his own party completely controlled both houses of Congress: They didn’t want it. The New York Times reports that leading anti-immigration activists are concerned Trump’s focus on the “relatively ineffectual” wall is distracting from other strategies they would like prioritized.
For instance, Republican Rep. Will Hurd, from the border state of Texas, said in 2017, “I’ve made it clear time and time again that building a physical wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border. ” The conservative Cato Institute has called Trump’s wall idea “impractical, expensive and ineffective. ” One might suspect that more Republicans would speak out against Trump’s stupid wall idea if they weren’t afraid of alienating the right-wing GOP base.
►There are already 654 miles of border fencing.
The U. S. -Mexico border is 1,933 miles long. Of that, 34 percent already has a wall or a fence — in particular, parts along the areas of the border that are most easily accessed by people traveling by car or on foot. That’s right, there’s already a wall along 654 miles of the U. S. border. What’s the rest? Huge mountains and rivers and vast stretches of land that are privately owned, which the United States would have to seize through eminent domain if Trump got his way. Mind you, those areas aren’t completely open — they’re actively patrolled using sensors and drones and other technology, the sorts of things experts say actually work.
Here it’s worth noting that the less than 400,000 people who were trying to cross the border in 2018 were arrested. They were caught and detained and deported. Because of our already extremely highly militarized and aggressive border patrol efforts.
►Americans do not support Trump’s wall.
“The people of our country want it,” Trump said recently. No, they do not. A mid-December poll found that 54 percent of respondents opposed Trump’s wall. That number even crept up slightly by late December. And more than two out of three Americans don’t think the wall should be a political priority. It’s also worth noting that most Americans blame Trump for the government shutdown that he initiated by trying to hold government funding hostage to get his stupid wall.
Americans don’t support Trump’s wall because they know the truth — that we have a tough immigration and border enforcement system already working, and way bigger problems to focus on fixing in our nation.

Texto completo: A freshman Democratic woman in the House says President Trump is a "combative racist" who is damaging America.

“We are at a time when we have a combative racist and often unhinged person in the White House,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., in an interview with the New York Times. “That’s not going to be answered with somebody who says: Let’s come together and let’s heal and let’s all be gentle souls.”

Jayapal, who represents Seattle and most of King County, Washington, is one of several minority women who were elected to Congress in 2018.

She echoed comments made by self-proclaimed Democratic socialist and liberal firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., during a wide-ranging appearance on "60 Minutes" over the weekend.

"The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it, and expanded it, and created a platform for those things," Ocasio-Cortez said. “When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy.”

The accusations of racism, or least tolerance for racist rhetoric, from freshman lawmakers comes as Democrats gear up to launch investigations into Trump’s personal finances and conduct while in office.

Last week, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich, told supporters during a rally that Democrats would “go in an impeach the motherf--ker.”

Texto completo: MIDDLETOWN —
The eldest sister of the McGuire Sisters, the trio born in Middletown and raised in Miamisburg, with six Top 10 Billboard hits including No. 1 hits “Sincerely” and “Sugartime,” died just before New Year’s in Las Vegas.
Born Ruby Christine McGuire, the sister behind the iconic group’s matching attire, to Asa and Lillie McGuire on July 30, 1926, died on Dec. 28, 2018, at 92. McGuire’s family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday, according to the New York Times, and no cause of death was given.
Phyllis McGuire, 87, the youngest of the trio, is the sole survivor of the McGuire Sisters, who were born in Middletown. Dorothy “Dottie” McGuire died in 2012 at 84.
The McGuire Sisters performed for five presidents — Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush — and Queen Elizabeth II. They were inducted into three halls of fame: the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009.

Texto completo: This year, at long last, the Democrats who now control the House of Representatives will move to make Donald Trump's tax returns public.
Just how they do it, however, is crucial. Their style will determine whether voters become engaged, informed, interested, outraged or just shrug. If the Democrats mishandle disclosure of the tax returns they might even generate sympathy for Trump and solidify support from his base.
So how should these documents be revealed? Let's start with a touch of crucial history.
The very first constitutional power we grant our Congress is to tax us.
The first American Republic failed because the Articles of Confederation government had no power to tax or regulate business. "The revenue of the state is the state," Edmund Burke, the 18th century founder of modern conservatism, declared quite correctly in 1793.
Back in 1924, less than a decade after the individual income tax began, Congress voted itself the power to examine any tax return. It also has the right to "any tax information" related to those returns that the federal tax police, now called the IRS, and the Treasury Department possesses.
That means business records obtained during audits, among other things.
This law is unambiguous. It says that the chairmen of three committees - House Ways and Means, Senate Finance and the Joint Committee on Taxation - "shall" be given the tax documents by the Treasury secretary. The chief of staff of the joint committee also holds this power to obtain tax returns.
Congress exercises this authority all the time as part of its constitutional duty to supervise the executive branch. Indeed, for decades, the joint committee staff has examined all tax returns with multi-million-dollar refunds before the money is sent out.
If Steve Mnuchin, Trump's treasury secretary, declines to comply with the law, the courts will decide. The clear language of the statute, the congressional power to tax and its oversight duty as well as longstanding practice all make it virtually certain that Trump will fail if he tries to obstruct a Congressional investigation into his tax returns.
It won't help Trump that any litigation would likely cite Trump's twin tax fraud trials, which I discovered in 2016. Trump fabricated a business with more than $600,000 of losses and no revenue. He never produced a single receipt or check to back up the deductions, for which he was fined, but not prosecuted criminally.
Worst of all, Trump's longtime tax lawyer and accountant, Jack Mitnick, testified that while Trump's city tax return bore his photocopied signature, he had not prepared the return. There is a word for that: fraud.
What House Democrats must do is assign staff to carefully review the returns before disclosing them. If they find improper conduct, they must explain this not in the arcane language of tax experts, but it in plain English.
Focusing on simple things like the backdating of a document to escape taxes will matter. That is what revealed that showed President Richard Nixon was indeed a crook, a felony that sent his tax lawyer to prison.
The Democrats also need to avoid the mistake made by The New York Times when it dumped a powerful investigation into Trump's tax cheating in the last century, a 14,000-word expose that few people read fully. Instead, the House should hold public hearings exposing the facts Trump wants to hide. And they had best do it over many days so that voters can absorb the information.
By subpoenaing witnesses, including Trump aides and even state and federal tax auditors, hearings can turn the fine details of tax forms into a human story that resonates with voters.

Stocks surge as Fed chief signals flexibility

Texto completo: Stocks surged Friday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the central bank's approach to monetary policy would remain flexible in the face of market turbulence and signs that the global economy is slowing.
The S&P 500 rose more than 3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite was up more than 4 percent. Stocks were already higher before Powell's comments, after Labor Department figures showed robust gains in hiring, but the rally picked up speed as he spoke Friday morning.
The Fed's plans for future interest rate increases have become a critical concern for investors as stocks have stumbled in recent months. Markets slumped last month after the central bank raised rates and policymakers suggested it would continue on a course of tightening its monetary policy.
Powell, acknowledging the market's concerns that rising interest rates would dampen the economy, said the central bank could adjust its plans if conditions warrant.
Even before his remarks, stocks had been higher following gains in Europe and parts of Asia overnight. One notable exception among global markets was Japan, where shares fell in the first trading day of the new year.
Friday's gains came a punishing day Thursday, driven in part by news that Apple was reducing its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years.
Stock investors have been looking for fresh evidence about the state of the economy, and Friday they got a sign that it remains in good health. Employers in the United States added 312,000 jobs last month, well above Wall Street's expectations and the biggest monthly gain since February.
The faint prospect that China and the United States were inching toward a resolution of their trade war also helped lift markets. China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that Jeffrey Gerrish, the deputy U.S. trade representative, would lead a delegation to Beijing for trade talks next week.
One of the biggest concerns for investors is how much the trade dispute between China and the United States will dent global growth. The meeting next week would be the first between the two sides since President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping called a 90-day truce in December.
China also took steps to bolster its economy Friday. The People's Bank of China said it would cut the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves against bad times, essentially freeing up about $218 billion.
Reflecting Friday's optimistic tone, crude oil prices rose. The American benchmark for oil prices climbed above $48 a barrel.
The wealth management units of several global banks began circulating notes encouraging clients not to panic and highlighting "silver linings" and buying opportunities amid a rout that dragged markets around the world into negative territory last year.
"There are plenty of looming concerns for investors, from the U.S. government shutdown and vexed trade talks with China, to the potential impact on consumer and business confidence from the recent market volatility," analysts at the Swiss bank UBS wrote in a note.
"However," the note continued, "we think markets can rebound and hold an overweight to global stocks." - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden described himself as the Democratic Party's best bet to beat President Trump in 2020, according to a report.

“If you can persuade me there is somebody better who can win, I’m happy not to do it. But I don’t see the candidate who can clearly do what has to be done to win," Biden told a Democratic confidant, the New York Times reported on Sunday. "But I don’t see the candidate who can clearly do what has to be done to win," he added.

Biden, who last month described himself as the "most qualified person in the country to be president," is poised to announce whether he'll seek his party's nomination in 2020 by the end of January due to mounting pressure from Democratic donors urging him not to drag out his decision-making process like he did in 2016, according to the Times. Biden advisers told the paper the former vice president and senator, who bowed out of contention four years ago because of his son Beau's death, would likely run on a platform that touts his liberal policy priorities and Washington experience.

Vanity Fair reported in December that Biden was upset former President Barack Obama, with whom he served in the White House, was meeting with other 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Biden's spokesman Bill Russo dismissed the story's description as "unequivocally false. Period."

TSA agents call in sick as closure drags on

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

On Jan. 9 at 7 p.m., journalist Christopher Noxon will discuss his book, "Good Trouble: Lessons from the Civil Rights Playbook," which looks back at historic events from the civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s that offer valuable insights for contemporary activists and supporters. The book, which has pen-and-watercolor illustrations, revisits such events as the Montgomery bus boycott and the Greensboro lunch counter sit-ins and such civil rights icons as Rosa Parks and Bayard Rustin. Noxon has written for major publications such as the New Yorker, New York Times Magazine, Atlantic and Salon.
On Jan. 12 at 5 p.m. Keith Scribner will discuss his novel, "Old Newgate Road." Set in the tobacco-growing area of northern Connecticut, it involves Cole Callahan, who returns after 30 years to the home in East Granby where his father murdered his mother and finds the old man, now freed from prison and suffering from dementia. Complicating his life further is Cole's teenage son, who is in trouble with the law, and the presence of his estranged wife, boyhood sweetheart and a long-ago enemy. Can they face their difficult history and try to create a better future? Scribner grew up in New York and East Granby and has published other novels. He teaches at Oregon State University.

Texto completo: The first third of the new year promises a slew of thrilling new books that are penned by Southern-based authors or take place in the South.Among the offerings are sober examinations of climate change and last year's school shooting in Florida; memoirs about a literary friendship gone awry and life as a fake violinist; and several debut novels whose protagonists include a 19th-century charlatan from North Georgia and an atheist poet running a Christian writing school on the Gulf Coast. Here are 10 books we're looking forward to in 2019.
'Bluff City'
Ernest Withers was an African-American photographer in Memphis, Tenn., whose pictures captured historic moments from the civil rights movement.Withers photographed the Emmett Till murder trial, the Montgomery bus boycott, the rise of Martin Luther King Jr. and the emergence of the Black Power movement. He was also an FBI informant, who fed intelligence to the government about the civil rights movement's inner workings. Preston Lauterbach's book, subtitled "The Secret Life of Photographer Ernest Withers," explores who Withers was and what motivated his duplicitous actions. (Norton, January)
'Unmarriageable'
The early buzz is gaining momentum for Atlanta author Soniah Kamal's second novel, "Unmarriageable." The contemporary retelling of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" takes delight in exploring the parallels between the mores of Regency England and modern-day Pakistan. Alys is an English literature instructor who teaches Jane Austen to her high school students, many of whom she knows will drop out of school to marry before receiving a degree. At a lavish wedding in their backwater town of Dilipabad, Pakistan, Alys meets and takes an instant dislike to Valentine Dar-see. But over the course of the dayslong festivities, she begins to see a different side of him. (Penguin Random House, January)
'Sugar Run'
New beginnings and the forces that try to derail them are at the center of Mesha Maren's debut novel. "Sugar Run" begins with Jodi McCarty's release from prison for manslaughter. Having gone in at age 17, she's spent more of her life inside prison than out. Before she can return to her home in rural West Virginia, she has to take a side trip on a Greyhound bus to make amends. En route she meets Miranda, a young mother living in a motel and in need of rescue. Together they return to the Appalachian Mountains where Jodi's life first ran off the rails and where those who know her are hard-pressed to forget her past. (Algonquin Books, January)
'Parkland'
Published 10 years after the event, Dave Cullen's book "Columbine" changed what everybody thought they knew about the 1999 mass shooting at a high school in Colorado. The book focused on the two teenage gunmen and their families, and it explored the reasons why they committed such a heinous act. In his new book "Parkland," which publishes a year after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida, Cullen focuses on the student survivors who turned activists and transformed the tragedy into an organized and passionate call to action to stop gun violence. Where "Columbine"opened up a window into the mind of a psychopath, "Parkland" offers much-needed hope for the future. (HarperCollins, February)
'Sounds Like Titanic' Appalachian author Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman grew up wanting to be a violinist. Although she took lessons throughout her youth, she wasn't good enough to make her college orchestra. So imagine her surprise when she lands a job playing with a famous orchestra in New York City and begins touring the country. Imagine her further surprise when she performs in front of an unplugged microphone while concert halls are filled with the sound of recorded music of "original compositions" eerily similar to the "Titanic" soundtrack. This humorous and insightful memoir explores how fake has become the new reality in contemporary culture, and how Hindman's charade affected her view of herself and the world. (Norton, February)
'The Lost Prince: A Search for Pat Conroy'
Anyone who has lost a friend can relate to this compassionate but
no-holds-barred memoir by Michael Mewshaw about his complicated relationship with Pat Conroy. A prolific writer of
fictionand nonfiction, Mewshaw met Conroy in the 1980s when they were ex-pats in Rome. The book chronicles their decadeslong friendship, including their various literary projects, their daily phone conversations and their frequent family vacations. It also touches on troubling aspects of Conroy's personality, including his alcohol abuse, his estrangement from his daughter and his suicide threats. After enlisting Mewshaw to help him get out of a jam with his soon-to-be ex-wife, Conroy ghosts his friend more or less for good, leaving Mewshaw to try to figure out what went wrong. (Counterpoint Press, February)
'The Care and Feeding of
Ravenously Hungry Girls'
When the mother of four children dies, it's up to Althea, the oldest child, to raise her sisters and brother in small-town Michigan. Schooled on the responsibilities of adulthood at a young age, Althea grows up to become a pillar of her community, along with husband Proctor, with whom she runs a struggling restaurant and a charity that benefits local flood victims. But when the couple is arrested for fraud, turned in by their own daughter, the extended family comes undone. Told in alternating chapters from the perspectives of the three sisters -- Althea, Lillian and Violet -- this debut novel by Anissa Gray, an Atlanta-based journalist at CNN Worldwide, examines the changing dynamics of a family under pressure. (Penguin Random House, February)
'The Magnetic Girl'
Atlanta author and Oglethorpe faculty member Jessica Handler is best known for her memoir "Invisible Sisters" and the instructional writing guide "Braving the Fire," both of which deal with grief. But "The Magnetic Girl" marks her first foray into fiction. Inspired by true accounts, the historical novel is about Lulu Hurst, an all-but-forgotten woman from North Georgia who toured the Eastern Seaboard in the late 19th century entertaining audiences with her purported ability to conduct a current of electricity -- a newfangled discovery at the time -- with the touch of her hand. The real sparks fly, though, when Lulu begins to chafe against her stage father's control. (Hub City Press, April) 'The Gulf'
Like "Sounds Like Titanic," Belle Boggs' debut novel "The Gulf " explores a life of fakery through the eyes of struggling poet Marianne, a liberal atheist who takes a job running a for-profit writing program for Christians held in a motel on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Complications ensue when Marianne grows close to her students and shady investors begin making demands on the Genesis Inspirational Writing Ranch. Tensions come to a head as a hurricane bears down on the motley crew of writers and instructors in this humorous and empathetic exploration of what separates believers and nonbelievers. (Graywolf Press, April)
'Losing Earth' Nathaniel Rich's exploration of the scientists and politicians who turned revelations about climate change into a campaign for change during the '80s, and the missed opportunities to turn things around, began as an article for The New York Times Magazine, which devoted the entire issue to the topic. In this sobering book, subtitled "A Recent History," the New Orleans-based writer expands on his ideas, including explorations of the climate change denial movement and the oil industry's role in thwarting policy change. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, April)

They're ready to talk about more than likability

Texto completo: Earlier this week, two things happened. Elizabeth Warren announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee. And Tiffany Haddish failed to be funny onstage in Florida.
In both cases, the narrative became less about these women doing their jobs, and more about their likability. Because when you are a girl or a woman, it's all about being liked.
Within hours of Warren's announcement, Politico was picking apart her chances of escaping the stigmas that plagued Hillary Clinton, “written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground."
And Haddish, known for her catchphrase “She Ready," became a #shenotready hashtag.
She bombed her New Year's Eve set at the James L. Knight Center in Miami. She was hungover and flubbed. Paying customers have the right to be disappointed over a bad show. They deserve a refund. The comedian herself admitted she flopped, tweeting, “I wish it was better Miami. I prayed on it and I have a strong feeling this will never happened (sic) again."
But people piled on with delight over her failure. The schadenfreude was real. A video of a man in the audience heckling her performance has been viewed more than 2.6 million times and has 11,000 likes.
In comments under her pictures on Instagram and all over Twitter, Haddish has been called trash. And then came a debate about liking her and whether disliking her meant you hate black women — a debate that has plagued her career, as she is often sadly critiqued for being “loud and ghetto."
Sigh. How is this not the story of one bad night? Comedians bomb sometimes. Dave Chappelle got booed off stage in Detroit in 2015 and went on to stage a major critically acclaimed comeback.
Haddish partied too hard, got it wrong, and people are enjoying her fall.
“Saturday Night Live" comic Pete Davidson, playing sets in Medford and Boston on Monday, told his fans he'd taken weed and shrooms before the show. The New York Times described Davidson's performance as “rough and raucous stand-up" that started off “slow and discursive" before he eventually found his stride. Davidson has a high-profile struggle with depression and online trolling. This time, his audience gave him the grace to get it together. He deserved it.
Haddish was fed to the online wolves.
Women are defined based on whether they please the people. We should talk about Elizabeth Warren's policies. We should talk about her powerhouse fund-raising. We should talk about her populism. We should talk about her problematic DNA test.
But are we really going to talk about whether a second-term senator is likable enough to be president? Not her diplomacy, but her aloofness?
Her achievements might be the very root of the backlash.
“When women are successful in male-dominated fields, they are deemed less likable," says Sarah Sobieraj, associate professor of sociology at Tufts University. “The very fact that they are successful or knowledgable is what makes them less likable."
On Wednesday morning, Jess McIntosh, former Hillary Clinton outreach coordinator, told CNN the likability narrative is a sexist practice.
“In the very beginning, as we just start to see women candidates coming through, I want to be cautious that we don't fall into the sexist trap of talking about their likability exclusively," she said. “It's not about running for prom queen, it's about running for president, and we need to make sure we are treating the women in the race the same as the men."
There's inequity in how we view men, women, and likability when President Trump is trying to bully the nation into building a wall by shutting down the government and Louis C.K. is still performing.
“Women are expected to be sweet and nurturing and considerate of others," Sobieraj says. “So when women act or behave in a competitive or assertive or authoritative way, it is read as deviant."
Maybe our need to define women by how cool or nice or pleasant they are is why Warren felt the need to chug a beer on Instagram Monday night. “It's one more way to be able just to invite people into your home," she said. But critics called her desperate.
Author and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie had it right in her 2017 book, “Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions."
“Teach her to reject likability," Adichie wrote. “Her job is not to make herself likeable, her job is to be her full self, a self that is honest and aware of the equal humanity of other people."
Like it or not, women are letting go of the likability politics and stepping into their power.

How the Games Begin

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
Most people are surprised when I tell them I work as a game designer at The New York Times. I usually get one of two responses: "The Times makes games?" or "What is a game designer?"
Ask 10 people to define "game," and you'll walk away with 10 definitions. It's easiest to think of a game as a form of structured conflict. Players enter into an unspoken contract, with a system of rules governing their behavior and shaping their objectives. If you and I decide to play a pickup game of basketball, we're agreeing to participate in a contest to throw a ball through a hoop the most times. When the game concludes, a winner is declared -- and the pursuit of that title is where the real magic of games happens. Winning a game is meaningless outside the context of that game, but within the game it drives players to find unique and fascinating ways to overcome and subvert the rules in the name of victory.
I've been working on picking apart and understanding games for the last decade. I started out creating text adventures and weird versions of Tetris in my undergraduate computer science program. After college, I worked as a web developer and made HTML5 games on the side. Finally, I attended the N.Y.U. Game Center, where I earned an M.F.A. in game design, making a ton of games with different game designers, artists and institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Making games is difficult in part because it is so hard to predict the rules and interactions that will be most satisfying. Some special part of the brain switches on when you play a game, and the particular blend of information and constraint that will light it up is hard to anticipate. As a result, the most reliable way to create good games is to create a prototype of a game idea and put it in front of some helpful play testers to see what sticks. Then iterate and repeat, cutting distracting elements and embellishing fun features.
Running this gradual process of prototyping and iterating rule sets is the primary responsibility of a game designer, but the job is multidisciplinary in surprising ways. At times I act as a lawyer, crafting the laws of the game and ensuring they interact in a meaningful and satisfying way. At others I'm an anthropologist, studying what players value and what practices or rituals define their relationship with a game. I also think like a psychologist, trying to understand which specific rules and interactions tickle that cognitive sweet spot in the mind that leads the user to the best experience.
So how do I bring this process to the same institution that houses the famed Times Crossword?
First, our team brainstorms a variety of puzzle and game ideas. We discuss them as a group, drawing rough mock-ups and comparing them with existing games before voting on which ones we like best. Smaller teams develop the most popular ideas. We create a paper prototype, a quick, basic version of the game, and run around The New York Times Building asking people to play-test it. With each play test, we look to see which components of the game players struggle with and which components engage them. (Often, they are parts we don't expect. One time users were so fascinated by a mechanic they ignored part of the tutorial.) Then we modify the game by rewording the rules, changing the layout or even changing the objective before testing it again with a different set of play testers.
We play-test with as many people as possible to get a variety of perspectives. Employees at The Times are genuinely excited to play games and give polite but candid feedback. We factor each opinion in as we plan the next iteration, paying attention to what is not said as much as what is said. It's an exhausting process, but a consistently rewarding one.
Once we are satisfied with our prototype, we create a digital version and enlist an internal group of players to test it for us, following the same process of getting feedback and iterating. After about a month of testing and iterating, we test the game on nytimes.com, measuring which games get traction and which ones fall flat. Word games like Letter Boxed, where players connect letters to form chains of words, have done well. Meanwhile, our physics puzzler Gravity Golf, a game focused on guiding a golf ball using gravity and Rube Goldberg-esque obstacles, wasn't a hit.
Examining our games, we have found the Times readership to represent a wide range of tastes in amusements. The one shared characteristic is a deep intellectualism and curiosity about the world. Puzzles with a focus on language and logic tend to do best. (There's a reason everyone loves the crossword!)
Making games is a long, laborious process, but it's worth it when we see the joy we bring to people's lives. Hopefully, the games and puzzles we create serve as a welcome diversion from the trials and pressures of real life -- and the serious topics that occupy so many of my colleagues at The Times.

Texto completo: In a rush of new appointments before Tuesdays inauguration, Florida Gov.-elect Ron DeSantis tapped his selections to lead two agencies with troubled recent histories: the Department of Children and Families and the Department of Corrections.

DeSantis appointed Mark Inch, 58, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and a retired two-star Army general to lead the Department of Corrections. To lead the Department of Children and Families, DeSantis appointed Chad Poppell, 45. A former secretary of the states support agency, Department of Management Services, Poppell has experience in state and local government but little in child welfare. He also served as chief of staff in the states employment agency, the Department of Economic Opportunity.

Inchs appointment marks the first major hire of an agency head who hails from outside Florida. DeSantis transition team had previously said they were recruiting out-of-state, but the only picks that had been previously announced were of Florida public officials, lobbyists or business people.

Inchs time as chief of the federal Department of Justices prison arm was brief. He was appointed by then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in August 2017, then resigned unexpectedly in May 2018.

The New York Times later reported that Inch told Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein he was tired of the administration flouting departmental norms. And he felt that Sessions largely excluded him from major staffing, budget and policy decisions, according to the Times, in addition to being caught in an ideological war between Sessions and President Donald Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who vehemently disagreed on criminal justice reform.

Inch supports the First Step Act, a bill pending in Congress that seeks to shorten some federal drug sentences and reduce the likelihood inmates end up back behind bars.

During his career in the Army, Inch was the commanding general of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 in Kabul, Afghanistan, according to the transition teams announcement, and he advised senior Army officials on policing, rule of law and detainee operations.

In replacing Julie Jones, Inch takes over an agency that oversees 49 prisons and a $2.4 billion budget with 24,000 positions. Recently, the system has seen a rise in inmate deaths and struggled with a budget deficit that has led to a shortage in guards.

Poppell takes over another struggling agency, the Department of Children and Families. Its been led by interim secretary Rebecca Kapusta since September and in recent years has struggled to retain its leaders. Before former secretary Mike Carroll stepped down last fall, he had been the third leader in a year to take over DCFs reins when he was tapped for the role in 2014.

That year, a Miami Herald investigation had detailed the deaths of 477 children since 2008, even though their families had dealt with the agency in the past. During Carrolls four-year tenure, the agency continued to deal with several high-profile cases, particularly those involving the deaths of vulnerable children.

In addition to stints with state agencies, Poppell also worked as director of employee services at JEA, Jacksonvilles public electric water and sewer utility, and the city of Jacksonvilles chief of human resources, according to a press release from DeSantis transition team.

After he resigned from DMS in 2017, he joined IBM, and according to state records, registered to lobby the executive branch in 2017 and 2018 for the company.

IBM has gotten several contracts with DCF in the past few years, largely for database management system software, according to a state database of contracts with agencies.

The largest contract, which dates back to 2012 for a total of more than $90 million, tasks IBM with providing ongoing maintenance and operations of the Florida Safe Families Network system, a web application hosted in the agencys intranet, as well as other project work.

Do Democrats have magic number?

Texto completo: As the new year turns and Democrats focus on candidates to oppose President Donald Trump in 2020, there’s one number they should keep in mind: 47. Here’s why. Since the end of World War II, Democrats have elected only four presidents who did not hold the office already: John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.
Those four successful Democrats share many traits, but one of the most striking is their age on the day they were elected. They range from Kennedy, 43, to Carter, 52, but their average was — yes — 47. In fact, that was Obama’s exact age when he defeated 72-year-old John McCain. Of course, age is a very rough metric, but looking at the emerging field of Democratic aspirants, one impression is unmistakable. The potential candidate who best fits the profile of Democratic winners is Beto O’Rourke, the three-time congressman from El Paso, Texas, who narrowly lost a Senate race in November. On Election Day 2020, he will be 48.
A closer look at the four victorious post-war Democrats shows that their age was really a symbol for a much larger issue. Their youth helped shape their narratives, the stories they told voters about their past experiences and their plans for the future. Kennedy spearheaded the wave of returning World War II veterans who entered politics and assumed the leadership of the country. Carter was not a harbinger of a new generation, but as a naval officer-turned-peanut farmer, and then as a governor who had never served in the capitol, he represented a clean break from the "swamp" of post-Watergate Washington. Clinton was the first baby boomer president who talked about "building a bridge to the 21st century" and played on the name of his hometown in Arkansas when he told the Democratic convention in 1992, "I still believe in a place called Hope." Thirteen years before he was elected president, Barack Obama published a best-selling memoir, "Dreams From My Father," which told a new version of an old American story: a biracial child overcoming adversity and achieving success through his own merit and motivation.
Obama has met with O’Rourke since the election, and in an interview with his close adviser David Axelrod, the former president praised the defeated congressman as an "impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas."
Obama even drew parallels between himself and O’Rourke. He won in 2008, Obama told Axelrod, because "people had a sense that I said what I meant," and he discerned the same attempt to level with voters in the Texan’s failed campaign: "What I liked most about his race was that it didn’t feel constantly poll-tested."
Two New York Times political writers see another parallel between the two men. "Like Mr. Obama as he entered the 2008 campaign," wrote Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin, "Mr. O’Rourke can be difficult to place on an ideological spectrum, allowing supporters to project their own politics onto a messaging palette of national unity and common ground."
This is all very premature. O’Rourke might not even run for president. But if he does, remember the magic number is 47.

'Don't blame me' a common refrain when leaving WH

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – One by one they leap – or are pushed – from the foundering USS Trump, each offering a variation of the same plea: Don't blame me.
Comes now retired Gen. John Kelly, the second of President Trump's chiefs of staff to be discarded. Days before departing, he paused for a two-hour telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times. It was an extended exercise in self-absolution.
Don't blame him for Trump's border-wall obsession. "To be honest, it's not a wall," Kelly disclosed, insisting "we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration." (A day after the interview was published, Trump tweeted: "An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED.")
Don't blame Kelly for Trump's fabricated "crisis" at the southern border. "If you want to stop illegal immigration, stop U.S. demand for drugs and expand economic opportunity" in Central America, Kelly proposed.
Don't blame him for Trump's claims that Hispanic immigrants spread violence and drugs. "Illegal immigrants, overwhelmingly, are not bad people," Kelly said.
And don't blame him for the travel ban or the family separation policies, either. Rather, he, argued, he should be judged for what Trump didn't do: withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan (which he's doing now), pull troops out of South Korea or withdraw from NATO (which remain uncertain).
Kelly served his country honorably for decades. But there's nothing courageous in announcing, on the way out the door, that he didn't agree with many awful things Trump did on his watch. There was, once, a good argument that qualified people, by taking administration jobs, could temper Trump's worst instincts. But it turned out Trump was not to be tempered.
Those who disagreed with the madness had an obligation to resign, or at least to speak out – not to wash their hands of responsibility after the fact.
The self-absolution extends into the diaspora of Trump apologists. Departing House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., gave a farewell speech denouncing the use of social media to "play on anger" and "on people's fears." Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, in defeat, denounced Trump for operating with "no real relationships, just convenient transactions."
Better late than never? Perhaps. Those taking parting shots are certainly more honorable than those who, with non-disparagement agreements, get paid to defend Trump on the airwaves. The post-employment critics also compare favorably with Mick Mulvaney, who called Trump a "terrible human being" before becoming Trump's budget director and now acting chief of staff.
But the after-the-fact criticism seems self-serving – a way for Trump enablers to rebuild their reputations and find new jobs. Tucker Carlson, an unstinting Trump booster, used the anonymity of a German-language weekly to put on the record that he questions Trump's competence, knowledge, self-aggrandizement and personnel choices.
Even Carlson, though, is braver than the anonymous Trump official who wrote The New York Times op-ed about efforts to sabotage Trump from within. How long before the author emerges to claim credit – and perhaps a book contract? Proposed title: Don't blame me.

Commentary: What I learned on my Mormon social media fast

Texto completo: I’m back.
You may not have noticed I was missing, but I certainly noticed you were missing: all my friends on social media. I gave you up over the Christmas break.
It wasn’t totally my choice; I was trying to be an obedient Mormon. (I mean, an obedient member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Sigh.) At the October General Conference, church President Russell Nelson asked all the women of the church to give up social media for 10 days.
I have a job — a couple of them, actually — so it was not possible for me to do what some of the hyper-orthodox women around me did immediately, which was to sign off their Facebook accounts. I use social media as part of my work, as well as for fun and connection, so I waited until the holidays, when I was planning a rest from my regular work anyway.
Part of me was looking forward to it. I’ve taken retreats from social media before and found them helpful, and I particularly appreciated the openness with which Nelson framed the challenge — the “what do you notice?” aspect of the invitation:
“I invite you to participate in a 10-day fast from social media and from any other media that bring negative and impure thoughts to your mind. Pray to know which influences to remove during your fast. The effect of your 10-day fast may surprise you. What do you notice after taking a break from perspectives of the world that have been wounding your spirit? Is there a change in where you now want to spend your time and energy? Have any of your priorities shifted—even just a little? I urge you to record and follow through with each impression.”
In other church talks about social media, leaders have emphasized the need to remove ourselves from media that inspire us to envy other people, or be discontented with our own lives — witness the Pinterest-driven craziness that we have to have that particular paint color or life is just not worth living.
Pinterest envy is frankly not my issue, so that kind of rationale has never been terribly compelling for me. So I’m grateful that Nelson didn’t trot out that rather hackneyed reason, though I’m sure it’s helpful for other people.
What he promised about being surprised did turn out to be true in my case: I was surprised by two things over the past 10 days of virtual silence.
First, I hadn’t realized how much I needed a respite from moral outrage. Over the years, social media has morphed for me into one of the primary ways I consume the news. I’ll see a link to a breaking news story on Twitter and click on it, or read a Facebook friend’s repost of a New York Times editorial about the latest insanity from the Trump administration.
How many times a day do I do this? Before my fast, I would have told you that I probably encountered the news this way three or four times a day. Now I realize it is much, much more often — and that it is far more toxic to my mental and emotional health than I would have admitted to myself. We’re living in an abnormal administration that thrives on chaos and discord. What I need to figure out now is how much I contribute to that by repeatedly clicking on the latest scandal or crime.
Where, I now wonder, is the line between being an informed citizen — which is more important now than ever — and being a person who perpetuates anger 24/7? How can I stay vigilant without letting the news, as Nelson put it, wound my spirit?
So that’s the first lesson of my social media fast. The second is that I need and love social media, because I need and love my friends. This was especially true during this holiday season, when so, so many things broke or went wrong. Someday I’m sure my family will look back on the last week and a half and laugh at all of the enduring stories the holidays provided us — things like broken teeth (not once but twice!) that required emergency dentistry when every dentist in Ohio was out of the office, or broken cars (not one but two!) that stymied even my unflappable Mr.-Fix-It husband, or planned home renovations that were DOA because the company sent the wrong parts and couldn’t remedy it until the new year.
Nearly every day, I recorded in my journal what broke or went south that particular day. Suffice it to say it was not my favorite holiday season. And it wasn’t the kind that you can point to and say, “Oh, that Christmas was awful because my loved one was dying” or something equally compassion-worthy and understandable. It just sucked us all dry, this endless series of first-world problems that, when taken alone, might have been funny. But coming in a regular litany, they ground us down a little more each day.
And it was made worse and more isolating by the absence of social media. I missed seeing the adorable Christmas morning pics of my friends’ children opening their presents, and knowing how they were spending their New Year’s Eves. I missed the rough stuff, too, like hearing from friends who’ve lost parents this year about how they were coping in this first holiday.
I just missed their voices, the love and the pain, the ups and the downs. All of it.
I found that I need my people. And that was a lovely realization worth fasting for.

Texto completo: The new year is only two days old. But for Apple, it's possible that 2019 could end up being one of its longest years in recent history, with ominous portents for the rest of the tech industry.
On Wednesday, the Cupertino tech titan cut its revenue forecast for its just-completed fiscal first quarter. It was a nearly unheard-of move for a company whose profits in recent years have been the envy of the world.
In a letter to shareholders posted on the company's investor relations site, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company expects sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 29 to come in at $84 billion, compared with an earlier outlook for sales in a range of $89 billion to $93 billion and he pointed to the uncertain Chinese market as the culprit.
"While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China," Cook said in a letter to investors. "We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States."
Apple's surprise announcement is almost certain to reverberate in the broader tech industry, adding to concerns about the ability of American companies to navigate an increasingly uncertain economy amid the Trump administration's aggressive stance on trade with China and other nations.
For Apple, the impact of the trade war quickly became palpable: Not only will the company's sales end up being below its prior outlook, its revenue also is expected to fall almost 5 percent from the $88.3 billion it reported in last year's fiscal first quarter.
"Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline," Cook said in his shareholder letter.
The new forecast was all Wall Street needed to turn on Apple, as investors drove the company's shares down by more than 7 percent, to $146.10, in after-hours trading. Along with Wednesday's after-market losses, Apple shares have fallen by more than 15 percent over the past year.
Tim Bajarin, president of tech consultancy Creative Strategies, said that what Apple is seeing is a reflection of the state of the world economy and a maturing market for what has for years been a hot consumer product.
"China's worsening economy was bound to impact Apple and most of the smartphone companies as demand for smartphones (was) down across the board," he said. "Smartphone demand around the world has reached a peak, and it will be harder and harder for all smartphone companies to adjust to this new normal and create products that will still gain serious consumer demand."
Apple has a history of giving quarterly revenue outlooks that are slightly less than analysts' forecasts, then exceeding those estimates with its quarterly results.
But cutting a sales outlook for a business period that has just ended, and ahead of its upcoming quarterly results, is something completely foreign to Apple since before the iPod took off and set Apple on the path to where, in August, it became the first American company to reach a market valuation of $1 trillion.
"This will be the most defining moment in Cook's career," said Dan Ives, director of technology research at Wedbush Securities. "This was a major black eye for Apple as the China growth story crumbled this quarter, and it seems Cook and company were caught flat-footed."
Comments from Cook were likely to add to speculation that Apple's latest batch of new iPhones the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR are meeting with less-than-spectacular sales. The iPhone XS Max, for instance, starts at $1,099, while the iPhone XS has an initial price tag of $999. The iPhone XR starts out as a relatively inexpensive $749.
"In some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be," Cook said.
In November, Apple made investors nervous about iPhone sales, in particular, when the company said that it would no longer give quarterly unit-sales figures for iPhones, as well as iPads and Mac computers.
As part of an effort to spur iPhone sales, the company is currently running a promotion in which iPhone owners can trade in their current phones and get an iPhone XR starting at $449, or an iPhone XS from $699.

Texto completo: Manhattan: Voicer Carmel Harrigan blames the
federal government shutdown on the Democrats
when it is Trump who has caused it. Although he's
been President for two years, Trump still doesn't
have a clue as to howour government works, or is
supposed to. Contrary to his beliefs, it is a democracy and not a
dictatorship. For most things that he wants, the President still
needs to get majority approval fromCongress. Anyone, including
Trump, who doesn't understand this basic concept of how
our government works should read the Constitution.
Unilaterally demanding $5 billion for a wall (one which
most people believe is not the solution to our illegal immigration
problem) and threatening to shut down the federal government
if he doesn't get it is extortion and extremely petulant,
childish behavior. Apparently, it's either Trump's way or
the highway. If he doesn't get what he wants, the government
shuts down and it is the Democrats' fault. Is this howwe operate
now? Besides, what happened to Trump's campaign
promise thatMexico would pay for it?
Chana Schwartz
Driven over the edge
Staten Island: The Op-Ed by Javier H. Valdes and Deborah Axt ("What Gov. Cuomo owes immigrants," Dec. 31) basically demanded that those people who now live in New York after having violated the immigration laws of this country (the so-called "undocumented") should be rewarded for their crimes with driver's licenses, in-state tuition and protected housing. Why stop there? For example, there should be reserved seats on trains and buses solely for the hard-working immigrants on their way to and from laboring in the fields of New York City's many farms. How about traffic lanes exclusively for the undocumented, although this can wait until they have their licenses and (chortle) insurance? And let's give them the right to own guns, too. The FBI said more than 3,000 applications to buy firearms were denied in 2017 because they were filed by the undocumented. We can, we should, we must protect these future Democratic voters.
Robert S. Byer
Poor and poorer
Camp Hill, Ala.: As Errol Louis advocates, the state Legislature must abolish the practice of suspending driver's licenses for unpaid fees or fines, especially when the defendant's inability to pay is verified (" 'Cruel and counterproductive,' " column, Jan. 1). A 2016 case, Stinnie v. Holcomb, prohibits punishing a person because of their poverty. Lady Justice's indispensable symbol in New York: her cash register.

Turn the page
Manhattan: I happen to enjoy the Daily News. Voicer Frank Barnet's remarks that "the editors and reporters get up in the morning and start searching for any negative report they can print about Trump" made me laugh. If this is what he thinks, I feel very sorry for him. All anyone has to do is turn on any news in the morning, and they find out what is happening, and frequently it's about Donald Trump. Turn on your TV or radio, or pick up any newspaper. Pick up the New York Times or the Post if you don't like the Daily News.
Gary C. Marshall
Real news
Manhattan: To Voicer Frank Barnet: You say you stopped reading the Daily News due to negative articles about Trump. Well, sir, The News is only reporting the ugly reality. Pray tell, where on Earth did you find any newspaper with something positive to say about the President? Even conservative media have a hard time finding anything great to say about this psychologically unfit tweeter-in-chief. Despite Trump's cry of "fake news," the media reports the facts; some may slant left, others may slant right, but facts are facts. Trump is his own worst enemy. His words and actions, not a biased media, are the basis of negative press.
Pamela Carter
Listen up, Andrew
Danbury, Conn.: If Gov. Cuomo is thinking about running for President in 2020, he must learn how to speak. It is impossible to listen to him deliver a speech. He yells and then yells some more. He should go back to listen to how his father spoke. Listen to the rhythm and cadence of Mario Cuomo's sentences and how he was forceful without yelling. Andrew Cuomo could even try listening to Obama for his style. Cuomo is a definite no until he learns how to communicate from the big stage.
Rich Glehan
No thanks, Cardinal
Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.: I take offense at the sanctimonious drivel from Timothy Cardinal Dolan ("Speed aid to abuse survivors," Dec. 31). Hypocrisy is easy: All you need to do is tell people what they want to hear. Dolan's expertise in that arena is unquestioned. Sometime after arriving in New York, he visited one of the only parishes in the U.S. to have back-to-back pastors removed for clergy abuse, Holy Name of Mary in Croton-on-Hudson. His purpose was to rededicate a new altar. Did he reach out to any of the victims or their families from this parish? No! So much for his crocodile tears about speeding aid to victims. Though the Compensation Review Board, which Dolan affirms has paid out over $200 million, sounds great, its sole purpose was to take victims out of the pool of potential lawsuits should the Child Victims Act be passed with a backward-looking window. It has nothing to do with helping victims of clergy abuse. It is all about one thing: saving money. Every victim they pay is one less they will have to face in court if the Legislature opens a window for survivors. The board was strictly a business decision to save the church money and that makes Dolan a hypocrite of the first order by professing his concern for survivors.
Vinnie Nauheimer
Fools' paradise
Calverton, L.I.: About 42% of millennials in America believe in socialism, and are clueless that socialism has been an unremitting evil in 40 countries where it has been tried. It does not lead to a higher existence or stateless utopia, but has proven to lead to a bottomless pit of immorality, persecution, poverty, starvation and death. When we look at the facts of the last century, we see that wherever socialism has been tried, it is predicated on destroying free markets, represented democracy and republicanism, and the heritage of Judeo-Christian civilization. Socialism is based on a false view of human nature, history, labor, property, economic value, capital and the role of prices. Socialism in America promises the young free education and other freebies that attract their votes, but little do they realize that there must be an end when taxpayers can no longer foot the bill and we become just another nation of caravans looking to survive. The time is now to recognize the disastrous evil of socialism before it engulfs the minds and hearts of young voters in America who are clueless about its evil inflicted on many nations.

In Illinois, signs of intelligent life in the Democratic Party

Texto completo: If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats’ House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic: In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue — 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district’s residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district’s 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump’s approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964 — who have been America’s largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are — were; they are shuffling off stage — almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year’s midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" — people with no religion — "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats’ capture of New York’s 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November — the Democrats lost only two seats nationally — come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England. If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party — come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined — they should want to emulate Bustos’ success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family’s budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent’s disposable income. Bustos’ question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

The sinking of the side wheel steamship Mistletoe

Texto completo: Built in 1852 along the Delaware River in Chester, PA, a 153' wood hulled side wheel ship was called Mistletoe. The builder and owner are not known. Nor is the bizarre name Mistletoe. Who might have given her such a name? Could it have had anything to do with the mistletoe plant or Christmas?
Mistletoe, with a beam of 26.7', displaced 362 gross tons and was powered by a 370 horsepower engine. The ship started out as a lighthouse tender with the official number of 222226, taking supplies to and from lighthouses in the New York area. But she soon became dated – that is too slow – and was sold as a fishing boat (what we today call a head boat; people signed up and paid individually for a day of fishing). The New York Times succinctly wrote "Younger and smarter craft long ago crowded the lumbering side-wheeler out of her job."
A paddlewheel moves a steamboat. With low drafts, paddlewheelers could go far up shallow rivers, exploring and supplying areas which were just being settled. Two kinds of paddlewheelers were used: a sternwheel was more effective, but was hard to design and build. They tended to be heavy. A sidewheeler was lighter and easier to construct. They were supply boats, and could clear trees from river beds in addition to acting as railroad ferries.
The Mistletoe took people fishing off Sandy Hook and areas where fish were plentiful. On the morning of May 5, 1924, she left the Battery at 8:15am under the command of Captain Dan Gully. There were 76 people aboard, including 15 women and 6 children. By 11:30am the ship had reached her destination and enthusiastic fishermen were fishing for whiting and ling. At 12:45 according to the New York Times, "A man went down into the aft cabin to change his coat and saw smoke coming from the hold."
All passengers were ordered to the bow by Captain Gully while the crew tried to fight the flames. Buckets and hoses were used, but the ship continued to burn. A nearby steamship, Hamilton, saw the burning Mistletoe, and radioed to the police which sent out Police Boat #3. Miraculously, within a half hour, all the passengers except the crew and those who fought the fire, were rescued by nearby fishing boats.
The New York Times article headlines were emphatic:
"76 rescued in bay from blazing boat. 50 year old
Mistletoe burns to water's edge off Ambrose Light.
Small craft rush to aid. Landing party, including
15 women, at Battery and Sheepshead Bay."
They credited "fishermen who quickly mobilized their little boats into a rescue squadron" near Sandy Hook for saving everyone aboard.
The New York Times article ended with a rather tacky observation:
"William Holmes said that the only incident in
getting off the burning craft was when a woman
weighing about 300lbs, who was a passenger, fell
into his arms and nearly carried them both over
the side. With the aid of two other passengers,
she was lowered safely into the fishing boat along
side."
Still trying to fight the fire, Captain Gully almost lost his life when he was engulfed by smoke and collapsed. He was taken aboard Police Boat #3. By the time Fire Boat William Gaynor reached the Mistletoe, she had burned completely to the waterline. The loss was estimated at $50,000 by Captain Gully which, in retrospect, seems a bit high. Cause of the fire was never determined.
Today, the Mistletoe sits on the bottom in about 42' of water off East Rockaway Inlet in the area well known as Wreck Valley. It is a popular diving site, 42' deep, where divers can still see parts of the paddlewheels, the boiler, and copper sheeting which once covered the hull. The area is still an excellent place to fish, and divers can spear fish near the Mistletoe. Dan Berg, owner of Wreck Valley Charters, has seen old pictures showing passengers waiting to be rescued on the upper deck.
The Mistletoe's American flag was flying upside down. This is a distress signal.

Texto completo: President's comments on Afghanistan, Syria policy create new uncertainties
President Trump criticized former defense secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday, as acting Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan stepped into his new job and the military tried to make sense of the president's plans for the wars in Syria and Afghanistan.
Trump questioned how well Mattis had served as Pentagon chief and pointed out that the retired Marine general had been removed early from his last position as chief of U.S. Central Command over policy disagreements with the Obama administration.
"What's he done for me? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good. Not too good," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting, with Shanahan seated to his left. "I'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan, and I shouldn't be happy."
Trump added: "As you know, President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I."
Neither Mattis nor Shanahan could be reached for comment. The Pentagon did not respond to questions about Trump's remarks.
Mattis, who is beloved by many in the military, resigned Dec. 20, citing policy disagreements with the president. Mattis had said he would stay on through the end of February to provide continuity during transition to a new leader, but Trump abruptly forced him out days later. Shanahan took over Tuesday.
Trump's comments in the meeting about Syria and Afghanistan added new complications to discussions about U.S. plans in those countries.
Regarding Afghanistan, where about 14,000 troops are deployed, Trump questioned why Pakistan, India and Russia - the latter a U.S. adversary - aren't more involved, and why the U.S. military strikes both the Islamic State and the Taliban in areas where the groups are fighting each other.
"I said, 'Let them fight! They're both our enemies! Let them fight!' " Trump said. "And then they go in and end up fighting both of them. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen."
Regarding Syria, the president said that Iran can "do what they want there, frankly," contradicting warnings from other senior U.S. officials and allies including Israel, who have warned for years that Iran wants to build a military presence in Syria.
About two weeks ago, Trump ordered all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria and directed withdrawal plans be drawn up for about half the forces in Afghanistan.
Trump initially wanted all U.S. troops out of Syria within 30 days, triggering Mattis's resignation and concerns from Republicans and Democrats that the decision would create more chaos in the region. The president, in a video posted on his Twitter account Dec. 19, said U.S. troops were "all coming back" from Syria and that "they're coming back now."
The president has since softened on that approach and said Wednesday that the U.S. military will exit Syria "over a period of time." He has agreed to give the military about four months to completely depart Syria, according to three U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy discussions. That development was first reported by the New York Times.
But U.S. officials suggested Wednesday that the plan remains unclear. While Trump agreed to a 120-day timeline, military officials have cautioned that an additional month or two would allow for a smoother transition and hope to persuade the president to give them more time, the officials said.
Officials at the State Department have struggled to explain the U.S. strategy in Syria to key foreign partners invested in the conflict, given the possibility that Trump's advisers might persuade him to back off his initial withdrawal plan.
Pentagon officials, who rarely discuss troop movements before they occur, have declined to say how long a withdrawal will take.
"We are focused on a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of forces, taking all measures possible to ensure our troops' safety as they continue in their mission of an enduring defeat of ISIS," said Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman. "Out of concern for operational security, we are not going to discuss operational details."
The discussions have added tension to the ascension of Shanahan, who joined the Trump administration in 2017 with years of management experience at Boeing but no government or military experience.
Shanahan said in a statement that he has tapped David L. Norquist, an undersecretary of defense who serves as comptroller, to perform the duties of the deputy defense secretary. Norquist has served as the Defense Department's chief financial officer since mid-2017 and has "insight into virtually every tenet of this department," Shanahan said.
Shanahan said in a tweet early Wednesday evening that his top priority is ensuring the Defense Department is lethal and agile. He has met with senior leaders and his policy team, and his focus remains on the National Defense Strategy, in which Mattis last year called for the Pentagon to prepare for threats posed by adversaries such as Russia and China, he wrote.
With Mattis gone, one of his planned moves - bringing in Marine Maj. Gen. Burke W. Whitman to serve as a new senior spokesman - will not happen. Whitman was expected to brief the media in 2019 alongside chief Pentagon spokeswoman Dana W. White, who abruptly resigned on New Year's Eve as Mattis left the Pentagon. White is under investigation by the Defense Department inspector general amid accusations that she directed subordinate staff members carry out menial tasks for her.
In the Pentagon's history, there have been two previous acting defense secretaries: William P. Clements Jr. and William Howard Taft IV. Clements held the post for 39 days in 1973 after President Richard M. Nixon appointed Defense Secretary Elliot Richardson as attorney general, and Taft led the Pentagon for 60 days as the Senate rejected President George H.W. Bush's first Pentagon chief nominee, John Tower, amid allegations of womanizing and alcohol abuse.
Trump said in a visit to Iraq last month that "everybody and his uncle" and "everybody and his aunt" has interest in becoming defense secretary, but he added that Shanahan "could be there for a long time." The president did not say whether he meant in an acting capacity.
While serving as acting Pentagon chief, Shanahan will have the full authorities the job includes, said Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine major general who helped write the Goldwater-Nichols Act that guides civilian control of the military. However, the framers of the law did not anticipate that someone would serve as acting defense secretary indefinitely without Senate confirmation, he said.
Punaro called Norquist a good choice to take on deputy defense secretary duties and said the decision was complicated by the departure in November of Chief Management Officer John "Jay" Gibson, who held the No. 3 position in the Pentagon. The duties of the chief management officer have been carried out since by Deputy Chief Management Officer Lisa Hershman, who has not gone through a Senate confirmation process.
Carter Ham, a retired Army general, described Shanahan as very capable but said he believes Trump should select a permanent defense secretary soon for the sake of continuity.
"The question I have is: How long does this persist?" said Ham, who is now the president and chief executive of the Association of the United States Army. "For lack of a better term, will the people who were on the Mattis team stay? If they don't stay, I think it would be a little bit unusual for an acting secretary to build a team because the presumption is that the acting person is usually not the person who stays."

Texto completo: The liberal media are up to their usual dirty immigration tricks.
This time, they're exploiting the death of a second Guatemalan child who died while in the custody of the Border Patrol at the southwestern border.
As usual, the liberal media didn't blame the parents for irresponsibly dragging their eight-year-old son across Mexico with the hope of illegally sneaking into America.
As usual, they didn't blame Democrats in Congress for refusing to help President Trump secure the border properly in order to dissuade illegal immigrants from Central America from trekking to our border in the first place.
As usual, the liberal media and their Democrat friends blamed the Border Patrol for the tragic death of a sick child.
It doesn't fit into the liberal media's false narrative that the men and women of the Border Patrol have been overwhelmed by an unprecedented invasion of illegal immigrants from Central America.
It doesn't matter that the Border Patrol and other federal agencies are trying to process, house and care for the 14,000 unaccompanied children that are among the 140,000 illegal Central American immigrants seeking asylum who've been detained in the last two months.
Of course, the ultimate bad guy in this tragedy — as the liberal media never tire of telling us — is President Trump.
According to the liberal media, the boy and the seven-year-old Guatemalan girl who also died in Border Patrol custody in early December perished because Donald Trump's cruel and heartless administration insists on enforcing our immigration laws.
As USA Today's lopsided "news" article spun it, the back-to-back deaths of the children "prompted an outcry from immigration activists, politicians and human rights groups and raised questions about the Trump administration policies that have separated children and parents and filled detention centers."
Others in the liberal media shamelessly pushed the same theme, turning the two children into martyrs and innocent patron saints for the open borders movement.
Of course you'll never see the New York Times devote so much tearful front-page attention or significance to the deaths of Americans murdered or harmed by illegal immigrants.
Those innocent victims, and their grieving families, don't count as martyrs to the Times or CNN because they don't fit the liberal media's two major agendas — opening up our borders and destroying Donald Trump.
And unless you watch Fox or listen to conservative talk radio, you're not likely to hear those five-year-old soundbites from hypocritical Democrats like Barrack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, who were advocates for strong border-fences and tougher laws against illegals until President Trump promised to actually implement them.
According to Democrats and the liberal media, enforcing immigration laws as they were written by previous administrations is now un-American and immoral — mainly because it's being done by President Trump.
In the end it's up to Congress to fix immigration.
If the Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate really want to stop more kids from dying in the arms of Border Patrol agents, they have to secure the border, pass comprehensive immigration re-form — and do it now.
If they won't do it, then it's time for us to begin working to send every one of them home in the next election. I can't think of a better New Year's resolution for the whole country.
Happy New Year.

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren, who announced on Monday that she was forming a committee to explore the possibility of running for president in 2020, said Tuesday she plans campaign stops this weekend in Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses in 13 months.
The senator, who has not traveled to Iowa recently, is slated to visit several of the state's major cities: Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Storm Lake, and Sioux City, according to The New York Times.
In announcing the formation of the committee, Warren, 69, released a video that cast her as an agent of transformation for Americans who have felt left behind. The former Harvard law professor contends a small class of billionaires and corporate interests have hijacked the gears of government in Washington.
“Our government's supposed to work for all of us, but instead it has become a tool for the wealthy and well-connected," said Warren, who later pronounced from a news conference at her Cambridge home: “I'm in this fight all the way."

Top Defense spokeswoman resigns abruptly after MattisThe Defense Department's top spokeswoman, who had been under investigation since May over whether she mistreated employees, abruptly resigned Monday night within hours of the departure of Jim Mattis, the defense secretary.
Dana W. White said on Twitter: "I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by this administration to serve alongside Secretary Mattis, our service members, and all the civilians who support them. It has been my honor and privilege. Stay safe and God bless."
A Defense Department spokesperson on Tuesday confirmed White had resigned. Charles E. Summers Jr. replaced White, becoming "acting" assistant to the defense secretary, according to the Pentagon. Summers had served as secretary of state in Maine.
Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and the No. 2 man at the Pentagon, became acting secretary Monday night, replacing Mattis.

NASA spacecraft opens new year at tiny, icy world past Pluto

Texto completo: LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- The NASA spacecraft that yielded the first close-up views of Pluto opened the new year at an even more distant world, a billion miles beyond.

Flight controllers said everything looked good for New Horizons' flyby of the tiny, icy object at 12:33 a.m. Tuesday. Confirmation was not expected for hours, though, given the vast distance.

The mysterious, ancient target nicknamed Ultima Thule is 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) from Earth.

Scientists wanted New Horizons observing Ultima Thule during the encounter, not phoning home. So they had to wait until late morning before learning whether the spacecraft survived.

With New Horizons on autopilot, Mission Control was empty at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Instead, hundreds of team members and their guests gathered nearby on campus for back-to-back countdowns.

The crowd ushered in 2019 at midnight, then cheered, blew party horns and jubilantly waved small U.S. flags again 33 minutes later, the appointed time for New Horizons' closest approach to Ultima Thule.

A few black-and-white pictures of Ultima Thule might be available following Tuesday's official confirmation, but the highly anticipated close-ups won't be ready until Wednesday or Thursday, in color, it is hoped.

"We set a record. Never before has a spacecraft explored anything so far away," said the project's lead scientist who led the countdown to the close encounter, Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute. "Think of it. We're a billion miles farther than Pluto."

Stern called it an auspicious beginning to 2019, which will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's footsteps on the moon in July 1969.

"Ultima Thule is 17,000 times as far away as the 'giant leap' of Apollo's lunar missions," Stern noted in an opinion piece in The New York Times.

New Horizons, which is the size of a baby grand piano and part of an $800 million mission, was expected to hurtle to within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Ultima Thule, considerably closer than the Pluto encounter of 2015.

Its seven science instruments were to continue collecting data for four hours after the flyby. Then the spacecraft was to turn briefly toward Earth to transmit word of its success. It takes over six hours for radio signals to reach Earth from that far away.

Scientists believe there should be no rings or moons around Ultima Thule that might endanger New Horizons. Traveling at 31,500 mph (50,700 kph), the spacecraft could easily be knocked out by a rice-size particle. It's a tougher encounter than at Pluto because of the distance and the considerable unknowns, and because the spacecraft is older now.

"I can't promise you success. We are straining the capabilities of this spacecraft," Stern said at a news conference Monday. "By tomorrow, we'll know how we did. So stay tuned. There are no second chances for New Horizons."

The risk added to the excitement.

Queen guitarist Brian May, who also happens to be an astrophysicist, joined the team at Johns Hopkins for a midnight premiere of the rock 'n' roll song he wrote for the big event.

"We will never forget this moment," said May who led the New Year's countdown. "This is completely unknown territory."

Despite the government shutdown, several NASA scientists and other employees showed up at Johns Hopkins as private citizens, unwilling to miss history in the making.

Ultima Thule was unknown until 2014, eight years after New Horizons departed Earth. It was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope and added to New Horizons' itinerary.

Deep inside the so-called Kuiper Belt, a frigid expanse beyond Neptune that is also known as the Twilight Zone, Ultima Thule is believed to date back 4.5 billion years to the formation of our solar system. As such, it is "probably the best time capsule we've ever had for understanding the birth of our solar system and the planets in it," Stern said.

In classic and medieval literature, Thule was the most distant, northernmost place beyond the known world.

Scientists suspect Ultima Thule is a single object no more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) long, though there's a chance it could prove to be two smaller bodies orbiting each other or connected by a slender neck. It is thought to be potato-shaped and dark-colored with a touch of red, possibly from being zapped by cosmic rays for eons.

The exact shape and composition won't be known until Ultima Thule starts sending back data in a process expected to last almost two years.

"Who knows what we might find? ... Anything's possible out there in this very unknown region," said John Spencer, a deputy project scientist from Southwest Research Institute. "We'll find out soon enough."
